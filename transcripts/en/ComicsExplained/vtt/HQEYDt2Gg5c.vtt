4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.360
What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.800
<v 1>Rob and we are picking up with a vendor's volume seven, uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.120
the age of conscience.

7
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.360
And this is the return of moon night and what's probably one of the most Epic

8
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:23.570
returns ever for a particular character. Here's the thing about moon night,

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.420
moon night is one of these characters where mama hasn't really been using him

10
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:27.470
very often. And in fact,

11
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:30.560
we really haven't seen a lot from him since the end of Jeff Ramirez run. Now,

12
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.120
the, the importance of linear is run,

13
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.250
which I don't think we ever really finished. I thought we did.

14
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.800
And then people had asked me on Twitter if I was ever going to finish it.

15
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.520
And I was actually streaming on Twitch one day, uh, twist.tv/comments explained,

16
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.820
and people were like, no, man, you never finished it. And I was like, huh, well,

17
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.370
that's kind of wild, but, uh, but nonetheless, uh,

18
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.630
it's we need to finish that at some point,

19
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.110
but the importance of Jeff Ramirez run is a kind of consolidated all the

20
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:55.220
different personalities of Mark Spector down into a, into a,

21
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.070
him basically kind of coming to an understanding and basically recognizing his

22
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:00.830
different personalities and not really curing his mental health,

23
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.350
but improving it in a lot of different ways. The,

24
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:06.320
the important thing about this is not going to do this first part in the way it

25
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.930
was actually written, because I think it was a little confusing here. Instead,

26
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.510
what we're going to do is kind of skip forward a bit and sort of pick up with

27
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:13.280
the second part of the story to a degree,

28
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.290
but essentially Mark Spector had been experiencing these kind of dark, you know,

29
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:21.290
dark visions, basically where these kind of nightmarish visions of like,

30
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.270
you know, devils, conquering the world and,

31
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.490
and wiping out humanity and all that kind of stuff.

32
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.670
And his initial thought was that [inaudible] was the one who was causing it.

33
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.080
And so he essentially the moon,

34
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.320
I ended up traveling to the temple of conscience. And then when he got in there,

35
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.800
ended up finding out Kanchi was experiencing these same visions as well of like

36
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.500
devil's conquering and attacking and so on and so forth.

37
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.870
And so seemingly the two guys started working together.

38
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.560
Now what it does is it picks up in loon, right in the temple,

39
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.240
or I guess the location where, uh,

40
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.960
where iron fist Danny ran spends his time when he's not out doing superhero

41
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:51.794
antics. And,

42
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.440
and one thing to keep in mind is that when it comes to to moon night,

43
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.080
while he does have three different personalities, right, you got Mark Spector,

44
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.900
you got Steve grant and you got Jake Lockley and they all play different roles,

45
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.800
right? Steve branch, the super, super rich one, Mark Spector is the mercenary.

46
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.370
And then Jake Lockley is kind of like his cab driver ear to the ground to find

47
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:08.570
out what's going on in the street level,

48
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.950
sort of persona his powers or his abilities kind of expand or get stronger when

49
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:15.230
he's in the presence of a full moon. Now, for the most part,

50
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:18.080
his powers are not all that grandiose, right? It's not like, you know, when,

51
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:18.471
when, you know,

52
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.500
kind of bestowed with the abilities of the conscious you gave him that when he's

53
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.190
in the presence of a full moon, he has like telepathy, telekinesis,

54
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.320
stuff like that. It's really more just like improvements to strength, right?

55
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.060
He can just become increasingly stronger.

56
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.470
The difference here is that at the moment,

57
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:34.070
right now you have what's called a supermoon and this basically amplifies his

58
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.380
powers even further. Right? So it was almost kind of like,

59
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.530
like Moonlight hoking out to an extension. If you want to try to find some,

60
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.020
you know, in Marvel comics, uh, you know, a metaphor kind of example for,

61
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:44.420
for what's happening here. But the,

62
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:46.760
the funny thing about this is that he's able to initially,

63
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.490
and eventually overcome the iron fist Danny rant.

64
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.240
And he basically beats this guy into the ground and then essentially steals his

65
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:54.760
power, right? He uses a what's,

66
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.950
what's essentially an anchor around his neck and steals his power of the iron

67
00:02:57.951 --> 00:02:58.340
fist,

68
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.230
following that he travels to Greenwich village and the sanctum sanctorum of Dr.

69
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:04.360
Strange, this is a little murkier here, right?

70
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.110
It's not nearly as easy to steal this power as it is with, with a iron fist,

71
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.360
because all you have to do is overpower iron fist. Instead,

72
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.700
what you ended up getting were effectively the priests of,

73
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.570
of Concho who were sent there beforehand to kind of distract Stephen strange,

74
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.160
which allowed moon Knight to sneak in.

75
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.160
And then of course hidden with one of the banks and then steal his power as

76
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:24.460
well, right. To steal the power of, of Stephen strange. And so in turn,

77
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:28.570
he V travels to, uh, he'll walk Heights and East LA, and then he encounters, uh,

78
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.810
it doesn't really even have a direct encounter with Robbie Rayez and so much as

79
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.260
he basically uses one of the angst to siphon off and steal the power of Robbie

80
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.650
Reyes, right? So basically he has the power of the ghost rider drives a car,

81
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.390
and then I've kind of, you know, of course takes off with it.

82
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.224
And so following that,

83
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.590
he ends up traveling to Wakanda with the intention of stealing the power of

84
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.770
black Panther. The difference here is that with, with black Panther,

85
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.800
it's not as simple as stealing the power of other individuals, right?

86
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.950
Because those powers are external. You know, essentially with iron fist,

87
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.510
he has the power of the iron fist,

88
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:58.870
but that is a power source that can be taken away when it comes to, uh,

89
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.380
Steven strange, he basically has the ability to manipulate the powers of others.

90
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.200
So with him, you're basically kind of stealing knowledge for, you know,

91
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.270
you know, in effect, uh, with somebody like Robbie Reyes,

92
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.340
you're taking the spirit of engines away from him,

93
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.430
but it's like taking somebody's clothes or somebody's keys or somebody's car

94
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.830
when it comes to black Panther, his powers in his blood.

95
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.410
And this comes by way of Moonlight presenting a kind of ink,

96
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.180
the same one that he used, or at least, uh, you know,

97
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:22.390
the same kind that he used on the other characters that we've seen so far.

98
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.660
And it doesn't work because with black Panther the powers in his blood, right,

99
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.040
he consumes the heart shaped earth,

100
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.350
those powers merge with his body's physical form.

101
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.550
And so the only way to steal the power of black Panther it's to literally take

102
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.340
all of his blood, right. It's to kill him and take every ounce of his blood.

103
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.070
And so that's when you kind of have this bit of a stare down here and he says,

104
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.600
you're going to have to take all of me, let's go like,

105
00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:44.800
like take me to Concho and then we'll, we'll figure it out from there. Right.

106
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:46.480
And so, you know, at this point it's not,

107
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.480
it's really more black Panther trying to understand the bigger picture, right.

108
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.130
Kind of,

109
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.550
and himself to be captured in order to find out what it is that Mark doctor is

110
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:56.880
doing. Because by this point word of what moon night's done, Reese's ears,

111
00:04:56.881 --> 00:05:00.060
right? Stealing powers of Dr. Strange of, of the rest of the Avengers,

112
00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:03.720
or at least of, uh, Robbie Reyes. And, uh, he's like, okay, something like,

113
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:04.890
there's some kind of treachery afoot,

114
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.840
there's obviously a bigger game going on here.

115
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.170
We've got to find out what's happening. Now. The next thing is interesting,

116
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.070
but also kind of cooking the books in the sense that with mule near,

117
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.010
because of the fact that millionaire is forged out of Uhuru, uh,

118
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.980
it is essentially that what's moonwalk for lack of a better word.

119
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.910
And moon night being bestowed with the powers of Concho is able to manipulate

120
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.150
moon rock. I E he can control Munir. Now this is kind of Jason,

121
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.890
Aaron making up something on the spot,

122
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.170
because the big question to ask here is that if this was the case,

123
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.630
why have we never seen it before? And if I'm being honest,

124
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:35.490
I'm not familiar with any instance,

125
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:38.640
whereby moon Knight has been able to overpower Thor's hammer and in fact,

126
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.820
stop it in mid air to control the material itself. Now,

127
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.830
this is kind of an indirect explanation,

128
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:47.430
can Magneto control Thor's hammer and using this, it seems that you can,

129
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.740
if you can control the properties that make up the hammer,

130
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.350
you can control the hammer itself. Uh,

131
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.450
and of course the hammer is made of metal, meaning, uh, Magneto controls, metal,

132
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.680
not veto can control the hammer.

133
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.390
This really kind of offers an into how that can be done. Uh, it's not direct,

134
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.940
right? So you can really use it as a credible source. You couldn't say like,

135
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.530
well, I'm, you know, have you got to look at this?

136
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.840
And you look at that and using the transitive property, it kind of works.

137
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.160
It doesn't really work that way. Right? I mean,

138
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:09.080
when it comes to knowing what a character can do,

139
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.480
you really kind of have to go with like a one-to-one ratio.

140
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.210
But in this particular instance, the fact that it's made a move rock,

141
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.020
and because there's a supermoon and let an enhances the powers of Moonlight,

142
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.740
he in turn is able to control Thor's hammer. He uses it to overpower Thor,

143
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.790
and then he takes it. Of course,

144
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.670
he ends up submitting a whole bunch of different moons from across the cosmos,

145
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.280
you know, from, from various systems out there brings them to earth.

146
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.590
And the just kind of pummels Thor, you know, using these moons.

147
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.483
And that's basically it.

148
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.010
I kind of pulling them together and then basically crushing for,

149
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:35.870
to a degree Thor, of course isn't dead,

150
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.770
but this is essentially what conscious sense of scent moon Knight on a mission

151
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.050
for what's the overpower, the various Avengers.

152
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.840
The last thing is that black Panther can not be broken.

153
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.060
He can't be broken in the traditional sense, which is to say,

154
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.690
to have him willingly, give his blood over to Concho. And so, because of that,

155
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.030
we don't use it more or less just kind of being held captive.

156
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.700
The Phoenix force is still like, it still exists out there,

157
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:57.560
but it's currently untethered. And then of course,

158
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.870
there's the star brand entity. Now the star brand,

159
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:03.350
as we've seen in previous Avengers videos had bonded itself to a little kid,

160
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.350
right. To a little girl. And the Avengers are just basically monitoring this,

161
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:07.970
this star brand, just to make sure that, you know,

162
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.490
this little girl doesn't go nuts and wipe out, you know, every law,

163
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.050
all living things on the face of the earth,

164
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.200
but they kind of question to be asked here is what's the whole motivation behind

165
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.570
this in the first place, right? As it really just devils. Well,

166
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.630
if it's devils that are supposedly supposed to be taking over everything,

167
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.580
then there's only one person to go to.

168
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.310
If you're concerned about devil's doing bad things.

169
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.900
And that of course is manifesto.

170
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.090
So they end up traveling to the hotel in front of now,

171
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:31.850
this is where my [inaudible] been since the events of Marvel comics,

172
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:35.240
damnation storyline, where he was basically locked here by Stephen strange,

173
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.530
this was really just Marvel,

174
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:39.770
kind of sweeping the Festo under the rug and putting on the back burner.

175
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.590
And it was really mobile kind of saying, he's there, he's in this location,

176
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.060
we'll bring it back at some point in time,

177
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.530
use them for some kind of particular ends.

178
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.980
I wouldn't be surprised if we saw them a Festo in the Marvel cinematic universe.

179
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.660
Uh, it kind of makes sense. Otherwise,

180
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.640
none of this damnation never would have happened.

181
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.490
He would just be in the hellscape somewhere and just kind of locked away.

182
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.300
It was also partially done in order to tell a story whereby Johnny blaze could

183
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.790
take control of how instead of a Festo, right, to kind of, you know,

184
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:05.180
you serve Muffet those control over this realm, but basically they end up,

185
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.760
you know, we're kind of entering into this place, right? That, uh,

186
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.540
that using the power of Stephen, strange to the ink around moon nights, neck,

187
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.970
that he basically releases the bars. And then in turn,

188
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:17.630
he uses the power of the worst hammer to punch a hole through my Festo and

189
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:20.510
effectively kill him right now. The funny thing about this is keep in mind,

190
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.180
my Festo is the representation of pure evil,

191
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.670
but he's a representation of evil in its most pure sense.

192
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.410
Manifesto can never truly die,

193
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.200
but this isn't one of these things where we're talking about like dark side and

194
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:32.150
DC comics, right? Like true form dark side,

195
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.890
if there really even is such a thing. Uh, the,

196
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:37.670
the idea of that is it really is just kind of evil incarnate with Mephisto.

197
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:41.030
He represents how Lords, but he's not a definitive hell Lord,

198
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.270
meaning he's not necessarily Satan from Judeo Christianity.

199
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.910
And he's certainly not the one. All right.

200
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:48.670
We know that the one below all is what is in essence,

201
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.020
absolute evil in Marvel comics, if, and what we've seen in,

202
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:55.150
in Al Ewing's incredible whole core, immortal hope run is to be believed.

203
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.210
So my was just kind of a hell Lord, who's there.

204
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.750
But my fistulas and mortality comes in the form of resurrection. Or just to say,

205
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.020
no matter how many times you kill him, he'll always come back, right?

206
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:06.750
So he's not necessarily by any means gone forever.

207
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.110
But what this does do is it really kind of picks up two weeks after that.

208
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.470
And it basically shows a conscientious use the power at his disposal that was

209
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.290
given to him by moon, right? So if the angst belonging or that,

210
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.230
that contained the power of Stephen strange and those different guys to

211
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:21.360
basically create what's called feed city, you know,

212
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.400
that was formerly on the Island of Manhattan.

213
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:27.600
Now here's the issue with something like this Marvel comics used to be, uh,

214
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:27.771
they,

215
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:31.440
they used to write their stories in such a way to where the only time you would

216
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.610
see something like this,

217
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:36.570
this significant on a huge scale is if there was a crossover now that was back

218
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:38.940
in the seventies and the eighties, a lot of things have changed, right?

219
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:41.400
Especially during the late nineties, going into the early two thousands,

220
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.790
this kind of act wouldn't normally be reserved for a crossover back in the day,

221
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.940
right? Marble used to be very similar to DC, DC. Wouldn't do this. For example,

222
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.860
while you wouldn't see something like this, you would see it,

223
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.690
but you would see it referenced in other comics.

224
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.820
You don't really see a reference to anybody else's comic, right?

225
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:56.190
It's not as though we've been reading sorts of acts and it's like,

226
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.810
meanwhile and Manhattan,

227
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.530
the entire Island's been turned into a giant shrine for Khan Shu, the adoption,

228
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:04.230
God of the moon. Like it's not really something that you saw, right?

229
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:06.780
So it's one of these things where you kind of have to play it fast and loose.

230
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.081
And I,

231
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:09.810
and I simply say that because a lot of the guys were probably going to ask why

232
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:11.790
haven't we seen this in anybody else's books,

233
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.100
because it's just kind of how things are being done, right? Like every,

234
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:18.270
you know, almost every single individual comic has its own major event going on,

235
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.940
which really is one of the things that people kind of get burned out on. Right.

236
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.320
When everything seems like a big deal.

237
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.730
The reality is that when you write what are effectively villain of the villain

238
00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:27.590
of the week, stories, people get bored, right?

239
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:29.960
So mobile's really just kind of throwing things at the wall and seeing what

240
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.960
sticks and so far, this is kind of what sticks. And so from there,

241
00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:36.290
you basically switch over to black Panther and the belief of,

242
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.190
to Cholla is that moon Knight is not operating of his own accord, right?

243
00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:41.540
He's not operating of his own mind.

244
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.480
The other part of this is that the servants of,

245
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.230
of a conscience or trying to get black Panther to basically acquiesce, right.

246
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.420
They're trying to break him, they got him chained up. They're basically,

247
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:52.880
you know, whipping him with, uh, with, uh, with basically, you know,

248
00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:55.700
or at least flogging him, right. With these, you know, these whips that contain,

249
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.331
uh, Jagen,

250
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:59.720
moonstones just literally trying to break this guy down on the most basic level.

251
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.360
But as we know what the challah, the guy never gives up, right?

252
00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.760
Like the guy never, ever backs down the willpower of,

253
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.650
to challah is absolutely insane.

254
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.950
And so when moon night shows up here and it's just, you know, when to Charles,

255
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:12.770
like, you know, why are you doing this? Like, you know, Concho, like, you know,

256
00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:14.990
we have to find a way to get Concho out of your head.

257
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.400
The response of moon Knight is no.

258
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:19.610
I've had these visions of devils conquering the world up Mo you know,

259
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.850
conscious had the exact same villains we're working together to save you guys.

260
00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:25.130
And we're going to, we need to take your power in order to do it right.

261
00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:27.710
So it's not really, as though this is kind of an evil thing.

262
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.690
And that's one of the things to understand about this, right?

263
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.990
That con shoe has historically manipulated. Moonlight, tripped him,

264
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:36.740
used him for his own ends, but this instance, it really is different here,

265
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.180
but it really is different in some way,

266
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.430
they're going about it in all the worst possible ways,

267
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.500
but it really is different in these particular ways,

268
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.600
but it's really more or less Mark Spector saying, look,

269
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.470
I'm not being mind controlled, right? Like I'm doing this of my own accord.

270
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.390
Like I'm doing this because I choose to,

271
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.230
because it's what we need to do in order to save everyone.

272
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.010
The other part of this is that moon Knight, uh, doesn't fully trust Concho.

273
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.430
And it kind of makes sense just because of the,

274
00:11:58.431 --> 00:11:59.950
the shady history they have together.

275
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.130
And this comes in the form of black Panther, kind of, can you really trying to,

276
00:12:04.131 --> 00:12:07.260
to, you know, trying to get them understand none of this is a good idea, right?

277
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.170
None of nothing that you're doing here has beneficial and so on and so forth.

278
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.900
And that's what Mark spectra says, like I'm not blind to what I've done. Right.

279
00:12:12.901 --> 00:12:16.680
I understand the significance of turning on people who have historically been my

280
00:12:16.681 --> 00:12:19.170
teammates, even if we haven't necessarily teamed up all the time.

281
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.790
And even if we fought before, right?

282
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:22.830
Like I understand the significance of what I'm doing.

283
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.340
And I haven't given Concho all the powers in my possession.

284
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.320
I'm not blindly following this guy.

285
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.710
And he basically reveals that he's in possession of the Phoenix force, right?

286
00:12:31.711 --> 00:12:34.740
Like he's got the Phoenix force at his disposal and he ends up revealing here.

287
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:34.891
That,

288
00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:38.460
of course he is in possession of still possession of the ghost riders powers.

289
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.720
Right. What's, you're not small.

290
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.250
And that's one of the things to kind of keep in mind.

291
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.850
The ghost writer is one of these guys where it's so easy to throw them under the

292
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.320
kind of Superman under the rock. Right.

293
00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:50.040
And to assume that there's not much that ghost rider has to offer in terms of

294
00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:52.500
abilities, right. Then you just kind of a guy who's there. Uh,

295
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.830
the cool thing about ghost rider is he's exceedingly powerful, right?

296
00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:58.800
Like he's powerful enough to take on all kinds of different guys. And in fact,

297
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.870
ghost face off against Galactus before.

298
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.360
So it's not like it's a really small amount of power, right?

299
00:13:03.361 --> 00:13:06.180
It's only you become a ghost rider and you can lift like three tons.

300
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.060
It's not like that. Right. It's, it's a, it's basically the power of,

301
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.960
of a God is the power of the devil being used, you know, for,

302
00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:14.970
for any number of goals and achievements or whatever it is that you want to do.

303
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.000
You're the part of this is that with the, the binds around black Panther,

304
00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:18.600
kind of been, uh,

305
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.570
kind of being weakened when the various servants come back and come back in with

306
00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:24.810
the intention of, of literally trying to break him down again, by whipping him,

307
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:24.990
uh,

308
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.960
he literally breaks out of his chains and then starts beating the crap out of

309
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.300
them. Right? So like at that point, they,

310
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.350
they kind of flea and ask Kanchi to save them. Now,

311
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.020
pick up with iron man and pick up with Carol Danvers, right?

312
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:35.790
They've got the little kid star brand with them.

313
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.610
They're trying to keep this little kid away from Kanchi as best they can.

314
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.660
But for iron man,

315
00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:43.320
he sees this as like a very personal mission that he has to go on. Right.

316
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:45.540
Because remember when we talked about the, the previous,

317
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.110
sorry that we had of Ironman being stuck in the past with the Avengers 1

318
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.140
million,

319
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.040
when he was eventually presented with a time stone by [inaudible] brought him

320
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.130
back to the modern day that he kind of saw a little bit of these visions.

321
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.000
And so it's,

322
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.340
this is going to be kind of an important thing because that's the role he's

323
00:13:59.341 --> 00:13:59.760
playing.

324
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.130
We'll find out a little bit more about why that matters here in a minute,

325
00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:04.440
but the, the, the, the big thing about this is that again,

326
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:07.410
with Mephisto because of the fact that he always comes back, ah,

327
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.130
you end up having like these and iterations on the Festo manifesting, right?

328
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.260
One who's like, uh, one was like a pirate, right?

329
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.560
News revolvers with hellfire bullets, that computer souls,

330
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.290
different things like that. Just kind of popping back up here and there.

331
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.620
And it's basically Concho just constantly killing Sophisto. Now,

332
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.580
to be honest with you guys,

333
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.310
I don't really believe conscious powerful enough to kill the Festo.

334
00:14:26.311 --> 00:14:30.740
And the Festo is a universal entity. He's wildly powerful, you know, in,

335
00:14:30.741 --> 00:14:31.620
in his own way,

336
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.740
the way in which they were able to kill him before the longer Mephisto stays

337
00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:37.470
away from his realm among the hell Lords, the weaker he gets.

338
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.870
So it wouldn't make sense like when they visited him in that cell,

339
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.670
they could actually kill him. But when he manifests,

340
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.000
he should be as powerful as he could possibly be. And that's no small thing,

341
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.890
right? This guy's nuts in terms of its power.

342
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.950
Concho was never really being shown to be that powerful before,

343
00:14:49.951 --> 00:14:53.060
but he's also a character that we haven't really seen that much before.

344
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.650
And so in a lot of ways, uh, Jason,

345
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:56.780
Aaron is kind of flying by the seat of his pants,

346
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:59.510
with the power of the country possesses and what it is that he can do. Right.

347
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.310
So I guess it's kind of believable in that way,

348
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:04.100
because we don't really have much to tell us that it shouldn't be done,

349
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:04.880
but regardless,

350
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.660
what country's been doing is basically killing all these versions of manifesto.

351
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.750
They keep manifesting, but every time one comes back in this band, you know,

352
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:15.020
a little over a hundred so far every time, you know, Memphis STO comes back,

353
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.850
country fights him and then kills him, right.

354
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:19.370
It's just kind of been going on consistently at the same time,

355
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.480
you've got captain America,

356
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.350
you've got blade and you've got Shiho who were launching an effort to find like

357
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:27.230
Danny Rand, uh, you know, the iron fist, trying to find Stephen strange,

358
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.740
those individuals whose powers were taken by Concho and whose conscious forces

359
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.580
had kind of, you know, basically taken into hiding or, or, you know,

360
00:15:33.581 --> 00:15:35.770
kind of you remove them from the landscape. Now,

361
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.730
this matters is because in an effort to entrap the rest of the Avengers,

362
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.180
the forces of conscience kind of let it slip that like these guys were going to

363
00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:46.300
be on this train, right? Steven strain, Danny ran the iron fist, uh,

364
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.970
Robbie Reyes, and they were going to be on this train, captain America,

365
00:15:48.971 --> 00:15:51.700
and his team took debate and then basically rescued these guys, right.

366
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.740
That leads to the forces of conscious showing up.

367
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.720
And then all hell kind of breaking loose among these,

368
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.360
these various forces here at the same time that happens, uh,

369
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.050
mood night actually ends up going directly after Ironman and Carol Danvers.

370
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.390
Right. And it's a little bit of bickering here. It's kind of funny, you know,

371
00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:07.330
watching like 20, soccer's kind of an idiot trying to take care of a kid,

372
00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:09.100
which is he's completely ill-equipped to do,

373
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.510
but he recognizes the significance of this kid and recognizes the significance

374
00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:17.890
of what could happen if the visions of Concho and moon knife or actually

375
00:16:17.891 --> 00:16:20.740
correct. And so there's a point whereby moon night shows up here,

376
00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:23.560
he captures Carol Danvers and then goes to attack,

377
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.320
or at least goes to try to take the baby away from, uh, from,

378
00:16:26.321 --> 00:16:28.420
from Tony stark using the power of the ghost writer.

379
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.720
And then basically says like, like basically makes mention and saying that like,

380
00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:34.390
you know, everything that we fought for is going to die, right?

381
00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:37.630
You have to let me finish what I started or everything's going to die if we let

382
00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:41.380
manifesto win. And the fact that he references Mephisto tells Tony stark,

383
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.390
this ties into his whole experience. Right.

384
00:16:43.391 --> 00:16:45.940
And we'll have that video down in the description in case you guys want to get

385
00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:48.790
caught up. I don't want you guys to feel left out or anything, but, uh, but,

386
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.870
but in that moment,

387
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.630
because of the fact that this kind of goes towards quite literally stopping

388
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.790
Festo, when these kinds of devils more or less,

389
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.820
they seem to be popping up again, we don't really know that's actually the case.

390
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.940
We're largely just kind of assuming alongside moon Knight and Concho that he

391
00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:04.750
initially was going to give the kid over to Moonlight that in turn basically

392
00:17:04.751 --> 00:17:07.150
leads to Carol Danvers, kind of freeing herself, jumping in,

393
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.240
grabbing Tony stark in the baby and flying away. Right. And Tony Stark's like,

394
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.570
do not let me near him again. And like, do not let me near this baby again,

395
00:17:13.571 --> 00:17:17.110
like take this baby and fly away as far as you can. Right.

396
00:17:17.111 --> 00:17:18.970
Because if something like, like, if this happens again,

397
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.120
I will end up giving this kid to, to Moonlight. Right. I don't want to,

398
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.210
but I'm driven to, okay. Like I kind of have this, this drive to,

399
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:26.950
and so of course, with black Panther,

400
00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:29.560
freeing himself from the various guys who are out there, you know,

401
00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:31.600
freeing himself from the priests of conscience,

402
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.910
he goes to basically confront Concho himself, right.

403
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.380
To confront this guy himself. Now,

404
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.710
the reason why this is kind of important here is because in this moment,

405
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.070
when moon nights had, had basically kind of been left, right. With,

406
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:44.170
with Carol Danvers, grabbing Ironman and the baby,

407
00:17:44.171 --> 00:17:47.860
and then flying away that in an effort to kind of understand whether or not

408
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.580
Kanchi was telling him the, he ended up going to the moon, right.

409
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:51.660
For a moment of solitude,

410
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.030
just kind of staying there and just kind of thinking for a minute or two.

411
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.560
And he's met by the unseen now,

412
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:57.570
for those of you guys who aren't really familiar with the sky,

413
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:00.570
because it's been a long time since we really covered him, uh,

414
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.650
the unseen is classic Nick fury from back in the day, right? Like old school,

415
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:08.070
white guy, Nick fury, for that, you guys know who he is, right. It's like,

416
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.290
here's a picture of what he looks like of old school. Nick fury,

417
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.330
this is a picture of what he looks like, you know him when you see him.

418
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.490
But the idea was that during the original sin story,

419
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.150
back in 2014 or whenever it was,

420
00:18:17.151 --> 00:18:19.970
it was written as part of the lead up to Hickman's Avengers, new Avengers,

421
00:18:19.971 --> 00:18:23.060
and eventually secret Wars on then of course we'll have that description as

422
00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.790
well. That, that whole playlist, my editors, whoever this is,

423
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.580
we'll post this under the description, the idea behind that was it,

424
00:18:28.581 --> 00:18:31.940
Nick fury had basically killed the watcher in order to cover his own tracks for

425
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.810
something that he had done.

426
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.330
The results of this is that when it came out that Nick furry was the one who had

427
00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:38.840
done it, the other Watchers banded together and then confined him to the moon.

428
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.960
Right. So no one really knows he's there. I mean, some do here and there,

429
00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:44.600
like people who kind of go by there happened to see him, something like that.

430
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:48.740
But he's basically confined for essentially all existence to stay locked and

431
00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:52.100
chained to the moon and, and able to witness everything that happens on earth,

432
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.440
but being unable to do anything about it right now, even then,

433
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.440
he's still pretty ambiguous. I mean, it makes it clear. Jason air makes it very,

434
00:18:57.441 --> 00:19:00.320
very clear Nick fury, as we knew him as long since dead.

435
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.230
And it's basically just the unseen as he calls himself.

436
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.410
But what he basically tells new night here is you've been praying to Concho all

437
00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:09.140
this time. But if you're going to win this, you can't pray to him.

438
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.460
You're the only one who can really end this.

439
00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:12.740
You cannot pray to Taconcha anymore.

440
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.440
You have to learn to pray with different God. And when you do that,

441
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:18.590
when you give yourself over fully to that, God, then in turn,

442
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.680
you'll possess the kind of power that you need in order to essentially save the

443
00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:23.750
day. And so what you end up getting here is,

444
00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:27.320
is you kind of jumped back to black Panther, confronting Honshu,

445
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.690
and ultimately being met by, by moon night.

446
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.900
Now moon Knight had come back here with the intention of confronting Concho

447
00:19:32.901 --> 00:19:33.380
himself,

448
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.860
but in the recognition that black Panther was here and realizing that with these

449
00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:40.760
two teaming up that most likely you would have to be forced to flee that this

450
00:19:40.761 --> 00:19:44.240
led to constitute using the power of Dr. Strange to trick the mind of moon

451
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.610
Knight into believing that black Panther was manifesto.

452
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.200
And so literally it's an illusion.

453
00:19:48.201 --> 00:19:51.770
And so moon nights just fighting against the sky as best as he possibly can.

454
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.410
Now, ultimately does this fight drags on pretty far?

455
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.170
And it's kind of interesting to see this, to be honest with you guys. I mean,

456
00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.440
one of the funny things that happens is that honcho throws his hammer throws a

457
00:20:00.441 --> 00:20:03.320
hammer of mule near, uh, at, at black Panther and black Panther,

458
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:04.500
like catches it. And then,

459
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.850
and just like literally shows that like he's worthy of lifting it.

460
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.040
The funny thing is he doesn't use it and that's,

461
00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:12.680
that's kind of see that is how it needs to be needed to be done. Like,

462
00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:16.310
in my mind, showing a person's worthy of really Mueller is one thing.

463
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.710
But like when you show they're worthy and then you in turn,

464
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.800
use that worthy yeah. That person picks up the hammer and then starts fighting.

465
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.140
It kind of cheapens. It. They're like, yeah, I'm worthy of using it,

466
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.170
but I don't need it. Right. Like I can, I can do this on my own.

467
00:20:27.171 --> 00:20:28.520
We're just kind of an important thing, right?

468
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:31.550
It's a cool little moment there because what you end up getting is that with

469
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:33.100
this illusion being cast and,

470
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:36.200
and Moonlight facing off against like Panther black Panther trusts are

471
00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:37.490
reasonably them as best he can.

472
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.970
But black Panther also ends up putting the full of it was martial arts,

473
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.380
literally on display here, right?

474
00:20:42.381 --> 00:20:45.950
The flying leopard clock hick the black mambas spine strike the hippo fists were

475
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:48.100
just kind of an interesting name for a martial arts move,

476
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.540
but like the fist of Kanchi,

477
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.510
which moon Knight tries to use on black Panther and it doesn't work. Right.

478
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:52.930
He just,

479
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.530
he just basically overcomes like one of the coolest names here is the rage of

480
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.580
many Willdabeast. That's an amazing name for like a, for, for like an assault.

481
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.540
I think it's cool.

482
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.320
But basically black Panther is able to get the upper hand on Moonlight and then

483
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:06.640
incapacitated. Now,

484
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.940
the reason why this matters is because moon Knight had long since feel a

485
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:12.340
realized he was under the spell of an illusion, right.

486
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:13.560
That he was under the spell of,

487
00:21:13.561 --> 00:21:17.200
of conscience using the power of Steven strange and basically says like, like,

488
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.531
you know,

489
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:20.410
you're going to have to make me believe you're gonna have to like pummel me.

490
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.580
You know, if, if, you know,

491
00:21:21.581 --> 00:21:24.130
if I'm going to succeed here is a little bit ambiguous,

492
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.650
but we basically ended up realizing that in doing this,

493
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:31.180
he's basically casting off the influence of Concho and casting off his faith and

494
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:32.380
belief and conscience.

495
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.160
The reason why this matters it because it in turn allows the Phoenix force to

496
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:39.130
bind itself, to, uh, to, to Moonlight. Now, again,

497
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.830
the Phoenix is part of the original Avengers, right?

498
00:21:41.831 --> 00:21:43.090
And that's really the power source.

499
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.680
The Kanchi was going after the power of all the original Avengers, right? The,

500
00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:50.620
the Avengers 1 million BC that you had a, you had a basically Mueller,

501
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:53.260
which was being used by, uh, by Odin that you had. Um,

502
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:57.220
you had the Phoenix force, you had the first black Panther. You had like the,

503
00:21:57.221 --> 00:22:00.130
the first star brand, or really the second star brand. The first one was, uh,

504
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.710
a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But like you had the second star brand.

505
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.980
That's what the power of the country was going after the power of the original

506
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:09.370
Avengers to destroy whatever threat this was, that was coming towards earth.

507
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.240
But Moonlight absorbing the totality of the Phoenix force unto himself,

508
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.630
and then taking off into space really kind of changes things because the truth

509
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:20.320
about this is this feels like it should be a major crossover event,

510
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.960
a lot more significant than what you would see in a story like this.

511
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:23.794
But at the same time,

512
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.680
it is also the Avengers comics and under normal circumstances,

513
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:29.500
if we were talking about the Avengers comics 15 years ago,

514
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.790
it wouldn't be this big, right.

515
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:34.900
It wouldn't be like a massive spacefaring event with like a person being imbued

516
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:38.560
with a full power of the Phoenix force. And then like going to town on like, uh,

517
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.880
an Egyptian God of the sun.

518
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.120
You wouldn't really see that ever since the Marvel cinematic universe.

519
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.830
And like the first Avengers movie,

520
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.790
there's always kind of been this demand in comics to, to amp things up, right.

521
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:52.420
To make like the Avengers as big and comics as they are in the movies,

522
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:55.330
kind of this expectation that coming from those movies and sitting down and

523
00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:58.840
reading an Avengers comic, you're going to see like these insane story arcs.

524
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.340
And that's really where we are now, right?

525
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:02.440
That's why the Avengers comics are being written this way,

526
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.650
because it's kind of what people expect after having gone and see the movies.

527
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.270
That's one of the drawbacks of the movies, right?

528
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:10.510
Because you end up seeing a removal of character-driven stories.

529
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.600
And instead it focuses on like big, high octane action events,

530
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:16.240
which there's not always room to do both. And this one there is,

531
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.180
but there's not always room to do both of that across the board.

532
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.640
And that's kind of the problem that you run into. If you have to choose one,

533
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.690
which one do you choose,

534
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.900
but mood nights showing up here and beating the crap out of Concho after

535
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:29.230
realizing that he's basically being manipulated, uh, it leads to, of course,

536
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:32.410
you know, the, the attempt of him to take the star band child away from,

537
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.980
from iron man and our Carol Danvers only to be declined. And then to say, okay,

538
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.870
fine. Then get the kid out of here. Right? Like,

539
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:41.080
I don't mean any harm to this kid. This kid wants to screw me up. And, uh, the,

540
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.590
the,

541
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.800
the whole point of the star brands power is to be powerful enough to overcome

542
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.380
any foe he faces off against him is the reason why in Hickman's of vendors and

543
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:49.190
new Avengers,

544
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.460
one star brand was able to destroy one beyond her because it was facing off

545
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:52.851
against one,

546
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:55.820
beyond her at the time ended up destroying the entirety of the star brand.

547
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.310
Why do you end up having to kill himself? Or at least he was already dying,

548
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.560
but he ended up destroying his physical body, you know,

549
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:02.960
in order to actually destroy that one beyond her. But like,

550
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.300
it would be enough power to take out Mark Spector. If that,

551
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:08.240
if that maybe had full, full control of the star brand's power,

552
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.150
but the fight between these two guys where you end up having, you know,

553
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.610
conscious, you basically knocked back down to the surface.

554
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.390
The responsive Concho is to tell us forces a massive many of yourselves as you

555
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:17.931
can, right?

556
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:21.110
Like the full totality of my forces face off against these guys here.

557
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.810
I will deal with Moonlight out in space as best I can.

558
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:27.410
The problem with that is that as soon as he starts to come to you end up having

559
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:31.100
the arrival of Robbie Rayez and Robbie Reyes and black Panther ended up stealing

560
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:34.700
or end up taking the adjuncts of a, of Concho and taking their power.

561
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.120
And you'll take into the power from Concho and then giving it basically two

562
00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:41.360
different Avengers, right? Siemens strange, still knocked out. Rodney Reyes has,

563
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.223
has come to.

564
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.350
And so you end up seeing this power being given to like she Hulk who ends up

565
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:48.440
becoming the new iron fist blade, who becomes a new source or a Supreme.

566
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.020
And then of course, Robbie Reyes ends up getting his own, uh,

567
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.990
getting his ghost writer hire back. Now it's not going to stay this way,

568
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.820
but it is kind of a cool little shift up, you know,

569
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.310
even if only in the moment to see this kind of thing, go down.

570
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.970
The problem with this is that while you have Mark specter out, out, you know,

571
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.730
kind of hovering above the earth with the power of the Phoenix force,

572
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.180
he starts to realize this power is too much for him to control.

573
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.750
And it's literally sitting as mental illness into disarray because remember the

574
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:15.650
Phoenix force really seems to kind of go nuts if it starts experiencing emotions

575
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:17.840
or concepts that it didn't experience before.

576
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.730
There was a whole idea behind the dark Phoenix saga,

577
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.580
the Phoenix force started experiencing jealousy, rage, you know,

578
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.770
different emotions of the Phoenix had never really been,

579
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.080
never really been privy to and experiencing those,

580
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.470
set it on this dark and twisted path where like it corrupted Jean Gray and just

581
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:32.240
kind of went nuts. And this instance,

582
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.600
the Phoenix force is experiencing multiple personality disorder.

583
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.030
If it stated the same bonded to Mark spectra enough,

584
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.910
it could actually drive the Phoenix force insane. But in this instance,

585
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.510
Mark begins to realize the Phoenix force is making his mental illness worse.

586
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.820
And so in order to, to essentially overcome it,

587
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.270
when Thor re-emerges from all these worlds that have kind of been crushed

588
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:52.940
together to keep them, keep them held apart, to keep them in stasis,

589
00:25:52.941 --> 00:25:56.270
he summons his hammer back to him realizing that his hammers close and then like

590
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.450
pummels moon night and sends them crashing back down to earth. You know,

591
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:00.560
he ends up pummeling moon night,

592
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.000
the Phoenix force leaves moon night kind of goes back out,

593
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.060
does whatever it is it is going to do. But in that moment,

594
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.970
he's more or less defeated following that you end up having, you know,

595
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:09.500
Moonlight kind of crash landing on earth.

596
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.280
Phoenix force takes off Kanchi wakes up and then conscious and turn apprehended

597
00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:14.090
by the Avengers.

598
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.020
But not before saying I did all of this in order to like protect the world from

599
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:20.300
that threat, right? From these devils that are going to invade.

600
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.040
You're not going to have the power for that.

601
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.310
But the response to the Avengers is done. We'll find that power ourselves,

602
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:28.460
right. But it's not the job of some moon. God, who's more or less, you know,

603
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:31.430
kind of gone nuts to take that role unto himself. Right? Like, you know,

604
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.030
even though he was coming from a place of, of altruism, it's not the best thing.

605
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.120
The other question that really comes out of this is what's going to happen with

606
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:41.900
the Phoenix force. If any of you guys had read Jason Aaron's, uh, the,

607
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:45.600
basically his, his Thor, you end up finding out at a future point in time,

608
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.370
Wolverine bonds to the Phoenix force.

609
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.190
And that really is kind of what he seems to be pointing out here. Right?

610
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.930
That where you end up having Jean Gray,

611
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:54.660
who was kind of watching all that go down, that is kind of like, okay,

612
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:56.130
like something's coming, right.

613
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.530
Jean Gray recognizes the Phoenix force is coming again.

614
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.120
Or the Phoenix force is out there on earth.

615
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.790
And it's looking for a suitable host and where Jean Ray says,

616
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.430
it's not looking for me. Then the response, the question is,

617
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.730
who is it looking for and what we're not necessarily given a definitive answer

618
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:11.640
here. It looks like it's going to end up bonding itself to Wolverine.

619
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.220
We'll find out whether that's true or not, but that's what it looks like.

620
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.780
It's going to do. What would that being said, guys,

621
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:16.950
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

622
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.780
If you are new here to come and explain mission,

623
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:20.670
you guys have the sub button to become part of the Rob for,

624
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:21.630
if you guys enjoyed this video,

625
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.450
