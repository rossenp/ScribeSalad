00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.421
<v 0>Hey guys,</v>

2
00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:03.450
just a quick bumper before we start this video over on the discord server,

3
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:06.180
and you'll find a link down in the description, but over on the discord server,

4
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:10.200
we are looking for more moderators are just core servers grown to about 6,200

5
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.140
people. It's nuts. We need more moderators for the discord.

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
So if you are interested head over to the discord server and look for the

7
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:18.000
moderator application channel,

8
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.460
and you'll see the kinds of questions that we're asking, uh,

9
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.030
if you need some help with that just below that channel is the moderator

10
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:25.410
application help channel.

11
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.290
And that'll basically walk you through the process and tell you why we're asking

12
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.230
the kinds of questions that we're asking and what it is that we're looking for

13
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.950
in moderators. So make sure you guys go check that out and, uh, yeah,

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.290
let's begin. What's going on guys.

15
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:43.190
This is Rob and we are picking up with the aftermath to joker war and this kind

16
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:47.300
of start of a whole new Batman and Mrs. Cool. If I'm being honest with you guys,

17
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:51.080
I love this, this new direction that DC's taking Batman in.

18
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:52.220
And if I'm being honest,

19
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.060
I kind of feel like it's a long time coming to be honest with you guys and you

20
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:57.860
guys will see what I mean by the time we get to the end of this.

21
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.671
But initially this,

22
00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:02.000
this kind of picks up with a bit of musing on behalf of Bruce Wayne,

23
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.830
right in the aftermath of everything that's going on.

24
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.640
It's a little bit amusing here and he talks about how the way things used to be

25
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:09.470
right back in the day. And when I say back in the day,

26
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:12.200
I mean for quite some time in DC comics,

27
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.340
really since like the introduction of Batman in the very early days in the sense

28
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:17.960
that when we had commissioner Gordon,

29
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.820
when we had the introduction of the bat signal,

30
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:23.000
when you had Alfred that things kind of follow this pattern that Bruce Wayne

31
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.860
would begin his night, you know, as Batman,

32
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.530
he put on his Clover and Cal he'd go out into the city and then like the bat

33
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:29.930
signal might come up. Right. And that was just kind of an indicator of, Hey,

34
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:32.480
things are popping off, come and see me. Uh, commissioner Gordon would say that,

35
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:33.201
you know, come and see me.

36
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.900
And I'll kind of give you the skinny on what's happening throughout Gotham as a

37
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.060
whole. Now, once Bruce Wayne was given this rundown,

38
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.750
it'd be left to him to decide which one needed the most attention basically.

39
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.410
Right? And once you narrow that down, you kind of investigate the various clues.

40
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:46.250
Somehow sometimes you would do this with Robin.

41
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.860
Other times you would do it by himself. He'd have Alfred in his ear,

42
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.830
kind of giving him some advice. And, and, you know, as an outside perspective,

43
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.240
uh, he'd get back to the bat cave.

44
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.610
Alfred would basically push him to eat or drink something,

45
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:59.000
but Batman would always have this idea of if I stay here and investigate long

46
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.910
enough, I can kind of put the clues together and I can solve this case.

47
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.020
And that was the form and function by which everything in Gotham city worked and

48
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.840
then seemingly over the course of a single night or over the course of an

49
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.600
exceedingly short period of time, all that went away, Alfred died,

50
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:12.620
commissioner Gordon's out of the picture,

51
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.200
the joker who managed to successfully take over Gotham city.

52
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.330
Batman's lost pretty much all of his resources, right?

53
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:21.050
It's kind of just him and a lot of this, this discussion that he has really,

54
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.200
really comes from Selena Kyle. And that's when she's kind of like,

55
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.140
I can see that look on your face. It drives, it drives me insane. I hate it.

56
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:30.290
It's that you've made a decision and it's going to change both of our lives and

57
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.940
it's the right decision to make. But you know,

58
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:35.840
that it's going to suck in terms of this decision. And my initial thought was,

59
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.660
Batman's calling it off, right? He's, he's basically telling Selena,

60
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:40.490
like we're no longer together anymore.

61
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.700
The reality of this is he basically kind of says joker was right.

62
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.570
I've been doing this, I've been doing this all wrong for a very long time.

63
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.720
And that's true, right? That man's been doing this wrong for a very,

64
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.220
very lengthy amount of time. Right? And, and the way this is the,

65
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:54.320
the reason why this kind of comes out,

66
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:57.170
picks up about a week ago and we basically end up picking up grifter.

67
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.970
And now the reality is a grifter is a character.

68
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.400
I don't really know a whole lot about,

69
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.220
I know enough to know that he comes from the WildStorm imprint,

70
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.950
which was created by, uh, by Jim Lee and Brandon Choi back in the day,

71
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:06.760
back in the nineties.

72
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.160
And he was part of a group called international operations.

73
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:12.490
I think it was kind of like an espionage spy team WildStorm was largely its own

74
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.640
universe. It was just kind of out there doing its own thing and the aftermath of

75
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.840
flashpoint and the launch of the new 52 WildStorm became part of the main DC

76
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:22.510
line of comics. But that's really all I know about grifter. And honestly,

77
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:24.700
I don't really care that much to know anything more about him.

78
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.780
He's not interesting to me.

79
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.270
I don't really care much about his character for the longer shorter for the sake

80
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:29.410
of this video. Since you know,

81
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.390
this channel really is designed to educate you guys.

82
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.290
The nature of grifter is such that he has powers in so far as,

83
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.770
as telekinetic abilities. He's exceedingly fast. He's a great con artist, right?

84
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:40.040
He was, uh, he was, uh, uh,

85
00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:43.600
a member of the U S military special ops team or group or whatever you want to

86
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.360
call it before he deserted and became a con man effectively,

87
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.170
he was at one point involved with a group of aliens called Damon nights or

88
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.970
demonized. I'm not a hundred percent sure how to pronounce that.

89
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.700
The basically tried to possess him to take over his physical form. Uh,

90
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.620
he ended up escaping. And then for the most part,

91
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:58.450
he's just kind of been somewhat of a wonder.

92
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.970
I think it really more of just kind of like a hired gun, like a mercenary,

93
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.710
but in this particular instance here,

94
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.530
he's basically working as a bodyguard for Lucius Fox right now.

95
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.530
Batman is aware of who grifter is. The fight between them is really interesting.

96
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.740
And if anything, I think it's really one of these attempts by DC to say,

97
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:13.630
Hey guys, like look at this guy grifter, you know, he's,

98
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:17.500
he's pretty interesting. Um, I don't think anybody's really buying it, but, uh,

99
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.980
he's, he's capable enough to where he can kind of fight Batman to a standstill,

100
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.590
but he's basically been hired as a bodyguard by Lucius Fox.

101
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.340
And the reason for this is as part of the hold over with regards to joker Wark,

102
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.150
Lucius Fox is still the person in possession of Batman's wealth, right.

103
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.300
Of Bruce Wayne's wealth and really kind of the guy running Wayne enterprises now

104
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.321
in, in the videos that we do,

105
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:38.560
where we do like a character explanation or team explanation or something like

106
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.650
that, we'll talk about stories that happen over the course of a characters,

107
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.290
publication history that basically changes things up.

108
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.350
The kind of initiates a huge status quo. That's what this is, right?

109
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.780
This is a massive status quo change for Batman.

110
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.210
That's what you guys are literally reading history in real time.

111
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.230
And this particular instance,

112
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.270
rifles you guys who bought the book who are reading it right now,

113
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.510
you're reading through history like a huge history change in real time,

114
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.250
how long it lasts. We don't really know,

115
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.350
but the idea behind this is that with Lucius Fox,

116
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:05.110
more or less kind of running the show here effectively being a billionaire,

117
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.650
there's a few things going on the first is that he still Harbor some ill will

118
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.800
towards Batman in the sense that everything that happened with joker Wark, uh,

119
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:12.250
you know, the,

120
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.860
the way that he was infected by joker toxin and all that kind of stuff,

121
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.220
the experiences left him largely with some measure of PTSD. Now,

122
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:21.150
the other part of that is we kind of get this indication that punchline still

123
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:23.880
around, cause she's kind of out there talking to the press and things like that.

124
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.420
That was DC teasing us with an idea of punchlines mini series or maybe her

125
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:28.770
ongoing series. I'm not really sure,

126
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.860
but the other part of that is you still have clown Hunter and clown Hunter is

127
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.470
still basically going through tracking down members who were part of jokers

128
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:36.570
gang, and then taking them out where he finds them. Now,

129
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:39.000
the reason why this matters is because in the sure,

130
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.100
math of joker war in the fall of the joker,

131
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.640
those individuals who were part of his army vanished because their leader was

132
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.930
effectively gone, their, their chance of success, right? Their chance of,

133
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.380
of kind of having the world as they want.

134
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:52.080
I wanted it to be actually coming to fruition was gone, right?

135
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.620
So it was basically you guys lost. And in that instance, you know, in that case,

136
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.770
they basically took off and they, they down, right? They,

137
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.570
they ended up basically kind of going underground.

138
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.580
And that's an important distinction to understand here.

139
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.850
There's a difference between quitting and just going to a place where you can't

140
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:05.660
be detected.

141
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.780
And that's basically what was happening here for the jokers army in terms of

142
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.100
putting on the mask and going on,

143
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.680
going out every night and doing things that's over, right?

144
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:15.380
They don't really do that anymore. Instead they meet underground.

145
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.060
They meet in places that are not easily found and then plot or plan accordingly.

146
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.370
Now the joker still out there. And as far as we're aware,

147
00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:23.650
the joker doesn't really have any money Walnut with his own gang.

148
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.030
Because as we know, as the reader,

149
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.740
the joker doesn't really care about those guys.

150
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.740
They believe the joker cares and they hope the joker cares,

151
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.080
but the joker doesn't really care about them. They were cannon fodder, right?

152
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.520
They were a means to achieve an end.

153
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.490
Now whether or not they were intelligent enough to realize that is a wholly

154
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:38.500
different beast. And in times of desperation,

155
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.180
people believe what they want to believe.

156
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.030
And what ended up happening here is you had people who wanted things to be a

157
00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:45.400
certain way, the joker represented that way.

158
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.880
And ultimately they kind of tied the two together of their own volition.

159
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.390
The joker saying things I like, and the joker is espousing ideologies.

160
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.670
I agree with therefore the joker agrees with me,

161
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.180
the joker likes me and results of that is they ended up kind of becoming the

162
00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:01.300
people that they were becoming. Now, the joker basically kind of falling joker,

163
00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:03.640
having been defeated, or at least a scheme ending,

164
00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:05.860
kind of puts them in a position to where it's will the joker still out there.

165
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.620
The joker will save us. You know, I'm, I'm kind of making some assumptions here,

166
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:10.150
but you know, it's, it's, it's interesting.

167
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.840
It basically means a Joker's army is not Holy dead, albeit very much, you know,

168
00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:15.430
much smaller than it used to be.

169
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.210
But the long and short of this is that there are some major things going on with

170
00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:22.330
Bruce Wayne and especially Wayne man, Wayne, Wayne enterprises,

171
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.630
and Lucius Fox that Lucius Fox to a degree kind of enjoys the idea of it,

172
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.580
having all this wealth. You know, he goes, as far as to say,

173
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.470
I'm not going to lie, lie to you and say that like, it's fine. You know, that,

174
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.050
that, that I want this money doesn't benefit me. It does. It benefits me.

175
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:37.450
It benefits my family. That's the truth of the matter, right?

176
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:38.860
Having these funds at my disposal,

177
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.670
but understand that Wayne enterprises is looking to force you out, right?

178
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.900
Like you are a member of the board,

179
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.420
but they're looking to basically give you like a huge chunk of change.

180
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.150
Let you just kind of draw income seemingly for the rest of your life.

181
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.080
And then you go away.

182
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.140
Now you basically end up stepping down from Wayne enterprises as part of the

183
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:55.930
board. You have no decision making ability anymore. More so than that,

184
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:58.600
the reason why is because the heat's on to you. But the governor,

185
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.560
I mean is looking at you.

186
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.930
One of the big things that came out of joker war was how,

187
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.990
how Bruce Wayne was spending his money off shore counts,

188
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.950
different things like that.

189
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.220
And so the IRS and the financial sector of the federal government, right?

190
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:10.690
So seemingly the secret service,

191
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.660
if there's any indication of fraud on a massive level of being invoked,

192
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.470
they're looking into Bruce Wayne. And so the more he's in the public eye,

193
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.470
the more heat and scrutiny he draws on the Wayne enterprises.

194
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.040
And so it's best for business that Bruce Wayne stepped down. And that's the,

195
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.460
one of the big reasons why Lucius Fox is kind of holding onto this money.

196
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.300
The other part of that is that the notion that the public perception out there,

197
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.141
that Wayne,

198
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:35.410
as a person who was potentially engaging in embezzlement or at the very least

199
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.770
tax fraud, right? Like, you know, or,

200
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:39.910
or even just dodging taxes is not good for the public,

201
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.280
for public perception of Wayne enterprises.

202
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.800
And so one of the other reasons why they want him to step down and so that they

203
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:47.860
can rebrand, right? They can rebrand Wayne enterprises, right? It's all new,

204
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.720
all different Wayne enterprises or something like that.

205
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:51.520
Hopefully not as bad as what Marvel did and you know,

206
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:52.690
in the aftermath of secret Wars,

207
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.880
but the whole point behind that is they're looking literally distance themselves

208
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:59.460
from Bruce Wayne. And so the important thing behind this,

209
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:03.720
and the reason why this matters is that Bruce Wayne cannot operate as Batman.

210
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.220
The way he's done in the past,

211
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.180
which is to say with a unlimited checkbook and all the high-tech gadgetry in the

212
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:10.410
world, that at the end,

213
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.500
Batman is going to have to operate on the most basic level.

214
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.030
There's no high-tech gadgetry.

215
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.360
There's no super advanced Batmobile tools with all the resources in the world

216
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.670
that just come off of some endless supply chain.

217
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.770
It doesn't work that way anymore. That he's got a Batmobile.

218
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.930
If the Batmobile breaks down, he's got to fix it.

219
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.060
And there's a couple of reasons for why this is happening.

220
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.740
The first is because at this point,

221
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.910
it's obvious DC's bringing Batman comics more in line with Robert Pattinson's

222
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:33.660
Batman film.

223
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.110
The other part of this is because we've seen this happen before the most notable

224
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:41.460
instance came in 1969 during the Frank Robinson Edmund Hamilton era with Batman

225
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:42.510
number 217.

226
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.990
And this was a point where Dick Grayson had basically left to go to college.

227
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.700
And the result of this is that, uh,

228
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.270
Bruce Wayne actually ended up leaving Wayne Manor and taking up residence in the

229
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.170
city of Gotham.

230
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:55.320
And the reason why that's important is because what you end up having here is

231
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.470
this conversation between himself and Selena Kyle, where he says,

232
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.420
that's what I want to do. Now. One of the,

233
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:01.980
one of the little moments that comes out of this,

234
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:04.680
this is really more of a plot point that'll become important later on is that

235
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:07.380
when Bruce Wayne ends up leaving, leaving Lucius fought, right,

236
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.590
leaving that office, he tells grifter, like send a message to your boss, right?

237
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.950
Until you send a message, delicious Fox, tell him I know what halo is.

238
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.470
And basically I'm watching, it looks like it's, you know,

239
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.210
some kind of little bit of an underground thing,

240
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:20.190
some kind of plot point that we'll see later on down the line,

241
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.830
but kind of picking back up with Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle. Again,

242
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.230
he basically says I'm going to move into the city itself.

243
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.380
And that's what he did in the aftermath. Really with Batman 217,

244
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.930
he ended up moving into a penthouse inside Gotham city.

245
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.010
And that was designed more for him to be closer to the ground, to be more,

246
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.140
more direct. The, the issue with this is that in the aftermath of that,

247
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.560
he ended up deciding that being so close to the city was not the best idea

248
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:43.950
because it was too easy for people to pick up and distinguish the fact that

249
00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:46.140
Bruce Wayne was Batman, right. They were seeing him every day.

250
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.300
People could find a way to break in different things like that.

251
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.940
And putting the pieces together was seemingly just too easy.

252
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.070
So it didn't last all that long. And I would say,

253
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.490
if this does remain a mainstay for James Kenyans run, once you leave,

254
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.930
he'll go back to Wayne Manor, right?

255
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.700
And then we'll probably find some way in which, you know,

256
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.760
Alfred comes back probably using the Lazarus pits, you know, who really knows,

257
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.760
but the, the, the whole point behind this is that he basically says like,

258
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:07.200
there's a brownstone there that I own.

259
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.460
And I didn't even realize that I owned it.

260
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:11.130
So I'm certainly going to move into it. I'm not going to live across the bridge.

261
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.040
I'm going to live inside the city that I want to protect. So again,

262
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.910
kind of reiterating what we've seen happen in years past when it came to Batman.

263
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.320
The funny thing about this is that he had actually considered the idea of Selena

264
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:23.970
Kyle kind of renaming herself, right?

265
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:26.850
Like creating a new identity and her working alongside Bruce Wayne.

266
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.510
The issue with this is that with Selena Kyle and Bruce Wayne spending time

267
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:32.850
together, and then Catwoman and Batman hanging out together,

268
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.740
people would have put the pieces together like that.

269
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.570
They would have done it so quick. And they would have said,

270
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.580
Bruce Wayne is Selena, Kyla hanging out all the time.

271
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.760
Batman and Catwoman are fighting crime together all the time is Bruce Wayne,

272
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.260
Selena Kyle Batman, and Catwoman.

273
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.800
Somebody somewhere would have figured that out. Right.

274
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.450
The funny thing about this though, is a Selena.

275
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:51.840
Kyle had the reverse idea that Bruce Wayne could just run off with her. Now,

276
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:54.700
of course, Bruce's response is I can't do that. And that's true, right?

277
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.730
How's DC going to publish Batman comics. If Bruce, Wayne's not Batman,

278
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.593
it doesn't work.

279
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.390
Nobody wants to read a Batman comic where Bruce Wayne is not Batman for like 10

280
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.700
years for a short amount of time. Sure. Right?

281
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:08.890
Like the whole aftermath of final crisis, you know,

282
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.010
where like Dick Grayson was Batman for a time. And Damian Wayne was Robin shirt.

283
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.100
That's interesting. The aftermath of Batman nightfall. Sure.

284
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.450
But in terms of like 2030, that like Bruce Wayne is still not Batman.

285
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.630
People don't want that. People want Bruce Wayne to be Batman forever. Right.

286
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.120
It's just kind of the way things are. So we come up with fans are,

287
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.060
we do not like change. And so as one of these things, where,

288
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:30.040
where Bruce Wayne basically, and even something that, uh,

289
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.390
Selena Kyle basically say like,

290
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.270
we need to kind of get ourselves re-grounded right. Like we need to,

291
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.560
we need to reground ourselves.

292
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.500
And so what's interesting about this is like you Selina. Kyle's like,

293
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.810
we'll take one year, basically one year apart,

294
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:43.840
one year for them to figure things out, to get them, uh, get things grounded,

295
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:46.480
to get themselves sorted out. And then at the end of that one year,

296
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.560
basically reconcile,

297
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:50.440
consolidate and see whether or not they can move forward together.

298
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.480
And so where you kind of ended up getting as them basically going to the

299
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.640
brownstone of Bruce Wayne and knocking boots, right? I mean,

300
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:56.200
there's no apartment, no furniture in there.

301
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.480
Let's lean to cause like who needs furniture? But nonetheless, it's,

302
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:01.720
it's a it's it's, it's interesting. This is the whole new Batman, right?

303
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.470
It's DC taking Batman back to the way he was back during the sixties and the

304
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:08.230
seventies where he had some semblance of high-tech gadgetry,

305
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.100
but Batman comics were largely reliant on Bruce Wayne's intuition, right?

306
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:13.600
His intelligence, his detective skills,

307
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.840
and some measure of super advanced gadgetry. But in recent years,

308
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:20.590
I would say Batman comics have largely focused and shifted their focus to like

309
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.190
Bruce Wayne, being able to achieve his goals, using like super high tech stuff.

310
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.610
And I'm excited to read comics where it's just Batman and his intellect.

311
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.280
I'm excited to read that it's a throwback to the, to the comment,

312
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:33.280
to the Batman comics of yesteryear. And I'm looking forward to it a lot.

313
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.410
So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

314
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.970
If you are new here to come and explain,

315

317
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.730
I will catch you all later.

318
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.563
<v 1>Wow.</v>
