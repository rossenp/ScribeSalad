4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.720
What's going on.

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.620
<v 1>Guys. This is Rob and, uh, we are picking back up with the juggernaut,</v>

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.570
the juggernaut series over here at Marvel comics.

7
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.710
And I know this is something that we don't,

8
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:21.800
we kind of cover not really inconsistently, but Marvel does it once a month.

9
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.110
Right. So we kind of have to just wait it out a little bit. And at the moment,

10
00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:26.150
right now, I believe we're at issue number four.

11
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.340
And I think we have another week or two before issue.

12
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.530
Number five comes out maybe a little bit longer than that.

13
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.920
What this does is this kind of picks up off the heels of the last story that we

14
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:37.040
did, right. In the sense that, uh, we ended up learning that Arnhem Zola,

15
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.300
the one time member of Hydra who's long since been defected from the group and

16
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.750
kind of doing his own thing had basically been kidnapping people who were

17
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:47.240
mutants and then more or less experimenting on them. Right?

18
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:50.900
So in a lot of ways kind of taking over the role that was previously assigned to

19
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:54.260
Mr. Sinister in the X-Men comics. Uh, now the funny thing about this,

20
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.290
this was kind of interesting here is that Arnhem Zola, at least as we're told,

21
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.770
is operating out of an old factor three base. Now factor three,

22
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.230
this was kind of a kind of wild here. Factor three.

23
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:05.300
This is an old school organization, right?

24
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:10.040
So factor three was created in uncanny X-Men number 28.

25
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:10.460
I want to say,

26
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460
I think it was just X-Men number 28 back in the day by Roy Thomas. Um,

27
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.940
they're an old school enemy of the X-Men. They weren't really like a big deal,

28
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:17.331
right? I mean,

29
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.240
they were kind of a group that was introduced before the era of Claremont when

30
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.780
like groups were a lot more nuanced, a lot more, uh, subversive and,

31
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:25.910
and really a lot more dangerous, you know, in, in the,

32
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.440
the Claremont era on Kenny X-Men,

33
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.480
but it is kind of cool to see an old throwback.

34
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.480
But the idea is that as soon as juggernaut gets in here,

35
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.850
he's immediately attacked by Primus. Now, prime,

36
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.940
this goes all the way back to the old captain America and Falcon comics back in

37
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.630
1977, right? So this is not a new concept, but prime is,

38
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.500
as it existed was really just kind of a wholesale creation by Arnhem Zola,

39
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.780
not really a modification of an existing person,

40
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.880
but really just a complete and total creation,

41
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.270
but the idea behind Primus and really what made privacy so dangerous in the

42
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.291
old-school Marvel comics.

43
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.890
And even now to a degree is the fact that he's really just a malleable plastic

44
00:01:57.891 --> 00:01:59.600
character, right. He just kind of this Android,

45
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.510
they can essentially do whatever it is that he needs to do in order to overcome

46
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:04.460
an enemy in terms of adjusting himself. Right.

47
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:06.530
So think of it as something very similar to Mr.

48
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.690
Fantastic of the fantastic four now,

49
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.090
for the most part with juggernaut facing off against this guy,

50
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.160
it's like being tied up in string. And in fact,

51
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:16.490
when he's basically captured by primates it's because prime has kind of turns

52
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:20.450
itself into a sort of gelatinous state and then bonds itself to two juggernaut,

53
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.870
which basically sort of solidifies it, right. It just kind of keeps him in case,

54
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.430
but following him being knocked out,

55
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.620
we kind of get this little bit of a throwback, uh, about,

56
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:30.230
about a few months ago. We're not given an actual definitive date,

57
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.920
but at some point a few months ago that with Cain Marco showing back up and then

58
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.010
trying to, you know, having the,

59
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.850
the Crimson bands and then from there trying to reaccess his, uh,

60
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.170
his power as the John or not,

61
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.470
he ends up breaking into a storage facility that belongs to one.

62
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.440
Now the one stands for office of national emergency.

63
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.980
And this was an organization that largely Rose to prominence in the aftermath of

64
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:51.230
decimation of really during the events of decimation,

65
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.910
the aftermath of house of ant, right?

66
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:56.510
When the mutant population lost its powers or at least 98% of the mutant

67
00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:00.490
population losses powers the office of national basically reactivated the

68
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.640
Sentinel program, but they were Madison. The other thing they did too,

69
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.550
is they kind of made the X-Men prisoners, not directly,

70
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.720
but in so far as what was left of the mutant population resigned itself to the

71
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.600
grounds of the Xavier Institute. And then under Cyclops,

72
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.050
basically nobody was allowed to leave right in the sentinels basically existed

73
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.580
there under the auspices of, Hey,

74
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.190
we're going to protect you guys from various threats out there all the,

75
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.810
while the X-Men were basically prisoners,

76
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.520
they just weren't really allowed to go anywhere. Right?

77
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:28.300
So it was kind of the X-Men turning to an authority figure to keep them safe all

78
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:31.480
the while making themselves prisoners of that authority figure and just not

79
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.710
realizing it. And so following that with Cain, Marko basically re accessing the,

80
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.710
the, the kind of shards of the Crimson Jim of Ciroc,

81
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.130
and then kind of reactivating his juggernaut powers through the Crimson bands

82
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.300
that he currently possesses. He's met by the disembodied voice of, uh,

83
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.300
of sort of rock himself.

84
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:48.340
And so we're gonna kind of jump forward here for a second,

85
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.240
technically in the story,

86
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.660
but what it does is it yanks him directly to the Crimson dimension right now,

87
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.000
one of the things to understand when it comes to sit a rack and we really

88
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.710
haven't covered his character all too much,

89
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.290
but one of the important things to understand when it comes to [inaudible] is in

90
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.870
his own dimension, he's wildly powerful. And in fact,

91
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.690
there's been multiple instances in the case of Marvel comics,

92
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.740
where it's been stated that his Ciroc were to leave his dimension and show up in

93
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.260
the main Marvel universe with all of his powers intact,

94
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.760
basically operating at 100% of his powers. Nobody could stop him, right? Not,

95
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.500
Dormamuu not Dr. Strange nobody, right guys, just a whole nother level of power.

96
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.240
It's really insane, but such as it is,

97
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.050
he's confined really to his own Crimson dimension and can't really leave.

98
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.750
And that's where juggernaut comes into play, right?

99
00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:29.970
Juggernauts kind of the extension of back on earth and allowing him to kind of

100
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:30.661
do his own thing.

101
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:34.500
But the crazy thing about this is that what we're told here is traditionally the

102
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:37.380
armor given to juggernaut and the empowerment of the,

103
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:40.380
the Crimson gym basically anchors him to sit a rock, right?

104
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:42.780
It's how it set a rock was able to act through him over the years, uh,

105
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.280
during the eighth day event, for example,

106
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:47.460
when Siracha basically took total control or at least gave juggernaut almost

107
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:51.120
100% of his power and the juggernaut went forward just on a whole new level of

108
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:53.850
strength that we never really seen before, uh, that was all sit around,

109
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.630
acting through him.

110
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.470
The difference is that these bands that he has largely seem to be bands that are

111
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.450
tied to the bands that Dr strange uses, right?

112
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:02.940
The Crimson bands of sit or act because of her Dr. Strange,

113
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:06.300
using that spell before they're essentially seeming to be tied to Dr. Strange

114
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.150
his power in some way, we're not giving a definitive explanation here.

115
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.270
The important thing about this though, is that the gyms itself,

116
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:14.760
because they were kind of destroyed, but now reconstituted,

117
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.480
what it does is it allows juggernaut to go forward as a person who acts

118
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:20.430
autonomously of Ciroc, basically,

119
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:22.440
meaning he's not anchored to them or anchored to him.

120
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.220
So when Ciroc says like you have now returned to me as my,

121
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:28.620
my earthly avatar go forward and do my bidding through response to gender,

122
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.390
not is, you know, that's not going to happen.

123
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.270
I've not been whisked here to your realm. I'm here in a mind state,

124
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.330
but physically I'm still back on earth. I'll no longer you do your bidding.

125
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.360
I'll do whatever I want to do right now. It really kind of begs a question.

126
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:42.090
This is what we do not get an answer to. It really kind of begs the question.

127
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.880
If juggernauts powered by the Crimson, Jim was sitter at, uh,

128
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.420
and he goes forward wearing the Crimson bands and the Crimson bans are basically

129
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:52.080
a source of power linked to Dr. Strange bicycle rack. Then effectively,

130
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.350
he's still anchored to him. No, he doesn't necessarily have to do his bidding,

131
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.950
but by all standards of measurement, his can be taken away.

132
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.830
That's where the question becomes. If that's the case, why is it not habit,

133
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.760
right? Why didn't sit around,

134
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.340
just strip him of his power and all were given as this kind of loose

135
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:07.010
explanation. I'm not directly anchored to you anymore.

136
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.350
So what it seems like is for whatever reason,

137
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.260
the power of Ciroc is still confined to the Crimson gym,

138
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.110
but the Crimson gym cannot be accessed by Ciroc, right?

139
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.810
So you basically cannot cut the juggernaut off from a source of power.

140
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.330
So to give this a more tangible perspective,

141
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.300
it's like cutting off a person's hand, right? It doesn't belong to them anymore.

142
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.940
It's just in the possession of whoever it is that has that hand.

143
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.020
They can't do anything with it.

144
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.790
They can't move their fingers or anything like that.

145
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.140
That's basically what it looks like,

146
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.550
which is kind of interesting because it seems to defy this omnipotent power of

147
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.680
Cinerama. But it's also cool because it moves Jaeger,

148
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.710
not into being in a different position. Now, again, it's the nature of comics.

149
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.500
Everything that changes goes back to the being the way that it was before.

150
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.530
So somewhere along the line something's going to happen and juggernaut is going

151
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.870
to go back to being as old self, right? It's the nature of comics,

152
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.550
nothing stays changed for long, right?

153
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.890
Everything just always goes back to the status quo.

154
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.620
But for this time that we get it, it looks like it's pretty cool. Right?

155
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.660
So kind of jumping back to,

156
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.660
to where he's basically been captured and confined inside of this, uh, this,

157
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:02.000
this, you know, base of operations for Arnhem Zola,

158
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.000
of course you have diesel jump in and that's where things get interesting here,

159
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:08.030
because one of the things to understand this is more of an interim comic, right?

160
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.980
So there's not a whole lot of action going on here.

161
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.400
We do get kind of a return or at least a new status quo for juggernaut.

162
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.080
But beyond that, there's not a whole lot happening.

163
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.020
Instead of DSL basically jumps out of this, this, you know, uh,

164
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.720
this helicopter uses her power to kind of slow herself down.

165
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:22.970
So she doesn't smash into the ground in the mountains and die.

166
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.110
And then from there, Arnhem,

167
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.840
Zola makes his presence known and basically tells us what we already know.

168
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.530
Right. That for years he's been experimenting on mutants because mutans are now

169
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:33.800
considered to be a rare commodity, right? That were, there was no Precoa,

170
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.580
there was no centralized location where by all mutants existed and nobody could

171
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.620
access it. Beaton's used to be all over the place, right.

172
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.420
They were just in different places around the world,

173
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:43.190
just kind of making their living and doing their thing.

174
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.430
And it was very easy to access any mutant and basically kidnapped them,

175
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.260
experiment on them. And that's what you wanted to do.

176
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.950
But now that all the mutants are essentially under the purview of Coca-Cola and

177
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.040
the protection of the Island and the power of those who were on the Island.

178
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.750
One doesn't simply just walk into Coca-Cola,

179
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.470
you'll just simply go in there and then take a mutant and leave.

180
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.820
It doesn't really work that way. Right? I mean,

181
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.500
you'd likely get yourself killed doing it.

182
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.220
And so mutants are now a highly sought after commodity, like adamantium,

183
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.710
the whole point behind this is they're a rare commodity.

184
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.490
And so Arnhem Zola able to get his hands on a mutant and then in turn mess with

185
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:14.840
their DNA. And then, you know,

186
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:17.900
kind of sell that off to the highest bidder is a huge source of income.

187
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.540
That kind of seems to be what's going on here now for its part,

188
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.040
when diesel goes against Primus,

189
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.960
she's nowhere near prepared for that level of power.

190
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.510
And so she's ultimately conquered as well. And so with that,

191
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:29.630
being the case and juggernauts seeing what's happening and realizing they're

192
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:32.820
basically going to kill her and then kind of extract your DNA, break it down,

193
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.120
figure out how her powers work, find a way to duplicate it,

194
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:36.620
and then sell that off to somebody.

195
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.170
He of course smashes out of his containment cell.

196
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.140
And that immediately goes after Primus. Now, when that happens,

197
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.000
primacy of course, attacks juggernaut,

198
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.880
but juggernaut does one of those big thunder claps and then basically shatters

199
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.590
privates into a whole bunch of different pieces, right?

200
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:51.050
It doesn't really seem to kill them as much as incapacitate them,

201
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.720
but then from there, he goes directly after Arnhem Zola.

202
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:57.480
Now when he frees diesel, she of course goes after Arnhem, Zola as well,

203
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.230
and then seeks to destroy him only for us to find out that Arnhem Zola has been

204
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:02.190
conscripted, right?

205
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.940
He's been forced into servitude by some other organization out there that's

206
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:08.670
really pulling the strings. And so he's not really the mastermind here.

207
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.850
There's a much bigger plan of foot and there's a much bigger organization out

208
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.410
there. Again, it's an internal comment.

209
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.870
This is the empire strikes back of the story, right.

210
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.240
It just it's more informational than anything else.

211
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.740
It doesn't really have a whole lot of action.

212
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.300
And there's certainly no conclusion here.

213
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.510
It doesn't really kind of give us the idea that there's a much bigger situation

214
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.000
going on. So again, it's cool. You know, I, I dig it.

215
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:29.640
It's certainly one of those who probably could have coupled with the next video

216
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.430
with the next comic that came out and it probably would have done some good in

217
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:35.370
terms of having a little more going on in this particular story. But you know,

218
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.640
this is also a little important here because having it as its own individual

219
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:41.940
story gives us the ability to understand better what's going on as opposed to

220
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:45.090
having to rush through it and then making up for things later on down the road.

221
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:47.190
Right? So, uh, again, not a whole lot doing here,

222
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.740
but it probably does have a few bits of important information that'll become

223
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:52.140
relevant later on. But if you guys are new here to come and explain,

224
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.360
