4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.300
What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.260
<v 1>Brought and a couple of things before we start this video.</v>

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.840
<v 0>Um, for those of you guys who were on the discord server.</v>

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.660
<v 1>And you'll find a link to the discord down in the description, uh,</v>

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.390
we have some cool stuff coming for you guys, right?

9
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.130
So we've got like a Whittler bot where like a,

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.400
the Riddler will like escape from Arkema slalom and we'll show up at different

11
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:31.880
places throughout the server. And if you guess is riddle correctly,

12
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.300
then one of the winners will be picked for something like a t-shirt maybe a Rob

13
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.490
core ring or something like that. We're still getting the rewards,

14
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.100
rewards fleshed out, but that'll be coming relatively soon.

15
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.150
And then we're also kicking around the idea of a Dungeons and dragons or

16
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:47.570
superhero themed done as a dry, dry DMD kind of tournament,

17
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.160
which seems like it'd be really cool.

18
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:51.650
A lot of you guys have been asking me for it for a while. So, uh,

19
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.810
make sure you guys check out the discourse server down in the description.

20
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.480
I think it'd be pretty awesome, but, um,

21
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.480
but what I want to talk about in this video is I want to talk about Thor for

22
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.330
specifically like Gore the Godbold shirt and like Jane Foster Thor,

23
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.900
and then Odin Suncor. And, and one of the funny things,

24
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.970
there's actually a theory floating around out there.

25
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
Now I'm not the one who came up with this theory, right? This is not my theory.

26
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
I want to get that kind of clear right off the bat. So people are just like,

27
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.090
I heard that from Rob, he's the one that made it up. That's not true.

28
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.270
I actually saw this theory kind of circulating around on the internet and a fan

29
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.670
actually gave it to me on Twitter. But it's, it's a,

30
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:27.500
it's a cool little equivalent tidbit here. Right?

31
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.790
So one of the questions people have asked is that if in Thor four,

32
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.010
we're going to have Chris Hemsworth Thor,

33
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.540
and then we're also going to have like Natalie Portman's, Jane Foster Thor, uh,

34
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.150
are they both gonna be running around at the same time?

35
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.370
Are we going to have like two Thor's in those, in that movie?

36
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.380
And I think the answer to that question is no,

37
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:48.320
we're not going to have two Thor's. I think we're going to have three. Uh,

38
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.880
this is going to be the crazy thing about right.

39
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:52.550
So like three Thor's and Thor four,

40
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:55.400
I think it's going to be kind of kind of bonkers. Uh, so here's the deal.

41
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.590
The story's based on Gore, the God, which,

42
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.710
or at least he's going to be the villain now as always with the Marvel cinematic

43
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.250
universe, never expect a direct adaptation of a comic quite,

44
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:07.670
which is to say basically the comic book being filmed shot for shot.

45
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:09.720
And then given, given to us in the, as,

46
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.990
as a movie going audience that never happens, right?

47
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.710
It's usually just the general idea of the story and then reworked for moving

48
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.960
forward, which usually makes sense because for the most part,

49
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:20.150
you can't really get away with the kind of things and movies that you can get

50
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:22.730
away with comics because you're working with real life actors,

51
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:23.570
you have a screenplay,

52
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:25.910
you got to make sure it stays under a certain amount of time.

53
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.230
There's a lot of variables that go into making a film, but in the original God,

54
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:31.064
what's your story.

55
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.000
But what you basically have there at least towards the end was three generations

56
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.180
of four all facing off against score. Now in the comic,

57
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.220
it was Thor from three different timelines, right?

58
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:44.510
So for when he was younger Thor in the modern era and thought in the future, um,

59
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.670
and the movie, I think it's going to be a little different, right?

60
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.730
I think we're going to get Jane Foster Thor in the future because somewhere

61
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:53.870
along the line between now and then Odin's son either loses the ability to lift

62
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.570
his hammer, or he passes it on to Jane Foster because like, Oh,

63
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.550
like somebody has got to run Asgard. And so, you know,

64
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.640
Thor's basically like I'm going to be the one to run the show here, Jane Foster,

65
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.760
you keep an eye on earth. And then he basically passes the mantle off to her.

66
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.730
Um, it could be that he loses the ability to wield his hammer, right?

67
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.610
He's no longer worthy of it, which is what happened in the comics. Right.

68
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.520
He lost his worthiness and was just kind of there, right?

69
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.440
Like you lose a storm breaker or whatever the case is,

70
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.140
maybe mule near comes back and he's not worthy of wielding it.

71
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.610
But whatever happens to be the case,

72
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.800
Jane Foster will be the one to take up the mantle.

73
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.280
So I wouldn't be surprised if you see Natalie Portman as Thor. Uh,

74
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.460
but she's older, right? She's maybe like 20 years older, 30 years older,

75
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.190
something like that. And then that kind of leaves the question.

76
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.500
What's the younger version of Thor that we're going to see.

77
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.940
And this is when things get interesting.

78
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.800
I think we're going to see beta Ray bill.

79
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.900
And a lot of people ask that what a lot of people are like, you know,

80
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.090
who would the younger four be in this situation?

81
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.450
And I think it would be beta Ray bill. I think we might end up getting him now.

82
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.900
The question is how and why, and that's the answer I don't really have,

83
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.020
but I don't have the answer to the question. How would we get beta Ray bill?

84
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.700
Or why would we get beta Ray bill?

85
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.820
Because the only thing we've seen about his character is he was one of the

86
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.160
champions on Sakaar right? And Thor three,

87
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.610
he was one of the former champions who was defeated at some point along at some

88
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.620
point along the line. And we never really found out when,

89
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.860
but I think it'd be cool to find out that he was defeated by the incredible

90
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.320
Hulk, right? When, when hope first showed up on Sakaar,

91
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.040
he defeated beta Ray bill and became the new champion. That would be awesome.

92
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.130
Right. But, um, but there's, there's,

93
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.520
there's nothing to really indicate that like beta Ray bill does in any form or

94
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.660
fashion have any dealings with any of the superheroes or any of the earth based,

95
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.200
uh,

96
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.860
based characters or anything and comics that would make a lot more sense because

97
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:33.070
when, when betray bill first showed up, when Walt Simonson was writing Thor,

98
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.800
that beta Ray bill was kind of an accidental discovery, right?

99
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.580
The beta Ray bill was kind of like this cyborg based protector of his people who

100
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:41.800
were leaving their planet because it was destroyed by Cerner.

101
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.600
And this led to Thor,

102
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:47.200
basically intervening at the request of Nick fury to find out what this great,

103
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.050
huge caravan of space-faring vehicles was doing.

104
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.510
And it led to a fight between thorn beta Ray bill,

105
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.210
and then ultimately a kind of tournament of sorts. Right. But, you know,

106
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.840
there was kind of instituted by Odin to determine who could wield mule near.

107
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.861
And, uh, when,

108
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:02.770
when beta Ray bill initially defeated Thor and picked up his hammer,

109
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.800
that's what led to the whole tournament and ultimately Odin, you know, uh,

110
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.341
beta Ray bill,

111
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.360
I think lost and Odin ended up giving him his own hammer called a storm breaker,

112
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.750
right? That's the original storm breaker hammer and one comics, uh,

113
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.050
things that you guys can tell have changed a lot in the MCU in comparison to the

114
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.420
conics. Uh, so because of that, there's,

115
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.210
there's really no telling how this could work. Um,

116
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.310
I think it'd be cool if we got beta Ray bill,

117
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.030
but I think that most likely what you'll see is just a younger version of Odin's

118
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:31.330
son. And I think that makes the most sense, right? A younger version of Thor,

119
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.780
uh,

120
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.500
who in his younger days was brash headstrong wouldn't really listen to reason.

121
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.570
And I think it'd be a great compliment to, you know,

122
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.030
in all honesty to kind of have this younger version of Thor,

123
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:43.960
who's trying to be tamed by his modern age self and to kind of see how far his,

124
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.850
how much his character has changed. You know,

125
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:50.500
since the time before he was banished from Asgard on earth and like how much

126
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:53.200
he's learned since he's been on earth, fighting alongside humans, you know,

127
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.680
during the events of infinity war, Avengers, end game, that kind of a thing. Um,

128
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.300
so there's, there's a lot of really cool storytelling that could be done there,

129
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.020
but for the long and short of this, in terms of how Jane Foster fits in,

130
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.350
I think that's what we're going to get. The real question to ask here is,

131
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.410
are we going to get that future version of low-key that killed the world, right?

132
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.040
Because those guys don't know. And, and the, and that story, right.

133
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.850
And Gore the God butcher, there's a point where it kind of ties into that story,

134
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:20.870
but not directly, it was actually during the events of journey and the mystery.

135
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.210
I think the comics that were being published at the time,

136
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.140
but there's one point where future low-key actually kills everything on earth.

137
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.690
Like all the superheroes, all the supervillains, all of humanity.

138
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.110
He literally wipes out the world, right? It's just this dead empty husk.

139
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.950
And a Thor is just kind of sitting in Asgard with all the Asgardians being dead

140
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.810
and he's just kind of the King of nothing. Right.

141
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.540
And then eventually Galactus shows up on earth trying to consume it.

142
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.200
And it leads to a great big fight between like old King Thor and Galactus,

143
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.520
which is super cool. I doubt we'll see Galactus and that, but, um, but you know,

144
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.500
suffice it to say in, in this whole thing,

145
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.670
I haven't said that phrase in a while, suffice it to say suffice it to say in,

146
00:06:54.671 --> 00:06:57.410
in the midst of all this Thor for, I think it's going to be a really,

147
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.520
really fun and entertaining film. Uh, Gordon, God is an amazing villain.

148
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:05.060
He's captivating, he's riveting. Ah, he's wildly fascinating.

149
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:08.450
I would say he's probably the most interesting Thor villain that was ever

150
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:11.810
created in Marvel comics. Uh, so hats off to, to Jason,

151
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:15.140
Aaron for the invention of that character. But, uh, at this point, you know,

152
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:16.100
it's really too early to tell,

153
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.820
I just really too early to know exactly what the plot is going to be. Uh,

154
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.010
but you know, as we get closer to the release of the film,

155
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.640
we'll see like bits of news dropping and some spoiler leaks and,

156
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:26.750
and different things like that.

157
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:29.420
And we'll get a better indication of what the movie is going to look like.

158
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.280
But I wouldn't be surprised if the Jane Foster character in the Thor for film

159
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.640
is just a future version of Thor who wheels the hammer after,

160
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:40.130
for whatever reason, Odin's son ends up losing,

161
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.690
it ends up losing the ability to do so,

162
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:44.060
whether he chooses to give it up or he has to,

163
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.060
because he loses the ability to be worthy because we have to believe that

164
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.970
Mueller is going to come back at some point, right? It'll be remade.

165
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.670
It'll be reformed something along those lines. It's going to be gone forever.

166
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.620
Right. It's Thor's signature weapon. You know,

167
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:58.580
it's the one thing he's best known for is like the square looking hammer that he

168
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.370
just beat people up with. Right. So, um, either way,

169
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.530
I think it's going to be awesome. I'm very, very excited for it.

170
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.500
But I want to know your all's thoughts, what I want to hear your all's thoughts.

171
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.650
So post them down in the comment section, what do you think of this theory?

172
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.600
Right. Do you think it's a good one? Do you think it's a bad one?

173
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.950
Can you think of one better?

174
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.770
I'm really excited to see what kind of responses you guys have.

175
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.590
So with that being said, guys, we're going to read this video to an end.

176
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.530
If you are new here to come and explain and make sure you guys are the sub

177
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:23.810
button to become part of the rod core. If you guys enjoyed this video,

178
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.890
make sure you drop a light and I will catch you all later.

179
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.070
Oh, you said peace.

180
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.070
I will catch you all later.
