4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.360
Okay. We're picking back up again.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.970
<v 1>And with a Spider-Man,</v>

6
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:18.110
which is the conclusion of the story where Peter Parker meets miles Morales for

7
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:19.310
the very, very first time, right?

8
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.450
Peter Parker from the main level universe meets the ultimate Spider-Man miles

9
00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:23.901
Morales.

10
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:27.200
And the whole idea behind this is that we pick up with Peter Parker following

11
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.480
his kind of encounter alongside, uh,

12
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.530
miles with Mysterio who used basically use the kind of robot version of himself

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.410
to move into the ultimate universe or to travel to the ultimate universe. Uh,

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.900
Peter Parker is essentially traveled to meet, uh,

15
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.530
the ultimate universes version of Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson.

16
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.140
Now keep in mind the last time they saw Spider-Man,

17
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.140
it was their version of Peter Parker and he died in largely,

18
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:50.720
there was just kind of the grieving process that went into it. Now,

19
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.080
one of the things that we talked about in the early miles Morales comics that we

20
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:58.310
did is that there did come a point when miles took on the vitamin in costume and

21
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:01.520
was met by aunt Mae and Gwen Stacey. And they were kind of like, look,

22
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.330
if you're going to do this,

23
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.630
understand that you're living up to a legacy much bigger than yourself, right?

24
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.390
You don't just simply put on the Spider-Man costume and do your thing.

25
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.180
You're living up to the legacy that my nephew created. Uh,

26
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.550
and you stand for everything he stood for.

27
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.320
So this is not a thing to take lightly, right?

28
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:17.960
So it was kind of initially they were against it, but it's one of these things.

29
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.250
We're just kind of like, okay, you know,

30
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:22.670
we can sort of get on board once they realize the character of miles Morales and

31
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:25.490
what he had to offer. But the problem with this is that when Peter shows up,

32
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.210
he's wearing the original Spider-Man costume. And as soon as aunt Mae sees this,

33
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.140
she gets, right?

34
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.050
Because he basically showed his face and her thought is as some kind of a,

35
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.220
some kind of a joke, right?

36
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.730
When Stacy shows up and starts kicking the crap out of a, at a Peter Parker,

37
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.290
thinking the heat, pulling a stunt to,

38
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.350
and it's not until miles shows up and says, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.050
It's really actually Peter, right? It's not somebody pulling it up,

40
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:47.180
pulling a trick or something like that. And not somebody being a jerk,

41
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.180
I don't really know of a reasonable human being that would show up on the

42
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:51.950
doorstep of a woman.

43
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.340
And like basically two chicks who lost somebody close to them,

44
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.890
dressed as that person. Right. I mean, if somebody were to do that,

45
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.710
I would wholly, like I would stand by and just watch them,

46
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:03.590
get the crap kicked out of them. I'd record it. And then just be like, yeah,

47
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:08.420
man, this guy kind of had a coming like Debbie, my response I'd be like, yeah,

48
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.060
man, like they were kind of a Dick. They sort of had this coming. Right.

49
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.210
Nobody do anything. Let them get their just desserts. But, uh,

50
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.000
this is actually Peter, right? This is actually Peter Parker here.

51
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.330
And when miles comes to his rescue, that's when aunt may end up Gwen,

52
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:23.810
Stacy basically start to listen. Right. And Peter's initial responses like,

53
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.900
like I thought initially I died. I thought something happened. Like,

54
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.150
I didn't really know what was going on, how I ended up here. You know,

55
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:30.860
I've only recently been putting the pieces together.

56
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.010
I never should have come here, but I never should have come here to this place.

57
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.510
You know, I'm sorry I did this to you.

58
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:38.090
And then basically aunt may passes out right now. At that point,

59
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.720
we switch over to the ultimate universe, Tony stark and Nick fury right now,

60
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.480
Nick fury we've talked about before ultimate universe Ironman.

61
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.060
We've never really had a big discussion about one of the big things to

62
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:50.930
understand here is that ultimate iron man when he first showed up was designed

63
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.530
to be a more grounded version of Tony stark from the main Wilder universe.

64
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.890
Right? So not as intelligent because even Tony in the main Marvel universe,

65
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.180
his intelligence, even for the realm of comics borderlines questionable, right?

66
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.580
Like how could a person possibly be that smart?

67
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.200
This version of Tony is really smart,

68
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.620
but he is a version of intelligence we would expect to see here in the real

69
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.101
world, right?

70
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.100
Hence the nature of the ultimate universe kind of reflection of the real world,

71
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:13.000
the way it exists now.

72
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.630
And so he's not really able to pick up or really figure out what Mysterio of

73
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.430
what's what's going on with mysterious character, right?

74
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.640
How to reverse engineer, the circuitry, where the signals coming from, any,

75
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.570
all that kind of stuff.

76
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.660
The reality of this is there's an infinite number of universe is out there,

77
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.961
right?

78
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.380
And Tony just doesn't have the ability to trace a signal back to its origin

79
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.900
point. Now, if this were in the main Marvel universe, the main Marvel,

80
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.820
Tony stark would have figured it out like that, right.

81
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.820
He would've figured it out so fast because it's what the story called for it.

82
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.000
But the idea of the ultimate universe was to write more realistic stories,

83
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.730
right? And really, if you're talking about an infinite number of universes,

84
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.400
there really wouldn't be a way to trace the signal all the way back to its

85
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.031
origin point,

86
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:48.670
because it's not like it's a rope that leaves from the main mobile universe.

87
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.310
And all they have to do is just follow the breadcrumbs to get to its location.

88
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.130
It doesn't really work that way, at least not for anybody here.

89
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.950
And so at the end of the day, Tony doesn't really have any answers here.

90
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:59.590
He's like the only way for me to really get some answers is to talk to that

91
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:02.500
alternate reality version of Spider-Man to talk to Peter Parker is the only way

92
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.500
for me to really figure out what it is that's going on here. Now,

93
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.710
the funny comment he makes is I'm surprised that you let miles Morales run

94
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:11.110
around with Peter Parker. And I figured you would attract them over the head,

95
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.570
throw them into a hole, uh, and, and basically grabbed like the,

96
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:15.790
the main Peter and done the same thing, right? Kind of, you know,

97
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.610
kept miles Morales under wraps so that he wouldn't really have any idea what's

98
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:21.700
going on. And then basically took Peter and, and just kind of locked him up.

99
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.500
But the idea behind this is that fury really feels a bit of regret when it

100
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:30.010
comes to Peter, right? Peter was never properly trained to become a superhero.

101
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.030
He was never properly trained.

102
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:32.950
He wasn't really inducted the way that he was supposed to be.

103
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:36.370
He was just kind of allowed to do his thing. And that led to his eventual death.

104
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.070
And Nick fury felt a lot of responsibility for that.

105
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.900
That's why when you go and you read cataclysm,

106
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.300
but there's a lot of focus put on Nick fury and the guilt.

107
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.450
He feels for the death of Peter Parker because when he could have trained him or

108
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.150
he could have helped him to become a better hero, he didn't instead,

109
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:52.310
it was just kind of him doing his thing. And so with that guilt in mind,

110
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.310
along with promises that he made, it's kind of like,

111
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.110
we're just going to let them work it out together. Right.

112
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.280
Which is actually the right move.

113
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.810
The best move for Nick fury to make is really for Peter on Meg when Stacy to all

114
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:05.110
kind of come to terms with this on their own. And so once our may wakes up,

115
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.840
you basically have Peter like telling stories, you know, two,

116
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:11.260
two miles into Gwen, Stacy, them sharing stories with him, that kind of a thing,

117
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.290
and kind of going back and forth right in Peter's coming to this realization.

118
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.370
There's massive differences between this reality and the one that he's from now,

119
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:21.790
we, as the reader know that one of the funny things that goes on is Gwen,

120
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:24.190
Stacy kind of starts poking and prodding and is like,

121
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.340
is there a version of me in your universe? And Peter's like, yeah,

122
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.100
but she's a little bit older than you are. You know, she's about my age.

123
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.290
And she's like, well, I mean, you know, like, are you dating her?

124
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.630
And Peter's like, I mean, not really, like, I'm,

125
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:37.570
I'm basically dating Mary Jane Watson. Right. Which is what, when Stacy calls.

126
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.730
And then as soon as,

127
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:41.710
as soon as this kind of explanation goes on that Mary Jane is like a supermodel

128
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.290
where she's not in the ultimate universe where she's just like a nerdy girl when

129
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:46.750
it's like, she's a supermodel and all that kind of stuff. Like Wednesdays,

130
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:50.320
he's kind of shocked to find out that like Mary Jane Watson is this hugely

131
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.980
popular world renowned model. And it's kind of like, wow, that's a little crazy.

132
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.770
But when she starts asking, uh, what about me? Right? Like, what am I then?

133
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:00.350
Like, what's going on with me? Peter's like, wait, we should,

134
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.090
we should probably talk about something else.

135
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.140
I don't have the heart to tell you that the green goblin threw you off a bridge.

136
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.140
And I shot my at my wedding at your foot and broke your neck in the process

137
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.810
because I was basically what happened. I don't care what anybody says.

138
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.830
She was not dead.

139
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.840
<v 2>Before vitamin got there. I don't care what anybody says, but.</v>

140
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.460
<v 1>Uh, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of an interesting thing because it's like,</v>

141
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.690
there are parts of his reality.

142
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:22.840
He doesn't really want to divulge because who knows how Gwen Stacy would react.

143
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:23.770
If it was like, well, you're dead.

144
00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:26.500
And I'm the reason why then it's kind of like get out of this house. Right.

145
00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:27.580
You know, I don't want you here,

146
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.240
but it's really kind of new to her to learn a really fascinating for her to

147
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:35.110
learn that there's whole other world and dimensions out there now for her part,

148
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.210
aunt may is a lot more reserved here.

149
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.790
Why she's not nearly as excited as Gwen Stacy is, you know,

150
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:40.780
she's kind of braking,

151
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.720
bracing herself with the idea that it's not actually Peter Parker.

152
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.730
They're just like, well, we don't really know if it's Peter Parker.

153
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.010
We don't really know if it's him. Right. We don't know if that's the case.

154
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.920
It could be somebody else pretending to be him now. And in fact,

155
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:53.920
like it really is him. We know that miles Morales believes that Gwen,

156
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:57.430
Stacy believes that, but aunt Mae's doing this because in her heart of hearts,

157
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.210
if she gives into this and then it turns out to be false, she'd lose it. Right?

158
00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:04.210
Like it would just be the most crushing experience because for her,

159
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.270
when she kind of asked Peter, you know, what led you to be at, to,

160
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:08.350
to become this person, right?

161
00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:10.660
When he kind of starts talking to her about like uncle Ben, uncle,

162
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:12.040
Ben's the reason why he does this,

163
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.130
that uncle Ben of course is dead and his reality. But the fact that,

164
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:18.490
that he could have saved uncle Ben and he didn't is the reason why he became a

165
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.680
superhero, the way that he did and the idea that he could,

166
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.080
he could basically help other people. And in a lot of ways,

167
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.640
a tone for his past mistake,

168
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.120
he basically runs off the statement with great power. And then she finishes.

169
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:31.690
It comes great responsibility. Now it should be must come. Great responsibility.

170
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.690
The fact that this is a lesson that Peter was taught by uncle Ben tells,

171
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:37.660
automate everything. She needs to know that it really is him.

172
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.420
And that's where she kind of gives herself over incest. We thought like,

173
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.380
we lost you. Right. We lost you. And we didn't even get to say goodbye.

174
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.090
And that's the important thing here. Right?

175
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.950
That's the important thing to understand.

176
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.520
That's why aunt Mae kept herself reserved in this part. Right.

177
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:53.290
Because if she had said like, okay, yeah,

178
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:55.390
you're probably Peter and let her whole self believe it.

179
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.180
And then it turned out to just be some alternate reality version of Peter who

180
00:07:58.181 --> 00:08:00.310
was evil or something like that. But it wasn't like the,

181
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:02.740
this alternate reality counterpart to the one that she knew what,

182
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:07.080
just to say a good guy who fights the good fight and does what heroes do then it

183
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.790
would have broken her in her entirety, right? Like the, the,

184
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.500
the inability of her to say goodbye,

185
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.470
the chances she had did the fact that she never got to tell here that she was

186
00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:17.860
proud of him, that she loved him, but to never say, never be able to say,

187
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.610
I'm sorry, or any of that stuff, right. To basically like confessor or to,

188
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.850
to kind of get to say her last goodbyes to him is something that's always

189
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:28.240
haunted her having Peter here, this alternate reality version of Peter,

190
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.670
even though she knows us, not her actual nephew,

191
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.640
she knows is not the Peter Parker from the ultimate universe,

192
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.500
gives her a chance to effectively say goodbye, right. To say her goodbyes and,

193
00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:38.140
and, you know,

194
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.220
indirectly say it to Peter Parker from ultimate universe to give her closure is

195
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.910
basically what this does. Something that she's never had this entire time.

196
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.940
And so Mazda, Miralis looking out the window realizes, ah, okay,

197
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.570
shields on their way we need to go. Right? Because shield is a lot more seedy.

198
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.970
And the ultimate universal, they are in the main Marvel universe,

199
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.510
the main Marvel universe, they're still kind of jerks, but like,

200
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.940
they're more inclined to work with you than against you and the ultimate

201
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:02.910
universe. They're like a, like a, like a police force almost. Right. I mean,

202
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:05.610
not specifically, but in terms of like how they function, right?

203
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.930
Like they do their thing. And all,

204
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:09.810
there are just people who stand in the way is basically all that it is.

205
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.140
But of course, Peter ends up saying goodbye to, uh, to everybody here.

206
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.270
And then of course he ends up getting in the car with, uh,

207
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.650
Nick fury miles Morales.

208
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.630
And it's kind of a funny thing because Nick fury asks like,

209
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.670
is there a Nick fury where you come from? And he's like, yeah,

210
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.920
but he's kind of a white guy. And then like, Nick fury is like,

211
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:27.420
sorry to hear that, man. We're just kind of a funny thing. But again,

212
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.960
it gives me the closure she needs. And that's why when the story came out,

213
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:31.710
it was so huge.

214
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.710
It was wrapping up all these plot threats by all these little things that have

215
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:37.590
been left hanging. And the reality is that if anybody, but Brian,

216
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:40.650
Michael Bendis had taken this over, we probably would have never seen this.

217
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.140
Right. The Bendis started off with a, with the ultimate Spiderman.

218
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:44.190
He originally created it.

219
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.220
It makes sense that he would basically end it here and kind of continue things

220
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.190
on with miles. And that's why Spider-Man is so important.

221
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.910
It's one part wrapping up plot threads that Bendis never got to wrap up after

222
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.910
the death of Peter Parker and the ultimate universe and the cataclysm story.

223
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.150
And it was a way to kind of officially transition into the miles and we'll find

224
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:02.820
more, find out more why that's the case when we get,

225
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.910
once we get to the end of this. But when he, when he really meets with,

226
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.640
you know, Tony star, he's coming, okay. So there's a few differences here.

227
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.940
Like one, the Tony stark in my universe stopped drinking a while ago,

228
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.810
which Nick fury loves. And too, it's obvious this guy is not as smart.

229
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.120
And so with, with Tony kind of being like, look like,

230
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.780
I need to know where his home is. I need to know where your universe is. Uh,

231
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.960
when Peter starts to point them in that direction, then it turns into, okay,

232
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.690
then we can, at the very least figure out how to get you back. Right.

233
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:30.300
We can figure, you know, we can figure out how to reverse engineer this stuff.

234
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.170
Now make no mistake.

235
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.570
Tony starts not doing this out of the goodness of his heart.

236
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.200
Tony starts doing this one part because he was directed by Nick fury, but two,

237
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.560
because he can get something out of it, right? I mean, this is, uh,

238
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.440
a level of technology that Tony just doesn't have access to being able to attain

239
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:46.710
this technology and use it for his own ends. It's a huge benefit, right?

240
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:49.080
It's something that he desperately wants here. And so once,

241
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.260
once they're basically looking at the broadcast that Mr has been putting out,

242
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.970
you know, over the internet, you know, all day long.

243
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:55.290
And for how many days he's been here,

244
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.950
miles picks up on the fact that one of these buildings is actually in Brooklyn,

245
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.470
right? He's like one of these villages in Brooklyn, I'm familiar with it.

246
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.410
And so they know exactly where it is Mysterio is operating out of,

247
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.970
or they know his base of operations.

248
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.080
Once they locate that Nick fury calls in everyone. And when I say everyone,

249
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:14.250
I mean an entire shield strike team alongside Spiderman and alongside the

250
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.230
ultimate four. But with that being said, guys,
