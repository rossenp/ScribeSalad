<v 1>And yeah, let's begin.</v>

5
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.670
What's going on.

6
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.740
<v 0>Guys? This is Robin.</v>

7
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.790
We are picking back up again with the conclusion of Spider-Man. Yes, we are.

8
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:19.040
We are wrapping up the Spiderman event, uh,

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.920
and this is probably the single most important part of the story.

10
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.960
Not necessarily because of what's happened so far,

11
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.210
but because of the future of miles Morales.

12
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.850
So what we end up doing here is we initially pick up with Mysterio.

13
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.320
Mysterio is suffering from the same problem that every supervillain suffers from

14
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.200
stupidity. So the idea behind this with Mysteria.

15
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.140
So the idea behind this with Mysterio is that he comes to the realization that

16
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:46.250
he actually unintentionally defeated Spiderman that with Spiderman being whisked

17
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:49.310
off into this other dimension, where Peter Parker in that reality is dead,

18
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.440
that it leaves no Spiderman.

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.660
And this universe right in the main Marvel universe,

20
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.160
there is no Peter Parker here, right?

21
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.170
He's often the ultimate universe somewhere.

22
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.320
And it was something that Mysterio had not really thought of before.

23
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.810
And now he realizes it like, man, dude, okay.

24
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.330
Like I actually defeated Spiderman, but then the question becomes,

25
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.300
why isn't it enough? Right? Like, why is it not enough? He's like,

26
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.700
I have to see it. Right. I have to see him suffer and die.

27
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.970
I'll just take a peak for myself. Just for one moment. Now this is Brian,

28
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.060
Michael Bendis being Brian, Michael Bendis. If it were me writing this story,

29
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.390
it would be like, Oh man, dude, on one, cool. The end. And that would be it.

30
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.631
Right.

31
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:23.780
It would be Mysterio realizing he basically got the upper hand on Peter Parker

32
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.460
and there's no,

33
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.160
no more Spider-Man here such as it is then is one of the Telus stories. And so,

34
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.580
so basically mysterial comes to the realization that he wants to actually see

35
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.740
Spiderman, suffer and die. And so he reopened,

36
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:37.670
he basically reactivates the portal and takes a peek inside only for webbing to

37
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:41.960
come flying out and eviction basically attach itself to him.

38
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.550
And then of course you have Peter Parker,

39
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:46.520
you have miles Morales and the Ultimate's team who's there like the ultimate

40
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.310
Avengers who were all there. And it's kind of like, well, crap, right? Like,

41
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.270
well, like that's basically yet, right? Like, okay. I mean,

42
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.060
who could have possibly seen that coming? The cool thing about this though,

43
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.100
is that one thing to understand what the stereo is.

44
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280
He's usually always got an ACE up his sleeve and that's one of the things that

45
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:04.040
makes him so dangerous. Right? And so where you have Nick fury,

46
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.350
you've got the rest of the guys who were kind of like cool. The day saved.

47
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:06.890
Keep in mind,

48
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.680
they're not used to the kind of villains you have in the main Marvel universe

49
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.950
were somehow they always have some kind of an escape plan or something like

50
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:13.130
that.

51
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.610
You remember the main mobile universe is a lot less realistic than the ultimate

52
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:17.331
universe was.

53
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:21.170
And so Mysterio immediately types away and just starts releasing a whole host of

54
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:24.230
these chemicals and sets off an explosion. And when that happens,

55
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.590
basically everybody here. So like I eman Nick fury miles, Morales,

56
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.100
all these various guys are met by what are essentially their worst nightmares.

57
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.130
Why there's literally what they're exposed to using the power of Mysterio.

58
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.100
He exposes all of them to their worst nightmares, right?

59
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.070
So you've got all the Ultimate's who were dead at the hands of Tony stark,

60
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.980
which of course is definitely an illusion to what we saw in the Marvel cinematic

61
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:45.410
universe. You've got Nick fury, who's watching the world on fire,

62
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:48.470
watching the world burn green goblin has killed aunt Mae and the in,

63
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.120
in front of a, I'm sorry, really Dr.

64
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:52.910
Octopus and green goblin have killed on may in front of Spider-Man.

65
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.390
And then you've got the Prowler who killed miles, Miralis mother and father.

66
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.350
And so because of that,

67
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.870
where everybody else is kind of succumbing this Myles sort of succumbs to it a

68
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:04.390
little bit, but then manages to get the upper hand on it,

69
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.460
even if only for a moment. And when that happens,

70
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.940
he realizes Mysterio is making a break for the portal and he tackles mysterious.

71
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.520
Now by all standards of measurement, miles should have,

72
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.730
should have been 100% incapacitated here. And again,

73
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.760
that's kind of the critique of Bendis right. Ben, this is just, well, of course,

74
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.460
miles while it has to be on top. He's the guy that I'm writing right now.

75
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.310
He's the main Spider-Man we can't have him lose. Right. So it's kinda like,

76
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.040
okay, you know, it's sort of, Hey, he's going to go with it in this story,

77
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.480
right. It's just kind of the way that Bendis does it,

78
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.890
but where you end up having the stereo,

79
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.960
who of course uses his powers on miles yet again,

80
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.900
he almost gets the upper hand miles Dodge,

81
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.720
the attack goes invisible and the mysterial trying to figure out what happens,

82
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.300
ends up being attacked by miles. Again. Now, again, this is kind of,

83
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.660
Bendis basically saying like, this is how capable Myles is.

84
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.710
Now the reality of this is that while this was kind of, I wouldn't say far Fest,

85
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.320
but kind of like what in the world's going on here, you know, back in the day,

86
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.350
in this day and age, it's common practice. And it kind of makes sense.

87
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.770
I think that with this story and,

88
00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:57.520
and miles being able to overcome mysterious so fast,

89
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:59.770
despite mysterious abilities was really more of just,

90
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.190
Bendis wanting to tell the story as opposed to just kind of letting it play out

91
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.510
organically. In reality,

92
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.330
having somebody like Mysterio was probably not the best bet.

93
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.980
It probably should have been somebody more like Dr.

94
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.730
Octopus because mysterious powers are not limited to just some kind of tentacles

95
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.790
attached to his back, that that go after you, but he messes with your mind,

96
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:16.780
he messes with your head.

97
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.750
And so there isn't really a whole lot of reason to believe that miles would

98
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.300
somehow be able to overcome this so quickly. Right?

99
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.090
If you're trying to maintain that kind of comic book lore that we're used to,

100
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.370
and kind of maintain consistency thin, you know,

101
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.570
it's something you would kind of expect,

102
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.810
but with Peter Parker able to overcome it as well, alongside miles,

103
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.380
they take up material pretty quickly, right? He's defeated pretty fast.

104
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.250
And so from that point,

105
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.580
what they ended up doing is actually keeping Mysterio inside the ultimate

106
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:40.060
universe.

107
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.990
And the reason why is because mysterial now knows that Peter Parker Spider-Man

108
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.830
and so it kind of creates this situation where Peter's like, okay, cool. Yeah,

109
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.220
man, hold on to them. I appreciate it guys. Thanks for looking out.

110
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.440
It's kind of a shady thing to do,

111
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:56.410
but this is really the most important moment that comes out of this, right?

112
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.690
Which is why we kind of more or less ham-fisted our way through this.

113
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.840
There's a point where Peter and miles are talking and Peter basically,

114
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:05.670
thanks him for keeping the legacy of Spiderman going. And when miles asked him,

115
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:08.830
like, does that mean that I have your blessing? Peter's like, absolutely.

116
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.070
This was Brian, Michael, Bendis giving a big middle finger to the naysayers.

117
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.560
And we talked about that before that when miles first showed up,

118
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.260
there were a lot of people who were really pissy about the fact that Peter

119
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.450
Parker in the alternate universe had been killed and they wanted,

120
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.000
they didn't want miles. They wanted Peter Parker. The response has been,

121
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.900
this is you already have Peter Parker. You've had him for like 50 years, right?

122
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.780
You've had Peter Parker for a long, long time. You need to get over yourselves,

123
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:30.490
right? It's time for a new Spiderman.

124
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.640
It's time to kind of continue on this story, focusing on somebody else.

125
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.910
We can't do that in the main Marvel universe because Peter Parker is etched in

126
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:39.790
stone, forevermore, the Spiderman in the main Marvel universe.

127
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:42.220
We can't change that. Marvel editorial, well, let me change it.

128
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:44.800
And even if I wanted to, it'd be a terrible idea to do it anyway.

129
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.710
But in the ultimate universe, I created this character. Bendis giveth.

130
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.690
Bendis take it away, take it away. And that's kind of,

131
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.010
that's kind of a stance on that.

132
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.800
And so when you had a lot of people who were giving him flack and really

133
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.880
complaining a lot on the various forum boards and social media,

134
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.710
different things like that,

135
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.490
about miles Morales taking over the role of Spiderman in the ultimate universe.

136
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.550
This was really been to saying, no, he's not going anywhere, right.

137
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.240
If what you expected me to do was to basically give in acquiesce and admit,

138
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:09.910
defeat and say, Hey, you know, you,

139
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.350
you 50 comic book fans who sound like 5 million.

140
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.000
Obviously you guys don't like miles miles.

141
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.220
So let me just get rid of him and bring back Peter Parker.

142
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.130
If that's what you were expecting, then I'm sorry, you're gravely mistaken.

143
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.660
That's not what's going to happen.

144
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.300
And so we ended up just getting miles more Alice going forward.

145
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.890
And so as one of these things, where with,

146
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.430
with miles kind of getting the official blessing of Peter Parker that you have

147
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.980
this moment where Nick fury kind of pulls him aside and says,

148
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.650
you got his blessing, man, like you earned a kid, right?

149
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.070
If that's vitamin D real true, Spider-Man gives you his blessing,

150
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.860
then you're good. Right. Just go forward and do your superhero thing.

151
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.530
So it's really not anymore. Nick fury kind of questioning miles anymore,

152
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:44.390
kind of looking at him with a skewed eye or,

153
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.210
or really the only I can look at them at a look at them with, and just kinda,

154
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:48.560
you know, his, his one, his one good.

155
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.840
I kind of look at him with a skewed eye and then just kind of being like,

156
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.320
is he really going to be a good Spiderman at this point? You know,

157
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:57.080
he kind of goes forward with a whole new level of confidence that he didn't

158
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:57.920
really have before.

159
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.010
And that's kind of a cool thing because what you do is you switch over to Peter

160
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.830
Parker himself back home, right back in his own apartment. He's like miles,

161
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.030
Morales, miles Morales.

162
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.930
I wonder if we have a miles Morales in the main Marvel universe and then it ends

163
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:13.670
now of course we know as far as I'm aware, that's not true in, in Marvel comics.

164
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:15.320
Right. This story was told like eight years ago.

165
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.900
So we noticed not really true at the time this was written.

166
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.110
Everybody wanted to know if it was true or not. It was like the biggest,

167
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.120
biggest cliffhanger of like a decade. Right? Like I wonder if it's,

168
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.960
I wonder if they really do have a miles routes in the main Marvel universe and

169
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.180
it's like, I wonder what's going to happen with that. Right. It's kind of crazy,

170
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:32.300
but it is a cool story. Let me let you guys think down in the comment section.
