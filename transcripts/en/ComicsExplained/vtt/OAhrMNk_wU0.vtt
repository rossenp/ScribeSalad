4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.710
All right, what's going on.

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.390
<v 1>Guys. This is Rob and we are picking back up again with dark Knights and metal,</v>

6
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.260
but this time we're covering the Lobo one-shot and anybody who knows anything

7
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:22.010
about DC comics knows that Lobo is the most 1990s character ever.

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.380
And this story, I'm not even gonna lie to you guys.

9
00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:28.550
This story is a descent into absolute madness.

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.900
This initially picks up in a bar, right? Just kind of six months ago,

11
00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.370
right before seemingly all this,

12
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:37.040
this where at least when this dark nights metal stuff kind of kicked off. Right?

13
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:40.850
So, uh, following perpetuates takeover is basically when this happens. And, uh,

14
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200
we initially picked up with Lobel in this part.

15
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.930
And of course getting off at the bartender because the bartender's not getting

16
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.780
them any more drinks only for us to find out the reason why the bartender can't

17
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.600
get him more drinks is because he ripped off the bartender's arms and beat

18
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.070
everybody in the bar to death with them.

19
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.560
And so that's why the bartender can't get him any drinks. So

20
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.940
the other part of that is that he was here originally for the bounty,

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
but he killed the guy in the bar before anybody could tell him,

22
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.200
or before you could tell Lobo who he actually was,

23
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.080
or him basically beat everybody to death before they could tell him who he was.

24
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:08.900
So Lobo basically went into a rage, which is kind of normal, right?

25
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.540
That's what Lobo does, right? When you're basically a parody of Wolverine,

26
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.390
that's essentially what you do. You just go into to arbitrary Rangers,

27
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.430
for reasons that don't really make any sense. Cause you know,

28
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.230
that's what will rain does? And he grabs the body.

29
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.320
And of course he ends up being kind of yanked away. Now, when he janked away,

30
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:25.520
he's basically pulled by what looks like a version of Lobo, right?

31
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.320
Like this just huge gaudy version of Lobo. This guy is technically he's.

32
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:34.280
He's like the, the, what is it? The Batman who frags that's a stupid name.

33
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.890
Would you call him bat Lobo? Well, that's a much better name, right?

34
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:39.530
So like we're gonna call them bat Lobo. Like Batman becomes Lobo.

35
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.610
That's basically what we're going to call him.

36
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.440
But essentially it's one of the craziest things.

37
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:44.360
Because as soon as Lobo goes to punch this guy,

38
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.970
he immediately gets the upper hand, takes Lobo down. And that's it.

39
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.850
Now one thing to understand about this guy about Lobo's character,

40
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.830
this is a guy that can go toe to toe with Superman.

41
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.170
This guy is not someone to be scoffed at, right?

42
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:55.940
He's not some kind of small time guy.

43
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.870
The other thing about this is that Batman becoming Lobo basically happened in a

44
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:00.860
dark dark universe,

45
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:04.280
somewhere in the dark multiverse where Bruce Wayne injected himself with Barney

46
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:04.940
and DNA.

47
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.450
And it essentially gave him all the strength and the healing factor of Lobo

48
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.570
combined with all the skills and the fighting powers of Batman.

49
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.050
So like literally he's able to take on Lobo quite readily, right? I mean,

50
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.140
just able to, to, to get the upper hand on this guy quick, fast,

51
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.260
and in a hurry and the fights, not much of a big, long drawn out fight.

52
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.870
One of the other things that happens is that where he's, he's, uh,

53
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.763
he's fighting off against,

54
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.710
but we end up finding out that Lobo is actually playing possum, right?

55
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.750
He's just kind of faking how weak he is.

56
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.810
And that's one of the crazy things that goes on here is because in this Batman

57
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.700
who frags right, this bat Lobo's reality,

58
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.570
we don't really know if Lobo in the traditional sense ever actually existed.

59
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.120
Right. It's just his RNA and DNA. We don't really know if that's the case.

60
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.820
I mean, presumably it is right because he got the DNA from somewhere,

61
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.940
but Lobo actually ends up grabbing his own, you know,

62
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.650
battering chain thing and throws it into the, in his stomach.

63
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.220
And then suddenly Lobo's, uh, LinkedIn, uh, yanked away get again, right.

64
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:54.050
He snatched away again. And when that happens,

65
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.330
of course he arrives in front of Lex Luther.

66
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:58.820
Now this is kind of explains on the backend.

67
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.960
How is that during the events of dark nights metals?

68
00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:04.510
So basically the first four issues that we've covered so far wide as it Lobo's

69
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.480
on some kind of a special quest, we didn't really know what was going on. Right.

70
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.080
We just kind of got these cutaways where we we'd show Lobo just doing a thing.

71
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.670
And we wouldn't really get a whole lot of explanation.

72
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.520
We knew that he was communicating with Lex Luther and whatever's his,

73
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.700
whatever his mission was had to do with somebody, Lex Luther sent him for it,

74
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.500
but we didn't really know anything besides that bright.

75
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.990
So it was cool for us to get this kind of explanation here. Well,

76
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:27.190
the reality is that Lobo has been sent on a mission by Lex Luther to basically

77
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.650
capture what's called death metal and death metal.

78
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:33.310
This actual material here is essentially a material that can rewrite all of

79
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:33.910
reality.

80
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.240
But this is one of the issues that I'm sort of having with with dark nights,

81
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:40.510
metal, dark nights, metal is a fun story. It's a good event,

82
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.110
but it kind of feels like things are just being invented out of thin air for the

83
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:47.350
sake of telling a story, right. Just kind of being invented on the fly, right?

84
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.390
Just like moment, like this is not really planned out.

85
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.120
It's just kind of just things being, being invented out of nowhere.

86
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.970
Like a lot of this stuff just kind of feels too convenient if that makes any

87
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.910
sense. But the other part of this is that it is called death metal, right?

88
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:00.910
So it makes sense that there would be some kind of material out there called

89
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:04.840
death metal that would have the power to rewrite and recreate all of reality as

90
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.630
the wielders sees fit. Right. To basically recreate it. All right.

91
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:08.560
And then that's, what's kind of nuts.

92
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.990
Here is something that you don't usually see in DC comics,

93
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.490
which I think is what's really kind of getting to me,

94
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.470
that's something that you see in Marvel all the time, right?

95
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:17.980
The infinity infinity gauntlet, the cosmic cube, the cosmic regulator,

96
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.830
you see it all the time when like somebody achieves a level of power where they

97
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:24.130
have the ability to recreate all of reality on a whim, right? I mean the,

98
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.320
and the not even just the universe, the whole multi-verse,

99
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.470
sometimes I'm not really used to seeing that in DC comics,

100
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.410
somebody attaining an artifact that makes them so incredibly powerful.

101
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.010
They can control and manipulate the entirety of the multi-verse itself. Now,

102
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:36.340
again,

103
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.970
I'm not nearly as well versed in DC comics as I am in Marvel when it comes to

104
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.520
like a lot of the more obscure nitty gritty things,

105
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:44.560
stuff like that because outside of the infinity gauntlet,

106
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.960
if I walk up to the average person on the street and I say, Hey,

107
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.650
what's the casket of ancient winters or what is the heart of the universe?

108
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.570
They're not going to be able to give me an answer because they're not going to

109
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:55.180
know whether this is not something that they're familiar with. And so, um,

110
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.350
you know, with, with BC,

111
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.190
I'm not nearly as well versed in their intricate artifacts as I am with Marvel,

112
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.240
but I'm not aware of anything that's not powerful in DC. So it feels wholly new.

113
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.010
But in order to go on this mission, Lobo is like,

114
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.330
I need some kind of transportation.

115
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.880
And that's when one is basically given to them by Lex Luther, right?

116
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:11.080
Like his space bike as though,

117
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.260
as soon as he gets his baseball IQ basically takes off only for us to find out

118
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.350
that, uh, that the Batman, I guess, the, the Batman who frogs right,

119
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.660
is still very much awake and is basically on the,

120
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.260
on the mission or going on the mission of tracking down Lobo. Now,

121
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.590
at this point, we switch over to us technically the second part,

122
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.220
and the reason why this matters is because this Lobo comic is not written by one

123
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.890
person. So you've got Frank Cherry, who's writing this first part.

124
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.800
You've got Becky Cloonan who writes the last part or the second part.

125
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.720
And then you've got Sam Humphreys who writes the third part,

126
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.000
but neither one of these parts are exceedingly long, right?

127
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:43.660
Instead they're maybe nine or 10 pages each. And so we switch over to a,

128
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.870
to the second part here and we've got Lobo on black Hawk Island out in the

129
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:49.950
middle of nowhere. If you guys recall Blackhawk Island is where the,

130
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.260
the original dark nights metal event all kind of kicked off in terms of the

131
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:55.480
realization that like everything's sort of popping off.

132
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:57.920
So it's kind of cool to see us return this, to know your place,

133
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.580
but in the middle of that Lobo ends up facing off against what looks, I mean,

134
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:04.490
technically it's called black Monday, but it's like Solomon Grundy, Batman.

135
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.840
So in any event,

136
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.020
one of the things I kind of keep in mind when it comes to Lobo is that he is

137
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.200
kind of an idiot and he's easy to manipulate in a lot of different ways.

138
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.910
And that's one of the things that Lobo says, right?

139
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.280
Lobel kind of builds on him and it's just kind of like, you know,

140
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:19.280
you're basically a goof, right? I mean, you're an evil Batman, right?

141
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:21.620
So you're not necessarily weak, but like, think about it, right?

142
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:24.560
They put you on this Island by yourself to keep an eye out for anybody who

143
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:25.280
stumbles along,

144
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.550
they put you here because nobody likes you and you don't have any friends.

145
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.350
Nobody wants to be your friend. And in fact,

146
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:34.190
Lobo almost kind of starts befriending Solomon Grundy when he's like,

147
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.140
we're actually not that different. You and I, right?

148
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.550
Like I don't really have any friends. Now,

149
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.250
the reason why Lobo has no friends is because he killed everybody on his home.

150
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.380
Planet, killed all the killers, his entire race, and, uh,

151
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.530
is basically a bounty Hunter. Who's just kind of a Dick, nonetheless, you know,

152
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.300
that's kind of why he doesn't have any friends. Uh,

153
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.630
just something to keep in mind, guys, if you want friends, don't be a Dick.

154
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.770
Nobody wants to be friends with a Dick. Unless, well, there is that one guy,

155
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.730
every circle of friends has that one guy who is kind of a Dick, but he's ours,

156
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.870
right. He's our friend, but he's allowed to be that be that guy because he's,

157
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.780
he's our friend. Right. And how to get away with murder. It's Asher that,

158
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:08.840
guy's hilarious. I love that show. Uh, I'm a,

159
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.950
why sort started talking about that in any event, getting back on track,

160
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.710
you wind up having Lobo and you end up having, you know, Solomon Grundy,

161
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:18.260
or at least Solomon Grundy kind of defeated. And then from there, uh,

162
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.760
he ends up traveling through this,

163
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:22.880
this plays with all these different artifacts and ends up finding a box to

164
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.220
supposed to contain the death metal. Right. And he's like, man,

165
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:27.770
like I can't just simply be lying around like this, you know? And he's like,

166
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.161
okay.

167
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.060
So like when he finds it is simply not there and that's what Hawk man shows up.

168
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.311
He's like,

169
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:33.920
you really don't think that I would have taken this artifact that had the

170
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:37.430
ability to rewrite all of reality and just left it sitting in a room somewhere.

171
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.010
Right? I mean, no, it doesn't work that way.

172
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.960
It was a terrible idea to do that. Instead he had various notebooks,

173
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:46.730
all the notes that he taken since the Dawn of time.

174
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:50.120
If you guys remember the adventures of Carter hall from dark nights, metal,

175
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.850
when he was thrust back to the very beginning of time and basically started

176
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.260
writing through all these different,

177
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.380
these different notes and everything that he knew about the events of the metal

178
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.243
and all that kind of stuff.

179
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.280
He'd been basically documenting everything that he knew about death metal as

180
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.920
well. And then in turn, all those different notebooks were stolen.

181
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.700
But what he did is he managed to hide the, uh, the death metal itself. Right.

182
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:10.760
He managed to keep it hidden away in a place where nobody would be able to find

183
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:14.570
it except for Carter hall himself. And so when he's talking to Lobo, initially,

184
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:17.240
he doesn't want to hand it over. Right. He doesn't want to give it to Lobo,

185
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.940
but Luvo actually makes this really, really cool.

186
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.350
There's this really cool argument here.

187
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.340
What he basically says is that he's not really here because he's tempted by the

188
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:28.460
power of death metal and he wants to use it for his own ends.

189
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.780
That's not why he's looking to attain it.

190
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.090
He's looking to attain it because it's a mission he was sent on. Right.

191
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:34.580
He's just doing it for the bounty. And that's kind of an interesting thing.

192
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.380
One of the funny things about Lobo is that he's not really a guy who focuses on

193
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.160
trying to attain absolute power. Right. He just cares about the cash, right.

194
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:46.190
Cash money, right. Moolah, cheddar. That's all he really cares about. Right.

195
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:49.370
Just, just, just cheese. That's all he cares about is just getting cheese.

196
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.960
And a lot of people use that phrase anymore.

197
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.800
What phrase do you guys use in relation to like money, right. Like stacks.

198
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.690
Right. I don't know what, what phrase you guys use anymore.

199
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.720
Mariah says it's called stacking your coins. Is that true? Cause if it is,

200
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:04.050
it's like the least cool thing ever, right? Like, yeah man. Yeah.

201
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.650
I'm stuck in them coins. That doesn't sound remotely cool. Nonetheless,

202
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.030
right in the middle of this whole thing,

203
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.920
because of the fact that Hawk man is kind of like, okay,

204
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.840
so like he doesn't want anyone to use it for absolute power.

205
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.970
Maybe a Lobo really is the best person to put it, you know,

206
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.030
put this in the hands of he's exceedingly strong, he's got a healing factor.

207
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.590
He's not easily defeated. Right.

208
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.830
So maybe he really is the best choice because he's essentially Superman.

209
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.440
Who's also like a terrible human being or a terrible,

210
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.300
a terrible being out there. But at the same time,

211
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.040
doesn't want to use it for absolute power. Right.

212
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:31.230
He's just going to hand it over to whoever sent him on this mission,

213
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:33.090
which is probably for a good cause. I don't know. I mean,

214
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:34.350
I guess Hakman's kind of assuming,

215
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.670
but in the middle of all that they're suddenly met by the return of bat Lobo.

216
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.030
Who's,

217
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.860
who's flying this amazing looking bat wing and just raining down to hell fire

218
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:47.580
on this place. Now a portal also ends up opening that that Hawkman created,

219
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.230
but he doesn't really know where it goes to.

220
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.810
And so instead where he tells hoc where he tells Lobo, go through,

221
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.120
they're all hold them off, Lobo, snatches up and says, Nope,

222
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:56.550
you're coming with me. And when they pass through the portal,

223
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.220
the end up inside Jim ward. Right. And so from there,

224
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.540
the Lobo ends up basically using this, this device to kind of recreate reality,

225
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:06.030
right. Or, or at least seemingly recreate reality.

226
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:09.480
We're not really given a full on explanation here because somehow or another,

227
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.070
we basically ended up transitioning from Jim world into, uh, into this, this,

228
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.083
you know, Lobo land.

229
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.110
And the only real kind of transition that we get here is when Lobo kind of opens

230
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:21.540
the box and it says like, this is the part I've been waiting for. Right.

231
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:24.960
So seemingly he basically created like this whole dimension where everybody

232
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:28.080
seems to basically be a version of Lobo, right? Like you've got like a Lobos,

233
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.300
a Superman story, you've got a Lobo Batman story.

234
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.000
You got a Lobo wonder woman's story. But in the middle of all that,

235
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.620
while he's kind of doing all this stuff,

236
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.740
this suddenly he's met by the arrival of brainiac and Brittany EG of course,

237
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:41.850
managed to escape the confines of, uh, of Perpetua and justice league number 56.

238
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.200
I don't know if anybody read that, honestly,

239
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:44.430
we don't really need you to understand it.

240
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:45.720
We can just say brainiac was locked away.

241
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:48.510
At some point he basically ended up escaping what Propecia was thrown was

242
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.490
destroyed, done. Right. That's really all you need to know,

243
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.780
but he's essentially here for the purpose of trying to get a Lobo to hand the

244
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:59.070
device over to over to him. And the idea is that if Lex Luther, you know, Alexa,

245
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.900
they were basically told him that if Lex ever,

246
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.830
ever ended up going missing to ensure that Lobo handed over the device to

247
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.180
brainiac right now, this is suspicious at best or as Mariah. Uh, Mario says,

248
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.690
this is sus I am, I'm getting terribly off topic. Gordon's going to have,

249
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.050
Gordon is going to have a job sorting all this stuff out,

250
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.480
trying to figure out what stays and what goes. But, uh, in any event, what,

251
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.890
what Lobo actually ends up doing is kind of warping reality to a degree.

252
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.180
Now here's the funny thing about this.

253
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.520
This is very reminiscent of the old captain Britain story.

254
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:27.360
When he first encountered,

255
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:30.390
imagine Jasper's or really the second time they fought when he fought Jim

256
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.120
Jasper's from the main Marvel universe where he kept snapping his fingers.

257
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.330
And all of reality just kept changing on a whim, like in the blink of an eye.

258
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.670
Reality just kept changing every single time he snapped,

259
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:42.210
it was something different. And, uh, Kevin Britton was just wildly outclassed,

260
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.560
right? It was kind of cool, which is,

261
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:46.350
I'm hoping we see something like that during the tennis swords event from

262
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.750
Marvel. But, um, he basically kind of ends up, you know,

263
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:52.170
basically poking fun at brainiac makes them look like, uh, Mrs. Tibbs, right?

264
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:55.210
His, uh, his miss, his fourth grade teacher, but just kind of goofing off,

265
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.451
right.

266
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:58.720
And making brainiac look like a bit of a buffoon and not really taking any of

267
00:11:58.721 --> 00:11:59.800
this stuff seriously.

268
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.100
But that's when brainiac actually kind of takes a break away from the character

269
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:06.340
that we're normally used to and says, look like Lobo, you have to pay attention,

270
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:09.100
right? You are literally a survivor. The last of your kind,

271
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.420
the toughest best ditch in the universe, in your jargon, you've survived alone.

272
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.280
The odds are beyond the bounds of viability, but you beat them by being selfish.

273
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.780
And then you ask this crazy question, like,

274
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.570
what's the difference between jam and jelly and between yeah.

275
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:25.240
Between jelly and jam. He's like the sugar content. He's like, Ron,

276
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.040
I can't jelly this gun up. You're exhausted.

277
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.010
But he basically like besieged him and he says, look,

278
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.270
this is going to be the biggest test of your survival skills that you are going

279
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:38.830
to have to be selfish. Your selfishness is your survival. So be selfish with us,

280
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:40.630
right? Like give me the death metal.

281
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.700
It's the only way that we can possibly live.

282
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.700
And so what ends up happening is you end up having in the middle of this kind of

283
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:49.720
discussion that suddenly Batman logo pops back up again and basically starts

284
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:51.790
going on the, going on the offense against Lobo.

285
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.390
This is 1990s commerce guys at this feels chaotic and insane.

286
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.110
This was comics in the 1990s, almost universally across the board.

287
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.800
It was like every 15 year old, every 15 year old bedroom. Right. Just a chaotic,

288
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:05.590
disorganized mess. That's basically what it was. Right.

289
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.090
Let's basically how this, this whole thing was.

290
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.890
And so because of that with bat Lobo,

291
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:11.110
kind of getting the upper hand to a degree logo, of course,

292
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:14.410
having the ability to control this reality basically ends up grabbing bat Lobo

293
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:17.680
and just kind of sticking it back down basically into, into Lobo land, right?

294
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:20.050
Like, like get a blast global land in your face. He's like,

295
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:22.990
and you go and basically like kind of shoves him in there and this little pocket

296
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:25.180
dimension and kind of keeps the guy locked away right now.

297
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:28.510
Presumably he can escape at some future point in time. But of course, you know,

298
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:32.020
Lobo ends up restoring brainiac back to his normal self and then says like the

299
00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:33.580
inflection point approaches, right?

300
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:35.860
The moment with when existence hangs in the balance,

301
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.720
the key to everything is in your blood. And so Lobo kind of has this idea, okay,

302
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.230
like he's going to pull this wild and crazy stunt. We have no idea what it is,

303
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.430
but seemingly the fate of all reality comes down to the hands of a

304
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.600
death metal, rock music,

305
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.290
crazy dark version of Superman.

306
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.650
Who's probably one of the coolest DC characters ever created.

307
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.660
So with that being said, guys, we're going to bring this video to an end.

308
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.130
If you are new here to comments, explain,

309
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:05.230
make sure you guys are the sub button to become part of the rod for,

310
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:07.300
if you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you drop a light.

311
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.403
Now we'll cut you off.
