4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 1>What's going on guys. This is Rob and we are back again with, uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.720
I guess technically it's 10 of swords, but I like calling it extra swords.

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.900
I think it just sounds more like an X-Men title when you say it, but, uh,

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.220
but we are picking back up with this.

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.460
What this does this initially picks up with, uh, with apocalypse right now,

9
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:29.450
remember apocalypse has largely been in the healing gardens since his returned

10
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:32.060
from other worlds in the sense that when he was attacked by the four horsemen,

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.721
uh, that he,

12
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.900
his body looked like it was quite literally starting to fall apart and his

13
00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.490
injuries are pretty extreme, right?

14
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:40.040
There's no real certainty that he'll actually survive.

15
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.630
And so the people of Precoa and really the, the,

16
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.890
the mutants themselves are faced with a bit of a predicament because of the fact

17
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.610
that apocalypse suffered as injuries and other world. And he would die here.

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.030
The implication seems to be that while he wouldn't necessarily die in other

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.030
worlds, the effect of dying and other world remains the same.

20
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.670
And the sense that we don't know what version of him would actually come back.

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.990
Some alternate reality version,

22
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:02.210
maybe like the age of apocalypse version of himself,

23
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.190
where he's just hell bent on conquering the world.

24
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.030
And so the result of this is that the healer is basically brought before him for

25
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:09.710
the purpose of restoring his energies.

26
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:13.400
The problem with this is the healer cannot actually heal apocalypse on his own

27
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.650
one because of the fact that apocalypse keeps fighting, you know,

28
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:17.540
and all that kind of stuff because of how much pain he's in.

29
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.540
And so you end up basically having Polaris and Magneto used their combined

30
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:21.890
powers to strap him down,

31
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.280
but also because the healer's just not powerful enough in his own. Right?

32
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.540
And so the conversation begins to shift by Charles Xavier to having hope summers

33
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.141
amplify,

34
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.620
the powers of healer issue with that is this hasn't really been done before.

35
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.800
And we don't know what the effect would be if it would actually kill apocalypse,

36
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.050
if it would help him survive, there's no real knowing,

37
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.350
but apocalypses response is do it right. If I'm strong enough,

38
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.320
all survive the ordeal. And if I'm not, then I'll know I'm weak.

39
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.550
And so in this point,

40
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:50.150
apocalypse undergoes the healing at the hands of the healer whose power is

41
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.880
boosted by hope summers. And this is when we get this really,

42
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:57.080
really cool explanation as to why it is that apocalypse is so hell bent on

43
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.610
testing people. Because one of the things that we saw in the early days of,

44
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:03.770
of Marvel comics and really kind of the origin that we got from back in the day

45
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.150
is that apocalypse was discovered by ball and the sand stormers right.

46
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.890
They're kind of like this nomad group that was out there.

47
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.340
And he was taught by ball, the philosophy of survival of the fittest,

48
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.300
what this does is this Jonathan Hickman coming back and completely retelling the

49
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.960
origin of apocalypse, right? It's a whole new origin in relation to how it,

50
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.550
how it's based on apocalypse, his desire to test people. That's kind of the,

51
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:27.380
the funny thing here is that apocalypse leaving, you know,

52
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.230
and there is a little bit of wiggle room there and we'll kind of talk about why

53
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:32.000
this wiggle room is important here in a second,

54
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.860
but it's basically kind of a flashback sort of,

55
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.680
kind of consolidating a lot of what we were told up to this point.

56
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.990
And the idea was that somewhere along the line,

57
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:43.160
when you had a Krakatoa and a Rocco, that they were a singular nation, right?

58
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.080
That's something that we've talked about over the course of time.

59
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.260
These were two single islands and that somewhere out of nowhere,

60
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.410
you basically ended up getting these forces of evil, right? These,

61
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:55.340
these kinds of demonic entities that invaded the world. And because ACARA,

62
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.460
which is what it was called at the time was basically, you know, these two, uh,

63
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.840
you know, uh, Rocco and Coca-Cola existing as a single Island because, Oh,

64
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.180
Carra was effectively a mutant Haven, right?

65
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.420
He was a land where mutans resided those individuals who had popped up around

66
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.730
that time that were largely led by apocalypse, because this was a,

67
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.600
a safe Haven that this was one of the first places to fall,

68
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.780
because it was one of the first places where the horde initially popped up.

69
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.850
And so what you ended up getting was basically 100 soldiers, right?

70
00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:23.820
You ended up getting the white sword who is basically a champion, right?

71
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:26.010
He was a champion seemingly of the people on this Island.

72
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.070
So maybe apocalypse didn't necessarily rule over them per se,

73
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.830
but him and the 100 went into the portal, right.

74
00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:35.430
They passed into that realm and basically ended up facing off against all these

75
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.550
forces, right? These forces of men. And when that happened, that you,

76
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.090
of course also had Genesis the wife of apocalypse who stepped in as well and

77
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:44.970
helped to basically curtail these forces and send them back.

78
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.050
The problem with that is you ended up having a situation where a month actually

79
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:53.640
ended up contacting apocalypse directly, right? And this comes by virtue of, uh,

80
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.110
basically the helm of amaranth being brought forward to apocalypse by the forces

81
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.460
of these demons, right, by the,

82
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:01.320
all of these different demons and monsters and so on.

83
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.850
And so when one of them opens the box,

84
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:05.490
he realizes it's the helm and immediately panicked, right.

85
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:08.400
But he's told by one of the other guys and, you know, annihilation will walk.

86
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.110
The land is basically all God's made men do. And so put the helmet on, right?

87
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:15.300
Like put this thing on. And then when that happens,

88
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.520
basically Amazon takes over this person. Now,

89
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.250
the way this helm is explained to us by Jonathan Hickman,

90
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.880
the helmet itself is kind of like possessed by this sort of demonic entity,

91
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.220
but we're not given a full on explanation here, right?

92
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.480
We're not given any full answers in terms of who EMyth is or what their place is

93
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:32.640
or where they are from or any of that stuff.

94
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.730
It's just some kind of demonic being that exists out there. Now,

95
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.940
it really comes straight from the horses mouth, right? That, you know,

96
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.940
Hickman tells us, Amazon is a black planet of black death,

97
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.880
a hellscape of demons and things have a darker origin,

98
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.990
a chaos world of wild space that would be completely uncontrollable to the

99
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:49.440
living.

100
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.760
If not for the golden helm of annihilation that commands the conquered horde of

101
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.180
Amman, the person who wears the helm rules that dark world,

102
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.020
but the helmet itself rules, the were possessed by some elder God,

103
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.680
a primordial force of the spirit of that world made manifest.

104
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:05.850
The helm is seductive.

105
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.390
The helm is all consuming and only aware of greater strength.

106
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.530
Howard can hope to live through the experience, right?

107
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.350
It's a crown for the fit and only the fit can rule the amount, the health,

108
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.020
right? So there's this spirit basically, or this, this being,

109
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:20.250
it's almost kind of like, uh, the,

110
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:24.810
the essence of this demonic world that all these forces come from right now. We,

111
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:26.820
again, we don't really know what's goal or its ambition,

112
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.880
but the long and short is that when it possesses this demon and it starts

113
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:33.840
speaking directly to apocalypse that it says, I I'm, I'm giving you an offering,

114
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.690
but I cannot give it to you freely. Right. I must test you.

115
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.990
I must know whether or not you're worthy of receiving this offering.

116
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.090
And so what ends up happening is a couple of these demons,

117
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:45.930
basically challenge apocalypse as forces specifically Genesis.

118
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.930
And initially it was going to be apocalypse himself who was going to challenge

119
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.110
these guys, but, you know, the,

120
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:53.100
the ones who receive the offering or the one to undergo the test to determine

121
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:54.990
whether or not they were worth receiving the offering,

122
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.160
but instead his wife Genesis steps up. And when that happens,

123
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.210
she basically uses her power seemingly over the earth to destroy or to defeat

124
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.120
these two, you know, these two demonic beings. And then in turn,

125
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.950
you end up having this, this kind of offer that's made to her, you know, this,

126
00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:11.620
this, you know, uh, Memphis demon, right by Amazon basically.

127
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.640
And when that happens,

128
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.790
we don't really know what the offer was that was made to them,

129
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.100
the wife of apocalypse Genesis herself, instead,

130
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:20.350
all we know is that in the aftermath of this,

131
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.160
that basically they had to travel to that realm and they had to close the rift.

132
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Right. They had to close that portal and cut ACARA in half.

133
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.470
That's kind of what led to that, right? That's what led to, uh,

134
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.330
Krakatoa becoming its own Island and a Rocco becoming its own place inside of

135
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.420
other worlds, basically. And so in that moment, that's when,

136
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:41.140
when essentially the IBS seems to be that like a future battle will be fought,

137
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.230
right? That like, you know, we will give you safe Haven or whatever it is,

138
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.840
or we, and I have no real idea, but like in the future, you know,

139
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.500
things are gonna pop off. And so with that being the case, Genesis tasks,

140
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:52.810
her husband with testing, right? She says,

141
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.970
you're not strong enough to follow me to this realm,

142
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.920
stay and use the time that we buy you to make this world into something that can

143
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:03.820
stand against our enemy. Right? Judge them, my love judge them all.

144
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.090
And that's why apocalypse does what he does. He's tasked.

145
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:10.930
Or he was tasked by his wife to travel the world and to basically make it a

146
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:15.400
place where only the strong could survive. Because at some future point in time,

147
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.720
this strong will be the only ones capable of surviving against this coming horde

148
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.520
of, of the [inaudible] army. Right?

149
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:25.810
So apocalypse has quite literally been following this philosophy in order to

150
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:30.760
prepare the world for this army that is set to invade and then unleash all

151
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:32.050
kinds of Holy hell. Right?

152
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:35.380
So that's really the whole idea behind this is why apocalypse does what he does.

153
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.380
This is a massive change to his entire history, right?

154
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:40.000
Because we didn't really know the, the,

155
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.590
the kind of blanks that were being left there,

156
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.210
like kind of referencing what we talked about, you know,

157
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.820
earlier when we said that we would come back and explain this,

158
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.150
that the traditional history of apocalypse is that he was discovered by ball in

159
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.790
the sand storms. When he was a baby, he was taken under their wing.

160
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.090
He was taught the philosophy that only the strong deserve to survive this kind

161
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:56.710
of social Darwinist ideology.

162
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.590
But the origin at the time was that was an ideology.

163
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.440
That ball hat that was an ideology has tribe hat.

164
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.990
And they pass that ideology onto apocalypse.

165
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.460
And that's why he does what he does.

166
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.610
What Hickman's doing here is coming in and saying, none of that's true.

167
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.830
The reason why apocalypse test the world,

168
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:15.310
the way he does is because he knew a conflict was going to be coming at some

169
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:18.100
future point in time, right? 5,000 years, 10,000 years,

170
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:20.590
20,000 years into the future. And he's constantly been,

171
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:23.320
been touching the world in order to make sure it's strong enough to survive it.

172
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.180
This completely changes the motivation for why apocalypse does what he does.

173
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.390
It's not because he's a Dick it's because he's been trying to make sure the

174
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:35.050
world can save itself. Right? That's a huge change. It's a massive change.

175
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.790
And so once he fully recovers, he ends up traveling to, uh, to,

176
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:42.460
to the Libyan desert, right in Western Egypt to the temple of the four horsemen,

177
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.490
right to the temple of the horsemen and, and really to his own resting place.

178
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.540
And when he gets there, of course,

179
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:49.650
he goes inside and then he basically ends up taking a sword and,

180
00:08:49.651 --> 00:08:52.990
and essentially grabs a sword and then travels back to take his place.

181
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.120
Really it's as seemingly the final piece on the, the swords of X landscape,

182
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.710
the final piece that's here, uh,

183
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.640
as part of the excess words event and the final hero among cacoa,

184
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.880
who's going to face off against the forces of a Rocco. Well, that being said,

185
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:07.230
