4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.961
<v 1>What's going on guys.</v>

5
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.890
This is Rob and we are picking back up with the events of swords of X.

6
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.140
And in this video we are covering the hellion.

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.910
So we'll be initially pick up here with the resurrection of empath of Robert

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.790
Della Roshe. I think it is I'm sorry, manual. Dayla Roshe.

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.560
I'm not a hundred percent sure how to pronounce that name,

10
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.330
but this guy impath is, is not like the most powerful, but he's pretty powerful,

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.700
right? As his name suggests he can basically read,

12
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.180
manipulate the emotions of other people. He can also control emotions,

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.190
but he can only do it one emotion at a time, right?

14
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.250
So he can make you feel love or hate or anger or something like that.

15
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.170
So he's a pretty good asset to have on your team.

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.470
The funny thing about this though, is that with the hellions team itself,

17
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:50.480
and this is something to kind of point out here.

18
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.380
The thing about the hellions team is these are kind of like castoffs to a degree

19
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.930
originally, the hellions where the team of Emma Frost,

20
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.790
it was almost like Emma Frost, new mutants team.

21
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.370
They kind of went against the X-Men and new mutants and so on and so forth.

22
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.410
They were on again off again, enemies. And they actually,

23
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:05.510
they teamed up on some of some occasions.

24
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.050
But the overall idea here is that they're largely led by Mr. Sinister and the

25
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:12.740
way this kind of plays out is it talks about what move is going to come next,

26
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:13.011
right?

27
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:17.270
That the contest of swords is one where it may very well be the X-Men will lose,

28
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.060
right. Or even if they win, they could lose some of their kind.

29
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.880
And it's one of the most important things to remember here that the X-Men are

30
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.700
all about maintaining their existing population, right?

31
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.620
Like making sure they don't lose mutant lives,

32
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.860
even if it does involve some massive conflict that's going on. Right.

33
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.250
And so the idea here is to see if there's a see if it's possible to kind of find

34
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:38.150
a way to basically win without winning. Now, this is kind of Jonathan Hickman,

35
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:40.790
although he's not really the one writing this story or at least not directly,

36
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.140
but this is one of those things where,

37
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.110
where I guess really Zeb Wells has kind of taken a page out of Jonathan Hickman,

38
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.050
but it's based on the idea of, of like Avengers, new Avengers.

39
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.410
If you guys recall when Valeria was talking to Reed, as she said, you can't win.

40
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.930
Now it's time to find a way to not lose. That's basically,

41
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:57.350
what's kind of going on here. And sinister is the one who chimes in and says,

42
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.730
well, what if we sabotage them?

43
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.460
What if we let my hellions do what they do best right.

44
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:05.780
Light sheet steel until a Rocco, like older swords, the weapons belong to us.

45
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:09.410
Right? And so the idea is that the hellions are going to go into other world and

46
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.390
basically either steal the swords of the,

47
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:15.050
of those individuals who were already there or find some way to sabotage them.

48
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.710
Now, this is hugely against the rules, right? It's massively against the rules.

49
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.690
And if they get caught, there would be hell to pay.

50
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.350
But the funny thing about this is Xander and Magneto kinda mull this over for a

51
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:26.750
second and say, yeah, but it might be kind of worth it, right?

52
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:29.720
Like it's worth the risk. If we can save the lives of mutants,

53
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.810
especially younger, Munes right. If we can save the lives of these individuals,

54
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:35.210
these, these people who have to fight and not have to fight at all.

55
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.170
And so the funny thing about this is that initially the stance of people like

56
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:41.570
Exodus and a few people here and there is, we shouldn't do this,

57
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.270
but when it's put to a vote, five people vote in favor of it,

58
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:48.170
which means it passes. And so from there, the response of Exodus is okay, fine.

59
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.520
If that's it, that's how it's going to be.

60
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.940
The hellions will March into a Rocco to end this tournament before it starts.

61
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.670
And the fearless leader, Mr. Sinister will lead the way.

62
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.890
And that's what a sinister is like, what, wait a minute, what now, now,

63
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:02.080
wait a minute. Now I didn't say I was going to go on this mission. Right.

64
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.090
And it's kind of like, no, but I mean, they're your team.

65
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.620
You should be the one to lead them.

66
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.380
So how many people think this sinister should lead this campaign?

67
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.890
And only four people vote. Right? So sinister, you know, it's,

68
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.720
it's not really a passing motion. Sinister is kind of allowed to stay,

69
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.270
but then he kind of gets back into everything going on. Right.

70
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.640
He basically says like, you know, I want to have like on my team,

71
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.740
I do not want him hanging around with Polaris. Right.

72
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:24.720
We saw how fast he just kind of gala vented into other worlds. And he ended up,

73
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.690
you know, barely escaping by the skin of his teeth. I'm sorry, Magneto.

74
00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:30.480
But like your daughter is bad news. It Magneto is like, you know what?

75
00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:32.610
I changed my vote. I vote for Senator to go.

76
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.170
And so it was like sinister now has to go, right? Nathaniel, Essex,

77
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.720
Renzo's mouth. And now he has to go on this mission from there,

78
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:42.090
we switch over directly to the team itself.

79
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.850
And there are a couple of characters here that I want to kind of talk about for

80
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:47.820
a second. Orphan maker is an interesting character in and of himself, right?

81
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.510
His name is, is for the most part, Peter, we don't really know a ton about him.

82
00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:53.910
And we don't even know a whole lot about his powers. We know that like he can,

83
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:56.040
he has a kind of mechanized suit, but that's really,

84
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:59.010
it he's a character that hasn't really been fully fleshed out over the years.

85
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.010
The funny thing about this is that it is one of these instances where it's kind

86
00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:04.770
of a shame, right? Like orphan maker appeared back in 1988.

87
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.880
And aside from him having kind of been like a cohort of nanny and you know,

88
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.000
her basically saving him from being killed by sinister because sinister couldn't

89
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.310
control him, he's fought the he's fought the, the x-ray's fund.

90
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.260
X-Factor I think he fought the Avengers at one point.

91
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.600
Marvel just never really did anything with him. So the fact that he's here,

92
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.230
I think it's kind of a reflection of his status in the overall X-Men comics.

93
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:25.200
And he's almost kind of like an onion sellable character nanny has a far more

94
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:28.440
significant history, even if it's only on a small scale,

95
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.680
probably one of Andrew's biggest moments came when she D H storm was,

96
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:35.400
she turned storm into a little girl and that's when the storm first met gambit.

97
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.290
Right. So it was kind of during Chris Claremont's era,

98
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.530
but then of course you guys know Psylocke. You guys also are aware of havoc.

99
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.320
The character of wild child is a little more, um,

100
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.530
I would say obscure to the average come up,

101
00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:49.680
a greeter wild child appeared back in 1983. I think it was. Um,

102
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:52.860
and he was a character who, well, he originally appeared in alpha flight,

103
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.670
but he was a character named Kyle Gibson who was based largely off Wolverine and

104
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.490
saber tooth. And it was part of that era whereby no,

105
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:00.271
because what we're going to say,

106
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:03.780
Richard was so popular that Marvel was kind of finding ways to basically create

107
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:06.210
characters that would make them intriguing out with John Byrne, right.

108
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:06.961
In the title. Right.

109
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.270
It was kind of like let's create like a Wolverine type character.

110
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.870
And even within like his origin story, it's still very similar. Right?

111
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:15.480
So a very similar to it, to Wolverines in the sense that Cal given,

112
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.370
he was basically a kid whose powers manifested.

113
00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:19.410
He was essentially kicked out of the home by his parents.

114
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:22.080
He wondered the street, he was ultimately taken in by gamma flight.

115
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:25.590
He ended up being taken in and experimented on by the original secret empire,

116
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.800
kind of an offshoot of Hydra. He eventually became like weapon Omega. And then,

117
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.580
you know, there was the whole of a new X factor. So,

118
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.510
but he's one of these characters where you don't really, I mean,

119
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.350
if you read the old comics, wild child had a pretty interesting run,

120
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.740
especially in the early 1990s when it was like super high octane,

121
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.850
fast paced stories. Um, in 2009, or I think it was 2006, 2009,

122
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.830
he died during the Wolverine's origin story arc.

123
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:48.960
And then basically brought back as part of Coca-Cola.

124
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.110
But from there you also have gray Crow and gray Crow is a long-standing

125
00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:55.140
character because he was originally part of the original marauders, right.

126
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:57.680
There were led by an eventual Essex during the massacre.

127
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:00.170
He has the ability to basically tap into technology.

128
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.470
So it's kind of a hodgepodge ragtag gang here, right? I mean, these are,

129
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:07.000
this is not by any means kind of an organized team. I mean, it is, but it's,

130
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:10.040
it's just kind of characters who were there that nobody could really do anything

131
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.190
with, or couldn't really control or whose appearances whose powers made them,

132
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.620
you know, unable to kind of function in the normal world.

133
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.800
But the idea behind this is that sinister initially brought back a version of

134
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.890
himself and then essentially kind of thought them out with the intention of

135
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.820
sending that version of himself out on a mission instead of, of sinister prime,

136
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.170
so to speak going himself.

137
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.840
And then this version that he thought I'd actually rebels. And it was like, no,

138
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.733
I don't.

139
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.070
<v 2>So they actually kind of end up in Vogue.</v>

140
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.000
<v 1>A game of rock paper scissors in order to decide who it is that's going to go</v>

141
00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:39.640
out there. And it turns out that the main Sentencer was the one who lost.

142
00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:43.090
So he has to go on this mission. Now, once they enter into a, into,

143
00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:45.580
to what's basically Avalon, this led by Jamie Bradick.

144
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.970
If you guys recall our video on Excalibur, that that story arc that we did,

145
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.390
this guy is powerful. He's a reality. Warper, he's also kind of crazy.

146
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.760
And he's basically ranting and raving at this guy.

147
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:58.720
Newford who supposedly had told Jamie that he knows that he's familiar with

148
00:06:58.721 --> 00:06:59.680
horses and that, uh,

149
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.010
he's an equestrian and that they kind of brought this horse in for the purpose

150
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.210
of, of, you know, training it,

151
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:06.040
breaking it in to the Jimmy Braddock could enjoy it.

152
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.520
And it turns out Mueller never said any such thing by me for never claimed that

153
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:10.210
he never said that,

154
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.900
but you kind of have sinister and Jimmy Braddock sort of hanging out, right.

155
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.170
You're kind of, kind of talking to each other,

156
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.570
but this is something that's kind of interesting to me because it's a little bit

157
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:20.130
of humor and what's otherwise a pretty interesting story arc. Right. And I,

158
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.120
and I, I kind of love this to be honest,

159
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.920
it's one of the good things about extra sorts.

160
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.850
An ex of sorts does a really good job of maintaining the tone of the existing

161
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:31.840
comics while also giving us an ongoing story. And I kind of have to say,

162
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.990
I think that's something that Marvel has been lacking in recent years, right?

163
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:37.120
That you have a tone of a particular kind of book.

164
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.350
And then it goes into an event.

165
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.840
And the tone of the comic becomes the tone of the event.

166
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.400
And as soon as that event is over,

167
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.430
the tone of the comic goes back to normal again and is kind of jarring.

168
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.840
And so what you end up getting here is,

169
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.110
is initially Jamie Bradick who kind of shoots down the idea and saying like,

170
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.140
Hey, no, I really don't want to have anything to do with,

171
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:55.330
with basically sneaking in to other world and essentially betraying the rules of

172
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.670
Saturday name laid down. That's not supposed to happen.

173
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.760
And so we're sisters like, look, you know, I, if, if we can,

174
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.900
if we can pull this off,

175
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.420
like we can basically help you kind of preserve your fun. Right. You know,

176
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:05.860
preserving your fund is what we're shooting for it.

177
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.600
And that's when Jamie's like, Hey, Milford, ah,

178
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.290
take the horse and get the horse out of here, if you can, you know, or,

179
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:10.481
you know,

180
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:13.540
because supposedly you're good at horses or that's what you claim and me for.

181
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:17.680
It's like, I never said that, man. I never said I was good with horses. Right.

182
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.660
And so I was like, dude, I'm getting like Jimmy Biotics, like, dude,

183
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:20.680
I'm getting tired of hearing that.

184
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.690
Just take the horse and get outta here the whole time.

185
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:24.430
You first just trying to like pull on this horse.

186
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:27.310
And then Jamie Bradick in the midst of a conversation with sinister, you know,

187
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:29.650
we're sitting there kind of references the fact that this place is kind of

188
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:33.070
unsafe under the rule of Jimmy Bradick. Jimmy's like, Oh man, he's like,

189
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:34.210
someone's been talking about it's her. And he's like,

190
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.110
Newford I just remember it. It was I who was raised around horses, not you, you.

191
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.720
<v 2>And there's this guy.</v>

192
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.333
<v 1>Goofiness, right.</v>

193
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.190
That's kind of goofiness and nonsense that comes with the character of Jamie

194
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.323
Bradick and is awesome.

195
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.990
I love that kind of nonsensical nature of him because as goofy as he is,

196
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:52.720
he's also incredibly powerful, right? I mean,

197
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.820
the guy's able to work reality potentially on a scale he's just that capable.

198
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.360
And so it's one of these things where the response of Jamie is okay, fine.

199
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.900
Then I will do that. And, and I offer you like my priced horse, right?

200
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:05.010
I offer you silk, Maine.

201
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.900
What are you going to give me in return as part of this deal that we've struck

202
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.630
as part of this bargain, instead of just like,

203
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.370
we're not going to give you anything. I don't want your horse. And that's when,

204
00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:13.081
when you know, he's like,

205
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:16.080
he's like a horse is like a huge amount of responsibility. And,

206
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.990
and it's kind of funny because Jimmy stands up and he was like,

207
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.960
everybody listening, you know, the words of sinister have touched me.

208
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.680
The idea of responsibility, responsibility is a very important thing.

209
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:29.700
And I just remember it that I have the responsibility to report any suspicious

210
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.340
involvement, any suspicious actions or suspicions, uh,

211
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.900
suspicious travelers to Saturday. So if I'm going to maintain responsibility,

212
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.870
it's important that I tell her about what it is that you're doing.

213
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.930
And so ultimately you end up having sinister being like, okay,

214
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.700
we're not going to do, we're not going to take the horse,

215
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.150
but I can give you something else in step. And so sinister loses his Cape.

216
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.880
<v 3>And here's the thing.</v>

217
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.120
<v 1>On this surface as an old school, as a, as a long time coming book reader,</v>

218
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.940
there's a part of me that's kind of like sinister would never act this way.

219
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.250
Right. As soon as her super hardcore, but there's another part of me.

220
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.850
That's kind of like, I did this, I like the nonsensical sinister, right.

221
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:05.130
The one who's just like, I don't really take things seriously anymore.

222
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.760
I just kind of goof off, you know, I'm sort of just kind of a, of a goofy guy.

223
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.670
I kind of enjoy that version of sinister because I've been reading the old

224
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:14.370
school version of sinister for so long. It's pretty fun.

225
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.010
And so once they actually make their way here or there kind of has that,

226
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.790
you know, supposedly kind of interim station kind of a waystation of sorts, uh,

227
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.300
with Jimmy Bradick and they actually arrive into really kind of other world

228
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:25.830
itself they're immediately met by,

229
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:29.460
what's essentially an Envoy of Saturn Dean who basically charges them. Right.

230
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:31.980
Instead of like, you guys have to stop while you guys are in possession of silk,

231
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.620
Maine, uh,

232
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.670
you guys basically have this horse that belonged to Saturday and herself.

233
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.371
The fact that you,

234
00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:39.180
you have this horse means you stole it because we know the horse has been

235
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:42.330
stolen. Some crazy naked guy just ran up on the property and took it.

236
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:45.690
So like we know Jamie Bradick and his nakedness just running onto the,

237
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:49.140
to the territory of Saturday and, and stealing a horse buck naked, which is,

238
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.570
sounds like the most Jamie Brodick thing that a person could do.

239
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.860
I feel like somebody,

240
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.380
like people are kind of skipping to this video and somebody is going to land on

241
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:56.610
this part and just be like, what?

242
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.630
<v 3>Well, that's, that's going to be either.</v>

243
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.080
<v 1>But it's kind of like, okay, like empath, we need your powers,</v>

244
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.470
manipulate their emotions and turn them into allies. And he's like, no,

245
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.600
I'm good. He's like, I hate all of you guys. Okay.

246
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.370
<v 3>Hey, everybody here, I hope you die.</v>

247
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.290
And I hope that I hope that like when you die.

248
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.240
<v 1>And if you guys end up coming back, because remember when you,</v>

249
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.500
whenever you die in other world,

250
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.960
there's no guarantee you'll come back the way that you worked. So it was like,

251
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:18.830
when you guys come back,

252
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:22.100
you come back and such a screwed up state that like the entirety of Coca-Cola

253
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:24.140
will cheer. When I, when I suffocate you,

254
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.720
when I spear you have you're miserable.

255
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.240
<v 3>I hope that's the way things are like.</v>

256
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.090
<v 1>I hate you guys. And so in response, like sinister,</v>

257
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.460
like surely there's something that you want, right? Some kind of a favor,

258
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.080
I'll give you anything you want. And he's like,

259
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.710
I want grey Crow as my pet grey Crow flips. Right. He's just like,

260
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.800
not a chance I'm going to cut you in half. Right. And so since she was like,

261
00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:45.650
okay, dude, that's fine. Like, like just whatever, you know.

262
00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:49.580
And so he uses his powers. Grey Crow becomes just totally enamored with empath.

263
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.850
He's like, man, your eyes, both sparkling eyes while you're just a radiant soul,

264
00:11:52.851 --> 00:11:53.260
right.

265
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.400
He absolutely adores empath empath and turn his powers on the Envoy Saturnino

266
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.080
and they basically give sinister and his crew,

267
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:01.330
whatever it is that they need and just kind of go forward from there.

268
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.060
And it's kind of a crazy thing to see this story where,

269
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.630
where Greg Crow is just kind of falling through the grass and talking about how

270
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.680
great impath is.

271
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.990
It's one of these things where you kind of have to go and read the old mutant

272
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:15.130
massacre and see how like sadistic his character was in order to really get a

273
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:18.550
grasp for how funny this is. Old-school coming up.

274
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:20.320
Fans would probably get a kick out of it. Right?

275
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:24.740
Like the new guys are kind of like says a thing, you know, it's,

276
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.940
it's interesting, but they all kind of agree as they're making,

277
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.900
making their way through here, they all kind of agree.

278
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.330
This is going to go pretty bad. Right? Like they're all kind of like,

279
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:33.970
this is going to be, this is like a suicide mission basically. Right? So it's,

280
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.610
it's almost kind of like the hellions have become Marvel suicide squad.

281
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.010
It's kind of wild, but it's like, we're probably going to die.

282
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.320
And if we don't die, we're definitely not going to succeed.

283
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.140
Things are going to go pretty terrible for us. Right.

284
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.930
So they're definitely off to a great start with that being said, guys,

285
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.660
we're gonna bring this video to an end. If you are new here to come and explain,

286
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.730
make sure you guys at the sub button to become part of the Rob core.

287
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.490

288

289
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:14.010
[inaudible].
