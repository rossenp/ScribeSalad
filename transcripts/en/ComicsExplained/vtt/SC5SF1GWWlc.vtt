00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.970
guys hit the like button, if you enjoyed the video and yeah. Let's begin.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.300
Okay. So before we.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.300
<v 1>Start this video, two things, one,</v>

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.360
for those of you guys who are curious about the selling of Rob core rings,

7
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.760
that was not a one-off, I'm going to sell them again, but I'm going to,

8
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:20.391
I'm going to do it again.

9
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:24.410
I'm not going to leave you guys just once to those rings sold out in two hours.

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.040
Now I have not found a way on Etsy to show that the rings were sold out, right?

11
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.110
As soon as a single ring type showed up, sold out,

12
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.780
then it was like Etsy automatically delisted it. Right?

13
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:35.630
So that's why some of you guys went to the store and you didn't see anything

14
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.250
there because they were all sold out. Right?

15
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:38.930
But in two hours they were all gone.

16
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.910
Those are the guys who did buy Rob four rings.

17
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.090
You should be able to go on to Etsy and you should see the status of your order.

18
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.770
Ah, they should all be on their way.

19
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.830
The only exception is we got an order from a guy in Norway and we had a little

20
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.920
bit of a complication. It was on our end. It was not anything you did wrong. Uh,

21
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.650
but we fixed it and everything's all sorted out. So, uh,

22
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.280
we will order more Rob core rings and we will send out more Rob core rings and I

23
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.450
will place more up for sale.

24
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.650
So keep your ears open and I will let you guys know when you can buy them. So,

25
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.670
uh, anyway.

26
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.040
<v 0>Onto the video what's going on.</v>

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.930
<v 1>This is Rob and we are picking up with the conclusion of X of sores.</v>

28
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.630
I hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving week. I know I did.

29
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.110
I definitely needed that break. I absolutely needed that break. Uh,

30
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.450
I was going nuts, just,

31
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.780
I think we've been probably doing this nonstop for about two years without

32
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:27.500
really taking a break. Uh, so I needed one, but, uh,

33
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.190
but we are picking back up with the conclusion of a, of X of sorts, right?

34
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.240
We're wrapping this whole thing up.

35
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.970
And initially I thought about doing each of these individuals separately,

36
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.580
but I think at this point we can just kind of do all the videos together and

37
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:38.480
just sort of call it a day.

38
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.120
I do want to touch on the hellions because we're going to kind of skip over

39
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.550
this. The hellions was a totally unnecessary story.

40
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.010
I'm not really sure why it was included in this in the first place.

41
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.130
The only real takeaway those of guys who remember the only real thing going on

42
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:53.030
with the hellions is that their goal was to get into other worlds and steal the

43
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:55.670
swords of Morocco. So they couldn't even compete in the first place,

44
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.090
which would basically seem to nullify the entire tournament. Now, as we saw,

45
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.300
not all the fights were being done with swords really only those who needed

46
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.620
swords would be disqualified,

47
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.360
but then Saturday and probably would have changed things.

48
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.250
What ended up happening with the hellions, however,

49
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:11.210
is that it was revealed that sinister simply wanted to steal genes of mutants

50
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.170
that had just had out there.

51
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.440
And once the other hellions found out sinister managed to achieve his goal to a

52
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.510
degree and then came back to, uh,

53
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.300
the Kirkland gate back into the main Marvel universe,

54
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:22.250
so to speak and then pretty much killed all the hellions.

55
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.040
And that was basically it, right? So there's a little bit going on there,

56
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:27.290
but not a whole lot, certainly nothing that works. Whereas, you know,

57
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.390
that warrants us covering the entirety of the story.

58
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.120
But what's really important here is we pick up with the next part of the

59
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:33.950
tournament, which takes place in cable.

60
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.300
And this is done by virtue of cable having to face off against Bay. Now,

61
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:42.050
of course, Bay is the wife of Doug Ramsey, right? She's the wife of cipher.

62
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.960
And so cable's kind of watching all this on,

63
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:45.740
or I guess it's really kind of engaging in this,

64
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.890
knowing that he's probably going to have to kill the wife of Doug Ramsey.

65
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.860
And in that moment of hesitation Bay gets the upper hand.

66
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.860
Now here's the big difference because cable says things like, you know,

67
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.860
if I had been who I was before then this probably never would have been a

68
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:00.790
problem in the first place and true. The, one of the things that was you guys,

69
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.910
weren't really familiar and I've heard people ask this,

70
00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:07.260
why is cable so young Marvel introduced a retcon con basically having cable's

71
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.920
younger self kill his older self and then take his place as kind of like the new

72
00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:11.280
cable.

73
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.890
It was a way for Marvel to kind of reinvigorate the character a little bit.

74
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.360
I kind of feel like it was unnecessary.

75
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.640
The older cable had a lot of great storytelling and going on,

76
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.080
and I think it's situations, you know,

77
00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:20.370
he would have been a lot more interesting,

78
00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:22.770
useful and would have made the stories a lot more interest frigging,

79
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:25.650
but such as it is, we ended up getting younger cable. Instead.

80
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.100
Now the problem with younger cable is he's not quite battle-hardened yet.

81
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.100
Not in the same way that his older self is. And he's right. When he says,

82
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.620
if this was this older self, he would have killed Bay like that,

83
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.940
but it would have to spend over,

84
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.310
like he would have just killed her in an instant and would have been like, cool,

85
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.390
like we get the point done.

86
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.850
And he would've like watched Doug Ramsey cry and he probably would have

87
00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:44.070
comforted him and said, Hey man, sorry, but like, you know,

88
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.860
the entire kingdom of Coca-Cola and the entire,

89
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:50.040
like our entire earth is more important than your wife, right?

90
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:53.220
So would that be the case with Bay getting the upper hand, uh,

91
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.490
with cable kind of hesitating for a moment, they'd basically topples him.

92
00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:00.000
She breaks his arm and then she goes for the killing blow and Doug jumps in and

93
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.150
asked her to stop, right? He says like, stop, like you've basically one, uh,

94
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.360
this was supposed to be finished, right. And Saturday, and had kind of declared.

95
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.130
This was going to be a battle to the death, right.

96
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:11.190
It was going to be a fight to the actual death itself, but Michigan kind of,

97
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.400
kind of relinquishes here and says, but some deaths are of the spirit, right?

98
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.270
So in the end for the point to a Rocco cacoa is now down,

99
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.330
basically it's 18 to six, right down by 12 points.

100
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.150
This is a pretty huge number to have to catch up. Now, from there,

101
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.840
you end up picking up with cable, contacting Jean Gray and psych hops directly,

102
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.060
which is something that he's not really supposed to be doing, right.

103
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.460
Using his telepathy and managing to reach to them.

104
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.030
But the fact that he was able to do this to essentially use a telepathic powers,

105
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.080
to reach across dimensional barriers and contact gene and a Cyclops,

106
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.930
that's a huge thing, right? This is really more of an act of desperation,

107
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.540
but for people who create like respect threads, right?

108
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:49.680
Like the power of the telepathy of, of, of, uh, the power of like cables,

109
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:51.960
telepathy, what like Jean Gray celebrity or something like that.

110
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.180
This is one of those examples that we'll use. Right. They'll just say like,

111
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.390
was able to use this telepathy across dimensional barriers, right.

112
00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:58.620
Or something along those lines. Right.

113
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:00.590
That's where this kind of stuff comes from. But the reality,

114
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.910
this is cable looks at the situation and says,

115
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.810
it's dire and we're probably going to lose, right? Like we're down 18 to six.

116
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.860
The deck basically seems to be stacked against us. Like she wants us to lose.

117
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.680
I'm not really sure why. I'm not really sure what's going on here.

118
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.420
I'm going to stay here and fight as much as I can,

119
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.040
but like tell Esmee right of the step broker coups,

120
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.430
it kind of girlfriend of cable. Tell her I love her, right? I mean,

121
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:23.340
that's kind of where this is now Saturday and steps in and cuts off his

122
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:26.310
connection. And that's when Cyclops and Jean are like, okay,

123
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.920
we need to do something now we'll get back to them here in a second.

124
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.230
What we're going to do here is we're going to focus on Gorgon, right?

125
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.690
He's the next fight. Now Borgen is one of these guys.

126
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:37.290
And the reason why he wears a bandana around his head is that if he takes it off

127
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.210
and he looks at, you you'll turn to stone,

128
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.450
but he's being made to face off face off against white sword.

129
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.330
But facing off against white sword is not just fighting him.

130
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.270
It's fighting his 100 soldiers. And so he says like,

131
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.300
you'll fight me after you fight all of them. And so he says like,

132
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:53.490
once you get through all 100 of these guys, then we'll battle.

133
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.910
That's all he says, number one, right. This first guy comes running in,

134
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.230
gets like, gets his head chopped off in an instant. Then it's two and three.

135
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.320
Those guys get taken down. Then it's four, five and six. Right?

136
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.510
Those guys get turned to stone and then manages to make it through and gouge out

137
00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:10.510
the eyes of Gordon. So his primary power is basically gone here.

138
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.190
And so now he's basically just fighting,

139
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:14.080
using his own prodigious martial arts skill.

140
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.200
But then it's now you have to fight all the rest of the other ones. Right?

141
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:18.790
You have to fight seemingly all of them.

142
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.360
And so what ends up happening is that Gordon actually takes out something like

143
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.770
13 of, of like the light source champions, which moves the number up. Right?

144
00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:28.180
So it actually gives them a lead, right?

145
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.910
Because each one of these individuals that he kills counts as a point.

146
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.880
So it kind of seems like Saturday is more or less balancing the numbers.

147
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:36.640
And so now Coca-Cola is ahead 19 to eight.

148
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.580
And that's when the horsemen step in and say invest, right?

149
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.060
Because if he kills all 100 of your soldiers, it's going to move them up.

150
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.450
They're going to be 106 to 18. They're going to crush us. Right?

151
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:48.190
Like there's not gonna be any chance for us to win.

152
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.580
Like the term will basically be over, right? I mean, there's not enough,

153
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.580
you know, not enough opponents for us to face off, against to finish this right.

154
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.760
To, to come out on top. This will, that's when white sward stepson and says,

155
00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:00.610
okay, fine. Then the battle will be between the two, two of us.

156
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.910
And it's one of these things where Gorgon knows he's not going to win. Right?

157
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:05.980
Like he knows he cannot come out on top here.

158
00:07:05.981 --> 00:07:08.530
There's no possible way for that to happen. And the white sword says,

159
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.140
I'm going to kill you. And then I will bring you into my,

160
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.690
bring you into my army and the responsible organ organism, not a chance,

161
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.710
whatever happens to me after this, whatever death awaits me,

162
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:21.640
whatever comes next, this afterlife, it will not be as one of your henchmen.

163
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.100
Right? And that's when, uh, when white Swan is like, okay, fine.

164
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.870
If you don't want to be, then you don't have to be.

165
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.960
But hundreds of sort through his chest and basically killed him.

166
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:31.090
Now there's two pool things that come out of this.

167
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.490
The first is apocalypse kind of commenting and saying,

168
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.780
this is how a mutant dies. If you're going to die, you die on your own terms.

169
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:40.840
You die in saying, I'm not going to be a subject to anybody else,

170
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.180
but you die with what you perceive to be your own honor.

171
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.910
The other thing that comes out of this as a Gordon was,

172
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.180
I wouldn't necessarily say an essential member of the X-Men roster,

173
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.780
but somebody who probably could do with a bit of revamping and the reason why is

174
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:56.620
because Vulcans never really had major roles in Marvel for quite some time.

175
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.380
This is kind of an exciting moment because it could be one of these things where

176
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.150
mobile just never to bring him back, right.

177
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.700
Pitman just kind of writes them out and he's gone or it could be,

178
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.760
they bring him back. It's totally changed because remember he died here.

179
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:08.920
In other words, which means if they resurrect him,

180
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.190
he'll come back in any number of different versions of himself from across the

181
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:15.400
multi-verse. We don't know which version it will be. So he could come back with,

182
00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:17.560
with better powers. He could come back weaker.

183
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.800
He could come back as just some old Sage wise, man who never fights.

184
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.690
He could come back in a wide array of different forms,

185
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.100
but Oregon having been destroyed right now, the score is currently even a Rocco.

186
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.800
<v 2>19 Cracow at 19. And I need you to keep that in mind, hold that in,</v>

187
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:34.630
in your mind, as long as you can, because this will be.

188
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.381
<v 1>How important,</v>

189
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:39.730
because this leads into the final battle between apocalypse and his wife.

190
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.800
<v 2>Who's donning the helmet of annihilation.</v>

191
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.620
One of the things that happens here is an apocalypse challenges, his wife,

192
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:48.440
to face him off as herself, right? To basically not use the power of,

193
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.610
of annihilation or any of that stuff to really just kind of husband and wife

194
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.010
dueling each other. But the other thing that comes out of this,

195
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.070
it's really more, uh, with Jean Gray and.

196
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.280
<v 1>Cyclops that with the messages they receive from cable and the fact that things</v>

197
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:02.600
seem so dire go to the quiet council, right? And they say like,

198
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.830
we need to go do this.

199
00:09:03.831 --> 00:09:06.590
Like we need to go rescue our son and the quiet castles in a,

200
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.970
in a bit of a predicament, right?

201
00:09:07.971 --> 00:09:11.330
Because the biggest issue they face is that when they ask Cyclops,

202
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.900
what is it you intend to do? Psych Papa's response is twofold. One.

203
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.310
I'm going to assemble a strike team.

204
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.980
This strike team is going to be a smash and grab job, right?

205
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:21.800
We're just going to break into the other world. We're going to pass in there.

206
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.200
We're going to grab our X-Men and we're going to come back.

207
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.320
We need you to hold the gate open until we do. Now,

208
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.490
the issue with the quiet council is, but what if you die over there, right?

209
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.250
If you die over there, there'd be no way for us to know, right?

210
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:37.790
Because Saturday Nina's cut off any telepathic communications to that realm.

211
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.420
So it's not like we can maintain a telepathic lifeline and know whether or not

212
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:44.480
you survive and say, Oh my God, psych cops and Jean, and all the X-Men are dead,

213
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.460
are at close a portal. So they, it, so nobody can get in.

214
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.600
They just kind of have to wait and see.

215
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.930
But if they die over there and there's no way of knowing they died,

216
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.200
they could potentially just be holding the portal open for an invasion that they

217
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:56.930
didn't know was coming. So they could literally so their own end.

218
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.930
The other part of this is that Jean Gray and psych hops were part of the quiet

219
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:03.560
council. And so it basically be taking away from, from their number. Now,

220
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.680
anybody who's familiar with governmental positions knows that usually

221
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:10.010
individuals who hold positions of government are not afforded the opportunity of

222
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:13.220
putting their life on the line. Leaders don't have that luxury, right?

223
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:16.100
Because somebody has to govern, it's the responsibility you take.

224
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.480
And so what this means is that while sock hops and Jean are simply just going to

225
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:22.130
go, right? It's one of these things where it's like,

226
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.600
we're going to find a way to leave.

227
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.810
So you're going to have to like lock us up or something that in turn the quiet

228
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.150
counsel, now that they're met with the, the idea that, uh,

229
00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:32.090
that like Nightcrawler wants to go, their concern is okay,

230
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.440
then what do we do now? Right.

231
00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:37.070
What do we do in this instance where the quiet council could potentially lose

232
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:38.450
three or four of their number?

233
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.910
Do we simply just hope they come back in one piece?

234
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.880
Do we ensure the governing body can function the way that it's supposed to?

235
00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:46.160
Because river, everybody here has a role to play.

236
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.250
So the government has to continue on. And so in order to,

237
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:51.950
to basically satisfy this me to answer this question,

238
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.800
a vote is given and the vote is, is given in two forms.

239
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.340
The first vote is if you guys pass through that gate and you die,

240
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.160
and there's no way for us to know that you die and we could be holding the gate

241
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.100
open for, then that means we have to close the gate, right?

242
00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:06.860
We can't take the chance that if you perish there and we don't know that we

243
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:08.870
allow all the enemies to come flooding in, right?

244
00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:11.180
Any chance that we have of closing the gate will be gone at that point.

245
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.450
And so what they say is Neil, the first vote is Doobie close the gate.

246
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.330
After the forces of the strike team, Jean Gray, sock hops,

247
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.720
after they all pass through the answer is yes. Right? We close the gate.

248
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.800
The second concern is what do we do about you guys leaving the quiet council and

249
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:25.634
potentially dying.

250
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.520
So do we just kind of hope that you guys make it back in one piece?

251
00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.430
Do we put the entire government on hold in order to, you know,

252
00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:32.930
in order to find out whether you made it back,

253
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.960
never knowing how long it could take you to get back that if something went

254
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.900
wrong and you guys were stuck there for decades and decades,

255
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.230
or you guys just grew old there and died because you can never find a way back.

256
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.530
Do we just kind of allow the quiet council to function in its own way without

257
00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:49.130
you guys there? Or do we fill your seats? And when they vote, the answer is,

258
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.110
if you go, you lose your spot, right?

259
00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:53.680
We're going to replace you with somebody else. But at the end of the day,

260
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.820
Jean and Cyclops don't care, their stances. We don't care. Like we are going,

261
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.870
what we're going to go with this, you know, apocalypse is already there, right?

262
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.030
And it may very well be that he might perish that,

263
00:12:03.031 --> 00:12:05.380
that there's individuals who are out there that are supposed to be on the

264
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:08.020
council that could very well die. And so, because of that, no,

265
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:10.510
they've already lost so many of their number. They effectively vote.

266
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.380
If Jean grand Cyclops pass through this gate and they take the strike team and

267
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.180
they go to other world for this mission,

268
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.270
then they give up their position on the quiet council and Jean grey.

269
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.180
And cycop say, we're okay with that. And they leave,

270
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.060
but they basically walk away because it's one of these things where they say,

271
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:27.880
if, if the CRI council is the government of Kakoa,

272
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.410
then the X-Men are its heroes.

273
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.460
And of what use our heroes who refuse to fight my allegiance is to the mutant

274
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.160
population. My allegiance is to the people. And if we,

275
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:39.790
as the quiet council are going to sit and just rest on our laurels effectively,

276
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:40.810
you know, and just kind of,

277
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.540
not really do anything in the face of such dire straights,

278
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.130
that of what use are we? Right?

279
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.640
And so Cyclops and Jean basically leave and where you would expect some measure

280
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:53.280
of condemnation from a quiet council instead, it's really Magneto insight.

281
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.410
And [inaudible] who were just like, that's exactly how we raised you.

282
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.180
That's exactly what you, what we're supposed to do.

283
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.510
And it's one of these things where we can kind of assume a lot of the reasons

284
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.360
why some of these folks don't leave could very well be tied to like Maura

285
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.020
McKendrick.

286
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.990
And the idea that like does this kind of greater game that was established

287
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:11.260
during the house and powers of X and the sense that like, if they perish,

288
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.610
everything would come to an end,

289
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.880
it really seems to point to the idea that gene grain side cops are not really

290
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.610
that essential to the future survival of the X-Men either.

291
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.420
<v 2>That, or this is something that has to happen. Right.</v>

292
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.880
But regardless of the situation, they basically pass through.

293
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.520
<v 1>Brew and they go into, into other world itself.</v>

294
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.130
And so picking back up with apocalypse and his wife.

295
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.560
<v 2>Things are interesting here. This is kind of cool. It's this really,</v>

296
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:35.820
really amazing moment where the wife of apocalypse gets the upper hand, right?

297
00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:38.780
Genesis gets the upper hand on him and like destroys a sword.

298
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.660
<v 1>And says, okay,</v>

299
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.140
like I give you one last kiss and then I will hear your surrender and welcome

300
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:45.810
you back to your rightful place by my side.

301
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.450
And then she sh like wants you to just raise the sword. She asks like,

302
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.630
will you yield apocalypse? Here's the thing to understand about apocalypse.

303
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.880
<v 2>Right? Always outnumbered, never.</v>

304
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.100
<v 1>Outgunned, right? Apocalypse is not a guy.</v>

305
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.780
<v 2>Who falls easily. Right. This is not a man who yields and that's exactly.</v>

306
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.200
That's exactly what he says, man. Jonathan Hickman, Jonathan, Jonathan,

307
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.480
Jonathan, Jonathan Hickman, man, man. It's it's man.

308
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.600
It's it's it's so it's like, but it's like one of the coolest moments.

309
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.110
Cause apocalypse was like, I will not yield. Not to fear,

310
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.550
not to doubt and not to love where Genesis thought she had the upper hand and

311
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.970
four moves it's bat, bat, bat, and then she's done, right.

312
00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:27.210
That's the end of Genesis. Like literally like just swipes right through.

313
00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:29.010
And that's that, you know, like, like, and it's,

314
00:14:29.011 --> 00:14:32.790
and it's nuts because that's the thing, man, apocalypse man is bad people, man,

315
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.880
man, she's sleeping on a pocket of sun. Like that's exactly what it is.

316
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.420
And that's what makes it so crazy is because with her basically.

317
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.180
<v 1>Defeated apocalypse is like, I don't want this. Right.</v>

318
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.430
He looks out at Nina and he's like, I don't want this. Right.

319
00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:47.880
I don't want to kill my own wife. I'm not in favor of this. Now keep in mind,

320
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.130
the score is still 19 to 19, whoever this wins.

321
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.963
<v 2>The contest.</v>

322
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.880
And so with that Saturday seems like I don't really care what it is that you

323
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:57.860
want. Right? Like the tournament must go on.

324
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.090
You must slay your wife or be slayed by your wife for Victor to be determined

325
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:05.570
here. But in this moment when apocalypse and Saturnino having this conversation,

326
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.990
then suddenly like Genesis puts on the helmet of annihilation,

327
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.920
completely heals herself. And it's just like, nothing is settled, right?

328
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.670
Like I annihilation and now in total control, your nothing is settled, right?

329
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:20.630
Like this will go on and we will fight. Now when that happens, right?

330
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:25.040
Like when she dawns it, helmet of annihilation, she calls in every one,

331
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.820
like literally all the forces of Amref just come pouring into other one at this

332
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:31.100
point, it's just like men, the hell with the tournament son. Like,

333
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.930
we're just going to do this right now. Like,

334
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.410
that's exactly what this is right now. The, the different little fairy people,

335
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:39.050
whatever they are, the fish folk of, uh, like the forces of, of,

336
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:41.780
of Saturday and right here, a little assistance AIDS, whatever they are,

337
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.020
they immediately run and grab like the little, uh, like these, this,

338
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:48.200
this kind of box right there contains all these little puzzle pieces more or

339
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:50.720
less. And the idea is that when Saturday and puts this together,

340
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.830
it would have to fit effectively,

341
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:55.280
give her an answer on what her next move needs to be and what it is a sheet that

342
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:56.900
she needs to do in this. But without, you know,

343
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.650
beyond Saturday and what's going on right now is all hell is breaking loose sun.

344
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.670
Like all these forces of Amazon are pouring in here and you've got like six

345
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:07.640
X-Men and captain Britain basically facing off against them,

346
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:11.900
all doing everything they can now where we're Amith goes for the killing blow

347
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:15.110
against the apocalypse. And seemingly he's just going to let it happen. Right.

348
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:19.310
Like out of nowhere, she struck by lightning, right out of nowhere,

349
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.430
she's struck by lightning, inter storm, right. Storms like, okay.

350
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.680
So she's only going to be delayed for so long, right?

351
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:26.030
Like she's only going to be delayed for so long.

352
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.300
Like we've got our armies routed. We have to get out of here. Right?

353
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:32.600
Like we have to leave. And the responsible Hotlips is like, not a chance, man.

354
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:35.450
Like no way. We're like, there's no way I'm leaving my wife behind.

355
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:39.020
But at this point it's not even the stance of, of apocalypse and what he wants.

356
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.050
It's like, like run, run runaway, live to fight another day. Right?

357
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.960
Like we can get out of here. We can get back to her Koa. Yes. I guess. I mean,

358
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:47.810
the scores currently tied. We can figure this out later. Right.

359
00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:50.990
But like for right now we need reinforcements or numbers or something.

360
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.980
While that's going on,

361
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.730
Bay actually ends up abandoning the forces of Morocco grabs Doug, uh,

362
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:58.790
Doug Ramsey and just runs. Right. Just like takes off running. Right.

363
00:16:58.791 --> 00:17:00.920
It's just like, okay. So like she snatches up her husband, right.

364
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.270
Because you know, she's like, Hey, you know,

365
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.190
I need to make a man out of you before, before we're done.

366
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.350
So she snatches him up. They just go running.

367
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.740
And so all the X-Men what's left of these guys are basically just fighting to

368
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:12.560
the point of exhaustion. They're just fighting like to this moment,

369
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:15.230
to this point of exhaustion. And there's not a whole lot that they can do here.

370
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.410
It's just like, like at this point you've got what you've got captain Britain,

371
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.390
you've got Wolverine, you've got apocalypse,

372
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.570
you've got storm and you got magic and that's it against this virtually endless

373
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:28.400
horde of all these guys will then out of nowhere here comes Jubilee, right?

374
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.280
Like you're going to Jubilee coming in with like all these fairy folk. Right.

375
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:33.020
Because she was just kind of hanging out with him for a little while.

376
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:35.840
I guess it's by no means like a, like a turn lane. It's not like,

377
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.990
there's like the battle is turned, right. I mean, as Jubilee, great fireworks.

378
00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:41.870
Right? She's like, you know, PDB, BDW PBL WVU.

379
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.060
She creates fireworks where there's really nothing going on there.

380
00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:47.720
But at the very least their numbers are temporarily bolstered and it does give

381
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:50.010
them a chance to kind of survive experience.

382
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.970
Now what you also end up having is Doug Ramsey talking to Bay and saying,

383
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:57.060
look like, basically I love you, right? I mean, it's more or less what he said,

384
00:17:57.061 --> 00:17:59.040
right? It's this declaration of love. Like absolutely love you,

385
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.390
but we cannot stay here. Right. We can't just run away from my friends.

386
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.790
We have to go back. We have to help them survive.

387
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.310
Like we have to make sure that they live through all of this. Right.

388
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:11.730
We have to find a way to end this tournament. I can't just leave them alone.

389
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.620
And so one of the things he kind of asked her, he's like,

390
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:17.310
you don't have to stay here. Right. You don't have to stay with, with a Rocco.

391
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.380
You can come back when this is all said and done,

392
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.400
you can come back to Coca-Cola and live among us. Right.

393
00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.700
You can live at my place, like we're married. Right. So, I mean, you know, it's,

394
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.470
it's, it'll take a little bit of decorating. I mean, it's a bachelor pad. No,

395
00:18:27.471 --> 00:18:29.950
it was a bachelor pad until like a day ago when we got married, you know,

396
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.060
and happened out of nowhere, I wasn't really expecting it,

397
00:18:32.061 --> 00:18:34.580
but you know what I mean, surprise has happened in this game of life.

398
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.370
I don't know what to tell you. So it's, it's, it's kind of a,

399
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.590
it's kind of a cool little thing,

400
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.720
but like basically of course ends up traveling back, you know, an NSO, the,

401
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:44.660
the forces are Marshall a little bit larger,

402
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:46.760
but still there's not much they can do here.

403
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.560
The funny thing about that is that when all this begins to happen,

404
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.520
as all this is taking place, you know, annihilation, you know,

405
00:18:52.521 --> 00:18:55.430
basically Genesis, you know, it's more or less possessed by annihilation now.

406
00:18:55.431 --> 00:18:58.400
It's like, it's like, we want, right. Like we basically won here.

407
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.370
This not necessarily formal because I haven't killed apocalypse,

408
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.880
but I'm going to, but I'm going to destroy this guy. We'll then from there,

409
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.810
we switch over to Saturday and a Saturday, Nene is assembling this,

410
00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:12.950
this puzzle piece. That's when she, she begins to realize, Oh my God, like she,

411
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.820
like she has to reassemble the captain Britain court more so than that, this,

412
00:19:16.821 --> 00:19:19.970
this kind of puzzle that seems really existed before, before she ever took over.

413
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.770
Was it, you know, it's a little ambiguous.

414
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.220
It all seems to point to the idea of like the definitive captain Britain and the

415
00:19:25.221 --> 00:19:27.210
definitive captain Britain is Betsy Braddock,

416
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.960
quite like the fates have more or less determined. It's Betsy, Brett. Now,

417
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:33.290
when I say the fates, I don't mean some individual out there who put this,

418
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.290
you know, box of pieces here and then said, okay, you know,

419
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:38.000
now Saturday afternoon or surprise,

420
00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:39.770
when you find out who the person is supposed to be, you know,

421
00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:41.990
it's just one of these things where looks like it's out of her control.

422
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.050
That's one of the things about other world is it's very, very ambiguous, right?

423
00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:48.680
There's a lot of talk about the fate sin and how things can unfold and you know,

424
00:19:48.681 --> 00:19:50.840
how it can end and whether or not things would turn out the way that you hoped

425
00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:52.880
it to you. It's one of those things is a little ambiguous,

426
00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:56.330
but the big takeaway from all this is the captain Britain core completely gets

427
00:19:56.331 --> 00:19:58.070
reformed by Saturn, right?

428
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.340
She reformed the entire core and the entire court comes, responded.

429
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.640
They come pouring in, they all come flying in and it's like, okay,

430
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:06.620
like our numbers are bolstered. Like we have a chance.

431
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.800
The fact that the captain Britain court is reformed is pretty cool. Right?

432
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:12.290
We haven't seen them since the events of the incursions when they were all

433
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:14.210
killed by the mapmakers in the beyond hours. Right?

434
00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:17.330
So this is the first time that we're seeing the captain Britain court fully

435
00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:21.860
reassembled now for, for the forces of annihilation, as she continues fighting.

436
00:20:21.861 --> 00:20:23.600
And as a captain Britain Corps comes showing up.

437
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.400
They're not really putting up a huge fight, right?

438
00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:27.170
There's not really a whole lot doing here. Uh,

439
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.150
and they're actually getting taken out quite readily.

440
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.700
But what she says in response to all this is like,

441
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.880
they summon an army summon one of our own, as she talks to like war,

442
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.410
like she's like summon one of our own.

443
00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:39.290
So they summoned all these just helpless looking crews,

444
00:20:39.291 --> 00:20:42.950
all these just terrible looking monsters from the world of like, literally from,

445
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.620
from like annihilation realm, something like all these different,

446
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:49.780
huge monstrous beasts and things like that. Like, it's getting kind of crazy,

447
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.760
right? It's getting absolutely bonkers.

448
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.760
And it's one of these things where you end up having side pops and Jean who

449
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:58.210
chime into magic. Now here's the, here's the thing that happens, man.

450
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.780
Here's the thing. Here's the thing that happened, that happens. So she hits up,

451
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.180
here's some psych hops and Jean [inaudible] like,

452
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.640
off and Gina hit up magic and they say, okay, like,

453
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.760
you need to open a portal for us. Right? Like we have our forces here.

454
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.310
You need to open a portal. And they're like, she was like, okay,

455
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:15.190
like I was wondering how long it would take for you guys to get here. Right.

456
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:18.040
So slammed her sword into the ground, opens a portal. And when it,

457
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:22.270
when she does, it brings in the entire sword space station, right.

458
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.980
This whole sword space station, when it opens up, everybody comes pouring out.

459
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:29.890
Right. So you've got wind pools. You've got dupe, you've got gambit. Right.

460
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.770
You've got, you got all kinds of people here. You've got Quintin choir.

461
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.940
So you got like this huge mish-mash of like all these Omega level mutants and

462
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:37.990
all that stuff. Like it's,

463
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.160
it's like almost the entire forces of Precoa like everybody who's currently an

464
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:46.380
X-Men comes pouring out into this thing and all hell breaks,

465
00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:51.160
loose nanometers. [inaudible] John,

466
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.280
John Hickman, man, man, man, man, man,

467
00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:00.000
they were not prepared. The forces of Amith ju just like the, the,

468
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.070
they, it is an absolute massacre, right? Like it's an absolute bloodbath.

469
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.650
They start so many, even more of their monsters. Right?

470
00:22:07.651 --> 00:22:10.110
Like even more of their absolute monsters. They're like,

471
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.360
she's like summing it all summing everything. Right.

472
00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:14.160
Bring everything in here that you possibly can.

473
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.350
So all these monsters start pouring in here. Right?

474
00:22:16.351 --> 00:22:18.600
Like all these things just start jumping in here.

475
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.470
The X-Men are all like fighting for their, like, like fighting for their lives,

476
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:26.310
man. Like it's, it's, it's, it's absolutely bonkers. And so from there, like,

477
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.910
like you have cable, who's kind of watching all this unfold and he's just like,

478
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.760
he's like, dude, it doesn't look like there's really a way for us to win.

479
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.220
And Saudi Dean's kind of talking to them. And she was like, what card?

480
00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:36.870
Where you dealt. And he was like the fool.

481
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.290
And she's like only a fool would really look at this sword and believe that's

482
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.230
all he's really holding. Now. Remember back when,

483
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.300
when Donovan or I'm sorry with X's sword was going on.

484
00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:48.600
Remember back when they were in the sword space station and the whole sword

485
00:22:48.601 --> 00:22:52.230
space station was taken over by those crazy looking monsters. Right?

486
00:22:52.231 --> 00:22:55.470
Those crazy looking monsters did only desire, death and destruction. Right?

487
00:22:55.471 --> 00:22:56.280
You guys remember that?

488
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.910
And they managed to push them all back through that portal and lock them away in

489
00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:03.810
the realm of death. What is happening is cables just like, Oh my God, right?

490
00:23:03.811 --> 00:23:05.130
Like, I totally forgot about that.

491
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.220
This is why Jonathan Hickman does this stuff because they've got an army of

492
00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:11.520
forces. They're just in the, in the thousands and thousands and thousands.

493
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.650
This seemingly matched the forces of a Rocco at,

494
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.350
or at least that seems to be the case. Quite that like match that huge army,

495
00:23:16.351 --> 00:23:18.810
the forces of EMyth. Like it's just waiting in the wings.

496
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.350
All they have to do is just unleash it. Right. And so like, cables,

497
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:23.940
like get me to get me to the. Right.

498
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.770
Get me to the sword ship given to that device.

499
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.630
We're all we have to do is unlock. And they're like, okay.

500
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.060
So as soon as they get in there and they literally unlocked that door,

501
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.090
all those forces come pouring in like, hell, right? Like Eliana,

502
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.140
Rasputin makes a portal.

503
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.740
So they all go flying into that portal and they show up into this realm and just

504
00:23:37.741 --> 00:23:41.220
start killing everything they find. Right? I mean, if anything,

505
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:42.950
it's like Lord of the ranger regiment where like that,

506
00:23:42.951 --> 00:23:45.030
that army of the dead guys, the ghost or whatever it,

507
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.020
but as soon as they show up, like the whole battle just turns. Right.

508
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.780
That's exactly what happens. There's this amazing moment. Right?

509
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.850
We're like one of these, these monster things are like,

510
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.990
we've suffered in a dead realm for far too long, picked its bones,

511
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.520
examine it fully. Now we seek a heartier meal and like an right annihilation,

512
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:02.710
right? Like this, this chick for the,

513
00:24:02.711 --> 00:24:04.820
the helmet chick with the wife Wilcock lift. She's like,

514
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.460
you want the full measure of a world than come preacher,

515
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.550
taste my metal and feast on Amazon. And like just a night.

516
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.620
<v 1>This guy. Right. Like,</v>

517
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.930
I love the way that Jonathan Hickman does like these one-liners.

518
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.840
<v 2>So ridiculously cool. And so like from there,</v>

519
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.990
like where she goes to make this other statement, apocalypse grabs her, right.

520
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.290
Let's like tackles her down to the ground and rips the helmet off her face.

521
00:24:23.291 --> 00:24:26.710
Right? Like rips, rips that the helmet of Amith off the face of Genesis.

522
00:24:26.711 --> 00:24:29.530
And you remember the helmet of EMyth has its own its own mind what it does,

523
00:24:29.531 --> 00:24:30.490
its own thing, you know?

524
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.190
And then anybody who wears the helmet it's possessed by the helmet.

525
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.490
And so apocalypse puts the helmet on. Everybody stops. Right.

526
00:24:36.491 --> 00:24:38.440
Everybody stops and was just like, dude, Holy cow,

527
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.700
this is really going to happen right now.

528
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.760
There's a pocket what's going to put the helmet on and apocalypse grabs it and

529
00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:46.330
sits it on its head. And like, and, and, and literally he's just like,

530
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.580
I am remade. Right. I am apocalypse. You know,

531
00:24:48.581 --> 00:24:51.580
I am totally remade him and annihilation try,

532
00:24:51.581 --> 00:24:53.740
like Emma tries to take over apocalypse, right?

533
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.250
Like an eyelash and tries to take over apocalypse. And like, and,

534
00:24:56.251 --> 00:24:58.330
and initially it seems to be successful,

535
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.670
but then like apocalypse takes over control.

536
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.490
Like he takes over control of the helmet and it's just like, no,

537
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.570
like I am apocalypse.

538
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.160
I'm not some servant to some arbitrary object that exists out there that some

539
00:25:09.161 --> 00:25:11.110
demon entities and possession of, right?

540
00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:14.410
Like when you step into the realm of apocalypses sphere of influence,

541
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.750
you fall to the influence of apocalypse, right.

542
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:21.640
I will not be controlled by anybody and just totally dominates the helmet now

543
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:22.840
while all that's happening.

544
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.620
And the way in which we know that everything is going to turn is ISCA turns

545
00:25:26.621 --> 00:25:28.240
against the forces of, of a Rocco.

546
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.220
<v 1>And that's when they realize we're not going to win. Right. Like.</v>

547
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.310
<v 2>Literally her power is to always win. So as soon as she turncoats,</v>

548
00:25:33.311 --> 00:25:35.380
then it's like, okay, then we've basically lost here.

549
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.920
And that's what apocalypse steps that Saturday in and says, can you hear me?

550
00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:41.290
And she says, yes, I can hear you and I can see you. And then he says,

551
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.880
then fine, I, as,

552
00:25:42.881 --> 00:25:47.650
as a host of annihilation and the leader of the forces of, of the Iraq army,

553
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.420
I surrender and just.

554
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.270
<v 1>Gives up and that gives the wind to cacoa right.</v>

555
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.200
<v 2>Dude. It's amazing. Manager's like, dude, that's so that's such a ridiculous,</v>

556
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.320
equal idea. And this Saturday is like, cool, done. Let's do this. Right.

557
00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:00.560
So she goes flying in with.

558
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.850
<v 1>Go dragon, right? Who's dragon fire member has the ability to melt realm.</v>

559
00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.270
<v 2>And just like literally punches a hole in this fabric of space,</v>

560
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.040
which rips through all the forces of it.

561
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.620
<v 1>Of EMyth. Right. And like rip them all through. And even those,</v>

562
00:26:11.621 --> 00:26:14.140
those weird demonic looking force entity guys. Right?

563
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.750
<v 2>So those are all more or less out of the way, the demand,</v>

564
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.250
the weird guys and the other dimension,

565
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.890
they're all pulled back in the forces of, of AMA.

566
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.860
<v 1>Kind of waiting to find out what their orders are going to be. Especially like,</v>

567
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:24.850
like what do we do now?

568
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.920
<v 2>And so essentially the, the helmet is pulled off of apocalypse Saturday.</v>

569
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.080
<v 1>Structures it, and turns it into a staff, which is actually really,</v>

570
00:26:32.081 --> 00:26:32.800
really great.

571
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.630
<v 2>Cool. And then from there, it's kind of like, okay.</v>

572
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.100
So like now that this content.

573
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.830
<v 1>Is basically done, then I want to show a good faith,</v>

574
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.310
but I want to show a good faith that you guys are not going to wage war against

575
00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:44.880
each other again. And when question is, what's the show of good faith.

576
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.450
She's like, I want a mutant from cacoa to go to a Rocco.

577
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.580
And I want a meeting from a Rocco to go to Coca-Cola.

578
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.300
<v 2>That's what I, that's what I require. That's what I asked now.</v>

579
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.040
<v 1>Kilt with apocalypse. Uh, basically he ends up going with the Rocco forces,</v>

580
00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.390
right? He ends up joining a Rocco.

581
00:26:59.391 --> 00:27:02.600
Now this is not mean that Marvel is getting rid of a pocket. If anything,

582
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.510
they're probably just kind of keeping him on the back burner for a little while,

583
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.650
because in reality, this whole extra swords event was a story about apocalypse,

584
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.200
but that's basically all this was, it was just a story about apocalypse.

585
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.230
But when the question's asked, who basically speaks for Coca-Cola,

586
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.190
who from Coca-Cola is going to demand somebody from a Rocco come to their,

587
00:27:19.191 --> 00:27:21.980
come to their location. Apocalypse says as the only member,

588
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.560
or really the highest ranking member of the quiet council here,

589
00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:25.820
I will speak for Precoa.

590
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.260
And the person that I choose from a Rocco to come to cacoa is the entire Rocko

591
00:27:30.261 --> 00:27:32.480
nation, the entire Island itself. Right.

592
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.290
I want the Island of a Rocco and that's true. Remember a Rocco is a,

593
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.340
an Island and it was one half of Kakoa when they were Oak Hora. Right.

594
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.740
That's the whole idea. And they were split in the,

595
00:27:42.741 --> 00:27:45.230
in the sense of like all these forces showing up in the first place.

596
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.790
And apocalypse was basically the one that did it.

597
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.230
He's reuniting the Island of cacoa with the Rocco

598
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.950
recreating. Oh, Cora. But he's doing it at the sacrifice of himself.

599
00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.100
He is leading with his forces and it's one of these cool things,

600
00:27:58.101 --> 00:28:00.980
because what it does is it transforms the character of apocalypse.

601
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.870
It takes them away from this guy. Who's just like, Oh,

602
00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:03.980
we're just going to the shore stuff.

603
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.460
<v 2>That's the people who are, you know, the most fit to make sure they're,</v>

604
00:28:06.461 --> 00:28:07.580
they're actually fit, you know,

605
00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:10.570
and just kind of be a Dick from time to time anal and, and, you know, and,

606
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.740
and the transforming from like that guy into,

607
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.410
I am basically sacrificing my place on the quiet council.

608
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.330
So I can be with my wife and my kids. Right.

609
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.720
<v 1>It makes him a tragic hero. And it's amazing. It's absolutely amazing.</v>

610
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.380
That's why stories like this are so cool because Jonathan Hickman is so good at

611
00:28:24.381 --> 00:28:26.690
changing up the entirety of characters.

612
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.300
And so what you get here is a little bit of an epilogue,

613
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.240
and I'm not going to spoil too much here because I believe this is going to go

614
00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:32.840
into.

615
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.080
<v 2>What is it? The, the reign of X, N like N L. Okay. I'll, I'll,</v>

616
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.190
I'll throw this out there.

617
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.720
It looks like Jim Jasper's is going to kind of seize control, right?

618
00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:42.590
Like it's going to focus.

619
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.020
<v 1>On Jim. Jasper's kind of rising to control.</v>

620
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.380
<v 2>And then who knows what's going to happen. Right. Who hasn't had it yet?</v>

621
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:53.330
<v 1>Here's something I want to make clear to you guys. Saturday was bound by magic,</v>

622
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.340
right? She's bound by the limits of magic.

623
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.470
So there's only so much you can do there.

624
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:59.780
She's bound by like the limits of fate and all that kind of stuff.

625
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.790
When it comes to other world is all kinds of tradition,

626
00:29:01.791 --> 00:29:03.740
fade all pomp and circumstance, all that kind of stuff.

627
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.090
Jim Jasper's is a crazy guy with the ability to manipulate up to, you know,

628
00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:10.340
everything up to and including the most reverse, right.

629
00:29:10.341 --> 00:29:13.460
This guy is just a as on a whole nother level, right?

630
00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:16.220
Like Jim Jasper's is ridiculous. Now, like Jim Jasper's,

631
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.320
if he's anything like the way he was before,

632
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.050
but has more fine tune control over his powers,

633
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.770
then they've probably been expanded. Right. And if they'd been expanded, if Jim,

634
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.633
let me, let me put it this way.

635
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:30.200
If Jim Jasper's weakness that he has to have a reality to manipulate an order to

636
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.890
be on B, be it as absolute peak. If that weakness is removed,

637
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.460
Jim Jasper's is right up there with like the living tribunal. If it's re if,

638
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.190
if that's removed, I'm not saying it is, but if that's removed,

639
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.010
Jim Jasper's is well beyond the.

640
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.280
<v 2>Marquis of death and Matthew Malloy and protege and all those guys,</v>

641
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.020
he's right up there with living tribunal.

642
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:49.270
If not between the living prime Udall and the one above all,

643
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.760
like there's no limit to what he can do. That's a big if,

644
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.980
and we don't even have any idea what they're going to do with this character.

645
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.980
Right? So don't take this as an absolute truth. I'm not saying that it is,

646
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.890
but as kind of bonkers, right. It's kind of crazy because when,

647
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:01.720
when the dust settles and everything Saturday,

648
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:04.570
and really kind of retakes her place as the Omni Versal magistrates,

649
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.890
and she got pretty much everything.

650
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:08.080
She wanted the reformation of the captain Britain core,

651
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.360
the one person she didn't get was Brian Bradick, you know,

652
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:13.210
she of course wanted him more than anybody else. But in essence,

653
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.210
the entire Omni vessel development court has been restored.

654
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.220
She's back to being the Omni bristle magistrates.

655
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.050
And the captain Britain core has been returned.

656
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.080
That's one of the reasons why I wanted to cover the, uh,

657
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:26.680
the original Magnum Jasper story, all that stuff is coming back.

658
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.080
What all that stuff is, is basically back to the way it was before.

659
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.900
So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end. Uh,

660
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.320
I loved XO sorts. I love the Xs swords event. It was so good.

661
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.910
But if you guys are new here to comments, explain it,

662
00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:38.980
make sure you guys are the sub button to become part of the rod poor.

663
00:30:38.981 --> 00:30:39.970
If you guys enjoyed this video,

664
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.120
make sure you drop a light and that we'll catch you all later.

665
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:44.790
<v 3>Please.</v>
