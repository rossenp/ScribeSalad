4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.830
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.830
<v 1>This is Rob. And for the first time in recorded Marvel history,</v>

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.120
Wolverine meets Matt, Jim Jaspers. And this is hugely exciting.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.670
I am so excited about this because it's just a cool moment, right?

8
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.730
It's just a cool part of this story. But before we get into that,

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.960
we pick up with the next part of our battle, right. Of our X's swords event.

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.270
And this picks up and the Holy Republic effect,

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.890
which leads to the floating kingdom of Romo Regina kind of passing through a

12
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.450
portal to access another location.

13
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.800
And what we have here is Iliana Rasputin facing off against hogger pod, right?

14
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:45.440
One of the forces of a Rocco kind of a weird name,

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.200
it's a little bit interesting guys, basically like a giant crocodile thing.

16
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
But the funny thing about this is that with Iliana Rasputin,

17
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.360
she is prodigious with a sword,

18
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.330
not to mention when you add in the various magical effects that come with the

19
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.030
soul sword, along with her ability to use magic as well.

20
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.400
This fight is a non-starter right, is done.

21
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.920
The problem is this is not a sword fight.

22
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.900
This is an arm wrestling contest Saturday and changes it on a

23
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:13.220
whim. She's like, Nope, ah, this is a contest of arms. So hands, class,

24
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.920
shoulder square elbows, and the pocket pin to win.

25
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.270
And it's like arm wrestling seriously. And of course, hotter pocket decimates,

26
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.800
Iliana, rest people. Now,

27
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.870
one of the things that we're going to find out here in one of the things you're

28
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:26.480
going to see over the course of this is that there's something pretty sketchy

29
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:28.850
going on, right? And we kind of talked about that in a previous video.

30
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.970
Some things pre seem pretty sketchy, but with poker POG, the Victor here,

31
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.110
the score now stands at a Rocco three cacoa one. And so at that point,

32
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.330
we switch over to a place called the blight spoke,

33
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.190
and this is a wholly new environment,

34
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.110
but it was created by Jonathan Hickman in this story.

35
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.160
The funny thing about this is that this is a, an interesting scenario,

36
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.410
an interesting situation, historically speaking,

37
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.470
when it comes to alternate realities and Marvel comics,

38
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.780
every universe that dies is reborn again.

39
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.530
And it really kind of follows the function that that universe is destroyed and

40
00:01:57.531 --> 00:01:59.630
then kind of coalesced into a new universe.

41
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.130
So it doesn't really matter how it happens.

42
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.130
So if you were to take like the main Marvel universe, or you were to say,

43
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.230
this universe reaches his inevitable heat death,

44
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.120
which is to say the point at which it's going to die,

45
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.370
you have the big bang where everything expands outwards,

46
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.420
and you have the big crunch where it all condenses back into a singular singular

47
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.750
point of energy. And it explodes in a big bang and is reborn again. But say,

48
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:18.471
for example,

49
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:22.430
somebody like Jean Gray as the dark Phoenix lost her mind and wiped out the

50
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.980
whole universe, the universe would be singularly destroyed.

51
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.530
And that would be the end of it. Right? That would be the end of that universe.

52
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.550
In previous years, it was always assumed that the end of that,

53
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.920
of that universe would lead to it being reborn, right?

54
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.140
It would just somehow come back into existence. Again,

55
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.020
what Jonathan Hickman does is he says, Nope, that doesn't happen.

56
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.080
When a universe is destroyed prematurely. In that form,

57
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.150
it goes to a place called the blight spoke. And the blight spoke is,

58
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.900
is kind of a composite of just dead realities, right?

59
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.600
Where they all just sort of coalesced into a singular landmass, right?

60
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.760
So if you were to say like the United States, for example,

61
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:55.910
is a combination of dead realities, then like Chicago is like,

62
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.940
there's like an alternate reality. And New York is an alternate reality.

63
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.910
California is an alternate reality, right?

64
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.060
Like all these cities and all these States are all just alternate realities,

65
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.710
but that they all kind of share this,

66
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.100
this sort of energy that's called the blight energy and a sense that when a

67
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.150
person's there, it quite literally drains off your life essence, right?

68
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.530
It'll kill you over time.

69
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.650
That's the reason why Wolverine and the summoner are brought here is because

70
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.660
they are, they have a healing factor and they are,

71
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.210
for the most part indestructable, that's kind of what they're referred to.

72
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.360
But the reason why this fight is so intriguing is because we're Wolverine

73
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.560
finally calls out seminar.

74
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.040
And somebody responds to them that what they end up doing is literally falling

75
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:33.250
through different realities. And as they fall through these different realities,

76
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.380
they experience a kind of reality shift.

77
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.920
So in one universe they're just covered in bugs, right?

78
00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:40.870
Bugs basically took over this entire universe and killed everything in

79
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:44.290
existence. And another universe is more old school. And another universe,

80
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.530
you have a scenario where seminar is actually kind of like an old man,

81
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:50.890
Logan type character. There's one universe where they're all kind of futuristic,

82
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.660
right? There's all kind of bounces.

83
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.900
And it changes around one word like the mini angled, one conquered everything,

84
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.080
right. One where their chess pieces is just any possibility that exists.

85
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.160
There's a universe for it.

86
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.500
And that's one of the things that Marvin never really explored. And in fact,

87
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.940
a lot of you guys had a really cool idea for a video that I will make that I'm

88
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.690
actually going to make on that. Not really a video per se,

89
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.120
but a kind of book series that I'm actually gonna, I'm gonna talk about that.

90
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.160
I'm gonna make a separate video on that because I think it's really,

91
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.310
really cool. But at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, uh,

92
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:17.470
Wolverine manages to get the upper hand on summoner,

93
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.440
stabs them through the eye and kills him. And he loses.

94
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.680
And the reason why is because Saturday comes along and says, Nope,

95
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.050
this was a fight to the death. Summoner fought to the death, Fanta stay alive.

96
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.190
Therefore you lose.

97
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.180
As you guys can tell odds are basically stacked against Coca-Cola that what it

98
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:37.290
looks like is happening is Saturday is basically cooking the books in order to

99
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:40.290
ensure that Precoa loses. Now, from that point,

100
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:43.650
we switch over to the crooked market. And this is basically just the bar,

101
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.060
this run by Jim Jasper's,

102
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.430
where you have Wolverine and you have storm sharing a drink.

103
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.730
And what we ended up getting is basically a card presented to them whereby it's

104
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:51.990
a drinking contest, right?

105
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.050
They both have to drink and whoever lasts the longest ends up winning the

106
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:57.900
benefit of this is that it's a guaranteed victory for Coca-Cola.

107
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.100
It's a guaranteed point.

108
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:02.160
But the funny thing is that Jim Jasper has kind of have this quick little

109
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:03.360
conversation with Wolverine,

110
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.870
where he talks about the blindness is bloody magnificent is what he refers to it

111
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:07.260
as right.

112
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.530
This drink called the blindness is one of the most exquisite things that either

113
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.650
of them will ever put into their mouth. Now, I can't reiterate this enough.

114
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.340
This is the first time this ever happened to me. Let me tell you something, man,

115
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.770
to me, this is exciting. This is hugely exciting.

116
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.100
Jim Jasper's meeting the X-Men for the very first time.

117
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.010
This only matters if you're a fan of Jim Jasper's,

118
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:28.980
but this guy could end these guys like that. And in fact,

119
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:32.130
Jim Jasper's will actually show off his powers here in a little while here.

120
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.170
And I think, uh, in the next video that would do who's.

121
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.190
He goes to show off his powers.

122
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:37.830
You'll see the kind of stuff Jim Jaspers is capable of,

123
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.150
but one of the fan theories,

124
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:42.210
and this is a genius idea that one of you guys came out with one of the theories

125
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:43.950
that you guys came up with on discord, as you said,

126
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.790
what if Jim Jaspers is actually the one controlling everything and Saturday,

127
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.200
it's just doing what he tells her to.

128
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.060
He's the one who's actually in control of this.

129
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.000
And Saturday as a servant to him, what if that the case? And I was like,

130
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.000
that's kinda nuts because that's entirely possible, right? I mean, this guy,

131
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.050
a universal shaper, he can control any space that he's in.

132
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.140
It's ridiculous how powerful Jim Jaspers is and a whim.

133
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:06.050
He could turn these guys into ants, right? Wolverine and storm.

134
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.330
He could break them down and just turn them into stone.

135
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.740
He could turn them into each other.

136
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.470
Why did he get turned Wolverine in a storm and storm into Wolverine? He could,

137
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.780
he could do any number of things, right? This guy, there's no limit,

138
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.900
whatever it is he can imagine doing. It becomes reality, right?

139
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:19.610
That's just how powerful this guy is.

140
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.820
But what we also into finding out is that as they're drinking this Wolverine

141
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:26.240
starts to get drunk and that doesn't happen because remember Wolverine's healing

142
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.860
factor keeps them from getting drunk.

143
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.500
Now that is alcohol in the main mobile universe.

144
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.450
This may be an entirely different breed,

145
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:34.670
or at least that seemed to be the case until we find it,

146
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.090
find out the horseman death. Who's currently a part of the, uh,

147
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.040
of the Iraq enforces working for a while ago.

148
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.790
He presents an artifact to Jim Jaspers and we ended up finding out what death

149
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:48.590
did is he bribed Jaspers to poison the drink of Wolverine and storm to

150
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:51.320
make them drunk. Not only that as they start to get drunk,

151
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.990
that the picks up with the next battle between the forces of ProCoach.

152
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.320
So the forces of Rocco that worked at Koa got a battle amongst themselves.

153
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.900
A Rocco got a battle amongst themselves, as well as well.

154
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.040
And the logic behind this according to Saturday,

155
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.620
and is that they all originated from a singular landmass, the landmass of ACARA.

156
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.610
And so in essence, it is basically groups that are part of the same community,

157
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.400
all fighting against each other, right? That's the stance of Saturday and

158
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.290
[inaudible], they're basically fighting themselves. And that's why these,

159
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:20.980
these kinds of battles among the Cohen and Arakan forces as part of this

160
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:22.210
tournament is taking place.

161
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.600
But what you end up getting here is basically solemn facing off against the

162
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.440
horseman of war.

163
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.800
And this is a personal vendetta because remember solemn had killed the husband

164
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:32.110
of horseman work at some point in the past.

165
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.800
But the caveat to this is that if you guys recall solemn and Wolverine met each

166
00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:39.130
other, and a bargain was struck between the two that they were both tasked with

167
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:42.610
tracking down the Mura Masa blade, and that solemn had gotten his hands on both.

168
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.600
And so he was only going to relinquish his blade to Wolverine if Wolverine would

169
00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:47.290
strike a deal.

170
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.860
And that deal is brought into full freight when Wolverine is teleported away

171
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:53.680
from the storm and brought to this conflict drunk as a skunk.

172
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.460
And the bargain that was struck was that at some point in time at a time of his

173
00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:00.130
choosing Wolverine would fight in the place of Solomon.

174
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.140
And he's calling in this, these calling in this favor.

175
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.380
Now the funny thing about this is that it doesn't really seem to matter that in

176
00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:08.860
reality here, that because solemn has adamantium skin,

177
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.120
that it wouldn't really make any difference,

178
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.040
war would not be able to defeat the solemn.

179
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.820
So something else seems to be going on here. It is. We don't fully know,

180
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.280
but with Wolverine being here and being absolutely drunk,

181
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.100
he also reveals that he's the one who killed somewhat,

182
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.700
or of course being the son of horseman war. And so solemn killed her husband,

183
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.060
Wolverine killed her son. The horseman war is. And so because of that,

184
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.190
she starts losing it right. Starts going off on Wolverine, full blast. Now,

185
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.950
Wolverine, really, you know, kind of experiences this, this hut.

186
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.980
And one of the things that Saturday Dean really a comment she really kind of

187
00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:41.800
makes here. And what's really interesting is she draws a great,

188
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.550
a great concept here. She says, you've become reckless. You become reckless.

189
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:48.970
And the face of the fact that one you can heal from anything and two,

190
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.520
the resurrection protocols can always bring you back.

191
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.320
You've become exceedingly cavalier.

192
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.850
You don't know what it's like to fight to the death anymore. And that really,

193
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:59.640
I would, I would say is a great analysis. That's the winning edge.

194
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.310
The X-Men have lost since they've been on cacoa.

195
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.240
The funny thing is that the idea of creating cocoa or bringing all the X-Men to

196
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.930
that Island in the first place by Xavier was to create a place where the X-Men

197
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:10.011
and,

198
00:09:10.011 --> 00:09:12.960
and really the mutant population could have their own government can have their

199
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.140
own, their own Island mass, but in the more macro scale, right,

200
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:17.370
the much larger scale here,

201
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.100
it was all done from what we saw during house and powers of 10,

202
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.630
right house of X powers of 10, uh,

203
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.050
that we basically saw this situation where a war was going to happen at some

204
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:25.830
point in the future.

205
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.100
And so all of it seemed to have been done for the purpose of making the X-Men

206
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.940
stronger and even apocalypse himself in the early days when his family and his

207
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.860
horsemen ended up inside a Rocco,

208
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.650
he made the promise to his wife that he would make the world stronger.

209
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.040
But in giving people the ability to always come back from the dead,

210
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.370
you make them weaker because suddenly none of the battles that they're in matter

211
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.370
because their philosophy is will no matter what happens, I'll always come back.

212
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:50.160
So even if it's not a conscious thought, it's a subconscious thought.

213
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.630
Even if I die, I'll come back.

214
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.780
And so they lose the edge that they get when they play for keeps.

215
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.360
And that's the point that Saturday makes that you become reckless.

216
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.560
You become complacent. The Wolverine of yesteryear would have slaughtered war,

217
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.180
right. Would have absolutely ripped through war.

218
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.650
This battle would have been a non-starter.

219
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.280
The horseman war would have died so fast, but over the, over the years,

220
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.400
his healing factor, all those things playing in Wolverines losses edge.

221
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.310
And it's really kind of a way of Jonathan Hickman criticizing the publishing

222
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:17.940
history of Marvel in saying you've taken away from the full of ferocity of one

223
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:19.770
of the most ferocious characters and Marvel,

224
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.080
because over time he always just comes back.

225
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.500
And so what we end up finding out is a caveat from having that drink at Jim

226
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:26.340
Jasper's bar,

227
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.400
as part of the bargain that was struck between Jim Jaspers and the horsemen of

228
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:31.890
death is that when they were poisoned, it took their powers.

229
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.810
Wolverine has lost his healing factor.

230
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.640
He doesn't have the ability to come back from the dead.

231
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.270
And so you ended up having a war who manages to pin him, get the upper hand,

232
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.770
and then go for the killing blow.

233
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.040
But of course she cannot actually kill him because he has an adamantium

234
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:45.360
skeleton. But in the end,

235
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.380
the whim is given directly to sportsman war because Wolverine cuts off her hand.

236
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.590
But the problem with Wolverine cutting off her hand is that's not a killing

237
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.930
bloat because Forsman war got the killing blow.

238
00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:57.990
Even though Wolverine didn't actually die. The victory goes to a Rocco.

239
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.690
Now I'm of the mind that has had an IMR playing fair,

240
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.450
the victory would have gone to Wolverine because he can't be killed.

241
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.600
And because he can't be killed, there's no way it can be a fight to the death,

242
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.430
right? So that would have been the end of it. But again,

243
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:11.940
it's one of these things where it looks like Saturday is intentionally cheating

244
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.140
in order to make sure the forces of a Rocco come out on top. And if that's true,

245
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.990
then the question becomes why. But with that being said, guys,

246
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.070
we're to bring this video to an end,

247
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.470
if you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

248
00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:24.630
button to become part of the rod core. If you guys enjoyed this video,

249
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.310
make sure you drop a light and.
