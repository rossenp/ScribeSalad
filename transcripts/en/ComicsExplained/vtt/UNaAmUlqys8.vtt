4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.630
Okay.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.490
<v 1>So we are picking up with the new mutants as part of swords of X part six.</v>

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.180
And this one is totally different from the video that we did with the hellions,

7
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:22.940
right? The hellions was a lot more comedic, more of a dark humor. Actually,

8
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:26.720
this is part seven. I think if we take into account, um, extra sorts creation,

9
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.870
right? It's kind of what that is. Nonetheless. Um, this one's pretty dark,

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.560
right? It's not really dark. This one's, uh, just a different kind of tone, but,

11
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.370
um, this, this one really picks up, uh, with it being written by ed Brisson.

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.510
Of course, you know, it's going to be amazing,

13
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.300
but this one picks up with magic Guiliano, Rasputin,

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.420
basically hitting up like Cyclops and cable and kind of telling him like, Hey,

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.010
well you got to grab your sword. You got to come here.

16
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.710
We've got a really cute thing going on. You gotta bring your sword. Right.

17
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:50.900
You know, as part of the whole swords of X event, basically come here,

18
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.750
stand on your altar and get ready for the whole baby huge thing.

19
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.710
Not a whole lot going there.

20
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.190
The really big moment kind of comes with regards to warlock. And, uh,

21
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.840
and Doug Ramsey. Now Doug Ramsey,

22
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.600
most of you guys are familiar with just because of our coverage of Donald X,

23
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.210
right? He's the guy that can basically understand any language.

24
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:07.490
And he's the one that translates for cacoa itself.

25
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:11.150
Whenever cacoa wants to speak to the, to the quiet counsel or, uh,

26
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.670
when the quiet council has a question for Coca-Cola or something along those

27
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:16.310
lines, but warlock is a more interesting character, right?

28
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.150
So warlock appeared back in 1984 and he was created by Chris Claremont and bill

29
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:20.984
sinkewitz. Right.

30
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.350
And the whole idea behind warlock is that he comes from a planet that's never

31
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.280
really identified,

32
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.000
but the idea of the planet is that it's basically kind of a living techno

33
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.430
organism, right? Like the people, the Denisons,

34
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:33.800
its native citizens are like living technology.

35
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.410
And the way this works is that when parents give birth to their kids,

36
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.130
the kids basically prove their ability to live by fighting their parents to the

37
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.040
death. And if the kid kills their parents, the kid continues on,

38
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.350
they have their own offspring and the cycle continues.

39
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.530
But for the case of warlock, he actually rebelled against this ideology, right?

40
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:51.380
He didn't, he didn't really believe in fighting against anybody.

41
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.200
And so with his father basically being the ruler of the world,

42
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.680
he essentially fled. And of course it's this led to a great, big, huge chase.

43
00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:00.620
And he eventually landed on earth and then ended up in countering the X-Men and

44
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.300
more or less became part of the Savior's team, uh, or at least the,

45
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.270
the new mutants for quite some time. Right.

46
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:08.180
So that's kind of the longest short explanation of him, much like hellions.

47
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.550
I feel like we should do a video on him in the same way that we should do a

48
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:11.630
video on wild child.

49
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.310
But the idea here is that a warlock has basically been a long time friend of the

50
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.130
X-Men. Right. And that's why warlock refers to himself as self.

51
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.190
He refers to dog as like Doug friend, right?

52
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:24.200
It's like a computer talking to people. He's also a little janky.

53
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.600
If you guys remember him on like X-Men the animated series.

54
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.420
<v 0>Yeah. He was, he was a little, you know, a little janky, you know, a little,</v>

55
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:29.870
a little.

56
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.110
<v 1>We are.</v>

57
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.400
But the idea is that Doug is as soon as the part of the people who were supposed

58
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:37.280
to fight here on cacoa, but the problem is that he's not really a fighter,

59
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.710
like he's a translator, but he wants to be a fighter. Right.

60
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:42.560
He wants to be something more than the guy who just translates things.

61
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.340
And that's kind of the crazy thing is that Doug's weapon is supposed to be

62
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.110
warlock, right? That's, that's kind of what his weapon is supposed to be. And,

63
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:50.390
and we're like basically says like,

64
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.360
I can turn myself into a sword and we can fight together, you know,

65
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.880
but it's kind of crazy because initially he kind of says, you know,

66
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:58.700
why should he use a sword? And like started hiking down trees and stuff and,

67
00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:00.430
and was like, no, you don't either. Right?

68
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.590
And that's when Eliana respite and appears and Ileana,

69
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.130
Rasputin's kind of takes Doug under her wing and starts training them on how to

70
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.070
fight the problem with this is that Doug is not a fighter.

71
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.590
He's never really been a fighter. That was never really his thing.

72
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.590
He's like Sage, right. He's almost kind of like the brains behind the operation.

73
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.220
And that's one of the biggest issues that he runs into is that in his little bit

74
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.000
of a kind of bout with Iliana Rasputin, he's taken down quick, fast,

75
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.130
and in a hurry, right. He's taken down so quickly.

76
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.080
And the response of Iliana is you're, you're,

77
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.660
you're supposed to be one of the 10 champions fighting for earth.

78
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.670
And that the issue is that if you die out there,

79
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.650
there's no guarantee you're going to come back the way you are.

80
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.530
The reality is you just need to stay here, right? Like you just,

81
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:36.550
you just need to stay here.

82
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.730
And it's one of these things where you kind of switch over to the quiet counsel

83
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.510
and you have this kind of discussion taking place between cacoa and Doug.

84
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.210
And of course, you know, basically Greco was talking in a language that nobody,

85
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:47.680
but Doug can really understand.

86
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.710
And it's a little bit of bickering going on as a quiet council is, you know,

87
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.940
having their discussions or what have you,

88
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.670
or seemingly as sinister is getting ready to go on his mission, right.

89
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.120
Going on with mission with the hellions. But the whole gist here is that, uh,

90
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.870
you know, the, the mission of sinister is kind of questionable. And that's when,

91
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.410
when Doug kind of asks a question, like what happens if Sinisters mission fails?

92
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.360
And the idea is, well, I mean, you know,

93
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.450
we'll explore that option when we get to it, but for right now,

94
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.390
there's no real point in, in really focusing on anything else, right?

95
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:15.010
Like we'll, we'll focus on those things. You know,

96
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:18.460
you just worry about being our translator. It's one of these things where,

97
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.940
where even Kurkova himself is on board with the idea that Doug doesn't go,

98
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.180
right?

99
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.510
The Doug is basically the person who represents the voice of Coca-Cola on the

100
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.990
quiet council. So Agricola can be heard. He's kind of necessary in that way.

101
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.420
But with Doug himself, he's like, you know, the rules have been set.

102
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.420
I was chosen to be part of the tent. I want to fight.

103
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.780
And the idea here is that they're kind of looking at a, looking at a,

104
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:40.810
at the possibility of replacing Doug with somebody else,

105
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.540
sneaking somebody else in to take Doug's place.

106
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.580
Instead of Doug actually being the one to fight now,

107
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.290
whether or not that can be done, we don't know.

108
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.880
And we have to believe based on the prophecy,

109
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.740
that there's a reason why Doug was chosen.

110
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.600
Maybe there was no reason why maybe it was just arbitrary.

111
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.280
It was just luck of the draw. It's Doug,

112
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.380
he's going to be the one to fight and he's gonna be the one to die. Right?

113
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.620
Like we don't really know, but kind of continuing his training sessions with,

114
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.470
uh, with magic chicken tenus to get the upper hand on him.

115
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.640
And the reason why is because Doug's not using his powers the way he needs to

116
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.600
that with Iliana being so hard on him could call it initially kind of comes to

117
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.490
the rescue, but duck says, no, let her go.

118
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.080
And this is one of these things where it's like,

119
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.810
Eliana is doing our best to just try to keep him alive by,

120
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.670
by teaching him to be an effective fighter.

121
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.400
Chris Eliana had to learn the hard way. When, when she was a little girl,

122
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.140
she was taken to limbo. She learned, you know,

123
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:25.120
the black arts and all that kind of stuff. She learned how to fight.

124
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.120
She had to learn to survive. And that's really what Doug has to learn here.

125
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.030
He has to learn how to survive because the truth about this is that with Doug

126
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.720
being so important on Coca-Cola and a lot of ways he's been mollycoddled by the

127
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:36.370
X-Men, right? Like they take care of him.

128
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:39.040
They make sure that he's kind of prized above almost all others,

129
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:41.860
because his job is to just kind of, you know, be an interpreter,

130
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.200
but he doesn't want to be resigned to that kind of a situation. Right.

131
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.730
And plus it's a boring life, you know?

132
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.030
And that's when Eliana cottage harms in and says, understand the stakes here,

133
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.090
Doug, like, this is not a small thing when Doug's like, I wasn't, you know,

134
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:53.740
I really wasn't doing that bad. She's like, no,

135
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:57.410
you don't understand what this is. Right? Like these are apocalypse as children.

136
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.910
And they literally crushed him without breaking a sweat. They kill.

137
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.601
It's something that we,

138
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:06.440
as the X-Men have almost never been able to do what we've almost never been able

139
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:08.960
to kill a apocalypse. We've never been able to do that. Right.

140
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:11.090
All we've ever been able to do is fight him off.

141
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.430
They were able to punch a hole in him. Right.

142
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.730
They were able to injure him in a way that we've just never been able to do.

143
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.420
Those are the forces that we're fighting up against and you are fumbling and

144
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.510
bumbling. Right. You don't know what you're doing. So yeah. I mean,

145
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:26.840
I guess in the grand scheme of things, you didn't really do that bad,

146
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.550
but the reality is you did terrible,

147
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.580
but in comparison to the people who were fighting out there, and that's true,

148
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.290
right? Because you look at Eliana Rasputin,

149
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.920
she's a hardcore dyed in the wool fighter. You look at storm, it's the same way,

150
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.560
Wolverine. It's the exact same way. Then you have cipher,

151
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.330
but this guy understands languages.

152
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.660
And as one of these things where he kind of kind of muses to himself and says,

153
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.550
you know, kind of gets irritated at Iliana, right?

154
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.800
Because she doesn't seem to believe that he understands the stakes,

155
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.920
but he says like, I'm putting my life on the line to save others. Right?

156
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:55.010
Like that matters. Doesn't it. And that's when Exodus pops up and says,

157
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.790
it does matter, but understand. No one's going to sing songs about your life.

158
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.300
No, one's going to tell stories about it because it won't be worth telling your

159
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:05.630
skill is language, not battle. Right? That's what you're here for.

160
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.730
You're here that you're here to interpret language.

161
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.090
You're not here as a fighter. Why you were chosen is anybody's guess.

162
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.990
But it's obvious to the quiet council is obvious to Eliana [inaudible] and it's

163
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:18.230
obvious to you. You're not a fighter. You're not here to fight.

164
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.850
And it's one of these things where XO says,

165
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:21.440
maybe there's some kind of a loophole, right?

166
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.020
Maybe there's something that we can do as soon as there's plan fails. You know,

167
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:24.980
when his plan fails,

168
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.830
maybe there's something we can do where we can switch you out with somebody

169
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:31.520
else. Right. If the, if, if Ben a dupe, Harry was given the, given the sword,

170
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:34.970
right? If, if Exodus was the one who was going to fight, he would probably win.

171
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.880
Right. And he would probably do better than anybody else. Right? Keep in mind,

172
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.350
Exodus is an Omega level. Telepath. This guy is hugely powerful. I mean,

173
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.500
the world shakes with the kind of power, this guy possesses, right? It's just,

174
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:49.850
it's kind of nuts. But at the end of the day, the stance is Doug was chosen.

175
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.940
Doug has to be the one to fight, right.

176
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:54.650
Doug has to be the one to engage in this conflict.

177
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.090
And so when he's back in his quarters,

178
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:59.210
he's met by really Mondo kind of taken over by Coca-Cola.

179
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.340
Agricola tries to reiterate it again, right?

180
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.580
Like there must be a way to send somebody else in your place.

181
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.550
The whole world's against him. But like the whole world is against Doug.

182
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.230
No one believes he can succeed.

183
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.720
And the reality of this is that can be disheartening,

184
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.550
but there's also something just great about standing in the face of everyone who

185
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:19.040
told you that you couldn't and then you do,

186
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.470
but there's just something about proving them all wrong.

187
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.850
And even if they don't admit it,

188
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.700
knowing that they know they have egg on their face,

189
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.280
knowing that they know that they were foolish to question you,

190
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.590
they were foolish to tell you that it couldn't be done. And that's,

191
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:32.780
what's so cool about that because that's the relatable thing, right?

192
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:34.790
Like with comments, explain, I ran into that.

193
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.190
I ran into people who told me you can't do that, right?

194
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:38.660
You can't be a full-time YouTuber.

195
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.600
There's no way you can succeed at that and look where I am now. Right?

196
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:44.450
And they're, they're stuck with egg on their face, looking like buffoons.

197
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.190
They were foolish enough to question me.

198
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.970
And there's a great kind of empowerment that comes with that.

199
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.000
And I would say this really kind of proves to be the turning point of Doug

200
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:56.700
Ramsey because he just kind of breaks and he's I've had enough. I can't run.

201
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:59.910
I can't hide. This is the responsibility has been bestowed on me.

202
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.390
I'm scared out of my wits. Right? Like you have to understand. I'm terrified.

203
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.600
I know that I might not come back. I know that I may die out there.

204
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:09.750
And if they resurrect me, I won't come back as a person that I was before.

205
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:13.050
I'll lose all my powers or I'll come back twisted and evil who have, you know,

206
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:16.050
I have no real idea, but understand. This is my response.

207
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.230
And that's usually what it takes. Right?

208
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.400
It takes this idea of people having a thing that they want to achieve and being

209
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:25.430
met with adversity and every conceivable way, right?

210
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.800
Sometimes this adversity is in your own head, right?

211
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:30.050
It's your fear is your anxiety. It's your nerves.

212
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.170
It's your depression is any number of things that are constantly just bumping up

213
00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:36.320
against you and telling you it can't be done. There's no way it can be done.

214
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:38.780
If you could have done it, you would have done it by now, right? Like all these,

215
00:09:38.781 --> 00:09:40.670
all this negativity that feeds into you.

216
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:43.040
And then when it comes from the outside, people who are telling you,

217
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.650
you're making every mistake, you're not doing this. You're not doing that.

218
00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:48.470
You're screwing up. Then all it all kind of it's like boiling over.

219
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.160
And then something just snaps. And it just turns into I can't.

220
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.610
And then as it's just a matter of, I don't care what anybody else has to say,

221
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.640
the voices get silent. And it's just this pure determination.

222
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.430
That's what you're left with the desire, not to prove to them,

223
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.060
but to prove to yourself that you can actually do it. And that's what happens.

224
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:08.240
Right? Doug goes into his training session with, with Eliana Rasputin. And he,

225
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:10.610
by no means comes out as like a world-class swordsman,

226
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.240
but he starts using his power. He's countering every move she's making,

227
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.880
he's making all the right moves. And he's saying, because I look at you,

228
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.280
Elliot Rasputin, and your moves are a language.

229
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.630
I understand what you're going to do.

230
00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:22.580
I can predict what you're going to do before you do it.

231
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.640
I can read you the way you move, how you fight your style.

232
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.460
It's no different than understanding French or English or Spanish.

233
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.130
It's just in this instance, I'm understanding sportsmanship.

234
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.750
I'm learning the language offensive.

235
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.670
And because he's able to pick up on it so fast,

236
00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:37.910
his skill starts to increase at an almost exponential rate.

237
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.330
And one of the first things he picks up on with Elliana is you're letting me

238
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.730
when you're holding you back, why are you doing this?

239
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.160
Why are you holding back like this? And she says, you know,

240
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:50.480
you have the potential to use your powers, to overcome anybody that you fight,

241
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.430
because you're, you're like taskmaster, right?

242
00:10:52.431 --> 00:10:53.960
Like you will learn to fight like them.

243
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:56.630
And you'll learn to understand how they fight as you fight, right.

244
00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:59.270
You'll be able to overcome them. And so as that time, you know,

245
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:02.030
when that progresses, one thing that, that I'm afraid of,

246
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.970
and one thing that concerns me and believe me, when I tell you this,

247
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.300
that if you raise your sword to fight anybody on other world,

248
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.480
it'll be the last thing that you do. That there's nothing you can do to stop it.

249
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:14.660
In essence, that while he is making progress and he is getting better,

250
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.290
he's still ill-equipped to face off against the forces that are out there to

251
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:21.710
face off against those various threats. Still a little bit of opposition there.

252
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.560
But if I'm being, if I'm a betting, man, if I'm being honest with you guys,

253
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.200
which I feel like as often as I say that I'm a betting man, ah,

254
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.870
then I would say, this will come down to Doug Ramsey.

255
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.090
Like it'll come down to cipher. It'll come down to him,

256
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:35.720
basically being the one who will most likely come out on top and save the day.

257
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.850
If he doesn't think Recode is kind of screwed.

258
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.020
But at the moment we are four sorts captured. Five of we include cable,

259
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.720
we've got four or five more to go. So with that being said, guys,

260
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.000
we're gonna bring this video to an end. If you are new here to comments,

261
00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:49.610
explain to me that you guys have the sub button to become part of the Rob pork.

262
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.530
Do you guys enjoy this video? Make sure you drop a,

263
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.880
like now we'll catch you all.
