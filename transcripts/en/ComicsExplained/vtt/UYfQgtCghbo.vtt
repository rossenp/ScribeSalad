00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.380
<v 0>Hey, what's going on guys. This is Rob.</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.800
This is just to let you guys know I'm going to be selling Rob core rings here in

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.100
the next couple of weeks. I found a way to sell them an unlimited quantity.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.070
So I'm only going to sell them about 20 rings at a time.

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.530
They're going to be first come first serve. Right?

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.710
So you can announcement in a video at the beginning of the video.

7
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.690
So keep your ears out, make sure you guys check the videos out,

8
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.030
but I'm going to make an announcement at the beginning of the year, you know,

9
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:21.860
and say, Hey guys, Rob court rings are for sale.

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.620
Make sure you guys check the link down in the description. And, uh,

11
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.770
and then once they're gone, they're gone until I reopened it again. And, uh,

12
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:30.140
until I restock and then make more rings available,

13
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.050
it will go in this fashion forevermore when I'm, you know, depending on how the,

14
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:37.310
the turnout to this is never stopped selling Rob port rings and just kind of

15
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:39.320
keep it on there and just sell them forever and ever, and ever,

16
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.630
and just do it in like, you know, sections do it.

17
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.270
Like I might do it one week and then wait two or three weeks and do it again.

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.180
Maybe I'll do it once a month and just kind of do it randomly over the course of

19
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.980
the month. I'm not entirely sure either way,

20
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.300
we're going to start selling Rob port rings.

21
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.860
So I figured I would make you guys aware of it.

22
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.520
So you guys will have your chance to buy them and yeah, let's start the video.

23
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.070
Okay. So this is going to be a unpopular opinion here, right?

24
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:02.480
This is going to be an unpopular opinion,

25
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.750
but I feel like this is what Tom King's Batman run should have been.

26
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.180
Like the more I get into this, the more I'm kind of like, I like this more,

27
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.080
but I, I did enjoy Tom King's Batman run, but I feel like this is great.

28
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.090
The way it's being done waves being handled with Bruce Wayne.

29
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.210
And I'll tell you guys why once we get towards the end of this video,

30
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.280
but this initially picks up with ghost Hunter. I'm sorry.

31
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.640
Ghost maker tracking down Bruce Wayne. Right now,

32
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.100
remember we still don't know anything about this guy, right?

33
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:28.280
We still don't know anything about ghost maker, but this deals with the past,

34
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.540
right? And this has kind of a cool thing.

35
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.890
This is a cool concept where we get to see the early days of Batman.

36
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.550
This is not uncommon now for those of you guys,

37
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.830
you don't know what I mean in the, the,

38
00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:39.650
the period after the events of prices on infinite earths and BC's experiment

39
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:43.040
with whether or not Batman could continue to hold a title. Post-crisis right,

40
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.710
because they almost canceled him in the sixties and seventies.

41
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.900
We ended up getting Batman year one, right after,

42
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:50.900
after the dark Knight returns and Batman year one was kind of a retelling of

43
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:53.060
that man's origin story. But following that,

44
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.710
we got what can largely be considered to be a lesser known line of comics called

45
00:01:57.711 --> 00:01:58.730
tales of the dark night.

46
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.880
But tales of the dark night were a series of stories that were told by different

47
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:02.241
writers.

48
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:05.570
It was kind of a rotating cast of a writers and artists that basically dealt

49
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:08.100
with the early events of Bruce Wayne's life, right? Like either the,

50
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.920
the time when he led up to becoming Batman,

51
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.590
but mostly the time after he became Batman, right?

52
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.480
Just kind of an immediate interim period.

53
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.660
And what this did is it kind of fleshed his character out with different

54
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.660
adventures, his relationship with Superman, why it is they're good friends,

55
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.060
different things along those lines. And so what we get here,

56
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.700
it's kind of that in a more condensed form, right?

57
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:28.550
In the sense we're basically seeing the introduction of ghost maker when he and

58
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:29.690
Bruce Wayne were younger.

59
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.240
And what ends up happening here is he basically tracks him down to a kind of

60
00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:34.910
desert. And we can tell that there's almost,

61
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.220
I wouldn't really say there's a friendship between these two,

62
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.530
but there seems to be a mutual respect. Right?

63
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.320
And that's kind of the shaky thing about how James Tinian does this.

64
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.750
They don't really hate each other, but they don't really like each other.

65
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.010
They don't disrespect each other,

66
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:48.380
but they don't really have a whole lot of respect for, I don't,

67
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:51.440
I don't really know exactly how this kind of relationship can be characterized.

68
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.270
Maybe it's just one that's highly competitive,

69
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.360
but given the things that are going on right now between ghost maker and Batman,

70
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.430
there doesn't really seem to be a lot of love loss there.

71
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.520
But the whole thing about this is that, uh,

72
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.930
that there's this kind of discussion.

73
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.860
Wayne says that today's his anniversary of when his parents died.

74
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.710
And that's why he doesn't want to fight ghost maker. At that point in time,

75
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:10.620
he says, just leave me. I'm training out here. And that the response is built.

76
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.120
Smoker is no you're brooding, right?

77
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:14.610
That doesn't count is that the whole point of this training session is to be

78
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.140
conscious of every grain of sand.

79
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.900
Bruce Wayne realizes ghost makers already done this.

80
00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:22.350
And that's one of the general consensus of his character is that he is always

81
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.850
seemingly one step ahead of Batman. When it comes to training that in, you know,

82
00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:27.401
in a, in a,

83
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:31.260
a one-on-one confrontation ghost maker will almost always win because everything

84
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.990
that Bruce Wayne's learning now, he already learned, right?

85
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:35.550
He's just that far ahead of him. Now, again,

86
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.400
we don't know where all this originated from. We know that he came from Gotham,

87
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.170
but we don't know this is like a childhood rival.

88
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.230
That's just continued on all the way up to the here and now we don't really know

89
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:44.580
a whole lot about what's going on here. Right?

90
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:46.860
We don't really have the full on origin of ghost maker.

91
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.440
And so we're just kind of left to these little flashbacks that we get from

92
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.290
tenure here and there, they kind of give us an indication of what's going on.

93
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.690
But one of the things that he says here is that, uh,

94
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:57.240
that he kind of apologizes to Bruce. And Bruce's kinda like why me?

95
00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:59.010
I didn't really think that you felt things like that. They,

96
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.160
you wouldn't really care that my parents died. And his response was like, no,

97
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:03.810
I don't. I don't really care that your parents die.

98
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.240
I'm apologizing to you because you're going to fail.

99
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.370
But you allow your emotions to rule you.

100
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.240
And because you have emotions that makes you weak, you have to be emotionless.

101
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.420
You have to approach something like this, not caring about people,

102
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.840
because it's the only way to truly function in this chaotic world.

103
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.690
And so what you end up doing is jump forward and Johnny Ford to the here and now

104
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.980
where we left off with the last,

105
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.800
the last story where you had ghost maker facing off against Batman.

106
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.560
Now the cool thing about this is in, in, in all honesty,

107
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.430
I think ghosts maker is a better Batman than Batman, right? Like I really,

108
00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:34.890
really, really think he is one of the first things that happens.

109
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:36.540
You've got Oracle, right? You've got Barbara Gordon.

110
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:39.720
Who's using all of her intelligence abilities to try to read and on everything

111
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.750
that goes to maker's doing. And the response of Batman is don't. If you do that,

112
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.380
his, his ghost net will literally just like work into your system. And it'll,

113
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:48.450
it'll, it'll start destroying all your computers, right?

114
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.480
The whole purpose of the ghost net is to make sure nobody can track it, right?

115
00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:53.130
It's a cannibalized computer algorithm.

116
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.040
It'll find your computer system and eat it apart. The other thing is like,

117
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:58.260
this guy is not to be trifled with right.

118
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:01.710
This guy is serious business indicating he's got a lot of resources.

119
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.650
The funny thing about that is that in this kind of conversation between Batman

120
00:05:04.651 --> 00:05:07.110
and ghost maker, ghost maker kind of responds and saying like,

121
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:09.450
you used to make fun of the name that I had in that. Interesting.

122
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:12.870
You said you didn't need a mask or a pseudonym to fight crime in Gotham,

123
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.070
but look at you now you're Batman. Like how clever is that a man dresses, a bat,

124
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.790
good job, Bruce Wayne, you sure showed me. You know, it's, it's one of these,

125
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:22.290
these funny little things, right? One of these,

126
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:24.300
these funny almost where he's kind of taunting him. He's like,

127
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:27.150
how long was it when you came to Gotham that you became Batman?

128
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.580
Were you here for like a week? Were you here for like maybe a month,

129
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.540
but somewhere along the line,

130
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:34.290
you realize how stupid that ideology was and you would need some kind of an

131
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:38.340
identity in order to basically shield yourself or to, to, to scare people.

132
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.151
And that's kind of, what's,

133
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:41.850
what's nuts here is because Batman basically says it we've been beating ghosts

134
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:43.950
makers since they were 20, which may very well be true.

135
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:46.880
But ghost maker responds in saying like, do you know what I've done? And,

136
00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:50.100
and just the time that I've been here and I've been here for only 12 hours,

137
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.060
do you know what I've done?

138
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.230
I leak the criminal activities of 14 different district judges just to your

139
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:56.310
Gotham Gazette, right?

140
00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:59.600
You're in you're inept are basically taking him into custody right now.

141
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.810
I solved a string of homicides, but your same cops couldn't solve.

142
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.880
And now they're putting the killer into Arkham asylum.

143
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.930
And I sent the FBI the location of six shipments of heavy artillery from Santa

144
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.590
Prisca. I did all of that before I even left my plane. Right.

145
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.200
This is how much better of a Batman I am venue.

146
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.830
I solved all these crimes and you haven't done it yet. If you haven't done it,

147
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.390
if you're so capable and you haven't done it yet,

148
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.460
why haven't you done it now from there? Of course it leads to, you know,

149
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.400
indicates he's going to go directly after count Hunter.

150
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.710
And that's when Batman basically tells him get out of here. Right.

151
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.740
And so it basically kind of boils back down to Batman versus ghost maker again.

152
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.650
And that's, what's kind of awesome is he basically tells Batman, like,

153
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.260
you're failing. You are, you are failing superhero.

154
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.710
Like you're a guy who's trying to, you know, keep Gotham under control,

155
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.020
but you're failing in almost every conceivable way, right?

156
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:45.050
Like you have sadistic villains who get back onto the street and they kill just

157
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:47.540
as many people, if not more than they did the last time.

158
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.570
And you hand them over to a justice system that, you know, cannot control them,

159
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.900
but you hope that it can one day and then they get out and the whole cycle

160
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:57.320
repeats itself, right? If you really wanted to keep Gotham city safe,

161
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.280
then you would kill them all.

162
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.190
You would kill all those various sadistic criminals that you have out there.

163
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.930
And then you would say, that's enough, right?

164
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.420
Because you're not out of control of your emotions.

165
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.170
Surely you can objectively look at the things your villains had done and come to

166
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:13.070
the rational conclusion that they should die and then create a line in the sand

167
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.870
that you simply just don't cross. Like that's,

168
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:17.150
what's interesting there because it does create like these really,

169
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.190
really interesting philosophical, moral limits,

170
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:23.480
because insane that I guarantee you as clear as, as sure as the sun will rise,

171
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.390
people will automatically come out with a cookie cutter argument. Well,

172
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.600
if you change this line in the sand, kill, change that line in the sand. Right.

173
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.180
And it'll just kind of keep on sort of creating those arguments. Right.

174
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:35.120
But from there you switch over to, to, to Harley Quinn, right?

175
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.110
And Harley Quinn is here talking to a plant that kind of poison Ivy have she

176
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.050
grabbed out in the park somewhere. Now I may be a little bit behind here.

177
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:44.240
I don't think I am. As far as I'm aware,

178
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.080
I think poison Ivy is still dead following the events of heroes in crisis.

179
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.930
Honestly, I don't remember the ending of that story. All that well,

180
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.650
to be quite Frank, honestly, I don't really think most people do.

181
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.530
I thought heroes in crisis was great until you got about to the end.

182
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:00.410
It was a cool, interesting ending, but it was kind of like, you know,

183
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.240
but nonetheless, if I'm wrong, correct me. Right.

184
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.340
Cause I did a little bit of poking around and I couldn't really find a

185
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:07.670
definitive answer. But the, the whole point of this is that poison Ivy is,

186
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.340
is like, it's really kind of keeping up a mento of her. Right?

187
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.560
Which all points to the idea that poison Ivy is dead.

188
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.780
But common Hunter shows up out of nowhere, right.

189
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:16.430
And immediately starts going towards this check.

190
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:19.310
Now there is an origin of count Hunter that we can cover it.

191
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:20.780
If you guys are interested. Honestly,

192
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:23.780
the reason why I haven't done it yet is I wasn't really sure you guys would be,

193
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.390
but we can cover it if you guys are interested. If you guys want to see that,

194
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.940
let me know down in the comment section, but Holly Quinn,

195
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.250
this is the funny thing about Harley Quinn, right? Historically speaking,

196
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.880
Harley Quinn kind of muses to herself about this idea that she's more or less

197
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.680
lived her life based on what everybody else wanted.

198
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.740
And that was the significance of poison Ivy's role in her life.

199
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.680
And that's why you see her in such a way that when clown Hunter shows up,

200
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.700
she's just kind of like, you know,

201
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:46.010
I'm not going to kill you because in years past you would have,

202
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.570
right in years past, she would have been with the joker.

203
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:48.890
A joker would have said, kill him for her.

204
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:51.440
She's kind of doing her own thing right now. Of course,

205
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.060
she manages to get the upper hand on him,

206
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.270
but not before he reveals to her that his weapon is called the bat bat,

207
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.090
which is kind of an amazing name. Right. I guarantee you,

208
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.700
people are going to be cost playing once Comicons open, back up.

209
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.390
I miss Comicons and I miss hanging out with you guys at Comicons.

210
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.730
I miss that man. You guys are so fun to hang out with.

211
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.090
I just met with a fan Andrew yesterday here in Columbus and bought him lunch.

212
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.170
I thought I left my wallet at home.

213
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.720
It turned out it was in my car the whole time. So I was kind of panicking. Like,

214
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.030
am I really going to hang out with a fan? They're going to have to buy me lunch.

215
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.580
Like, I feel like I feel terrible if that happens. But uh,

216
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.510
I found a wallet in the car,

217
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.420
but I bought him lunch and we hung out and just like for like two and a half

218
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.120
hours, three hours, and just like hung out and talked about nerd stuff.

219
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.040
So I miss, I miss hanging out with you guys.

220
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.650
I miss like seeing you guys spending time with you guys. I miss that,

221
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.720
but I feel like once con's opened back up again,

222
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.510
people are going to cosplay as clown Hunter. Somebody is,

223
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.000
and they're going to have the bat bat and it's going to look awesome.

224
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.410
But you know, he kind of gets the upper hand on Harley quintuple, rarely.

225
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.070
But the funny thing about clown Hunter is for all the zealousness that he has

226
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.840
and for all the candor that he has,

227
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.380
he is still painfully inexperienced.

228
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.440
He's just a really off kid who believes he's doing the right thing,

229
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.180
getting out there and tearing stuff up.

230
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.840
He's very indicative of Bruce Wayne in the early days of Batman, right.

231
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:03.750
Just flying by the seat of his pants and needing a bit of a guiding hand.

232
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.690
But the funny thing is in the midst of all this, once Carmen Hunter subdued,

233
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.140
Batman comes crashing in through the window with a sword in his back.

234
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.500
And Holly Quinn's of course, Tanya clown Hunter. And, and,

235
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:14.190
and it's kind of one of these things where like this,

236
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:15.630
this sword is sitting in his back, she's like,

237
00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:18.810
do these sorts of cool and clown and ghost makers like, yeah, man,

238
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.600
they really kind of are. He's like, I presume you're Holly Quinn, right?

239
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:24.000
You're the boy's target. And she's like, are you some kind of an assassin?

240
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.980
You know? And he's like, I'm not an assassin. I'm a crime fighter.

241
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.110
I'll call the ghost maker. And she's like, that's a dumb name.

242
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.200
<v 1>And he's like, this city sucks. And like attacks and just like subdues her.</v>

243
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.100
<v 0>You know, it was like, man, this city sucks. Wolfville well, well you're stupid,</v>

244
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.300
you know? And then like knocks her out.

245
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.800
So it was obvious that that ghost maker is still very immature in some ways.

246
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.500
But then this is when Batman pulls the rug out from under it.

247
00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:46.610
And this was one of the things, and this is,

248
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.830
this is one of the things where I would kind of challenge Batman on this.

249
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.370
And what he basically says here is that the serial killer that was handed over

250
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.660
to, to, you know, Arkham asylum that Batman had that basically CA uh, Cassandra,

251
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.810
Canada been tracking that guy for quite some time in order to find out like

252
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.580
where he worries stores his trophies, right?

253
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:03.980
Because it took a trophy from every single person that he killed.

254
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.530
And the idea is that now the families aren't going to have that they're going to

255
00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:07.460
have to live with hearsay.

256
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.400
They'll never really know how many victims he had when it came to the,

257
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:13.730
the judges that were busted. They were all working for tiger shark, right?

258
00:11:13.731 --> 00:11:16.700
A well-known villain well-known super-villain in, in DC comics.

259
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.540
And that ghost maker just destroyed. What is N w what is an essence,

260
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.910
an entire Rico case Rico, of course,

261
00:11:22.911 --> 00:11:25.670
being racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act right,

262
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.110
is a part of the, uh, the organized crime act of 1970s. Really in 1970,

263
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.730
it was designed to combat organized crime.

264
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:35.090
Something that the federal government created when they implemented prohibition.

265
00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:36.560
Right. But he's kind of like,

266
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.990
like these guys were all being all being surveilled, right?

267
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:41.600
Like I was going after tiger shark. I didn't care about the judges.

268
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.180
We would take them down too, but I was going after him. Right.

269
00:11:44.181 --> 00:11:46.550
If we bust the judges and we have all this evidence,

270
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:49.040
we can intern BAS tiger shark under the Rico laws,

271
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:52.130
because he basically instructed them to commit all these crimes, you know?

272
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.520
And then when, uh, when he's talking the Santa Prisca Shipman, he's like,

273
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.680
I infiltrated that shipment six days ago.

274
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.800
And I replace all the weapons with faulty shells and was waiting to take down

275
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.750
their buyers here in Gotham city. Now,

276
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.110
all this evidence that Batman presents is really designed for the purpose of

277
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:08.140
saying I was playing a much bigger game than you thought I was.

278
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.520
But the funny thing about this is that this is not necessarily Batman as ghost

279
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:14.530
maker remembers him. This is Bruce Wayne.

280
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.500
Who's learned a few things in the early days of Gotham.

281
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.990
He would've shown up just like that. Right. He would have,

282
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.020
he would have reacted the exact same way that ghost maker did,

283
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.490
but in his early adventures in Gotham,

284
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.950
he would've just sort of taking down major guys were taking down, you know,

285
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.980
over the criminals happened to be it wasn't until the various experiences of

286
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:33.640
Bruce Wayne got in saying, okay, we have things like the organized crime act.

287
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.820
And we have, you know, section nine Oh one a, which is the Rico statute.

288
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:38.590
Like we have all these different things that are out there.

289
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.460
I can use those at my disposal and help build cases against the bigger guys,

290
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:44.410
right? Because if I take a drug dealer off the street,

291
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:46.810
there'll be another one tomorrow. But if I take off the guy,

292
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.120
who's actually supplying drugs to the drug dealers,

293
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.540
then that puts a huge wrench in the works of the people out there who are trying

294
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:54.700
to run these great, big, huge criminal empires.

295
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.860
But the crazy thing about that is that at the end of the day,

296
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.710
ghost maker still has the one up on Batman.

297
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.100
And the reason why is because he looks at clown Hunter and he says, okay,

298
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.770
so like maybe I was a little, I jumped the gun a little bit, right?

299
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.850
Maybe I was overzealous.

300
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.880
And I was in such a desire to prove to you that I was better than you.

301
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.030
Then maybe you got the upper hand on me on these things. So here's my question.

302
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.410
This kid count Hunter killed 24 people in the midst of jokers last attack.

303
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.060
That's more than three times.

304
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.930
The number of people that are serial killer had killed and you're protecting

305
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:26.170
him. Why is this kid not in Arkham asylum? Why is he not there?

306
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.370
Why is he not locked away?

307
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.340
And the response of Batman is because if we throw them in Arkham asylum,

308
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.570
where if we do them in black, a prison,

309
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.970
the guards will agree with what he was doing. And they would enable him.

310
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:35.170
And he was like, didn't, we should kill him.

311
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.320
And Batman's only response is he's 17 years old, right.

312
00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:39.850
He watched his parents die in front of him.

313
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.820
He's a by-product of his experiences. But at the end of the day,

314
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.750
the question that you kind of have to ask here is at what point does Batman stop

315
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.080
making excuses for people? At what point does that happen for those of you guys,

316
00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:52.150
if you ever get a chance, there is a, well,

317
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:54.580
at least there was a Hungarian philosopher named Agnes Heller.

318
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:57.520
She actually passed away a little while ago, but she had a really good book.

319
00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:59.290
And I want to say, it's called the theory of feelings.

320
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.840
And she talks about why people commit crimes. As she says,

321
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.990
crime crimes only ever really happened under one of three circumstances.

322
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.520
There's crimes of profit crimes of passion and crimes of compulsion that a crime

323
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:10.510
of profit is a,

324
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:13.690
is a crime where a person commits it and doesn't care about the consequences.

325
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.670
The profit does not have to be monetary.

326
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.090
It's simply just a thing a person gets in return for committing that crime.

327
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.210
Maybe it's some kind of self satisfaction, some kind of enjoyment.

328
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:24.190
They get out of it, whatever the case happens to be, right?

329
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:26.380
So like they enjoy killing people and it,

330
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.610
and it satiates a happiness inside their body to do that right inside their mind

331
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:33.040
in order to commit those crimes. And the answer is a clown Hunter.

332
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.510
It is one of these things where he's like,

333
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:38.500
I find satisfaction in taking these guys out because I believe they're bad guys.

334
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.000
The second thing is a crime of passion.

335
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.730
A crime of passion is one of these things where like you come home,

336
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:44.290
like you find your man in bed with another woman,

337
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.940
you just freak out and stab him to death, right.

338
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:48.010
It just happened spur of the moment. And, and it's just, you know,

339
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:48.441
that's where they,

340
00:14:48.441 --> 00:14:51.200
they call going into like a psychotic rage or something like that.

341
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.120
You couldn't control yourself. A blackout.

342
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:54.680
You hear about cases like that sometimes.

343
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.680
And then a crime of compulsion is you're driven by it,

344
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.150
but you cannot help yourself.

345
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.880
The joker is somebody who commits crimes out of compulsion, right?

346
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:05.300
He's compelled to do things that will get Batman to chase after him,

347
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.470
depending on how you want to slice it.

348
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:09.110
That's why he's been written consistently over the years is because he commits

349
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.770
crimes under one of those three circumstances, profit, passion, or compulsion.

350
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.770
But for the, for the character of count Hunter, he knows what he's doing.

351
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.600
He understands that he's killing people.

352
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:20.990
He gets the rhyme and reason behind it because he understands the nature of his

353
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:24.050
actions and the gravity of his actions. You can't make excuses for him.

354
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:26.690
He can't say, well, I mean, you're only 17. That kind of a thing. No,

355
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:29.630
you knew what you were doing. And then in turn, you, you treat them accordingly,

356
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.980
right? Which means he goes under arrest.

357
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:32.480
He goes into the justice system and in turn,

358
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.490
maybe sentenced to execution or something like that.

359
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:38.210
And the instance of what ghost maker is saying here is if they hand them over to

360
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:39.110
the justice system.

361
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.740
And Batman's concern is that the guards will agree with him and they'll enable

362
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.790
him. And he'll in turn,

363
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.780
make the justice system even more corrupt than the only way to STEM that tide is

364
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.400
to kill him, but just take them off the board,

365
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.590
which is not an unreasonable argument to make.

366
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:54.260
But regardless of how you decide to slice it at the end of the day,

367
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.830
the responsive ghost maker with everything going on here is that fine, right?

368
00:15:57.831 --> 00:15:59.150
If this is going to be your attitude,

369
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.150
but you're constantly going to make excuses for everybody out there who commits

370
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:05.420
a crime, how it's somehow not their fault and they can be redeemed.

371
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.450
Then I will make Gotham better right now on the surface.

372
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.450
This is hand wavy on the surface. This is, Oh my God.

373
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:15.050
We've seen this story a million times before, but not like this with Bain,

374
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:18.320
he took over Gotham city and just turned into a giant criminal enterprise,

375
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.260
right. And was using like villains as a means to run the, run, the show,

376
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.410
running the town with joker, he just turned the entirety of Gotham into madness.

377
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.470
This is a cool story to see a person who comes along,

378
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.190
who legitimately could actually make Gotham better, who is able to,

379
00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:35.090
to become a full measure where Batman is a half measure. And then in turn,

380
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.950
we get to see what happens after that.

381
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.670
Would Gotham actually be a better place under the rule of ghost Hunter?

382
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:43.550
Or would it be just like this fascist totalitarian kind of place?

383
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.360
We don't really know.

384
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.240
And I feel like James Tinian wouldn't take it in that direction. If he did.

385
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:48.410
I feel like it'd be a travesty.

386
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.490
I think the best thing he could do is to actually make Gotham city an inherently

387
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:55.040
better place, right? Like criminals are just executed, right?

388
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:57.800
They're just killed. Not, not like baseline drug, dealing criminals, but like,

389
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:00.680
this is a district ones, right? People who kill, who kill other individuals,

390
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:01.221
right? Like, you know,

391
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:03.530
they're just executed on the spot and that's basically it,

392
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.590
if it's done in that way and any other way, right. That, that,

393
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.940
that I'm not considering here.

394
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.410
And Gotham actually becomes a much better city and it's better under ghost maker

395
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:15.680
than it ever was under Batman. That would be an amazing story.

396
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.990
Not because it would give us room to get rid of Batman,

397
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.200
but because of the fact that it would show us what things Batman could use from

398
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:24.800
that to make Gotham better versus what he does that makes Gotham worse.

399
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.180
It'd be a great dissection of the nature of Batman and whether or not he is

400
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.480
actually good for Gotham city. It's a great philosophical concept.

401
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.700
So with that being said, guys, we're going to bring this video to an end.

402
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.430
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

403
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.650
button to become part of the Rob court. If you guys enjoy this video,

404
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.110
make sure you drop a light. Now we'll catch you all there.
