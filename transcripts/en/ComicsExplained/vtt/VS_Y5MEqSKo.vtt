4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.690
What's going on.

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.610
<v 1>Guys. This is Rob and we are picking up with the conclusion of dark nights,</v>

6
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.180
death metal, right? We are completely done with this event now. And I feel like.

7
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.280
<v 0>A little bit of explanation is needed here, right? Because there's a few things.</v>

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.550
<v 1>They go on first and foremost is Diana Prince wonder woman as she exists in her</v>

9
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:30.800
current form versus the Batman who laughs.

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.830
And I've seen a little bit of confusion in the comment section about this and

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.230
the, the videos that I've made. So I'm going to clear this up real fast.

12
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.090
Diana is powered by anti-crisis energy and the Batman who laughs is

13
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:44.960
powered by crisis energy. Now the question is how do these things work?

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.870
So crisis and anti crisis energy are in effect.

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.060
Allegories is basically all the are, right?

16
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:54.140
That a crisis energy is the representation of selfishness, right?

17
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:57.500
The idea of focusing on the present of living in the here and now,

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.450
and not really caring about anything else,

19
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.590
Andy crisis energy is tied to the idea of recognizing that memory.

20
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.730
That history is all one significant thing and that the entire history of

21
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.150
superheroes, despite all the crisis events connects them. All right.

22
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:14.270
So it's almost one of these things where crisis energy is the notion that heroes

23
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.120
have kind of lost themselves in so far as the fact that they're part of this

24
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:18.920
great big, huge grant, half a street, right?

25
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.830
It's like standing in a room in a house and not knowing there's any other rooms

26
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.990
or refusing to see them we're as anti crisis.

27
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:26.240
Energy is kind of like we're in this great, big, huge house,

28
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.590
and there's all kinds of history here.

29
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.690
And it's important that we recognize it right now.

30
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:31.490
They represent two different types of powers.

31
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.760
And the funny thing about this is that selfishness is Scott Snyder puts it

32
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.660
selfishness.

33
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.620
And in really seemingly crisis energy itself at the outset seems to be more

34
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:43.760
powerful than anti crisis energy. Now it's not Scott Snyder saying that like,

35
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:44.121
you know,

36
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:48.350
selfishness is better is simply means to say that if you look at things in the

37
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:49.910
moment, that appears to be the case,

38
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.230
but the power of anti crisis energy comes and drawing into the past and looking

39
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:55.490
at the bigger picture itself.

40
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.330
And that's exactly what happens when it comes to Diana and the Batman who laughs

41
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.280
with these guys facing off against each other.

42
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.450
That is just as much of a physical battle as it is a metaphysical battle, right?

43
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.030
In the sense of Batman who laughs does things like he grabs the Titans,

44
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.010
takes away the powers and throws them, you know,

45
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:12.710
and like with the intention of killing them and then Diana saves them and then

46
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:14.390
he attacks her while she's distracted.

47
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.640
That kind of a thing like you see that kind of situation going on,

48
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:19.790
but it's also a metaphysical and this sense that their fight is happening on a

49
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:20.750
much grander scale.

50
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:24.590
So literally when he attacks her and basically punches her and sends her fine,

51
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.040
he sends her flying through both time and space to the point that they actually

52
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:32.210
traveled back to 160 million years ago. It's interesting because even goes,

53
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.270
as far as to say that with this whole scenario going on,

54
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.130
he makes this sort of offhand remark, right.

55
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.950
And says that maybe if folks respect the past this time,

56
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.190
that big rock simply just won't go, boom. Right. And this is,

57
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:45.740
this is kind of a double meaning and we'll find out what the second meaning of

58
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:47.270
this is once we get to the end of the story.

59
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.660
But in the moment when he says that he's talking about this idea of earth,

60
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.400
right. That if people respected the past,

61
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.880
that if people had learned from the past that it basically would lead to this

62
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:58.610
idea that like we wouldn't have the, the world in his current state.

63
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.880
And here's the why that happens right. As we're kind of going through this,

64
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.400
right? You got Wally West fighting, Barry Allen, you've got, uh,

65
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.520
you got Aqua Bambi attacked by his mom. You've got swamping from, uh,

66
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.940
from like the dark multi-verse attacking swamp in a positive multi-verse right.

67
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.770
Got those great, big, huge fight going on. Um,

68
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.720
one of the things that this really kind of hits that here,

69
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.750
the reason why this is important is because when it comes to the heroes,

70
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.010
understanding their past,

71
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.210
it was the writing of DC comics at the time of those crisis events to ensure the

72
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.690
heroes would not really remember their past coming out of the events of prices

73
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.780
on offenders. There were a few heroes who did remember right. Wally West,

74
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.960
for example, remember it because it was by virtue of Barry Allen dying.

75
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.410
And then Wally West being aged up from kid flash into adult flash,

76
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.410
due to the event, the energy from crisis on infinite earths.

77
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.580
Then he became who he was. Right.

78
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:41.740
So he remembered there were a few other people here and there,

79
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.440
they kind of remember it, but it was really murky and really kind of crazy.

80
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.921
For example,

81
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.940
like Supergirl didn't really get a proper origin that reconciled her existence

82
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.270
after the death of the multi-verse until you got to around like zero hour and

83
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.500
infinite crisis. Right. I mean,

84
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.590
not even like immediately after crisis on infinite earths was that rectified

85
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.311
with hop man.

86
00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:01.210
He was a multi-vessel character that existed and didn't really get an updated

87
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.560
origin until something like four or five years after the first crisis events.

88
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.380
So it was, it was pretty murky and kind of all over the place, leaving out the,

89
00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:10.000
the publishing problems that that DC had at the time,

90
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.540
the long and short is that when the original crisis on infinite earths event

91
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:16.300
happened, that the heroes, most of them didn't really remember.

92
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:19.600
I would say something like 99.9, nine, nine, 9%. Right. All,

93
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.840
but maybe like a couple didn't really remember what happened or that the

94
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.210
multi-verse existed or any of that stuff. Right.

95
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.310
You go into infinite crisis and they they're, you know,

96
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.330
the multi-verse comes back,

97
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.960
you go into final crisis and the heroes are basically told the multi-verse came

98
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.480
back. So I was like, okay, but their history, their life,

99
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.510
as they existed before the events of crisis on infinite earths,

100
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.550
that was still lost. They still didn't know about that.

101
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.620
They knew the multi-verse existed at some point in time,

102
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.590
but Superman didn't remember what his life was like back when he was being

103
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.890
published in the stories before the events of crisis on infinite earths,

104
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.070
having essentially limitless power that he didn't really remember any of that

105
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:51.641
stuff. Right.

106
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:54.160
You go into the events of flashpoint where Barry Allen tries to save his mom's

107
00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:56.890
life. He basically ends up realizing things go South if he does.

108
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:57.880
So he just let her die.

109
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.900
And then DC reboots with the new 52 and the heroes lost all their knowledge

110
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.740
about their, their existence before the events of flashpoint yet again. Right.

111
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:08.920
So they lost knowledge. And then what knowledge they did have they lost again.

112
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.770
Right? So it's kinda nuts. It's, it's one of these things where, uh,

113
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.100
it's it's heroes constantly being written in a way by virtue of,

114
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:16.600
of DCS publishing standard.

115
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:20.330
It would seem that they only ever really live in the moment, but what,

116
00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:22.720
what this really kind of points out and the whole status,

117
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:26.290
and really the whole position of Diana is to eliminate that concept by

118
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.950
destroying the Batman who laughs she would destroy essentially all the memories

119
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:32.410
that were lost by virtue of the crisis events.

120
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.570
And so while the crisis events will have happened,

121
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.290
crisis on infinite earths took place, infant crisis, final crisis flashpoint,

122
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.150
while all those events still took place.

123
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:44.290
Instead the heroes lack of knowledge of what their life was before those events

124
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.530
happened would be restored. Right. They would remember everything, right.

125
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.160
And so that's really where, what Diana Prince stands for.

126
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.650
And so as these guys are kind of fighting 70 Batman who lasts stop, sir, right?

127
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:56.500
So it was like, stop. We need to stop. Like we need to stop fighting. Uh, and,

128
00:05:56.501 --> 00:06:00.260
and, and it's wonder woman just kind of appearing in this almost huge void,

129
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.510
right? And this giant hand comes out of nowhere.

130
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:06.140
Now the giant hand of the multi-verse is iconic for DC comic book fans, right.

131
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.690
It's been depicted multiple times over the years.

132
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.100
And it's basically the hand that created the multi-verse now for years gone by,

133
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.180
we largely just believed it was the hand of the presence. We largely believed.

134
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.060
It was just the hand of like this nice omnipotent being that you only ever

135
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.290
really see in vertigo comics,

136
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.720
there was responsible for the creation of the entire multi-verse.

137
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:24.950
And indeed it wasn't really,

138
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:29.540
until we got to like the DC rebirth landscape with the idea of document Hatton,

139
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.570
and now with Perpetua that we're actually getting a break away from that

140
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:34.220
ideology, that what we're getting here,

141
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.460
at least what we got with with doomsday clock and, and the events of, uh,

142
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.230
the Washington being rolled in Dr. Manhattan,

143
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.480
all that stuff is that maybe the hand was Dr. Manhattan.

144
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.160
It was fan speculation at best,

145
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.550
but it was the idea that maybe it was document Hatton, but DC revealed no,

146
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.190
it was not Dr. Manhattan. It was the hand of perpetuate, right?

147
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.460
The creator of the multi-verse as we see it now. And so, because of that,

148
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.271
it was one of these,

149
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.870
these kind of bonkers situations where the Batman who laughs is like this was

150
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.960
Propecia was hand write the birth of the multi-verse as it exists.

151
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.290
So going all the way back to when the multi-verse was first created in DC

152
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.820
comics, which seemingly happened before DC started publishing, right. You know,

153
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.780
this, it gets a little crazy at that point,

154
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:10.610
but when the multi-verse was first created,

155
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.680
the perpetual was the one who made that. Right.

156
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:16.580
We know that by virtue of everything from Scott Snyder's justice league run all

157
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.520
the way up until now, the perpetual was the one who created the multi-verse.

158
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.060
But what he says is that her species are called the hands, right?

159
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.780
And they're basically on their way here to erase this entire universe because

160
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.640
basically they dare to want more, right.

161
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.210
Unless the Batman who laughs can kill them first, now a little exposition,

162
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.760
right? A little explanation here, the idea behind Perpetua,

163
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:36.110
for those of you guys who were a little behind here,

164
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:38.030
the idea behind Perpetua is that she was,

165
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.370
she really just kind of popped up and broke out of the source wall.

166
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.620
And we don't really know why she was confined there.

167
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:44.240
We just seemingly knew that she was there.

168
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:47.240
It wasn't until later in justice league that we learned that she was the

169
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.990
original creator of DC's multi-verse that her race called the hands,

170
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:55.220
basically those who stand above her had tasked her with going into this huge

171
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.220
empty void and just creating a multi-verse. But where she was a crew,

172
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.180
a supposed to create this multi-verse to suit the direction of the hands as they

173
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.480
had given it to her, she instead chose to make it in her own image, right.

174
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:08.030
That only the strong deserve to survive apex, predators,

175
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:10.610
different things like that. So she basically defied her mission.

176
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:14.020
She was told to do a, she chose to do B basically how that works.

177
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.600
Her punishment was that her children, the monitor,

178
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:19.450
the ante monitor and the world forger stood against her. Right.

179
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:22.450
They basically fought her off and then informed the hands of what she was doing.

180
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.370
And the hands locked her away in the source wall.

181
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:27.700
And she was supposed to be there for all eternity that goes into the original

182
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:30.550
dark nights metal event, or the source wall was destroyed.

183
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.850
And that freed Perpetua and now Perpetua came back and that's where all,

184
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.030
all this stuff is taking place. Right? So that's kind of a rough, real,

185
00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:39.030
really sort of ad hoc timeline of,

186
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:41.920
of what's going on with everything happening at the moment. But, uh,

187
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.010
that's the hand that you're seeing here is that a Perpetua, but the idea of,

188
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:48.460
of the, the Batman who laughs is kind of like the hands don't really care,

189
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:48.970
right? I mean,

190
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.550
there's on such a level of power destroying our universe would be like

191
00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:53.050
destroying aunts on the side of a mountain.

192
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.980
Why does this it's irrelevant to them that it was supposed to serve a particular

193
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:57.240
purpose. It didn't, uh,

194
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.730
and now they're going to come here and they're going to wipe it all out as you.

195
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.070
And it's one of these things where he says, if you don't believe me,

196
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.390
then look to the future, look to this future where like, I kill you all,

197
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:08.370
all the superheroes that you have, uh, that you guys ultimately defeat me,

198
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.400
but half your friends are dead and you allow it to be that way, right?

199
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.100
You don't just adjust things or change things, or, you know,

200
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:16.890
modify things on a whim. You just kind of let things go forward,

201
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.600
look to that future and see what awaits you.

202
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.420
And the reality is the hand show up and kill them anyway. Right?

203
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.800
The hands show up. So no matter what they do,

204
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:24.720
seemingly the hands will destroy them, right?

205
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.350
The hands will wipe everything out and seemingly the entire multi-verse will be

206
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:32.730
reborn yet again. And so in, in the understanding and the recognition of that,

207
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.100
the Batman who laughs goes to make his move and saying,

208
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.020
I can wipe out all existence, right?

209
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.970
And you and I can merge our powers together, right.

210
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:42.000
We can combine our forces together and we can destroy the hands. And, you know,

211
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:43.130
as payment for your,

212
00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:47.100
your willingness to help me that I will turn the multi-verse into a place of

213
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:50.280
absolute insanity and madness, but I will spare your world.

214
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.090
I will give you guys a paradise world to live on where everything will be

215
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:56.310
perfect. You'll always be young. Everything will be happy. Well,

216
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:59.100
you guys imagined to be this perfect life. I will give that to you.

217
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:02.340
That will be your reward for helping me all, just take everything else.

218
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.750
And in reality,

219
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.470
it really does seem like something the Batman who lasts would do, right. I mean,

220
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.070
of what use is a singular universe in comparison to an infinitely expanding

221
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.830
multi-verse right. He can just do everything he wants with it forever more.

222
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.570
It's not like it's an itch. You can't scratch. Right.

223
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:18.420
He's not like Galactus of the DC universe where it's like, I have to learn.

224
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.070
You just, it's not really like that. Right.

225
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:22.440
It's a promise he can make and a promise he probably would make.

226
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.910
And that would essentially be it. Now,

227
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:26.490
there are a few other things I do want to draw people's attention to you in

228
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:28.920
terms of this main fight that's going on here. Uh, you know,

229
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:31.980
one of the things that happens for example is that the Robin King cuts off the

230
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:33.090
hand of Batman, right?

231
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.880
And literally Batman loses his black lantern ring in the process.

232
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.440
There is also this dark multi-verse version of Superman whereby in his universe,

233
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:43.590
his spacecraft was lost on the way to earth and basically consumed,

234
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:46.260
or at least absorbed the energy of all the stars in the universe. Right?

235
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:50.460
So he's just wildly powerful and corrupted he's way beyond Superman. 1 million.

236
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.500
If you guys are interested in seeing that we can cover it.

237
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.650
I think it's only like a few pages long. I don't think it's very lengthy.

238
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.490
It's not like a,

239
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.090
like a one-shot where it's like a 20 page origin story or anything like that.

240
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.990
But, you know, it might,

241
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.510
it might be like a three minute long video that we make, but I'll cover it.

242
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.620
If you guys are interested in seeing it,

243
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.780
the reality of this is focusing back on,

244
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:10.080
on wonder woman and the Batman who laughs really the meat and potatoes of the

245
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:12.750
story here. That wonder woman ultimately does not acquiesce.

246
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.760
She doesn't give in Russia is kind of like whatever.

247
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:17.910
And so what she ended up doing is attacking him and sending him forward through

248
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.610
time, all the way to the end of the universe, right? Where,

249
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.580
where the universe and really even the multi-verse will meet its inevitable end.

250
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.920
It's basic heat death. That, that one of the things that,

251
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:27.570
that kind of exists here. And I don't know,

252
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:30.660
I can't really speak to whether or not this is true and real-world physics, but,

253
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.000
and comic lore and kind of a comic book. Them.

254
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.020
The idea here is that the multi-verse essentially exploded into existence with a

255
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:40.590
big bang and much like how a universe will condense down into a big crunch.

256
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.600
The multi-verse would do the same thing, right?

257
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:45.480
Like by virtue of his gravitational pull all the energy in existence,

258
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.080
it would essentially condense back down into an infinitely small singularity and

259
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:51.240
then be reborn as a new multi-verse yet again,

260
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.800
that's how it's normally supposed to happen. Uh, nonetheless,

261
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:57.130
they're basically here at this point where everything is going to end the issue

262
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:57.580
with this,

263
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.260
is that any real opportunity that Diana has to full on defeat?

264
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:05.380
The Batman who laughs through any measure of a lengthy fight is basically gone

265
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.090
because the hands have arrived here.

266
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.270
These beings who intend to wipe out the entirety of the multi-verse they're here

267
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:14.320
now, and things are about to get really bad because again,

268
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.080
they don't really much care about the heroes or any of that stuff.

269
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.020
And so it's one of these things where the Batman who lasts besieged is wonder

270
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:22.900
woman yet again, right. One last time and is like side with me.

271
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:27.070
Like if you side with me, we can save everything. Right. But if you don't,

272
00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:28.180
if you destroy me, right,

273
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.420
because as the heroes kind of unify and as the heroes fight together and so on,

274
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.540
then the anti-crisis energy basically becomes more powerful than the crisis

275
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.940
energy. So essentially the tables are kind of turning here, but it's like,

276
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.660
if you, if you decided to wipe me out, right? If at the end of all things,

277
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:43.690
if you push me in to this death of this multi-verse right,

278
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:47.020
where every universe has ever existed as kind of condensed down into this point,

279
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.290
then all that will be left is you. And then in turn, the hands will kill you.

280
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.910
The wipe out, you know, they'll go back there,

281
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:54.160
wipe out your universe and they'll start all over again. Right.

282
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:56.170
They'll destroy the multi-verse and that'll be the end of it. Right.

283
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:59.610
They'll just clean slate, everything. So it was kind of nuts because from there,

284
00:12:59.611 --> 00:12:59.831
again,

285
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:02.290
you kind of switched back to this battle and you get this really amazing moment,

286
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:04.360
right? With Batman, you get this really, really cool moment where bat,

287
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:08.050
where Robin King and his forces had basically killed all the members of the bat

288
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:09.400
family. And so it's kind of like, I mean,

289
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:12.100
all the members of Robin's Robin King's forces have died as well.

290
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.770
And Batman is the only one left to alive, but it's one of these things where,

291
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.050
because he had the black lantern ring for a while, it takes a little,

292
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:19.750
it takes a little bit for the effects to kind of die off. And then Robin,

293
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.240
King's just kind of like, you know, like, I mean, because you don't have your,

294
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:25.270
your black lantern ring anymore, you're basically gonna dive at man.

295
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.400
Like that's essentially yet it's curtains for you home slice. And then that man,

296
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:28.961
it's kinda like, you know,

297
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:31.660
I've met a lot of different MES from across the multi-verse.

298
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.140
And the one thing they all seem to have in common is that they would never do

299
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:37.690
something as obvious as to take a black lantern ring,

300
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.890
their most powerful weapon,

301
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.950
the thing that keeps them alive and just put it on their finger so that if

302
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.280
somebody came along and did the most predictable thing that anybody could do,

303
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:48.240
which is cut the hand off and remove the ring that they would,

304
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.650
then I would somehow die. Right? He's like, that's not the case.

305
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:52.420
This is a symbolic thing. He was like,

306
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.930
the black lantern ring is built into me and literally taps his chest.

307
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.920
And then from there activates his ring and that resurrects the entire army of

308
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:01.870
Robin kink and all the members of the bathroom,

309
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:05.410
like the whole bat family become black lanterns. It's pretty amazing. Right.

310
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:08.620
It's pretty bad even Alfred's back. Right. Looking all decrepit and everything.

311
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:11.440
Right. So Alfred's back, right? Like he's, he's here now. And, uh,

312
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.300
and it's cool. Right? It's, it's pretty awesome.

313
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.860
But it's small little things like that, right.

314
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:17.140
In terms of this fight between this just, you know,

315
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:20.080
last son I think is this version of Superman, I think it's called the last son.

316
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.380
Um, and this, in this fight between him where he's just decimating, right.

317
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.080
Has it's not even close. Right. He's just absolutely crushing this guy.

318
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.030
Like it's, it's, it's not even close. I don't know.

319
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:29.080
People are going to make a point and be like,

320
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.140
actually Rob decimation means to kill one 10th of everything.

321
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:35.410
You know what we can use, we can break it down to mathematics if you want to.

322
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.590
And then basically illustrate how it is decimation. Uh, but you know,

323
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:39.520
in this scenario here,

324
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.460
Lex Luther pops out of nowhere and basically tells like Superman,

325
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.950
get outta here, all destroy this guy. And the question is, how are the,

326
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.050
what are you going to do that intellectually to present a new suit,

327
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.020
this powered by a black hole, right? It's just black hole,

328
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.740
a black hole energy is a singularity.

329
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.830
And the problem with this is that the sumac is like, if you use this suit,

330
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:56.660
right, this last one is like, if you use the suit,

331
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.590
then you'll create a black hole. Singularity will wipe out the entirety of the,

332
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.570
of the universe where at least the section of the universe you'll start sucking

333
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:05.640
everything into it. And Lexus like, yeah, that's the point. And he operated,

334
00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:08.690
he activates the self-destruct and creates a black hole event. Right.

335
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.290
And sucks in this Superman, this, this last son, Superman alongside himself,

336
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.800
and basically obliterates everything while that's going on at the very end of

337
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:18.470
the multi-verse wonder, woman's just like the hell with it. Right? She's like,

338
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:20.690
whatever, if we're here at the end of all, things that I'm going to go out,

339
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:21.141
then a very,

340
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.390
at the very least I'm going to go out like the hero I've always been,

341
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.390
I'm not going to go out as some servant of the Batman who laughs governed by

342
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:29.540
fear. So she grabs this guy and pushes him into the singularity. Right.

343
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:33.380
Basically destroys the Batman who laughs and she in turn is consumed by it as

344
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.360
well and basically obliterated. Right.

345
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.690
It's she's literally destroyed and that's the end of it. Right? At that point,

346
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.030
she just kind of wakes up. Why should we, we're not really wakes up.

347
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:44.450
She just kind of per consciousness sort of comes into existence. Right.

348
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.960
And she just sort of looking around, she's sort of, she's basically disembodied,

349
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:49.190
right? She's like in a theorial form,

350
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.010
but she just kind of like what in the world is going on here? And she's met by,

351
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.540
uh, by another disembodied voice.

352
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:55.730
And they basically say when we created the multi-verse,

353
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.900
our hope was that life within would follow a path that it would ascend from

354
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:01.790
simple selfishness to greater truce.

355
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.330
Basically you would become better than what you are and what we've seen in this

356
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:08.480
multi-verse is it that never happened when its multi-verse was created by

357
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:12.020
Perpetua? Yes. She bastardized it, Gigi bastardized the whole thing.

358
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.380
But even when she was destroyed and her work was wiped away and a new

359
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:18.830
multi-verse was created and you were given the opportunity to become better,

360
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.340
you didn't right. You just stayed selfish. You stayed doing crappy things.

361
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.760
You only ever focused on yourself and refuse to accept the fact that there's a

362
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:27.290
world bigger than you. Right.

363
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:30.740
That there's more to this world than how you think and feel there are billions

364
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.110
and, and really like billions of people within your own world.

365
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.120
And there's countless live within the multi-verse right.

366
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.690
That that only ever really came down to you. And so, because of that,

367
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.570
this existence that you guys, you know, well, you guys call here, this,

368
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:44.540
this university you live in this multi-verse that exists is a place of

369
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:47.540
selfishness, sadness, and horror. And we wanted to wipe it out.

370
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.110
The problem is we can't. And the reason why is because when they beat,

371
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:51.780
when they basically said,

372
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.430
we're going to take a form to appear to you as what we see as being our,

373
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:58.430
you know, the, the definitive standard on what a true hero is,

374
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.660
they take the form of wonder woman.

375
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.440
Now it doesn't mean that wonder woman is the end all be all what every superhero

376
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:06.690
needs to be. It's the idea of what superheroes are. What,

377
00:17:06.691 --> 00:17:09.620
what superheroes stand for that? When these, these guys,

378
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:12.980
when the hands are talking about the selfish nature of life within the

379
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:16.250
multi-verse that they're basically talking about non superhero beings, right?

380
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.260
Individuals, the average Joe, you and me, right?

381
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.620
Our inability to look at the world and see more than ourselves. I mean,

382
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.140
and that's, that's true, but even here in the real world, right? Like, you know,

383
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:26.690
we know that like there are, there, there there's a greater, you know,

384
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:29.330
there's a greater picture out there and there's other people out there who think

385
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.340
and feel right. That's the definition of a narcissist,

386
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.400
the person who believes that only their feelings, thoughts, and beliefs matter.

387
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.800
And that everybody else is basically irrelevant. Right? That's,

388
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:39.350
that's a narcissist and most people are not narcissists,

389
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.480
but most people have a tendency to think about things,

390
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:44.510
but thinking about themselves first and everybody else second. And so,

391
00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:45.230
because of that,

392
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.860
it's one of these things where superheroes were kind of this guiding force that

393
00:17:48.861 --> 00:17:49.471
it was like, Hey,

394
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:52.920
like we could drag you into the future and we can make you guys recognize that

395
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:55.200
there's a greater world of themselves. And if you don't want to, well,

396
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:56.460
then we'll just get rid of you, right?

397
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:00.600
Like we'll literally create a list of standard on what creates a good person and

398
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:04.170
anybody who is not part of that list. Then we kill and we just keep the rest.

399
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.960
And the rest of you guys just live in fear, hoping you do not move,

400
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.420
not become one of those people on the list, right? Like, you know,

401
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.510
people who embody those traits on the list, it'd be very dictatorial.

402
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.880
And it essentially the earth three in the DC universe.

403
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.600
But instead superheros exist to guide people into a better future to give them

404
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:20.730
an example of the standard, to live by,

405
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.740
to fight for things greater than yourself,

406
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.250
to not bend yourself to your most basic needs, to not look at the world,

407
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.310
from the perspective of what do I need, what helps me?

408
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.530
What makes my life better? And instead,

409
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:34.470
focusing on what makes the lives of other people better, right?

410
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:37.830
What makes the lives of this world that we live in better and that kind of going

411
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:40.710
forward from there. And that's how the hands see superheroes.

412
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.100
They see them as being people who were capable of doing great things.

413
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:47.160
And despite the fact that they stumbled and they fell and they screwed up from

414
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:50.460
time to time in the end, they were doing not very good things,

415
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.900
but they were doing them for the right reasons. Right.

416
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.450
Not everything they did was good. Right. I mean you to do some shady stuff,

417
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.970
mean wonder woman killed Maxwell, Lord and infinite crisis,

418
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.920
like literally broke his neck. I mean, they'd kill people. Hey happens. Yeah.

419
00:18:59.921 --> 00:19:01.890
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. You know what I mean?

420
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:04.350
So they did some unsavory things here and there,

421
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.730
but they all did it for the right reason. Or they did it for the,

422
00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:09.840
for the best reasons they possibly could because they were trying to make the

423
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:13.350
world better facing off against threats that otherwise would have torn the world

424
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:16.650
and even the universe apart. And so, because of that, what they say is,

425
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:17.220
you know,

426
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.610
you guys have kind of given us this example of what superheroes are supposed to

427
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:22.830
be about how your multi-verse was not irredeemable.

428
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.660
It was not beyond being safe.

429
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.660
It was just that it takes a little bit more of a nudge, but you were right.

430
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:30.360
When you said that, you know, when you were powered by anti-crisis energy,

431
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.811
you were right.

432
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:33.690
When you said the shortcoming of superheroes and the people in the world is they

433
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:37.020
don't really understand the fact that they're part of a much bigger tapestry,

434
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.350
not even your superhero friends know that because they've forgotten so much of

435
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:42.780
their past. And so from there, it kind of goes into,

436
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.820
we are going to effectively fix things, right.

437
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:48.240
But it's going to require a great sacrifice on your behalf.

438
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.870
It's going to require you to ascend the on your current form and to become

439
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:55.020
something greater than what you are in essence, DCS, rebooting,

440
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.130
not really a hard reboot,

441
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.580
but DC's basically reworking the entirety of everything. It's a soft reboot.

442
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.160
It's their, their, their secret war. She doesn't have 15. Right.

443
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:04.590
But it is in effect. A reboot is basically, I mean,

444
00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:06.690
we can just treat it this way. It's more or less what it is.

445
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.280
It's one of these things where you kind of,

446
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.710
you end up having like this Raby huge celebration, but you know, it's great.

447
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.630
A huge celebration. This, this big event going on,

448
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.420
all the heroes are kind of celebrating the fact that like they won the war

449
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:17.820
against the Batman who lasts. They remember it all, which is cool,

450
00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:20.280
but they won the war against the Batman who lasts the day with safe.

451
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.350
They realize they lost wonder woman in the process.

452
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:25.260
But her sacrifice is the reason why everybody's still survived.

453
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:27.390
So they honor her quite. It's not like, man, where's wonder woman. Oh,

454
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:30.540
that's why she's dead. Aw. It's not really like that. You know,

455
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.260
it's not really people laughing about wonder woman die. It's not really,

456
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:35.880
that's the, that's not really the case. Instead.

457
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.910
They're all just kind of taking stock and celebrating the good things in life.

458
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:41.400
What is usually what happens after a war takes place? Right? I mean,

459
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.320
I just want to point out here all with you guys. See this.

460
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.170
I want to point out here, you got Batman playing the guitar. You've got a,

461
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.200
you got, what was, what's her name? The black Canary chick. You got her playing,

462
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.990
laying a playing guitar who cares. And then you've got Superman singing.

463
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.240
And then you got Wally West than the drums. I just want to say,

464
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.910
I want to see this band play. I don't really care black and errors there now,

465
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.760
but I want to see this band play, but I want to see this band play some music.

466
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.010
If I were being honest, I would trade out black Canary. Well,

467
00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.870
I would trade it off for wonder woman, but she's not here.

468
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.850
Like she's basically dead. If I'm being honest,

469
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.520
I would probably say as a Tauna could rock it out. Right.

470
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:11.590
She'd be amazing on a rock guitar.

471
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.020
I feel like she would just start playing songs that were sad. And you know,

472
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.340
like, like what does she play?

473
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:18.580
Like golf or like Lincoln park with their first album, you know,

474
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:21.160
like I'm still misunderstood by the world. You know,

475
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.980
world didn't understand the other singing sad songs about her life. You know,

476
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:27.170
nobody understands or anything, but, uh, but nonetheless, you know, it's,

477
00:21:27.171 --> 00:21:30.540
it's cool. It's just these little celebrations, but in the middle of this, uh,

478
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.120
Barry Allie comes to Wally West and says, I need you to come with me.

479
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.210
There's something I need to show you. And what they,

480
00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:38.220
what he does is he takes them to the, to this place in the moon and then says,

481
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.730
I need you to vibrate at a frequency of one 60.4 gigahertz,

482
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.130
which one of those is one of the reasons why that's done is because remember the

483
00:21:44.131 --> 00:21:44.731
universe, the,

484
00:21:44.731 --> 00:21:48.900
the various multi versus out there essentially exists by virtue of tuning,

485
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.951
waltz, tuning forks, right?

486
00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:52.110
In the sense that like they have vibrational frequencies.

487
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.380
So it's like the main DC universe might be at the frequency of SI.

488
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.560
And then like, you know, the earth, the universe might be the frequency of D.

489
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.330
And so in order to access that universe,

490
00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:03.360
you have to vibrate at the proper frequency in order to pass through the

491
00:22:03.361 --> 00:22:06.270
dimensional barriers and get to that place. But the, the, the,

492
00:22:06.271 --> 00:22:08.070
the important thing here is that when that's done,

493
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.970
what you end up basically discovering is that this is a whole new set of events

494
00:22:11.971 --> 00:22:15.460
here, right? There's this kind of like massive space station, uh, that is,

495
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:19.050
is they call it the next stage of the, the halls of justice and doom. But, uh,

496
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.240
it's essentially a place ran by, by villains, but not really because they're,

497
00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:24.780
they're doing bad stuff because there's some of the smartest people in the

498
00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:25.890
world, the whole project,

499
00:22:25.891 --> 00:22:28.680
at least the launches initially being overseen by Superman and Batman.

500
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.310
But what they basically realized is that the actions of wonder woman and what

501
00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:34.230
comes out of this is colossal.

502
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.900
One of the first things to happen is a source walls gone.

503
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.430
There is no source wall anymore, right?

504
00:22:38.431 --> 00:22:42.420
There's no walls separating the various universities and multi verses that exist

505
00:22:42.421 --> 00:22:44.220
out there in DC comics. It's gone, right?

506
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.750
It seemingly it's completely disappeared.

507
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.540
Not only that there is no singular multi-verse anymore.

508
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.990
Now it's multi versus growing at a,

509
00:22:50.991 --> 00:22:55.110
at a geometric rate by the just infinitely expanding multi versus going on and

510
00:22:55.111 --> 00:22:58.260
on and on and on in terms of like the old powers that existed out there,

511
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.130
dark side, there's no indication that he's there. That basically the,

512
00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:04.740
the actions of wonder woman and kind of recruited the multi-verse is essentially

513
00:23:04.741 --> 00:23:08.880
that the entire old standard of comics of DC comics is effectively gone.

514
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.390
That what this does is it allows the possibilities for superheroes and

515
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:15.870
supervillains from other universes to merge and crossover at a, at a,

516
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:18.360
at a constant rate, Harvard is that they want to write,

517
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.800
they call it the infinite frontier,

518
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.440
but it basically means that is a whole new kettle of beans.

519
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.440
Batman visited other bet, a Batman from other universities,

520
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.060
but it's kind of nuts. It's cool.

521
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.410
But what this does is it gives DC the ability to kind of initiate this

522
00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:34.200
colossal publishing initiative, which is awesome.

523
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.840
It expands the DC universe in a way that's never been done before,

524
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.020
because what if, what if over that, like in a single Batman story, right?

525
00:23:40.021 --> 00:23:42.000
Let's say you're reading your Batman number, whatever, you know,

526
00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:43.200
written by who in the hell ever.

527
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.820
And then as a crossover between like Batman and like three different versions of

528
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.880
them from across the universe, every story could feel like a mini event.

529
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.550
And I know that seems at the, you know, on the surface, it's kinda like, ah,

530
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.280
I want to do with a bunch of mini events,

531
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.370
but that in turn takes the idea of big crossover events.

532
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.290
And I would hope puts them on the back burner, right.

533
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.870
DC doesn't really do massive crossover events. Anyway,

534
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.030
they've done a lot more in recent years than they used to,

535
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.120
but it used to be that they never really did great big, huge crossover event.

536
00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.280
It's only been because they've been Marvel comics.

537
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.490
Then they started doing huge crossover events relatively consistently, right?

538
00:24:12.491 --> 00:24:15.040
I mean, you can see me a song and a dance about how, you know,

539
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.620
dark nights metal is not a big crossover event,

540
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.280
but just because it doesn't have tie-ins does not mean it's not a crossover

541
00:24:21.281 --> 00:24:24.040
event, right. It basically is. Uh, but, you know, imagine that,

542
00:24:24.041 --> 00:24:26.800
like this was on a, on a much smaller scale, right? So imagine that like,

543
00:24:26.801 --> 00:24:29.890
there's some joker from some alternate reality, who's gone awry, you know,

544
00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:33.460
and like jump to a different universe and committed all kinds of panic and stuff

545
00:24:33.461 --> 00:24:34.150
on that universe.

546
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.690
And so it takes Batman from that universe and Batman from the main DC universe

547
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.360
to team up and stop that version of the joker. Right. It's cool.

548
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.280
It creates all different kinds of possibilities.

549
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.070
And it's one of the things that they say is kind of becoming its own different.

550
00:24:45.071 --> 00:24:46.600
It's its own singular omniverse,

551
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.090
and there's an infinite amount of possibilities that can come out of this,

552
00:24:49.091 --> 00:24:52.120
right? There's no telling what they can publish, what they can create.

553
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.150
And now the other thing that they realize is that there's two centers of the

554
00:24:55.151 --> 00:24:57.820
multi-verse. Now that one of them seems to be themselves.

555
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.550
And the other one is basically what they call the world, right?

556
00:25:00.551 --> 00:25:01.870
They don't really know much about that world.

557
00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.610
They don't really know a whole lot about what's going on with it.

558
00:25:03.611 --> 00:25:05.620
So obviously that's going to be some exploration,

559
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.940
but the big takeaway from all this,

560
00:25:06.941 --> 00:25:10.450
the big significance behind all this is that the multi-verse is growing to the

561
00:25:10.451 --> 00:25:13.390
point where it's becoming an omniverse. So we have multiple multi versus now.

562
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.523
Uh, and that there,

563
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.410
there are no barriers anymore between the universes that are out there.

564
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.320
So there's all kinds of publishing possibilities that can be done.

565
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.990
It can go on and on and on and on. This is fantastic, right?

566
00:25:22.991 --> 00:25:25.870
This is absolutely amazing. This is fantastic news,

567
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.050
I think is kind of what DC needed. Because if I'm being honest with you guys,

568
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.750
I think one of the reasons why DC struggles so much, you know,

569
00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:34.510
especially if you guys are keeping track of the news going on with DC comics,

570
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.880
I think one of the reasons why they struggle so much is because their characters

571
00:25:36.881 --> 00:25:38.410
are static. They don't change.

572
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.920
They pretty much are the same character they've been for a long, long,

573
00:25:41.921 --> 00:25:44.890
long time. They don't really evolve. They don't really grow right now.

574
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.110
This would be, this wouldn't necessarily be the worst thing.

575
00:25:47.111 --> 00:25:49.450
If like the DC cinematic universe was successful.

576
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.310
Like Marvel characters are pretty much the exact same.

577
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:53.050
They don't really change that much. They change a little bit,

578
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.190
but they don't really change a whole lot.

579
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.050
Everything goes back to the status quo.

580
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.500
The Marvel cinematic universe is what makes things more interesting for Marvel

581
00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:02.560
comics. If the MCU didn't exist, Marvel comics will be boring as hell, right?

582
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:05.830
But it's the compliment of the MCU and kind of seeing the characters in a little

583
00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:07.420
bit of a different light that make things different.

584
00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.270
If DC had that in terms of their movie form, it would be the same way,

585
00:26:10.271 --> 00:26:12.460
but they don't buy because nobody knows what's going on.

586
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.450
They don't even know what's going on.

587
00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:15.280
They're like I have this massive plan on how to,

588
00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.170
how to make their DC cinematic universe cohesive and work. And, and I,

589
00:26:19.171 --> 00:26:21.160
I don't even know who to take that to, but nonetheless,

590
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.590
or if it is even worth feeling, I have no clue.

591
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.860
But the whole point here is that what you have is a, is a,

592
00:26:26.861 --> 00:26:31.300
is basically a brave new world, right? If out is Huxley was writing this event,

593
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.180
it would look like this. Here's a brave new world.

594
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.270
There's all kinds of possibilities. Right? So with that being said, guys,

595
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.670
we're going, gonna bring this video to an end. If you are new here to comments,
