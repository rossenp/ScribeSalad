1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.030
<v 0>So Charlie Cox is back playing Daredevil in Spiderman.</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.930
Three Spider-Man trace, I think is how you pronounce that.

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.270
I'm pretty sure that's how you pronounce that. Look at this place.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.510
It's all decorated for Halloween. I watch it. The chefs show on Netflix,

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.860
hopefully Netflix hasn't copyright strike this. Um,

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.890
that's amazing. That's absolutely amazing.

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:24.390
The trolley conscious coming back as Daredevil.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.720
And here's the thing I'm glad that's happening because I'll be honest with you

9
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:32.340
guys. I know that like, there was a big match between FYGI and Jeff lobe,

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.640
uh, with Jeff lobe taking the TV side, 5g, taking the movie side,

11
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.540
there was kind of like, well, you know,

12
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.840
that's what we're going to refer to the Avengers movie is the event, you know,

13
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.450
and all that kind of stupid stuff. Um, I'm glad to see that,

14
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.930
like at least one is running the show and those characters are getting rolled

15
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:50.010
in, honestly, as excited as I am for Charlie Cox. Um,

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.440
I'm more excited for like Vincent D'Onofrio to return as the kingpin and Jon

17
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.390
Bernthal to come back as the Punisher,

18
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.010
because I don't think Vincent D'Onofrio died. Right? Kingpin didn't die in the,

19
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.280
uh, in the Netflix TV series. Did he like, I'm pretty sure he's still alive.

20
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.420
And Jon Bernthal was an amazing Punisher whose thing I would love to see John

21
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.931
Byrne fall,

22
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:12.690
come back as a Punisher to like face off against the new Avengers or something

23
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.610
like that. Ah, it'd be awesome.

24
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.890
But it was because the punishers had so many great moments,

25
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:19.560
like when he saved Spider-Man's life and civil war, well,

26
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.590
he saved her from being killed in the sewers of New York and then shows up on

27
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:27.000
the doorstep of captain America, like captain America's secret Avengers. And uh,

28
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.500
and, and.

29
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.190
<v 1>It's like, dude, like, like Mack, you know, he comes busting and he's like Mac.</v>

30
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.210
So they bring in some people to take care of Spider-Man and then you end up

31
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:35.680
finding out.

32
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.640
<v 0>Captain America's allied himself with villains.</v>

33
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.890
So like these villains come in and they're like,

34
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.200
we're here to help you capture the Punisher. Just sprays them down.

35
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.910
<v 1>You know what I'm saying? Anything.</v>

36
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.730
He just unloads on him and captain America freaks out.

37
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:49.530
He's like you murderer son of a bee and just starts attacking him.

38
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.320
And he's like, there were bad guys, cats. He just killed them on the spot.

39
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.750
Didn't even give him a chance to explain.

40
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360
<v 0>It was pretty. It was, it's not funny. It's hilarious.</v>

41
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.080
It was hilarious. But, uh, but no,

42
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.170
I'm excited for Charlie Cox and that's the thing, man. Like the cast,

43
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.950
the casting just keeps coming out and out and out for Spiderman three, right?

44
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:14.060
Like, like what is it? We have, uh, what's his name coming back? Um, what, uh,

45
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.700
Alfred Molina, whatever his name is coming back from, uh,

46
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.880
from the old Spiderman to Sony movies to play doctor octopus. Again,

47
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.570
I want to see superior Spider-Man son. I want to see superior Spider-Man.

48
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.950
I want to see him take over the body of Peter Parker and like become the,

49
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.170
become like the superior Spider-Man and they become a better Spider-Man than

50
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.630
Peter Parker was superior. Spider-Man was amazing.

51
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.690
There's this point in the story? When Dr. Octopus,

52
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:37.400
when he's in possession of Peter Parker's body,

53
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.060
he goes to fight the scorpion and punches the bottom half of his jaw off.

54
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.590
And then he's like, Holy cow,

55
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.560
Spiderman has been pulling his punches all these years. It's the craziest thing.

56
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.190
It's one of the coolest things, but, uh, but no trolley Cox is Daredevil.

57
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.020
He was, he was incredible. Right?

58
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.220
Dare devil was obviously the standout show on Netflix. It was an amazing show.

59
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.930
Uh, I'm glad to see that it's coming back.

60
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.930
I'm glad to see the Charlie Cox is the character that we all love him for it.

61
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.280
Because if I'm being honest,

62
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:06.970
I can't really see anybody else besides Ben Affleck. Just kidding.

63
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.180
I can't see anybody else playing Daredevil besides Charlie conch at this point,

64
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.260
like it's just it's it's he just did that good of a job. Right?

65
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:18.160
Then you throw him in with like Tom Holland and you, you throw him in with,

66
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.230
with Molina and you throw him in with like, what is it?

67
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.330
We're getting Andrew Garfield and we're getting Toby Maguire.

68
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.950
Then the Spider-Man movies. I mean, this is kind of crazy, man.

69
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.520
Like I haven't no idea what all this means. I mean,

70
00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:32.400
I assume that there's going to be some multi-vessel travel going on. Otherwise,

71
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.330
how do you explain their existence? Unless like, you know, Dr. Strange is like,

72
00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:39.240
Hey man, count yourself. Lucky with your identity being out, count yourself.

73
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.510
Lucky here's a Spiderman you could have been. And then shows all my Tobey,

74
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.850
Maguire and Andrew Garfield, mental hall. I was like, Hmm.

75
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.840
<v 1>No, it'd be.</v>

76
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.350
<v 0>But nonetheless, I'm very, very excited. I am very, very excited for, for,</v>

77
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.870
for this whole revelation. Um, here's the thing.

78
00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:00.090
And I've been telling people this for years and years and years,

79
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.240
I've been telling people this for a long, long time, people like,

80
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:06.900
like the Marvel cinematic universe, what we've seen is the tip of the iceberg.

81
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.500
Everything that's happened in the last six last 10 years and the Marvel

82
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.650
cinematic universe for all you book readers out there,

83
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.920
this is a 12 issue story for us, right? Like that's, that's what this is, right.

84
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:18.600
This is just a maxi series, right?

85
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.840
Maybe a little bit bigger if you want to throw in a few times and you can make

86
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.340
each individual's individual film, its own comic. So, okay.

87
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:29.400
Like a 22, 23 issue, long, long thing, right?

88
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:33.090
Like there are whole runs of characters that span hundreds of issues just to

89
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:35.310
give you guys perspective, right? Like digital,

90
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:38.100
civil war story was over 100 issues long.

91
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:40.410
Like just to give you guys perspective here, right?

92
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:43.830
At the same thing with like Avengers versus X-Men it was like 120 issues long.

93
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.320
It was crazy. The old annihilation, including the tire,

94
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.610
the thing was actually a little bit shorter.

95
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.270
Annihilation conquest was a lot bigger. Uh, but you know,

96
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:52.860
this is the tip of the iceberg.

97
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.630
Like Marvel has barely even begun to approach the possibility of

98
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.920
even thinking about the idea of getting into like the meat and potatoes of

99
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.350
everything they could do. But there's so much that little be another story.

100
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.730
What are you doing? What are you looking at? Look, look, my dog is dog star.

101
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:12.510
What are you doing? What do you want her? She's got an Ms. Piggy with her.

102
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.733
What do you want star?

103
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.020
I post on Instagram on my personal Instagram. I am Rob Jefferson.

104
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.740
I posted up there. She, uh, she drugged big,

105
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.700
dirty out of Mariah's office and was laying on it in the hallway. Right? Big,

106
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.470
big dirties. The name of the big Teddy bear. We have,

107
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.440
we were going through Walmart and I saw this giant Teddy bear that I wanted to

108
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:35.340
get Mariah. So I bought it and uh, and we, and I called it big dirty. So that's,

109
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.530
that's the name of it now? Big, dirty the Teddy bear.

110
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.840
<v 1>But, uh.</v>

111
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.550
<v 0>But yeah, you know, this is, this is kind of, wow.</v>

112
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.350
So just celebrate this monument.

113
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.460
Just a moment to celebrate this monument moment.

114
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.290
Um, some Encore rings again. Yes we are. But I've also got Merck.

115
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.960
I've also got like t-shirts and stuff like that. I've got four design for,

116
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.940
for rod por t-shirt design.

117
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.830
You'll find the t-shirts and the rod port rings down in the description. Um,

118
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:01.191
I want to,

119
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.040
I want to kind of put those on sale now so that if anybody orders them,

120
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.010
you can get them in time for Christmas. Some of you guys bought them for like,

121
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:08.570
you were buying them like two or three at a time. Right.

122
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.540
Buy them ones for like yourself and like your girlfriend or your girlfriend was

123
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:14.750
buying it for like herself and you or whatever the case was when people were,

124
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:16.990
was it somebody bought it for like their younger brother white.

125
00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:20.000
So we had people, we were buying like two or three at a time. Uh, but last,

126
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.710
last time we did this, they, they sold out in two hours. So, um,

127
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.330
you gotta be fast because.

128
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.100
<v 2>They're going to go quick. But anyway, got it.</v>

129
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.250
<v 0>Let's not just say all the people who were following the, the,</v>

130
00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:34.750
the store on Etsy, uh, because that's where they get sold.

131
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.000
So what are you doing? Why are you barking?

132
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.430
They get sold on Etsy and there are people who are following the store.

133
00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:42.000
So as soon as they go live, they're immediately on there and they started,

134
00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.230
they started buying them up. So you better be quick,

135
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.720
you better be super quick because it's going to be 20 of each size.

136
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:49.600
The same time we did last time. Same thing we did last time. Um,

137
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.680
there will also be a size 12 out this time around. So, uh, so yeah, it's,

138
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:57.220
it's kind of wild kind of crazy, uh, but very, very, very, very cool.

139
00:06:57.221 --> 00:07:00.100
All these different castings that are going out now. Like it's, it's,

140
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.580
it's really wild. Like I'm, I'm very excited about this. So anyway, guys,

141
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.080
we're going ahead and wrap this video up. Uh, thank you guys for watching.

142
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.860
And I just want to say this. This is, it's a great time to be a comic book fan,

143
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.320
right? It's a great time to be a comic book fan. Now,

144
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:18.100
I guess all we're really waiting for here is venom to be rolled over into the

145
00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:18.820
MCU.

146
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.310
I guess it's all we're really waiting for is venom to be brought over into the

147
00:07:21.311 --> 00:07:22.960
Marvel cinematic universe. Uh,

148
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.330
and it's all just kind of coming together and as being cohesive, right? It's,

149
00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:28.360
it's getting, getting more and more cohesive. So, uh,

150
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.300
high times ahead of us folks, I will say,

151
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:34.420
I think Spider-Man three is going to have massive ramifications for the future

152
00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:35.254
of the MCU,

153
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.480
with different movies that we're going to see and all that kind of stuff.

154
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.400
I feel like it's going to have massive ramifications.

155
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:42.340
We're going to see a whole bunch of stuff coming out of there. Probably.

156
00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:44.860
X-Men probably fantastic for some things like that.

157
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.310
I wouldn't be surprised if there's some throwaway scene where Peter Parker gets

158
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:51.220
an invitation to the future foundation and throws it away through your

159
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.830
foundation. Of course, is a fantastic four founded by Reed,

160
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.280
which are just like their own think tank kind of thing. Ah, it's cool. Right?

161
00:07:57.281 --> 00:08:01.660
So I'm, I'm very, very excited. I am very, very hyped. Uh, this is huge news.

162
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.523
So.

163
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.800
<v 2>I was going to go ahead and bring this video to an end and I will catch you all</v>

164
00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:07.660
later, Bruce.
