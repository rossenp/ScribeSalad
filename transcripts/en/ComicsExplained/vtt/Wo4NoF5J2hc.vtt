<v 0>What's going on, guys. This is Robin and little.</v>

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:05.070
Do you guys know I've actually got a secondary project?

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.920
That's actually bigger than comments explaining called pop culture.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.280
Explain like how many explained focuses on comics, pop culture,

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.650
explain focuses on everything else.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
And so we're starting things off by explaining celebrities and then we'll go

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.600
into like other stuff that's more pop culture oriented and kind of expand from

8
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.270
there. We're basically copying the formula of comics explained, right?

9
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:26.940
Like I blew up with the channel because I was doing character explanations.

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.610
So we're doing celebrity explanations. Um,

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.500
and there were just kind of expand from there, but this is one of the,

12
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:35.880
the celebrity explanations that I've done, which is on Stan Lee.

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.880
So if you guys enjoy it, make sure you guys head over and check out the channel.

14
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:41.760

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.080
