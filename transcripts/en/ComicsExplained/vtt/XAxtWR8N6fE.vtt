4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.810
All right. What's cool.

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.111
<v 1>On guys.</v>

6
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:16.850
This is Rob and we are picking back up again with DC and this is,

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.300
it's still like an amazing story while this is one you guys need to get out and

8
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.330
buy. Okay. So, so we pick up with the last video that we did, right?

9
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:26.420
And last video that we did focus on the idea that the various villains who

10
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:31.340
existed out there had basically recreated the amazing shows with Dr. Ivo, right?

11
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:32.360
Dr. Ivo was a guy who,

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.000
who originally created a main zone and he's essentially working for the

13
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.490
villains. Now, amazing is basically an Android,

14
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.950
but he essentially has the powers of the justice league.

15
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.250
And he's one of these guys where just one amazing can actually take out the

16
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.500
whole justice league. They have a whole army of them.

17
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.570
And one thing to keep in mind, the justice league,

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.900
as we think about it is like the traditional Superman, the traditional Batman,

19
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.020
and not to really knock on Jonathan Kent or Damian Wayne,

20
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.710
but there are no court Kent or, or Bruce Wayne respectively, right?

21
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.870
Like they're just not on the same level as their fathers.

22
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.990
And so what you're talking about is an army of, of [inaudible].

23
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.210
This is going to be taking on what is in effect,

24
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.930
a diminished justice league now for Oswald Cabo pot, right? For the penguin,

25
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.520
he's kind of impatient here. He's like, dude,

26
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.150
you promise us results a while ago. Right. It starts to off Ivo. And he's like,

27
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.030
look, man, like he basically like activates a few of these robots. He's like,

28
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:19.370
look, man, just one of these can take out the justice league.

29
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.570
What do you think they'll do to you?

30
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.410
And understand these guys went on programming. If I leave off a decimal point,

31
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.020
these guys will wipe out everything on the planet, right?

32
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:30.800
So I have to make sure this is programmed meticulously because remember the

33
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.680
whole idea of the villains is, is to wipe out the unliving,

34
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.980
but not for any kind of altruistic means it's because once the unliving are

35
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:37.490
wiped out,

36
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.880
they can in turn most likely turn the [inaudible] onto the superheroes,

37
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.850
take the superheroes out and then inherit the world for themselves. Right?

38
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:47.390
It's just kind of a circumstantial world. Domination is basically what it is.

39
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.410
Now. The other part of that,

40
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.380
what we ended up doing is we switched over to cyborg and then reality is a

41
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:52.340
little bit disappointing,

42
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.580
but it turns out that the life equation is inside cyborg and he basically

43
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:59.510
restructures or recodes his blood so that the life equation is confined within

44
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:00.710
his own genome. These are,

45
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.190
that I have with that is I was really hoping we would see white lanterns.

46
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.420
If I'm going to be honest with you guys,

47
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.480
I was really hoping we would see white lanterns because remember all the various

48
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:12.110
superheroes who made it off earth and are basically headed toward your group,

49
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.200
took off into space there with the green lanterns, right? Like don't forget,

50
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.490
the green lanterns are out there.

51
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.460
And all the other heroes are with the green lantern, the other heroes,

52
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.640
the surviving humans, they're all currently with the green lantern Corps.

53
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.670
But regardless what we end up having here is basically like this kind of

54
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:28.520
conversation, right? How do they get this out of them? Like how do they get the,

55
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.460
the life equation essentially out of cyborg?

56
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.380
And then turn it into something that can be used,

57
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.110
like synthesize it into a cure that can be given to people. Well,

58
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.080
Damian Wayne ends up having the idea to go see swamp thing.

59
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.930
And the reason why is not necessarily because of swamp thing,

60
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.370
but because of Alec Holland,

61
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.100
remember Alec Holland is the name of the guy who became swamp thing.

62
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.460
And he was a gifted biochemist, right? A biologist and a biochemist,

63
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.800
probably the best in the world before he became swamp thing.

64
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.100
And Damien kind of hits them up and says, look, man, like we need you, right?

65
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:58.640
Like we need the mind of Alec holon to help us solve this problem, right.

66
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.770
To help us solve this equation.

67
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.200
And initially swamp thing is a little bit hesitant,

68
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.480
not in the sense of he's just like, I never really liked Alex,

69
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.470
so I don't want to work with you. Right?

70
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.540
It's not like a Bruce banner incredible hook dichotomy.

71
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.150
It is one of these things where he's like, I can't do this on my own.

72
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.180
What you're asking me to do is not something that I can do myself. I mean,

73
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.240
I could, but not in the short period of time that you're looking for,

74
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.870
because what you're looking to do is to synthesize a cure as fast as humanly

75
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:23.680
possible and then spread it to the world. And while I am incredibly powerful,

76
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.500
I'm not powerful on that level. Right. And so when he is,

77
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.310
I'm saying what Damian Wayne did is actually concoct a plan exceedingly fast and

78
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.260
say, yeah, you're not going to be doing this alone.

79
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.080
And the way this works is actually pretty genius, right?

80
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.590
So you've got swamp thing here. You've got poison Ivy. You've got Dr. Fait.

81
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:42.100
You've got CyBorD, you've got, uh, detective Chimp. You've got Mary Marvel,

82
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.640
the new 52 while he was the young black Wally West. You've got a Harley Quinn.

83
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.060
You have all these people who were here because in some form or fashion,

84
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.930
they can basically help to synthesize this virus. Synthesizes cure much faster,

85
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.870
right? Mary Marvel's got wisdom. The cure is inside of cyborg.

86
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.550
Alec Holland is the mind of a, of a genius level, biochemist and biologist.

87
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.270
Dr. Fate,

88
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.090
who's there to basically unite the minds of all the people who are here. Uh,

89
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.250
poison Ivy was a doctor of toxicology.

90
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.980
Harley Quinn was a doctor of psychology and medicine.

91
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.920
And Wally West has the fastest mind on the planet. And then literally Tom,

92
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.590
Taylor's like, Batman's here because he's Batman. And.

93
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.870
<v 2>The only explanation we get.</v>

94
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.700
<v 1>Because he's Batman, but essentially they're able to,</v>

95
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.090
to kind of turn this into a cure that can be synthesized, right?

96
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:27.420
So it's only the first step. The next step is to actually mass produce it.

97
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.691
Right?

98
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.690
And so if you kind of get these diametrically opposing views and the sense of

99
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:34.020
Superman sets up and says, now we can save them all at the same time,

100
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.170
over in the layer of the villains it's now we can wipe them all out, right?

101
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:40.620
So they're literally creating two different means to cure the anti-life virus.

102
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.170
One depends on wiping out everybody that's infected.

103
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.360
And the other one is about basically saving people,

104
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:46.770
curing people who are infected.

105
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.400
And so with the amazing start ripping across right from their base operations

106
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.840
spreading outward like a plague,

107
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.710
killing everybody who's infected with unlike literally just spraying them down

108
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.610
with heat vision.

109
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.160
This kind of switches back over to the heroes who basically say, okay,

110
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.980
now that we've got the actual cure, we need a test subject.

111
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.500
And initially black Canary, or it gets really green.

112
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:06.510
Canary now wants to start with Oliver queen,

113
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.750
but you end up having a scot-free who's like, no, we should start with Barta.

114
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.680
And scot-free plays this incredibly smart, right? Because Dinah gets off.

115
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:15.710
She's like, why should we start with BARDA? Right. Why should,

116
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:17.970
why should we start with Oliver? And Scott is like, well,

117
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.780
here's the thing to think.

118
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.150
<v 2>About Sila. Here's the thing to understand, see if something.</v>

119
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.450
<v 1>Goes wrong, then BARDA is probably strong enough to take it.</v>

120
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.600
We shouldn't really risk all cleans life. I read that and I was like,

121
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.183
well-played scot-free.

122
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.570
<v 2>Well played.</v>

123
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.810
<v 1>What will you end up doing is transitioning or at least kind of teleporting to a</v>

124
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.501
busy, uh,

125
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:41.700
a life habitable planet this out there by alpha Centauri by just some star out

126
00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:44.070
there. And we're, scot-free initially had Barta tied up.

127
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.070
She of course never left the planet, but she did escape her confines.

128
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.590
So at that point they were kind of concerned like where in the world could she

129
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:52.440
possibly be? And then she comes, crashing down on them, right?

130
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:54.960
Like immediately attacks scot-free. Now in that moment,

131
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:58.100
Superman grabs a syringe and stabs into, into Barta.

132
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.600
And then it's just a ticking clock, right?

133
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.060
Like at that point it's literally just the clock is ticking down, right.

134
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.610
Seconds and seconds and seconds. Like how long is this going to take?

135
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.950
And Barbara just keeps on going on the offense. Right.

136
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.140
Keeps on attacking and attacking and Superman. It's like, okay,

137
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.020
the cure doesn't work. Right? Like I've got to kill her. And Scott's like, no,

138
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:14.860
don't hurt her. And then she snaps out of it. Right? So the cure works.

139
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.910
The day is saved everybody. The day is saved. Right.

140
00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:23.290
Everything's copacetic big BARDA has been saved. So over to John Constantine,

141
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.501
right.

142
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.950
Sitting in this room that only he can access in the tower of fate possibly be

143
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.480
attacked by the cloak of rag man. Right.

144
00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:31.090
Because it's trying to take the soul of, of John Constantine.

145
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.080
And then here comes the tunnel and she is. Right.

146
00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:37.300
Because she's just kind of like, what are you doing, right. Like,

147
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:39.640
why do you have a room here that nobody can find?

148
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.850
Why do you have the wizard staff? Right? The,

149
00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:45.280
the wizard Shizam why do you have a staff and the spear of destiny and madams,

150
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.920
antidotes, crystal ball. Why do you have all this? Right.

151
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:50.530
You came back from this mission with Jason, Todd and Todd died,

152
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.010
but is this what he died for Z to grab you to grab some just stupid relics?

153
00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:57.070
Because from the perception of, of Natana Constantine,

154
00:06:57.071 --> 00:06:57.940
what did this whole mission,

155
00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:00.700
just for the sake of saving these last bits of magic,

156
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.230
maybe not really having anything to do with them,

157
00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:04.780
but just kind of collecting them, you know, for his own personal interest,

158
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:07.600
because that's really something that John Constantine would Duke do,

159
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.750
people into going on a mission that only he really cares about knowing they

160
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:13.210
would die, but not really caring. Right? Not really worrying,

161
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.290
not really worrying about it at all.

162
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.070
The funny thing about this is that with this door being blown open and no one

163
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:21.250
really being able to access it except for Constantine and apparently the Tauna,

164
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.990
because nobody was really supposed to know it was there.

165
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.170
She left the door blown open, right? When that happens, Constantine's like,

166
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:28.030
okay, you have no idea what you invited here.

167
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.900
Anybody can find this place inter the Phantom stranger, right?

168
00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:35.080
Phantom stranger just comes walking in to give the Marvel fans perspective.

169
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.900
Imagine the watcher just shows up. That's when you know,

170
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:41.320
things are going to pop off and the Phantom strangers like you stole Madam

171
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.760
madams, editor's crystal ball, the path you're on, you cannot continue on this.

172
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.310
And the response of Constantine is, but if I go off this path,

173
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.770
the entire earth is going to die. Right. I've seen the future.

174
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:53.410
I know what will happen. The entire earth is going to collapse.

175
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.940
We're all going to be destroyed.

176
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.740
And there'll be nothing that we can do about it.

177
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.330
And it's one of these things where he's kind of being,

178
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:01.780
being chastised by fandom street. Right. He asks, uh, he has a ton of like,

179
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.600
has he told you what he's done? And she's like, no. And he's like, well, I mean,

180
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:05.740
he took bragged. Man's cloak.

181
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.580
He stabbed rom MACUSA with the spear of destiny in order to get the crystal

182
00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:12.790
ball. And then he imprisoned Boston brand in the cloak of rag, man,

183
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.970
the toughest pitch. She's like, are you serious, man? Like these are allies,

184
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:16.840
right? These are friends,

185
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.970
people that we fought along with for years and years and years.

186
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.640
And you're going to turn on them like that. Like, why would you do that? Now?

187
00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:24.700
If anything, all this shows is how dark things are, right?

188
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:28.330
How desperate things are that this has to happen. Now, from there,

189
00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:31.240
you have Constantine who literally starts laying into the fandom stranger,

190
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.780
right? Like after what you did to get yourself doomed for all eternity. Right?

191
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.250
Because we can kind of go with the origin.

192
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:39.280
The Phantom stranger is basically Judas and he's the one that betrayed Jesus.

193
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:42.970
He's like, you're in turn, going to chastise me about the decisions I've made.

194
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.300
Fatal stranger gets, right? Since I'm flying into a wall and then Constantine,

195
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:49.330
brandishes the spear of destiny, which can kill the fandom stranger.

196
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:51.130
And it's like, go on, dude. If you want to play this game,

197
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:54.340
we can play this game. I promise you we'll die. Then suddenly out of nowhere,

198
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.060
ExtraGen pops. Right. And ed Trigon's like gone now, Oh,

199
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.250
at your gun and rise again, the form of man, right.

200
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:02.130
Changes back into Jason blood and says, Constantine, we're screwed.

201
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:03.150
And he's like, why? And he's like,

202
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.300
because Trigon's coming while he's going to be here in moments, right.

203
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:07.920
In moments, he's going to burst through that.

204
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.290
They're going to burst through the earth and all hell's going to break loose,

205
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.810
right? Hell is going to be coming with them. You know? And he's like,

206
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.000
and there's more on top of that. And he's like, of course,

207
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:16.710
because try going invading the earth is not enough.

208
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.180
What more could possibly be going on.

209
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.660
And he basically tells them what's going on with the amazing,

210
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.590
with the amazing spreading across the world.

211
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.420
Things are getting dire for the superheroes. Very, very, very, very fast, right?

212
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.850
Because on one side they have all the villains who've banded together and

213
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:36.450
launched this army of amazing hosts to spread across the world and kill all the

214
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:39.600
various people that they now have a cure for. On the other side,

215
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.020
they've got trigon, who's showing up here. Now let's be honest with ourselves.

216
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.050
The biggest threat out of all these things that we're facing right now is

217
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:47.340
obviously trigon, right?

218
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.130
Trigon's like the biggest threat they have to deal with right now.

219
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.770
But it's one of these things where it's like, which one do they choose?

220
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.910
If they choose try again,

221
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.890
then the appraisals are gonna just going to tear everything up.

222
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:58.350
So there's not really going to be anything anybody left to save,

223
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.530
but if they ignore trigon and they focus on the [inaudible],

224
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.590
there's not going to be anything left to save. Right? So like the earth,

225
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.950
all of them will all basically just be cleansed and destroyed and that'll be it

226
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.070
because remember Trigon's here because he's angry over the fact that these

227
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.500
individuals who are infected with the anti-life virus,

228
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.300
that they're not really living with, they're not really dead.

229
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.860
And they technically should be dead.

230
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.040
And because of the fact that they're not trying and feels robbed of their souls,

231
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:20.221
right.

232
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:23.340
He feels robbed the fact that he's not able to take those individuals and bring

233
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:24.270
them to his realm. Right.

234
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:27.450
So he's basically just showing up to kill them all to take their souls. Right.

235
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:31.170
Because they are in effect mostly dead. Right. Just not officially dead.

236
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.460
And so from there, they're like, okay,

237
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.470
like the heroes kind of band together and say, okay.

238
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.610
So like the only real option that we have here is to effectively synthesize a

239
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:42.330
cure and then spread that cure around the world, just like try it, right?

240
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:44.220
Because the amazeballs are governed by programming.

241
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.900
And if the amazings are governed by programming,

242
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:48.630
their program says they have to kill those who were infected with the anti-elite

243
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.570
virus. But if there is nobody infected with the anti-elite virus,

244
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.800
there'd be nothing for them to destroy.

245
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.260
They would just stop what they were doing and just kind of free flow. Right.

246
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:56.340
They would just stay there, either that,

247
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:59.220
or go back to their home base and just say like all the on life had been

248
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.740
destroyed basically because there is no one life anymore.

249
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.960
So they killed the ones that were there before all of them were cured.

250
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.300
The only way to really do this,

251
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:09.810
the only way to really pull this off is through a combination of the flash and

252
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:12.840
cyborg and really the flash more than anything else where he basically rolls

253
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:15.910
through and reads all these different books on how to produce or how to,

254
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:20.190
how to duplicate viruses or cures using that combined with the plasma cells,

255
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.110
from sideboards blood, the flashes abilities,

256
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.790
he was able to basically create 3 billion copies of the serum in moments, right.

257
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.580
Probably a, you know, an hour or two. But like around that time, you know, with,

258
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.550
within those moments, like tried in bus out in Paris, right?

259
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:35.550
Like immediately explodes in Paris. All these unlikes come flooding,

260
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:40.070
flooding towards them. And in 15 minutes, everybody in Paris is dead. Right.

261
00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:42.500
The entirety of Paris is totally and totally destroyed.

262
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.420
Now I know for somebody like try again and you know,

263
00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:46.970
this doesn't really seem like a huge grandiose thing,

264
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.650
but this is kind of the nature of DC comics.

265
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.440
You don't really see things like Marvel, right. And this was a Marvel story.

266
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:54.370
It would be like, you know, try gonna merge. And then within two seconds,

267
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:56.500
everybody in Paris was dead. Like that's not really,

268
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.300
that's not really realistic,

269
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.940
at least as realistic as you can get when it comes to comics. Right? I mean,

270
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:04.840
we're talking about a demon emerging from health off because people infected

271
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.940
with a digital virus aren't really dead. Right.

272
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:09.160
So how realistic could we possibly be here?

273
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.790
But in comparison between Marvel and DC, DC plays a more quote,

274
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:15.520
unquote realistic tone with her comics did Marvel does, right.

275
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:18.490
That's why things were a lot more toned down and not necessarily as fight of

276
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:21.340
fancy as Marvel gets. And so, because of that, try again, you know,

277
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.370
just kind of makes his way out of Paris. Now with that being the case,

278
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:28.150
Constantine goes and gets, doc goes and gets Dr. Peyton says, okay,

279
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.090
I need you to see what's in this room. When Dr. Fait goes into the room,

280
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.680
that Constantine always kept hidden.

281
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.550
He's met by ed trigon and the Phantom stranger and John Constantine putting on

282
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:40.420
the cloak of rag, man. And that's when Dr. Fait's like, okay, wow, okay.

283
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:43.510
This is bad. Like, things are really bad. If you've got trigon here,

284
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:44.890
you've got the Phantom stranger.

285
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.360
Who's basically this omnipotent omniscient guy who basically swears to never

286
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:52.840
interfere. Like things must be exceedingly bad here.

287
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.610
And that's what Constantine's like. Yeah. They are.

288
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.500
I'm going to need your ambulance and I'm going to need your help.

289
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.870
And Dr. Fait's like, that's not going to happen, man.

290
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.230
I'm not going to give you that. And that moment, Phantom stranger stabs Dr.

291
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:04.630
Fate, right? Just like plunges the spear of destiny right. Through them.

292
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.550
And what it's just kind of like, why did you do that? And he's like,

293
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:09.640
because Constantine showed me the future and you would stop him from doing what

294
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:13.120
needs to be done. Right. So we got to take you out. But the helm of Nabu,

295
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.180
which Dr. Fait wares can not be, just take it. Right.

296
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:19.600
It has to be relinquished freely. He has to basically give it to somebody.

297
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.820
And so consciously it's like, yeah, I'm well aware of that.

298
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.590
So we grabbed the spear of the wizard.

299
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.330
Shizam puts his hand to Dr. Fait's head and then shouts Shizam and all the power

300
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:32.140
of Dr. Fate transfers to John Constantine, which he in turn cakes,

301
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:36.370
the helm takes the ambulette and says time to go right now, inter Zatanna right.

302
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.730
She comes back in like, okay, what's going on? Like, you just took the power,

303
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:42.730
Dr. Fait, like what in the world is going on here? And Constantine's like,

304
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.340
I'm going to go save the day. Now the reality here that the,

305
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.610
of what Tom Taylor tells us is it doesn't look like Constantine's going to

306
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:51.310
survive, but it doesn't look like he's going to lift through, this is a Tonna.

307
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.810
Isn't told this, you know, she's like,

308
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.640
are you going to be able to come back from this? And he's like, of course,

309
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:56.740
it's me. Why wouldn't I be able to come back from that? Right.

310
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.160
But he doesn't actually say, yes, I'll come back. You just says, yeah, it's me.

311
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.300
Right. And so, because of that,

312
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.310
where he doesn't really give her a definitive answer,

313
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.400
it seems to me because she would try to stop him the question to ask you,

314
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.470
if he's armed with a spirit that can kill a God.

315
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.740
If he's armed with a magical power of Dr. Fait, which is comparable,

316
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.230
if not more powerful than the power of Dr. Strange,

317
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.090
if he's got the cloak of Rodman, right.

318
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:20.020
