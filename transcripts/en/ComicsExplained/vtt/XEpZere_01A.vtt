4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.050
Okay. So we are picking up with the conclusion of a Batman ghosts.

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.680
<v 1>No worries. Right? This is the end of the Batman ghost stories story.</v>

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.800
And I am a little bit on the fence about how this ends,

7
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.990
but I'm also excited at the same time, but overall,

8
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.730
the story was absolutely amazing, right?

9
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:28.850
And this is one of those stories that one I urge you guys buy. And two,

10
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:31.670
I'm going to, I'm going to buy the physical copy of it. But as you get,

11
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:34.850
most of you guys know, I only ever buy physical copies of comics.

12
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:36.800
If they're important to me at this point in my life,

13
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.230
after having spent so many years buying physical comics,

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.570
I just got rid of my collection. That is by digitally now, right?

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.150
It's just so much easier than walking around with like, you know,

16
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.150
20 comics at a time trying to read them. So, uh,

17
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.290
so the first thing we do here is we basically pick up with what is in essence,

18
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.110
the final flashback of the ghost stories story, right?

19
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.720
In the sense that we have Batman and we have, or really Bruce Wayne,

20
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.090
and we have a ghost maker kind of having this conversation.

21
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.090
And the interesting thing about this is that Bruce Wayne kind of sees us

22
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:05.060
training as being completed, right? He's basically done. And at this point,

23
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:07.580
he's ready to head back to Gotham city and become a crime fighter.

24
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.200
And when he's met by ghost maker,

25
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.170
the responsive ghost maker is you're not ready. And when he asks,

26
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:16.460
why there's this really amazing conversation that goes on between the two now

27
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:17.750
for ghost maker, as a character,

28
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.080
it's very easy to talk him up where it could have been very easy to talk him up

29
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.960
as your stereotypical villain, right? A guy who just does stuff.

30
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.990
And he's essentially a vigilante and he's got no regard for human life and

31
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:28.550
nothing matters or anything like that.

32
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.490
But the reality is that while he does have a disregard for human life,

33
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.400
his motivation for it is actually altruistic.

34
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.900
And I know that sounds like an oxymoron.

35
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.230
How could you believe in doing the right thing? Because it's the right thing.

36
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.510
And at the same time, not care about people, right?

37
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.180
But one of the things to understand is that doing the right thing does not

38
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:45.890
necessarily mean the preservation of life.

39
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.950
Those two things are not mutually exclusive that in a world of like

40
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:51.290
utilitarianism, for example, doing the best,

41
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.780
or at least the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the fear,

42
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.410
which could mean sacrificing a few people. And that's kind of the stance of,

43
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:00.440
of ghosts maker, really. And to kind of put a finer point on it.

44
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.830
That's this whole perception. When he has this conversation with Batman,

45
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.300
he beats it. He says like, you're not ready here.

46
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.170
And when Batman asks why he says, because the entire motivation that you,

47
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.240
that you exist on exists in two fronts,

48
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.900
the first is that you're going back to Gotham city to fight crime because your

49
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.170
mommy and your daddy got shot and your that's your entire motivation,

50
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.090
your motivation is external, right?

51
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.490
You're like a person that wants to lose weight to impress a girl, right.

52
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:23.780
As soon as he has that girl impressed,

53
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.510
what's his motivation to keep losing weight anymore. At that point,

54
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:29.390
like his entire motivation has gone and he'll slip right back to where he was

55
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:32.210
before. When you get to a point where you believe that, like, you're,

56
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.000
you finally avenge the idea of your mom and your dad,

57
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.250
then where does Gotham city go from there? Do you retire?

58
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.430
Let it fall back into the hands of those individuals who corrupted in the first

59
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.950
place. What's how does that, how does that whole end result?

60
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.470
The other part of that is in order for you to succeed,

61
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.860
you need an internal motivation. And that's where,

62
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:50.540
where you kind of outlined the difference between himself and Bruce Wayne,

63
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.510
that with Bruce Wayne, he wants to get basically it's its vengeance.

64
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.570
It's the most basic principle is vengeance because as mom and dad were gone,

65
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.290
mom and dad got shot and he's going to get back to crime, right?

66
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.970
He's not going to get back at an individual person,

67
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.910
but he's going to get practice at the entire principle of crime for ghosts

68
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.850
maker. It's legitimately wanting to make the world better.

69
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.450
It's truthfully wanting to actually make the world a better place.

70
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.030
It's it's really just altruism at its finest.

71
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.540
Now where the two of them disagree is the collateral damage. That when,

72
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.130
when ghost maker looks at Batman, he says,

73
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:22.030
the problem that you have here is that you basically let every small little

74
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.000
thing get to you. You know, in this instance, your mom and dad were shot.

75
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.260
Now you want to get back at crunch.

76
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.440
But the entire motivation is that nobody will ever feel the same thing you felt.

77
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.610
Well, what happens if they do?

78
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.000
What happens if you get to a crime scene a minute to a minute later than it

79
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:34.660
actually happened?

80
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.960
What happens if you can't stop that guy from pulling the trigger and an innocent

81
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:39.340
person dies? What happens? Well,

82
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:42.070
then now you see yourself as a failure because you didn't live up to your

83
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.000
motivation, right?

84
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.640
You didn't live up to the cause that you were supposed to be pushing on at the

85
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.680
same time, you're basically selfish, right?

86
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:50.680
Like I want to basically make the world a better place. We talked about that.

87
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.620
You're just a really upset kid who wants to go back and make Gotham a better

88
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:56.080
place. But the reality is making the world better,

89
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.630
means not caring about people. And again,

90
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.760
I know it sounds weird to here's how we explained it, right?

91
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.640
It's actually a genius way. It's, it's a really interesting way of doing it.

92
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.580
His whole stance is if you don't really care about people,

93
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.590
then the ends justify the means.

94
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.110
And if the end result is basically what amounts,

95
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.250
so more or less a utopian world, where there really is no crime,

96
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.640
because you're finding the concept on crime of crime, on multiple levels, right.

97
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:19.740
You're finding it on the street level by putting away criminals.

98
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.830
And then you're finding it on the various other levels in terms of why people

99
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.350
commit crimes, you're basically stemming it, right? So like, you know,

100
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:27.270
economic inequality, different things like that.

101
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.400
You're fighting it all on multiple fronts. You know,

102
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:33.360
the idea of creating a utopian style world outweighs the number of people who

103
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:35.580
died. And that's true. That is a true statement.

104
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.450
If the end result is that the world wouldn't inherently become a utopian place,

105
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:42.060
not by way of like some kind of fascism or anything like that.

106
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.760
But by people being able to just kind of live their lives in peace,

107
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.000
not having to worry about crime, pursuing the things they love the most, right.

108
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.010
Just kind of enjoying their lives essentially.

109
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.580
Then it's worth the sacrifices of all those individuals who were killed. Now.

110
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.520
It doesn't mean that ghost maker's going to go through and just murder innocent

111
00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:00.000
people. But it does mean that he has to kind of regard people, right?

112
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:02.070
He has to look at two circumstances and say, okay,

113
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.190
I could stop this guy here from killing that one person.

114
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.990
Or I could let them kill that one person,

115
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.750
follow them back to their base of operations, which I don't know.

116
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.000
And men get all the criminals at the same time.

117
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.510
So I will sacrifice that one guy in order to apprehend those bigger guys. Right.

118
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.670
And it kind of sucks, but it's one of these things where,

119
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.100
when it comes to the world of fighting crime and trying to do better in the

120
00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:23.010
world, you can't have it all. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

121
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.310
You can't spare the life of the innocent guy and get all the criminals at the

122
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:28.740
same time. More often than not. It doesn't work that way.

123
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.790
It'd be nice if it did.

124
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.910
But the reality of the world we live in is you have to make choices.

125
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.490
And sometimes these choices will be ones you don't want to make.

126
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.353
But at the end of the day,

127
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.420
what you're getting out of the choice you make is better than what you're losing

128
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:42.090
in the choice that you're making. Right? So it's, it's one of these interesting,

129
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.310
interesting kind of philosophies, interesting situations,

130
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.950
but that's where him and Bruce Wayne differ because Bruce Wayne believes that he

131
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:47.940
can have it all right.

132
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.120
He can save the innocent guy and he can top of the criminal and he can kind of

133
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:54.540
make it, make the day better and, and make it Gotham city a much safer place.

134
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.500
The irony of all this is that if you look at the history of Wayne,

135
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.550
he's basically a dog chasing his tail. The criminals never really get fixed.

136
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:04.100
They never really get changed. They are, they're always bad guys, right?

137
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.640
He really hasn't made any headway in making Gotham better. If anything,

138
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.130
he's made Gotham worse. And so that's kind of the irony here.

139
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.811
That's kind of the, the,

140
00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:14.450
the whole point that ghost maker was trying to teach him is you're not ready to

141
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.930
actually do what needs to be done because you believe that you need to save

142
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.980
everybody when all the,

143
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:22.880
while the reality is some folks you're just going to have to let die in order to

144
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.160
catch the bigger fish. It sucks. It's not there,

145
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.860
but nobody ever said the world was as well, because that, you know,

146
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.100
ultimately you kind of have Bruce Wayne and ghost maker just disagreeing and

147
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.280
going their separate ways. Right? And so far as, uh, Bruce Wayne basically says,

148
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.010
fine, I'm going back to Gotham city. I don't ever want to see you there.

149
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.280
And that's when the truce gets struck where ghost maker says, okay, fine.

150
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.370
Didn't, that's the rule. Any city that I'm currently in,

151
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.370
you did not come to you. Right? If a city has been seen by me, right.

152
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.710
In the sense that like I've been there, I've involved myself there,

153
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.730
then you never come there.

154
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.890
And I will never go to any city that you've touched foot in.

155
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.690
These are our own little territories,

156
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:57.110
our own little places where wherever we set up shop, nobody else gets involved.

157
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.680
And so what we ended up doing is switching up to the, really the,

158
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:03.230
the end of the last video, when count Hunter intends to kill Harley Quinn.

159
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.760
And that's kind of the funny thing here, right?

160
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:08.000
That you have this discussion between these two guys are really just kind of

161
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.650
between Batman and Carmen Hunter,

162
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.070
where Batman tries to talk him down the entire time this was going on,

163
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.440
ghost maker is watching all this unfold. And, and, and really the,

164
00:07:16.441 --> 00:07:19.910
the point that ghost maker was trying to prove to Batman is if you put people in

165
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.790
a circumstance where there's no reward for doing the right thing,

166
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.800
but no consequence for doing the wrong thing,

167
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.410
people will do the wrong thing because more often than not,

168
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.070
the wrong thing is easier. The lazy user model and the least effort principle,

169
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.310
right,

170
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.580
at least ever principle was a concept created by George Ziff back in 1949,

171
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.860
which basically said that like, people want the want,

172
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:39.730
the greatest reward for the least amount of work. The laser user,

173
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.260
the lazy user model kind of builds on that work. Now,

174
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:46.220
the idea of Elise ever principle expands way beyond more than simply just,

175
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:48.560
you know, work and reward and stuff like that.

176
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:52.880
It actually encompasses every facet of human and really just every ecosystem in

177
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:56.090
the world, right? Animal life, plant life, even electricity, things like that,

178
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:57.230
the path of least resistance.

179
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.510
But it's kind of like that grocery cart litmus test.

180
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.500
I don't know if you guys ever heard of that,

181
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.070
but the grocery cart litmus test is this concept in social psychology,

182
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.530
where basically it kind of answers the question.

183
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.570
What would people do in a situation where again,

184
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.340
there's no reward for doing the right thing,

185
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.140
but no consequence for doing the wrong thing.

186
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.450
And so if you have a grocery card and you take it out, you know,

187
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:16.880
you bring it out to the parking lot. You put all your groceries in your car.

188
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.910
There's no consequence nobody's going to arrest you or give you a ticket.

189
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.110
Nothing bad is going to happen.

190
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.690
If you just leave that grocery cart sitting next to your vehicle,

191
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.420
and then you pull out, drive home and that's it. But you know,

192
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.870
it's the right thing to do to put the grocery cart back in the carousel. Again,

193
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.040
it's a minuscule thing,

194
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.820
but ultimately it's designed to kind of test people and put them in a situation

195
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:37.430
where, you know, where you ask the question, what will they do in this?

196
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:38.540
What will they do in this situation?

197
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.120
A lot of people leave the grocery cart sitting next to their cart,

198
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.610
which is basically kind of a test of whether or not people can actually

199
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:45.950
self-govern right. Well, people do the right thing,

200
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.900
even if there's no reward for doing the right thing.

201
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.550
And the answer to that is more often than not.

202
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.270
No people usually want that's the whole point that ghost maker is creating here

203
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.120
for Batman to see that clown Hunter has been given the ability to kill Harley

204
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:59.940
Quinn. He can take all his anger and all his, all his revenge,

205
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.710
all his wrath out on Harley Quinn,

206
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.770
because she was there when his parents were killed at the hands of the joker.

207
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.310
She's not the joker himself, but she's the closest the clown Hunter can get.

208
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.120
And so in this moment, when calm Hunter's being talked to by Batman and clown,

209
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.840
Hunter has the choice to either walk away or to kill Harley Quinn.

210
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.530
He goes in for the kill and had Batman not breaking himself out of his bow,

211
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.920
out of his bonds, thrown his batarang at Harley Quinn, which she can in turn,

212
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.250
cut herself out and then free yourself before, before calm Hunter killer.

213
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.250
And before bat, you know, if that man had not been able to subdue count, Hunter,

214
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.430
Holly Quinn would have been killed. He would have been to his base or instinct.

215
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.900
And the whole idea behind this here,

216
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.020
this is what's intriguing is the whole idea behind this is that while,

217
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:37.854
while count,

218
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.280
Hunter's kind of the minority here in so far that Carly Quinn's turned over a

219
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:44.100
new leaf. Batman never really had a new leaf to turn over in the first place,

220
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:45.360
but he's always taken the high road.

221
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.530
I would surmise these two are the exception to the rule and not the rule itself.

222
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.100
And the reason why is simple Harley Quinn, it creates this case for us,

223
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.110
where she basically starts talking to them and saying, Hey, look,

224
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.870
I was a psychiatrist. Let me talk to you for a second. Right.

225
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:59.880
And almost talks to them like a patient. She says, look,

226
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.220
there's something you need to understand. Right. Hear me out.

227
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.070
And then when I'm done talking, you can kill me if you really want to.

228
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.090
And so he's like, okay, fine.

229
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.450
And one of the things she basically says here is I'm not really responsible for

230
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.120
the things that I did, and it's not really set in so many words,

231
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.390
but it's basically, I was at a point in my life where I was at a really, really,

232
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:17.850
really low place. Right. I was in a really bad spot.

233
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.270
And then suddenly a man came along who told me everything that I wanted to hear

234
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.530
that made me feel special.

235
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.220
That made me feel relevant in a world where I felt painfully irrelevant and I

236
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:27.054
got carried away with it.

237
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.940
But the crazy thing about this is one thing to understand with Harley Quinn,

238
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.420
she wasn't hypnotized. She wasn't tricked, she wasn't mind controlled.

239
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.880
She was manipulated to a degree, but at the same time,

240
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:38.460
she also understood the consequences of her actions.

241
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.470
She knew that she was doing the wrong thing.

242
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.500
We know that she knows she was doing the wrong thing because over the course of

243
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:44.550
her publication history,

244
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.670
she recognized the problems she had and actually tried to leave the joker,

245
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.670
but kept going back. But if she understands the problem,

246
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.040
but then makes temporary efforts to fix the problem,

247
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.570
but then ultimately relapses.

248
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.410
Then that means she is responsible for her actions because she understands that

249
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:00.720
what she's doing is wrong. And so because of that, the, the,

250
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.690
the kind of argument of, well, I'm not really responsible for what I did on me.

251
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:05.100
I'm sorry that your, your parents died,

252
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:08.100
but it's not really my fault at the end of the day. It still is.

253
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.260
And she understands that when she goes, as far as to say,

254
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:13.200
like I made a lot of mistakes, I did a lot of things that I shouldn't have done,

255
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.720
and I'm going to pay those consequences for the rest of my life.

256
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.780
But I'm just trying to be a better version of myself. Right. And you know, when,

257
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:21.750
when she sits down and offers a kind of apology to Kevin, you know,

258
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.700
that's really all he gets out of her in reality.

259
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:25.110
That's all he really can get out of her.

260
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.900
And initially it doesn't seem to be enough. And he actually intended, you know,

261
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:30.960
it looks like he intends to go in for the kill, but then essentially does it,

262
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.000
right. He actually does. Doesn't really kill Harley Quinn.

263
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.720
And so that moment of an apology seems to be enough for him to kind of say,

264
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:39.180
okay, I need to be on my own and rethink things. Now,

265
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:41.700
the reality of this is that if this was in the real world,

266
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.090
Holly Quinn would have died because if we had a situation where somebody had

267
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:47.310
killed your parents in a violent crime,

268
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.890
and then in turn showed up to you and said, Hey, I'm sorry,

269
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:52.950
I killed your parents at some future point in time. That wouldn't be enough.

270
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.170
Right? I mean an apology. It's all you get. That wouldn't be enough, right?

271
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:59.230
I mean, we'd, we'd be screening for blood right. Eye for an eye, you know?

272
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:01.800
And so he, you know, any normal and would've stabbed her to death.

273
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.100
And that's why I think the philosophy of ghosts maker, it rings true.

274
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.910
It really does ring true here because we're, we're con hunters. Okay, fine.

275
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:11.130
You know, or, you know, I got to get where you're coming from. Again,

276
00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:14.040
it's all the exception to the rule that under any normal circumstance,

277
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.750
they would have lashed out. They would have attacked them.

278
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.800
And so for the most part,

279
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.030
the Batman comics in terms of how they're being shown here are very optimistic,

280
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.600
which is kind of ironic given how pessimistic the city of Gotham is.

281
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.530
And that's one of the reasons why ghosts maker being involved here makes things

282
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:33.090
so intriguing. Her stance on this is I could catch that voice if I wanted to.

283
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.890
And then he goes so far as to ask Batman,

284
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.500
what were you trying to prove there by, by having this,

285
00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:40.290
by convincing this kid or getting this kid to listen to Harley Quinn and then

286
00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:41.850
walk away from the idea of killing her,

287
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.910
what do you believe that you've proved here? And the stance of Batman is, um,

288
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.530
it's not about proving anything, right?

289
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:49.680
Like I just genuinely care about the kid and I didn't want to see him ruin his

290
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:50.040
life.

291
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.770
But the other thing that you kind of have to ask here is that if you look at

292
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.750
somebody like ghosts maker, and you say, okay,

293
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.510
this is a guy who approached the world with the idea that the world could

294
00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.010
legitimately be saved and killed.

295
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.150
Criminals is a small price to pay for the betterment of the billions of people

296
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:06.270
across the face of the world. Then in turn, the question has to be asked,

297
00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:09.210
how did he get to that point? And how does he maintain that position?

298
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.100
Is you really just that obstinate, right?

299
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.230
As he really just that unwilling to listen the reason,

300
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.350
or if he's really as intelligent as Bruce Wayne believes he is,

301
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.570
and is really as intelligent as we're being told, he is,

302
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.630
then he has to have come across different situations over the course of his

303
00:13:21.631 --> 00:13:22.020
life.

304
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.130
That reaffirmed the idea that a villains are given a choice between reforming or

305
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:28.050
staying villains they'll stay villains, right?

306
00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:30.390
Because it's either what they're used to. It's easier,

307
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.520
but people will be able to be more likely to commit a crime,

308
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:35.640
to achieve a goal than they will be to. We work hard, right? Again,

309
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.850
the least effort principle that people want the greatest reward for them,

310
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.490
the least amount of work that they can do. And so, because of that,

311
00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:44.160
like a fight kind of breaks out between the two of them, you know, kind of this,

312
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:46.980
this final fight that we get. And that then goes as far as to say it, like,

313
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.820
do you know how many times I could have killed Harley Quinn over the years?

314
00:13:50.821 --> 00:13:51.060
Right?

315
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.080
How many easy it would have been to just eliminate Joker's closest associates,

316
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.500
but then nobody learns. Nobody changes. Nothing's better in the end.

317
00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:02.580
Now the response of ghost maker is not everyone can be safe and the response of

318
00:14:02.581 --> 00:14:04.740
Batman is, but most people can.

319
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.460
And you usually cannot tell when you're face-to-face with them on the worst day

320
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.950
of their life. But here's the irony about all that, right?

321
00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:14.790
This is why I advocate for the joker being killed by Batman in college,

322
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.520
obviously come back at some point online, but it's why I think Kelly,

323
00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:19.340
the joker in Gotham is the only right thing,

324
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.970
because this assumes that the person you're facing off against is a person of

325
00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:25.500
reasonable, rational sound,

326
00:14:25.501 --> 00:14:29.340
mind who is otherwise taken into a situation that they normally wouldn't put

327
00:14:29.341 --> 00:14:32.040
themselves in, right? Like a husband loses his job.

328
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.890
And in order to make ends meet, he robs a bank to buy food.

329
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.560
That's a very tangible and realistic scenario that we see unfolded even now

330
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.620
out there in the world. Now, if Batman would have come across that guy,

331
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.620
while he's robbing that bank in that moment of desperation,

332
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.800
then Batman's statement rings true. Like you cannot really,

333
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.750
you can't see people how great they can be when you're seeing them in the worst

334
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:56.450
day of their life. Right. That moment of desperation.

335
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.620
But the thing about the joker is he's always been crazy. The Joker's not a guy.

336
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.150
Well, I guess ever since he became the joker,

337
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.690
but the is not a guy where he gets up in the morning, he gets a cup of coffee.

338
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:08.960
He watches the morning news and he says, okay, time to go be crazy.

339
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.530
And then he just goes and does crazy stuff. The Joker's crazy, 24 hours a day,

340
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:15.200
he sleeps crazy, right? He eats crazy. You know, he like,

341
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.030
he is constantly crazy. He is beyond being helped any possible help.

342
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.610
Any reformation, any fixing him is a pipe dream.

343
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.850
This idea of Batman saying like the average person can be fixed.

344
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:26.511
They can be saved.

345
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:29.480
That's true because Holly Quinn was not nearly as crazy as the joker.

346
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.610
She wasn't nearly as lost as the Joe for what,

347
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.730
there was always that portion of her that knew that she was doing the wrong

348
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.120
thing.

349
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.510
And Batman could tap into that and always try to find a way to bring her back.

350
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.750
Even if she wasn't readily accepting of it, where the joker that's gone,

351
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.060
any semblance of humanity that joker previously had any semblance of rationality

352
00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:49.270
outside of whatever it is is it I can do to get that man to chase me is the

353
00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:52.750
thing that I will do. That's gone. The joker is, is, is really like,

354
00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:55.330
he's not really even human anymore. Right? And so, because of that,

355
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.320
there's no saving him.

356
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.650
There's no point where Batman will ever come across a situation and say, okay,

357
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.370
now I've quote unquote, fixed the joker. He's back to being a rational person.

358
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.010
Everything will be safe. I guess the white Knight might work.

359
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.140
And so far it's like feeding him joker pills, right?

360
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:10.660
But in terms of organically getting him back back to being normal,

361
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.300
that's never going to happen. And so, as long as the joker is alive,

362
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.880
the joker will do everything. He can to get Batman, to chase him.

363
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.450
And because of his psych, uh, his, his, his psychosis, and because of his, uh,

364
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.590
his being associate path,

365
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.190
he has a complete and total disregard for the thoughts, feelings, emotions,

366
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.430
and lives of other people, right. They're irrelevant to him.

367
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.770
They're pawns in this game that he plays with Batman.

368
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.190
And so the only way to save people from the joker is to kill the joker.

369
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.300
The fact that that man never done that yet really says volumes about Batman

370
00:16:37.301 --> 00:16:41.470
stance on sacrificing innocent people on behalf of keeping the joker alive,

371
00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:45.850
right? It is a reverse version of utilitarianism, but done in a perverse way.

372
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.140
And that's, that's something that I want to clear.

373
00:16:47.141 --> 00:16:49.960
That's why I advocate for the joker being killed in light of all that.

374
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.230
I don't really see how any rational person could advocate for the joker.

375
00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:55.780
Staying alive as a Batman should kill him. Right? At this point,

376
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.100
it's just the right thing to do.

377
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.280
And so it's one of these things where Batman kind of gives up the fight with

378
00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:02.500
ghost maker says, look, we've been fighting long enough, right?

379
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.200
We've been fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting. And in all reality,

380
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.150
I've got my place here. You've got your place there,

381
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.460
wherever it is that you happen to be, I'm tired of fighting you.

382
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:10.600
I'm tired of doing this.

383
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.140
And so in response like Batman starts to put his guard back on and ghost maker

384
00:17:14.141 --> 00:17:14.830
kind of says, you know,

385
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.680
I always kind of wished you'd come charging out into with one of your cars.

386
00:17:17.681 --> 00:17:20.380
Right. I was always jealous of your cars. I always thought they were cool.

387
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.270
You know, and that means like I'm building a new one and he's like,

388
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:24.970
is it a flying car? It's like, Nope, it's just a wheels on the ground car.

389
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:28.360
Right? Because remember joker Batman's lost pretty much all his wealth, right.

390
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.700
He's not really as wealthy as he used to be. Ah, he,

391
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.560
all that money has been seized, right? I mean, well,

392
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:35.320
I guess really Lucius Fox is the one that runs Wayne enterprises,

393
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:37.870
but Bruce Wayne himself is no longer in his company. Right.

394
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:40.960
That was one of the big fallout, fallout aspects of joker war.

395
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.810
It really is just him and his wits and, you know,

396
00:17:43.811 --> 00:17:46.540
using whatever the resources you can to do whatever it is that he can,

397
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.700
but ultimately ghost makers like, okay, fine.

398
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.490
Then I'll be watching you on the go snack. Right.

399
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:53.580
I'll be keeping an eye on you in your city because I'm curious to see,

400
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:56.430
are you really going to be able to STEM the flow of crime here in Gotham?

401
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.550
Or are you going to be like, you've always been a dog chasing his tail,

402
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.850
wondering why things aren't getting better, but then Batman stops him and says,

403
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.460
you don't actually have to leave here. Right? Like, I mean,

404
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.420
this truth that we have is there because we really have more respect for each

405
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.930
other. And it's more of a rivalry than ultra outright hatred for each other.

406
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.960
But at the end of the day, we both respect the other's ability. Right?

407
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:20.550
You bring a level of skill to Gotham that nobody else in the bat family has.

408
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.930
And between you and me, we compliment each other exceedingly well, so come June,

409
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.720
come to Gotham city, but come and help me save this city. Right?

410
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.930
If you believe that I could do things better than show me how to do things

411
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:34.200
better. Right. Don't kill anybody in my city, but let's make things better.

412
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.050
We can fight crime on a multitude of different levels. Right.

413
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:38.940
We can do it in a myriad of different ways.

414
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.910
And so initially the response of ghost maker is, man, I don't,

415
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.010
I don't really know about that. That man is like, come on, dude. Like,

416
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.210
what do you have to lose?

417
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.190
And so ultimately ghost maker accepts ghost maker accepts and joins Batman in

418
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:52.260
Gotham city and becomes part of the bath family.

419
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:55.770
Now here's the thing I'm kind of, I'm, I'm, I'm excited about this, right?

420
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.380
I'm a little iffy on how it ends because of the fact that like,

421
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.110
we're not going to find out until March, which kind of me off.

422
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.950
But I do like the idea of ghost maker. I love the character of ghost maker.

423
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.070
He's amazing, absolutely adore the character of ghost maker. Um,

424
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.560
I think it's one of the most interesting additions to the bad family that's been

425
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:11.550
done in recent years.

426
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.220
And when I say recent years since like grant Morrison's run, right?

427
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.110
Like since Batman incorporated, I think it's cool.

428
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.640
And maybe even before Batman incorporated,

429
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:20.160
I think ghost maker is probably one of the most interesting characters ever

430
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:23.250
introduced to the Batman mythos. I'm really excited to see where it goes.

431
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.640
But the reason why we have to wait until March is because next month we get

432
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.540
future state. So yes, we are getting the future state event and DC comics with,

433
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.050
uh, the future bat wing, the son of Lucius Fox. I'm excited about this.

434
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.131
What I'm excited about,

435
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:38.160
about the new Batman coming and the new new future state Batman comics.

436
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.890
But with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end. Uh,

437
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.680
if you guys are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

438
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:45.900
button to become part of the rod court, if you guys enjoyed this video,

439
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.430
make sure you drop a like,

440
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.500
and I wouldn't know what you guys think about this story. Right?

441
00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:51.690
Leave a comment down in the description and, uh,

442
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.300
or in the comment section rather, and I will catch you all later.

443
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:55.940
<v 2>Please.</v>
