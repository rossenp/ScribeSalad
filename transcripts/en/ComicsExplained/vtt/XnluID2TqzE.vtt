4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.000
All right. What's going on guys.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.220
<v 1>Is Rob and we are picking back up again with Batman. Again,</v>

6
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.200
we're kind of continuing the aftermath of joker war,

7
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:20.990
but this time we are picking up with Batman's new villain,

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.080
that ghost maker and this guy's cool. And I dig was happening here.

9
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:28.610
Here's the funny thing is I didn't expect like ghosts maker to encounter Batman

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.820
for like another three issues are so wide off the bat. Like you have you,

11
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:33.470
you like literally in this first issue,

12
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.950
Batman takes this guy on and it's kinda crazy, right? It's kind of wonky here.

13
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.340
So, um, because of the fact that this is kind of the aftermath of joker war,

14
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.280
we're still gonna see some themes from that story being thrown in.

15
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.280
But the first thing we do here is we get this bit of an exposition right in

16
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:48.470
downtown Gotham city, really in an old town, uh,

17
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.380
you've got basically ghost ghost maker talking to this cough,

18
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.490
and this cop's been captured.

19
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.520
This guy's been strung up and ghost makers kind of giving us this perspective of

20
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.490
Gotham city, right. In the sense that he hates Gotham city.

21
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.920
But here's the funny thing about this is it's not this typical,

22
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.030
like I hate Gotham city.

23
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.660
It's one of these things where he's kind of like this city is not going to

24
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.310
improve more so than that. He goes,

25
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:10.730
as far as to say that he realized pretty early on that he was not going to

26
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:11.390
improve here.

27
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.780
So the first bit of indication we get in terms of the story of ghost maker is

28
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:16.910
that he seems to originate from Gotham city.

29
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.060
And then ultimately he ended up leaving the place that from his perspective,

30
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.840
the city smells of like urine and blood and violence and death.

31
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.730
It's just a really crappy place to be.

32
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.480
But the funny thing about this is that in, in his mind, he kind of says like,

33
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.190
this city should be burned to the ground,

34
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.160
but instead of taking this almost kind of like dark Knight rises approach where

35
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.980
it's like, I'm going to poison people's souls and that kind of stuff. Instead,

36
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:40.130
his idea is if I had all the billions of the world like Bruce Wayne does,

37
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.480
I would relocate all of you,

38
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.540
burn the city to the ground and then let you rebuild it into something better.

39
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.360
That's actually not a bad approach. It's violent,

40
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.210
but it's basically taking the city as it's so twisted and screwed up,

41
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.360
tearing it all down and then letting the people build it up into something

42
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:55.850
better. So it's not wholly like a villainous approach.

43
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.290
There's actually some good there.

44
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.870
And that's one of the things that struck me right off the bat in terms of the

45
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:01.910
nature of this guy. He's not a wholesale villain, right?

46
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:03.230
He's not a straight up bad guy.

47
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.080
And so what this guy basically says is this cop is kind of strung up and you

48
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.000
know, he's like, he's like, you know, what is it that you want, right. Like,

49
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.120
why are you saying all this? And the response of ghost maker is my ghost net,

50
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:11.301
right?

51
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.840
So basically his technology has made its way into the computer systems of Gotham

52
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.210
and he knows every single crime that's going on. And he's like,

53
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:18.860
I'm going to solve all of them for you.

54
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.170
But what you're going to do to me in return is you're going to give me a

55
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:22.190
location of clown Hunter.

56
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.320
You're going to tell me how to find this clown Hunter kit.

57
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.990
And it's kind of a crazy thing because this cop's like, we're not dirty, right?

58
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.660
I'm like, I'm not a dirty cop. I'm not just going to give you information,

59
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:32.990
right? You, you back guys don't work that way. And so he's like, I'm not Batman,

60
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.390
right? Like I'm the ghost maker. I'm better than Batman.

61
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.490
And I'm here to prove that I am right now. From there.

62
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.870
It switches over to what is effectively a new concept in DC comics? Well,

63
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:45.470
I guess new is a bit of a misnomer. We pick up with a group called the grinners.

64
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.240
The reason why I say this is kind of new,

65
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:51.800
but kind of not back in the 1940s backbone back when it was timely comics before

66
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.380
it became Atlas comics. And then eventually Marvel comics.

67
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.230
You had a line of comics that were called misery colleagues.

68
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.830
You had a line of comics called mystery comics,

69
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.360
which are exactly what they sounded like, right?

70
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.880
This was before Marvel became the superhero publishing house that,

71
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.720
that we know it to be now right before Spider-Man and the fantastic fork,

72
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.510
they publish mystery stories, right? Sometimes there were ghost stories.

73
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.710
Sometimes there were science fiction.

74
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.790
But the idea here is that back then what you had is in mystery comics,

75
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.200
number seven, you had to create her name.

76
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.740
Dr. Weems and Dr. Rims was a guy who was trying to find a kind of cure for

77
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:21.280
pneumonia.

78
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.130
And it was really more of model's attempt to kind of build on the Superman

79
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.880
mythos in so far as Superman was a champion of the people he fought against like

80
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.300
government censorship and against like crony politicians and bad,

81
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.020
bad business guys and stuff like that. Right? So the result of this is that in,

82
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:36.370
in mystery comics, number seven,

83
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.030
Dr. Weems was created by Al Gabriel as a guy who wanted to find a cure for

84
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.610
pneumonia, believed he'd found it experimented on himself.

85
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.790
And then basically ended up becoming a, what was called the grinner.

86
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.360
And this was a guy who had like this really sadistic grin on his face.

87
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.650
It's a pretty cool concept. Right?

88
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.950
But the idea here is that the grinners have actually been around in Gotham city

89
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.550
for a long, long time, right? During the days of like Harley Quinn.

90
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.960
The idea here though, is that the grinners are not your typical joker henchman.

91
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.180
Your typical joker henchmen are guys who were like,

92
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.610
criminals are down on their luck or they're in some weird situation.

93
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.460
And it's just easy money, right? I mean, it's a risk working for the joker.

94
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.030
These are basically guys who were like the most hardcore that whenever the joker

95
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.190
implements these great, big, huge grandiose schemes,

96
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.810
there's some of the first people to act,

97
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.560
but it's more of a desire to prove themselves to the joker than it is actually,

98
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.410
you know, being joker henchman per se. Now, for the most part,

99
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.620
the joker doesn't really seem to mind their actions because what they do falls

100
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.950
part and parcel with this plan. But these are the most diehard of the diehard,

101
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:31.690
right? These are the most extreme guys.

102
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.360
And whenever the joker isn't really doing anything whenever he doesn't really

103
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.150
have a major plan, they're basically lying low. And that's kind of,

104
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:40.030
what's been going on here is these guys are effectively lying low.

105
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:44.560
Now this information is given to Batman by virtue of Oracle, Barbara Gordon.

106
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.530
And one of the things tenon does is he says like right off the bat,

107
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:49.480
she's not going to stay in this role full time.

108
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.390
She's going to be bouncing back and forth between Oracle and Batgirl. Now,

109
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:54.850
for those of you guys who are not familiar with the Batman mythos,

110
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.160
if you are familiar with this bear with me for the next minute or two,

111
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.160
those are guys who are not familiar with this in the aftermath of the killing

112
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:04.000
joke with Barbara Gordon being shot and paralyzed and no longer being allowed to

113
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:05.470
operate. As, as Batgirl,

114
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.620
this all kind of tied into the events of like crisis on infinite earths rights.

115
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.160
They're kind of distilling the Batman mythos down to a more singular story that

116
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:14.650
focused on Batman himself. And so for her park,

117
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:18.130
Barbara Gordon was really sort of consolidated down and suddenly just became an

118
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:19.030
information broker.

119
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.670
Now this went from the eighties into the nineties and then eventually she

120
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:23.110
returned back to being back girl again,

121
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.650
but there are a lot of people who look at the character of Oracle and see her as

122
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:28.480
probably the best version of Barbara Gordon,

123
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.230
because she played a far more prominent role in DC comics than she did his bat

124
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:32.680
girl. Uh,

125
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.680
basically the information that's given to Batman is this is one of the safe

126
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:38.890
houses of the, uh, of the, the grinners and none for the most part,

127
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:40.770
nothing really seems to be going on here, right there,

128
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:42.040
there are some that are playing pool.

129
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.260
There's some that are shown at the bar that are playing cards,

130
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.630
just kind of staying low key until things pop off.

131
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.720
But the other thing about this is that this is about the clown Hunter kid.

132
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.260
You guys remember him from, uh, joker war. He was this kid that had enough,

133
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.440
the joker doing all the stuff that he was doing and looking at Batman and see

134
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:59.180
him as a guy who was only really ever a half measure, right? Like, well,

135
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.410
you know, we got to keep them alive.

136
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.580
And though we know they're going to kill people.

137
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.740
We can't kill the villains because we don't kill.

138
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.650
And so the results of that is a clown. Hunter stepped up and said, okay,

139
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.960
if Batman's not going to kill villains, then I will.

140
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.870
And so he basically went on this campaign and started killing all the clowns

141
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.310
with the joker everywhere he found them.

142
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.910
And so what Batman is looking to do here is cut this kid off and basically say,

143
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.510
okay, like,

144
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.540
I'm going to round these guys up and take them to jail before the kid can kill

145
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.610
them. Right. The problem is, as soon as he gets in there,

146
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.070
they're already dead and they weren't killed by count Hunter.

147
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.930
All these guys are already dead, right?

148
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.350
And the reason why Barbara Gordon saw them playing pool or playing cards is

149
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.620
because the video footage that she saw was on a constant loop.

150
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.490
This all just one great, big, huge trap. This specifically is more of a message.

151
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.730
And Batman sees a kind of face graffiti on the wall and then immediately tells

152
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.700
Barbara Gordon deactivate your computer systems, right? Shut it all down,

153
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.790
maintain radio silence. I'll let you know what's going on when this is all over.

154
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.860
Right. So Batman just immediately cuts her off, you know,

155
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:51.940
and that's when he tells her like this personal thing. And so from here,

156
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.300
we jumped back to, what's basically explained as many years ago,

157
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.900
what we ended up doing is picking up in Dublin and we have this guy named Tommy

158
00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.260
it's either Tommy to vain or Tommy Giovanni. Um, I would say Tommy Giovanni,

159
00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:05.920
if he was Italian, but the guy looks like he's Irish. Right? So Tommy to vain,

160
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.800
it really, you know, w whatever the case is, uh, I mean, the guys, you know,

161
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.020
Irish, cause you know, he's in Ireland. Uh, but, um, yeah, you know,

162
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:16.030
for those of you guys across the pond who are more familiar,

163
00:07:16.031 --> 00:07:18.580
like whether you're in Britain or whether you're actually in Ireland proper,

164
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.590
you guys can probably answer this question better than I could.

165
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.450
Is it actually Tommy Giovanni or Tommy to vain,

166
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.240
but you ended up having Bruce Wayne showing up here and literally throwing this

167
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.961
guy out the window.

168
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:28.750
Now it's not because of the fact that Bruce Wayne's got a bone to pick is

169
00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:30.970
because of Bruce. Wayne wants Tommy to train him, right? He's like,

170
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:33.190
I'm trying to get your attention. You wouldn't listen to me in the bar.

171
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.070
So now I have your full attention. You're going to teach me everything.

172
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:38.290
You know, you're the best knife wielder in the world.

173
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.750
You're the best at using knives and knowing how to throw them at people,

174
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.850
how to utilize them. So like, you're going to,

175
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:45.190
you're going to teach me and I'm going to show you that I'm a worthy pupil,

176
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.450
right? I'm going to beat the crap out of you.

177
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.670
And you're going to show me that you're there.

178
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.320
Then I'm gonna show you I'm worth a. And you're gonna teach me, right.

179
00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:53.740
The problem with this is that you end up having a guy who seemingly it comes out

180
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:56.500
of nowhere. Now, Bruce Wayne recognizes this kit. And of course,

181
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.680
given the circumstance, this is basically ghost or when he was younger. Right.

182
00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:02.080
I mean, given the nature of the comic, but like Batman, you know,

183
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.600
Bruce Wayne is kind of like, okay, like I recognize this kid,

184
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:06.490
which indicates that Bruce Wayne knew who he was.

185
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.310
They knew each other in Gotham city. And he basically says like,

186
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.590
I'm the new student, right? Like I'm the new student? Like,

187
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.840
like you Bruce Wayne, like you're just a rich kid. Right?

188
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.150
He was still crying over the fact that his mommy and daddy died. Like,

189
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.140
that's all you really are. See,

190
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:21.490
that's why I say in Batman begins the best description of Bruce Wayne. Right?

191
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:21.940
The best,

192
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.900
the best definition of Bruce Wayne came when he went to go meet a carbine

193
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.930
Falcone, I think it was who it was, who was played by Tom Wilkinson. And like,

194
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:31.000
he goes into the bar and he goes in there with a hand gun,

195
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:33.130
like he's going to shoot him. And they literally sit them down.

196
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:35.860
They take his gun away and Tom, Wilkinson's talking to him, you know?

197
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.530
And he's like, he's like, he's like, you're, you're Bruce Wayne. Right?

198
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:39.211
You're the, the,

199
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:41.860
the Prince of Gotham you'd have to go a thousand miles to find someone who

200
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.260
doesn't know your name. Right? Like you've never tasted desperate.

201
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.970
You've never known what it meant to struggle. Right?

202
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.330
You think because your mommy and daddy got shot that you really understand what

203
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:52.600
the darker nature of the world is. Like, like, you don't understand this world.

204
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.170
You're just like a rich kid who lost his mom and dad. You know,

205
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.300
the first thing about this criminal underworld.

206
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.820
But it's one of these things where like ghost maker really seems to kind of

207
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.740
reiterate this message. You're going on a crusade.

208
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.030
Do you want to come become some great, big,

209
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.830
huge superhero who can take on criminals?

210
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.500
Because you feel like you really understand the criminal element because a

211
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:09.090
criminal shot your mom and dad. No, no, no.

212
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.570
I'm a person who really understands the, the base level of the world. Now,

213
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.810
again, we don't really know much about ghost maker. We don't know if you,

214
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.670
somebody like Thomas Elliot, right.

215
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.570
Or if he's somebody who literally is just from like the worst part of Gotham and

216
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:23.340
somehow knew Bruce Wayne in their past,

217
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.510
but it's like lived in and just the struggle and strife that comes with being in

218
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:29.910
Gotham city, right? Just the lowest of the low, right.

219
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:33.720
Living down in the lower class, the lower class of society in the worst way.

220
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.660
But what you end up getting is basically these two guys who were essentially

221
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.330
fighting each other, right? Like, there's this guy, you know, ghost maker says,

222
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:40.890
look, if you want him to train you,

223
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.990
you're going to have to go through me because I'm already a student.

224
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.160
So let's get this on.

225
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.620
And when they get into an initial scuffle right off the bat,

226
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.930
Bruce Wayne is completely outclassed.

227
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.600
And that's kind of the crazy thing here is this like, he's literally like,

228
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:55.470
you're still too slow, right? You're still not fast enough to keep up with me.

229
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.130
That's what really seems to lend credence to the idea that ghost maker really is

230
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:02.750
just a better fighter than Bruce Wayne across the board. That's kind of the,

231
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:02.911
the,

232
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:05.520
the crazy thing here is what we ended up doing is switching back to the modern

233
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:06.960
day. But switching back to the present day,

234
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.330
you've got Harley Quinn meeting with the landlord, right? And she's like,

235
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.250
I'm going to rent this apartment. And he's like, no,

236
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.980
you're not a reasonable human being. Like, you're your Harley Quinn.

237
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.980
You bring nothing but problems. She's like, look, I'll pay you double rent,

238
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.260
right? Like I'll pay you twice. The rent that you normally make.

239
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.960
And then we'll be cool right now, of course, this guy being a landlord,

240
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.410
money talks, it's just the way, the way of the world.

241
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.050
And so the result of this is that he ends up giving her the room, right?

242
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:30.630
Letting her, letting her rent the room. And while all that's going on,

243
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:34.290
you have her being washed by clown Hunter who is essentially preparing to blow

244
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:36.270
the whole place up. Now, here's the funny thing about it.

245
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.020
The guy's watching videos about how to make his own homemade rocket launcher,

246
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.640
right? He's like, thanks Mr. Internet.

247
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.140
I sure am ready to create my own rocket launcher and fire it into a person's

248
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.740
home. That's, that's a little, that's a little extreme,

249
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.600
but he's literally learning from the internet.

250
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:55.440
The problem with this is that he's basically met by the arrival of ghost maker

251
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.620
and ghost maker is like, we're going to kill this kid right off the bat.

252
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.500
And that's kind of the crazy thing is that like, when this kid's talking to him,

253
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.540
he's like, you know, I'm not really sure that I like you, you know?

254
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.690
And he's like, well, you know, um, I'm sure that's a good thing, right?

255
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:09.600
Like you really shouldn't like me because in a minute I'm going to kill you.

256
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.400
But like, you know, here in Gotham city,

257
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.420
Batman is in the business of like taking criminals and putting them in jail and

258
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.120
hoping they stay there. And then like, you know, when they get out,

259
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:20.280
running them back up again, the Batman looks around and says,

260
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.770
it's not my job to keep them and keep them in jail.

261
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.990
That's the criminal justice system's job. And yes,

262
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:28.080
the criminal justice system is flawed, but like, it's their job to fix it.

263
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.770
Right. I'm just basically the dog catcher. It's not my place to change things.

264
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.830
It's just my place to enforce things. Right. But like at the end of the day,

265
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.640
it's kind of like this guy's lazy, but he's just a lazy superhero is all it is.

266
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.710
Right. I mean, if you have the ability to change things,

267
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.090
then it's your job to change things.

268
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.300
And the criminal justice system doesn't work well then as you're as a self

269
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:47.490
appointed superhero in Gotham, because remember,

270
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.150
it's not as though Gotham appointed Batman, Batman chose that. He's like,

271
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.710
I am going to protect Gotham city.

272
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.740
And then going to define how it is that I do it on my own base on this super

273
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.650
screwed up and flawed justice system is one of these things where you kind of

274
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.870
called into the whole nature of proofs right now, of course,

275
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.250
that leads to Batman jumping in,

276
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.340
but in immediately tacking ghost maker and just being like, okay,

277
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.070
like we had an agreement, this is my city.

278
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.740
And the response of ghost maker is then do your job.

279
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.980
And that's the crazy thing here because he's like this whole city is rotting

280
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:19.240
from the inside out it's rotting from the poor and the destitute who stay poor

281
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.190
and who stay living in destitution.

282
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.640
It's rotting from the wealthy who capitalize on them and keep them there.

283
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.350
It's rotting from like the criminals,

284
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.770
they keep escaping from jail and that you keep rounding up and putting it back

285
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.310
instead of,

286
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.040
instead of looking at them and saying they're in cordial human beings,

287
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.260
that the joker will always kill people.

288
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.720
And because of the nature of the joker and the nature of these criminals,

289
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.300
the justice system just can't hold them. Right.

290
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.400
The jails just can't hold these guys. And so,

291
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:45.460
because jails can't hold them and because they keep getting out and because they

292
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:48.820
keep killing people that in your desire to believe the justice system can hold

293
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:51.670
them. You're sacrificing innocent lives. You're getting people killed.

294
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.730
If you were any measure of a man who could do what needed to be done,

295
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.630
you would have killed them a long time ago. You know? And, and that's the,

296
00:12:57.631 --> 00:13:01.000
that's the crazy thing is this guy, ghost maker is not really a villain.

297
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:03.240
And I liked that philosophy, but I like, I'd like to,

298
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.130
I'd like a character that will look at Batman and say, you're,

299
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:09.490
you're sacrificing innocent people's lives because you believe that it's wrong

300
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.190
to kill. But if you believe it's wanting to kill, then what's worse here.

301
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.750
Who's worse in this situation,

302
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.290
the person who kills a hundred people or the person who could have stopped them.

303
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.290
And didn't which one of these two people is worse in this circumstance.

304
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:20.591
And that's,

305
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.770
what's so wild about that is a creature like these super philosophical

306
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:26.650
discussions, right? There's super philosophical debates over,

307
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:28.090
over who really is at fault here.

308
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.150
If Batman could kill the joker and he knows Joker's going to kill a whole bunch

309
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:34.120
of people, isn't Batman at fault here for not killing him.

310
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.940
Isn't that a legitimate case to make there. I think it is.

311
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.810
And so because of that,

312
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.200
these two guys start going at each other and initially Batman kind of takes this

313
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:44.740
idea of, okay, fine. Didn't like, let's fight this out. And initially it's like,

314
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.390
you know, we're doing this to save clown Hunter,

315
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.180
but the response of ghost maker is no, no, no, no. You and I,

316
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.730
we're not going to play this game. Like we're not going to fight each other.

317
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.710
You know, for the sake of like clown Hunter,

318
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.800
we're going to fight each other for Gotham city. If I defeat you,

319
00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.400
I'm going to kill you. And when I do, I'm going to take over Gotham city.

320
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.910
That's the craziest thing about this is like this guy's kind of legit.

321
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.910
And I agree with his philosophies. Like I liked the ghosts maker,

322
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.040
but with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

323
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.830
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys at the sub button

324
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:13.870
to become part of the Rob court. Do you guys enjoy this video?

325
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.360
Make sure you drop a light. Now we'll catch you all later.

326
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:52.763
