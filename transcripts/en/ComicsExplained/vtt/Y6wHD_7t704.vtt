4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.840
What's going on here?

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.440
<v 1>This is Robin. We are picking back up again with the swords of X event.</v>

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.300
And this sees the return of one of my favorite villains of all time and the

7
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.900
history of Marvel comics.

8
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.940
You guys know exactly who I'm talking about.

9
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.700
The downside of this is we see him once.

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.950
That's all we get. So what we initially have here is an Emissary, right?

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.010
An invitation to a contest of worlds, basically saying,

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.520
we invite you to see the,

13
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:42.830
the battle between the forces of a Rocco and the forces of Kakowa. Now,

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.540
a lot of the guys have kind of been wondering,

15
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.390
or at least kind of express a little bit of confusion in terms of what's going

16
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:51.050
on here to kind of sum this all down the nature of what's going on with XO

17
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.390
swords that are, I guess, 10 of swords, whatever you want to call it.

18
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.480
The whole reason why this is taking place is because apocalypse,

19
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.560
when he opened the gate,

20
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.610
the external gate that basically allows access between Coca-Cola and other

21
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:05.180
world. His goal was to use that gate to access a Rocco,

22
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.820
to rescue his wife and his children, the four horsemen,

23
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.270
and then bring them back to cacoa and basically unite his family,

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.560
what he ended up discovering.

25
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:16.850
And what we discovered is that what you also had going on were called the forces

26
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:20.030
of Amman and the forces of amaranth managed to breach their own realm.

27
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:22.550
And that eventually they were taken over by the four horsemen.

28
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.130
So the four horsemen lead the army of Ammon.

29
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.310
And so when apocalypse entered other world with the intention of reuniting his

30
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:31.790
family, that he discovered his family had basically become bad guys, right?

31
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:32.091
Like his,

32
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.390
his kids basically became villains and they were leading this army and they

33
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:38.990
intended to basically use the cocoa Wingate that granted access to other world

34
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.370
to pass through that gate,

35
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.850
into Coca-Cola and then conquer cacoa and the rest of the world. Right?

36
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.700
So it was, it's kind of like, you know, I want to get my kids back. Oh my God,

37
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.210
they're villains.

38
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.510
And the whole reason why this matters is because in order to settle the affair,

39
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.721
right,

40
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:54.650
in order to basically keep like all out war between the forces of Precoa and the

41
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:59.030
forces of a Rocco emerging on Saturday, and basically created this contest,

42
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.070
right? Created this, this whole great big, huge tournament.

43
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.820
And whoever wins will be the one who decides or who gets what it is that they

44
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:08.840
want. Right? So if the four horsemen, if apocalypse has kids win the tournament,

45
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.950
then they lead the army of [inaudible]. If the forces of Coca-Cola win,

46
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.710
then the army of amaranth, whatever happens to them, happens to them.

47
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.620
And that's why we are where we are right now should just a quick little

48
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.690
synopsis, kind of a quick explanation. I get this.

49
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:21.920
Some of the guys are a little confusing.

50
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.190
It's the nature of going through Jonathan Hickman's work kind of piece by piece

51
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.210
is that it's one of these things where he reads much better in trade. It's much,

52
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.720
much better to read Jonathan Hickman stories when it's all done and you go and

53
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:35.810
you get the trade paperbacks, right. It makes everything make a lot more sense.

54
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.621
But the, uh,

55
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:40.820
the Emissary has basically appeared here to mad Jim Jasper's in the crooked

56
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:42.230
market, right. And basically saying,

57
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.010
this is your invitation to show up here to this tournament to become a part of

58
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:47.870
it, right. To kind of watch everything unfold.

59
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.660
And that's the last time we see Jim Jasper's in this comic,

60
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.310
but here's the funny thing about this, right?

61
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:54.440
Here's the funny thing about what Hickman's going to end up doing here.

62
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.950
Jonathan Hickman, with, with Matt, Jim, Jasper's it could go one of two ways,

63
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.430
right? We could see Matt Jasper's pop off.

64
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.570
We could see him just lose his mind and this crazy display of power in the next

65
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.110
issue. We may not see him again for another five issues. Right.

66
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.290
It could be that we see him in the background during the whole tournament.

67
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.680
And then we don't actually see him do anything for another 50 issues.

68
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.900
There's no telling with Jonathan Hickman, right.

69
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.310
We have no idea Jonathan Hickman, right. For the long game. Right.

70
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:22.200
He writes for the conclusion of the story.

71
00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:24.570
So it's kind of the nature of the beast, right? It's the nature of the,

72
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.930
and so because of that, the next thing is that the, uh,

73
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.660
the Emissary visits that came of sub uh, civil life,

74
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.360
and then of course visits the inferior at the ever forge.

75
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.970
Now the inferior and really the fear of themselves,

76
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.490
the fact that there's more than one is kind of terrifying.

77
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.580
The fury are wildly powerful beings, right?

78
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:44.550
So to kind of give you guys a little bit of an explanation here,

79
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.460
when imagine Jasper's originally appeared in Marvel comics,

80
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.070
he was part of a universe called earth two 38.

81
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.250
And this was a universe where he basically killed all the superheroes,

82
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.980
but Jim Jaspers didn't do it on his own. Instead,

83
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:59.580
what he did is he used his powers to work reality, to create the fury.

84
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.930
And the fury was a being that had the ability to adapt to anybody's powers and

85
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:06.480
then overcome them. It's how the fury was well, a defeat,

86
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:08.400
Jim Jasper's from the main Marvel universe.

87
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:10.500
When the fury showed up inside the main Marvel universe,

88
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.070
or at least the first time that fury killed him,

89
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.950
that the two of them actually ended up coming back.

90
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.340
There's a story that we haven't covered called X-Men die by the sword.

91
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.320
I think where Jim Jasper's comes back. But,

92
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.730
but the whole idea here is that the fury realized that the only way the Jim

93
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.490
Jasper's powers work is if the universe to alter.

94
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.150
And so we took him to where the earth two 38 universe was out before it was

95
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:32.640
destroyed and then basically obliterated him, right?

96
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:36.000
Because he realized that in this giant empty space where there is no matter the

97
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.530
Jim Jasper's is powerless. Right?

98
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:42.060
So the fact that there's like an entire place here full of furious is kind of

99
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:43.530
nuts. Weapon forgers.

100
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:46.830
They create like these basically basically like these unbreakable weapons and

101
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:49.440
all of reality, like in the entirety of the multi-verse because rubber,

102
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.110
what we're dealing with here are multi multi-verse Haitians.

103
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.140
People from different universes can access these different places,

104
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.480
crooked market apocalypse from like, you know,

105
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.200
the age of apocalypse universe could access this and like characters somewhat

106
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:04.350
the days of future past universe assess this, uh, feasibly.

107
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.720
If they decided to include it, the Marvel cinematic universe,

108
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.470
Dr. Strange could travel to this place, right. It's kind of, kind of bunker.

109
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.230
So we're dealing with things on a much larger scale. These aren't planets,

110
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.030
these are whole universal territories, right?

111
00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:18.240
Little pocket dimensions also got the Holy Republic of the Fe.

112
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.090
You've got the floating kingdom of Roma, Roma, Regina.

113
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.670
This is basically Merlin and Roma.

114
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.510
They were previously the ones who ruled over other world before the events of

115
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:31.200
the incursions, the death of the, of the whole, uh, captain Britain court.

116
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.480
And the fact that they just kind of ended up going to war with each other,

117
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:37.140
but in their absence, it allowed Saturday to take over control of other world.

118
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.560
And that's why she is where she is. But nonetheless, you know, following these,

119
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:42.960
these kinds of emissaries or this Emissary that's sent out,

120
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.060
and these invitations that are given to these various people,

121
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.000
we pick up with what are called the foul and fair courts.

122
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.180
And this is basically a kind of coming together of these various courts.

123
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.730
Some of which we see here, some of which we don't, for example,

124
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:57.030
you don't see Jim Jasper's here. Who's considered part of the foul,

125
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.060
probably because he's just like, I have other things to do.

126
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:01.220
Besides show up here, you see the furious who were here.

127
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.310
They're considered part of the fair court Hickman doesn't really play it solid

128
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.940
in so far as saying the fear court are good guys, the foul court are bad guys.

129
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.400
We're not really given a, given a kind of knocked down X.

130
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.150
And that way we can kind of assume maybe it is,

131
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.510
but historically Merlin is a Dick. And the fact that he's of the,

132
00:06:16.511 --> 00:06:18.130
of the foul court kind of makes sense,

133
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.920
but Rome has been a little weird too sometimes. And so there's been a time,

134
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.610
a few times where she's been a little bit villainous and her actions.

135
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.000
And so again, it kind of seems to follow that ideology, but again,

136
00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:31.240
we're not given like an actual definitive instead,

137
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.200
the whole purpose behind the assembling of this court is basically the blights

138
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.950
of blight spokes to be allowed access across like any of the dimensions that

139
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:39.671
they want to. Now,

140
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:42.040
we're not really given a whole lot of information about the blight spoke.

141
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.490
And in fact, this is all we really seem to see of them, right?

142
00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:48.190
You got sheriff geo white chapel of the blight spoke, and that's really it. Uh,

143
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.070
their request is denied and that's, that's really all you get here,

144
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.900
but it's a little bit of a kind of a court thing,

145
00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:56.500
but the reason why Hickman does this is because this will be important later on

146
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.390
down the line, right. As a reason why he gives us this.

147
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.910
And so for the most part, we can kind of take this a little bit of a scene.

148
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.180
We can sit it on the back burner and then come back to it at a future point in

149
00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:05.140
time. Uh, but the,

150
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:08.260
the important thing to kind of come out of this is that at the ethic inclusion

151
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.610
meeting, essentially,

152
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.570
you end up having Saturday and who asks the current horseman who were there, uh,

153
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:15.070
you know, like pestilence and war,

154
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.970
all you are Rocco forces currently prepared to engage in this conflict and the

155
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.980
answer's. Yes. And then of course she asked him, he brought it,

156
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.560
what about your forces? Like Precoa and he's like, they're on their way. Right?

157
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:26.170
So basically this is a coming together of the warriors, right.

158
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:28.090
They're all basically arriving in other world.

159
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.970
And then the tournament will commence after that. Right. And so when,

160
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:34.600
what we end up doing here is transitioning to cacoa and apocalypse talking to

161
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:38.470
all the, the sword bears. Right. And he gives like the worst speech ever.

162
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:41.380
He's like, okay, guys, don't die. Because if you do,

163
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.960
then you're going to come back and some weird twisted version. All right,

164
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.730
let's go. And that's basically it. And instead, you know, the,

165
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:48.220
the statements kind of like, I mean,

166
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:52.060
you should kind of give us a little bit of like a pep talk, right? I mean,

167
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:55.120
you know, it's like, like literally like, well, like, I mean, can you like,

168
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.330
it couldn't hurt, right? If you give us some kind of a pep talk and so he does,

169
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:00.970
and it's actually this Epic, I have talked, right? He says like sword bears,

170
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.290
most of you are mutant.

171
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.130
You have tasted the sweetness of immortality and evolution of our people,

172
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.440
meaning the fact that they can die and always come back.

173
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.160
Now we step into the other world. We're all, realities are one.

174
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.270
And your defeat will mean the death of Coca-Cola the death of this earth and the

175
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:21.250
death of you as you are now never to return. So when you draw your sword,

176
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.020
you must not fight like a human who stands to lose a few years of toil,

177
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.550
but like a mutant who stands to lose forever and paradise for,

178
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:34.990
if you do not, you will not be the first immortals I will have watched die.

179
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.190
It's a crazy, it's a really, really cool thing. It's a pretty Epic speech.

180
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.350
Right. It's a pretty awesome speech there. Yeah.

181
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.920
So what we ended up doing is picking up with these various forces of glaucoma

182
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.230
and a Rocco all showing up here. Right.

183
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.170
And initially it starts with captain Britain showing up here along love rain

184
00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:53.830
cable. So on, they all basically teleport in at the same time, but when they do,

185
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:56.400
it's kind of like, okay, like immediately on their guard. Right.

186
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:59.400
Because they don't know if they're teleporting in here and the battle

187
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:00.450
immediately starts.

188
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.640
They don't know if they're teleporting in here and there's going to be a lot of

189
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.760
pomp and circumstance. Right. A great, big, huge kind of procession or,

190
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.380
you know.

191
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.340
<v 2>Welcome to the 10 of X event, you know, and so on and so forth.</v>

192
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.380
<v 1>You know, like you got Michael buffer there, you know.</v>

193
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:17.240
<v 2>In this side of the ring, standing at five 42, weighing some ridiculous number.</v>

194
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.640
<v 1>Because his bones are covered in an unbreakable.</v>

195
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.990
<v 2>Metal Wolverine.</v>

196
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.110
<v 1>I don't really know if that's, that's, that's what we're going to get. Right.</v>

197
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.850
I think it'd be awesome if like Michael buffer showed up here and offered a kind

198
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:31.400
of speech, but I think it'd be pretty cool, but Saturday,

199
00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:34.610
and finally makes her appearance and basically tells everybody you guys need to

200
00:09:34.611 --> 00:09:37.640
chill. Right. You know, like, like relax, the tournament's not starting yet.

201
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.810
It will start soon.

202
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.080
Your fellow combatants are going to be arriving here and it'll be a chance for

203
00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:45.590
you guys to meet. So head to your quarters, they've all been prepared for you.

204
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.680
And when they arrive there, they're all given their respective cards.

205
00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:52.100
Do you remember these were cards that were created by Saturn EAN explicitly for

206
00:09:52.101 --> 00:09:52.520
them,

207
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.150
but the cards do not necessarily mean what they appear to be on their faces.

208
00:09:56.151 --> 00:09:58.130
For example, you end up having cable.

209
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.370
Who's given the card of the fool and it doesn't mean that cable is an actual

210
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:03.600
full, even though we think that's what it means. Instead.

211
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.980
It's the journey of the fool, which is to say he doesn't know everything yet,

212
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.440
but he will learn a lot as time goes on.

213
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.210
This really kind of seems to be around it.

214
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:14.750
That way of John and Hickman saying the powers of cable are going to expand or

215
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.170
cable's own individual story is going to become a lot more grandiose than it

216
00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:21.620
currently is. But then of course, you end up having apocalypse who reads his,

217
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.090
gets angry and throws it away.

218
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.620
And so what he ends up doing is traveling to meet Saturday.

219
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.180
And this common conversation between these two is wildly intriguing.

220
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.040
And that's what makes Hickman's X's swords.

221
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.680
So cool is because you see characters meeting whom you would never see meet

222
00:10:36.681 --> 00:10:40.520
under any other circumstance and watching how they interact is really

223
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:41.600
intriguing. For example,

224
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.990
like Saturday Dean was never really the most powerful character ever.

225
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.380
It wasn't until she took over other world and then started using all the magic's

226
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:52.580
at its disposal to, to, to utilize, you know, to, to really rule this place.

227
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.770
This should became as powerful as she is prior to this,

228
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.280
she was basically a figurehead, but she was the Omni Versal magistrate.

229
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.700
She was not on par with like the living tribunal or somebody like that.

230
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:05.270
She just kind of played more of a gubernatorial role in relation to like how the

231
00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:06.530
multi-verse functions. You know,

232
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.450
if you kind of broke it down into different positions,

233
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.690
she played more of a governing body, uh, with regards to the living tribunal,

234
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.430
he played like the power source. Now,

235
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.500
neither one really associated with the other.

236
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.290
It's not like you would see meetings of the Omni vessel development court and

237
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:21.350
like the living tribunals out there in the third row, watching it all go down,

238
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.330
you would never really see that instead. It was just,

239
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:25.010
it was kind of doing its own thing.

240
00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:28.490
It was part of this wildly intricate hierarchy of how the multi-verse,

241
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.550
how its form and function is maintained. The funny thing about that though,

242
00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:35.600
is the Omni development court was sometimes acknowledged and sometimes ignored

243
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:38.420
by Marvel comics, depending on who the writer was. You know, for example,

244
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.770
you never really, you hadn't seen it for like,

245
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.590
I want to say it didn't appear for like a decade until you got to the

246
00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:43.610
incursions, right? I mean,

247
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:46.610
you had Spiderman UK and you had a few appearances here and there,

248
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.790
but like in those five years that Marvel was leading up to the secret Wars.

249
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.490
You saw it multitude of multitude of times prior to that,

250
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.190
you'd never saw it at all. Right.

251
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.860
And you probably wouldn't have known it existed unless you were reading the

252
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:57.820
right kind of comics.

253
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.550
And even then it didn't really appear all that often in Excalibur.

254
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:02.110
So it's one of these interesting things.

255
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.590
That's kind of the nature of the nature of how it all works.

256
00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:07.590
Models never really consolidated it. They never really kind of explained, like,

257
00:12:07.591 --> 00:12:10.680
what's the nature of the Omni Rosso development court in comparison to the

258
00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:14.310
living tribunal does like the one above all, is he part of this? Like, was he,

259
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.810
was he the one that kind of engineered that?

260
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.270
How does it compare to like the fulcrum and the Neil diamond comics for the

261
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.490
Eternals? We don't really know. Right.

262
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:22.650
We're not really given an explanation here. Well,

263
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.810
the apocalypse showing up here and basically meeting her,

264
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.620
the question is I don't really like what, what I'm seeing here. Right? Like,

265
00:12:28.621 --> 00:12:30.990
I don't really like what's going on. I don't really like this game.

266
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:32.310
You're playing answer me. Right?

267
00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:35.010
Like what's the meaning of these taunts of all this nonsense,

268
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.830
but notice Saturnian, doesn't really take him seriously. Now,

269
00:12:37.831 --> 00:12:40.110
one of the big things about our character about Saturn Dean's character

270
00:12:40.111 --> 00:12:43.050
historically is she always had a kind of arrogance, right.

271
00:12:43.051 --> 00:12:46.200
There was always a kind of arrogance about her in the sense of I'm above you.

272
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.430
I'm way above, I'm way, much higher above you than anybody else's rightly,

273
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:53.100
you know, it's just the nature of things, you know, in terms of power,

274
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.890
probably not. Or at least, you know, before she became ruler of other worlds,

275
00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:57.600
she's nowhere near above apocalypse,

276
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.640
but even apocalypse plays it a little Hottie. Right.

277
00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:02.670
He's like answering me before, you know, explain yourself before I become angry.

278
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.150
He's literally in the, in the he's in the lion's den, right?

279
00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:09.150
He's in the belly of the beast. What is he going to do? Like there's no power.

280
00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:11.420
He possesses that could overcome Saturday.

281
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.120
He could just start like smashing the 20 lights Citadel, right? Just like,

282
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.510
you know, smashing his fist and knocking off giant chunks of it.

283
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.660
And just more or less like inconveniencing her. But that would be about it.

284
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.050
That'd be about all that he could do in this situation.

285
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.050
But one of the things that she says is she's like, I'm kind of intrigued by you.

286
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.130
You really are the oldest beans in existence, right? In, in, on your earth,

287
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.220
not across your entire universe, right. Relative to the history of the universe.

288
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.450
You're but a spec while you've been,

289
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:38.310
you've been alive for a fraction of a second.

290
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.050
But in terms of the history of your earth,

291
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.240
you've been around for a relatively lengthy amount of time. I mean,

292
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.620
even within the history of the earth, right,

293
00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:45.120
it's still kind of a fraction of a second,

294
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:48.060
but in comparison to the evolution of your race of mutant kind,

295
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.620
you've been around for a long, long time.

296
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.390
And even in comparison to the length of humanity,

297
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.000
you've been around for a pretty lengthy amount of time, but I'm interested.

298
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:57.000
I'm kind of curious about you had all this power that you possess,

299
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.900
you beat Morgan Lafaye right. In like a straight up battle. That's interesting.

300
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.110
But what you've done here is you bullied yourself in,

301
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.140
you basically played the role of somebody who's lesser than yourself.

302
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.730
And then when it was, once it was all said and done,

303
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.760
the only reason you even got here is because I invited you.

304
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.930
So ask yourself the question.

305
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.260
Is it kind of an insult to know that no matter what your best efforts were,

306
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.510
you only got in here because I allowed it,

307
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.210
but even kind of continuing this taunting. And even when he says like,

308
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.550
are you trying to provoke me at the end of the day,

309
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.030
she still just kind of plays it fast and loose and she still doesn't really take

310
00:14:27.031 --> 00:14:30.240
him, take him seriously more so than that. She's like, you're a very,

311
00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:34.350
very old being. I'm surprised that you're acting so impatient here.

312
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.180
You really shouldn't be acting this impatient.

313
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.200
Like you've been around long enough.

314
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.690
You should have more patients than almost anybody else here.

315
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.170
You're playing a game that you've been working on from a Linea and here at the

316
00:14:43.171 --> 00:14:45.750
finish line, you're going to suddenly grow impatient. Well,

317
00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:48.870
the funny thing about this is that it reveals the very human side of apocalypse

318
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:51.920
in the sense of, of course he does, like, he's about done,

319
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.340
like which one of us doesn't find our second wind when we're that close to the

320
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:57.440
finish line, right? That's kind of where he is, you know,

321
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.750
this kind of new method, this new step of,

322
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:01.880
of zealousness this going on with this character.

323
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.460
And so with Saturday and who was already on her way to a meeting,

324
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.990
she invites apocalypse along.

325
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.110
And this is one of those things where it seems to be kind of designed to more or

326
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:12.140
less play games. But when he enters into this meeting room,

327
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.360
he's met by an individual who is wearing,

328
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:18.860
what's basically the helmet of EMyth, the helmet, the helmet of this,

329
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:21.740
of this demon entity. And as we explained in the last video,

330
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.610
those individuals who wear it become the voice of Amazon itself.

331
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.700
I really say itself because we don't really know if this demon is like a man or

332
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:30.890
a woman or anything about them whatsoever,

333
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.340
but they basically become the person or kind of stand in as the person who's

334
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:35.780
leading this whole force. Right?

335
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.170
And so this person that she's meeting with is effectively the person who's

336
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:42.710
leading, the four horsemen who in turn are leading the army of Amman, right?

337
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:45.890
So this person is basically apocalypse enemy because we,

338
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.230
we know do by virtue of the various swords.

339
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.620
And who's going to be fighting who that apocalypse is destined to fight this

340
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:54.590
person. And when this person goes and removes their mask,

341
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.850
we one see the card of apocalypse that says the lovers and then to it's

342
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.260
apocalypse, his wife it's Genesis. This means that during the tournament,

343
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.940
apocalypse is going to have to fight and he's going to have to kill his wife.

344
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.470
This is a bold move by Saturday, because if it does arrive, say for example,

345
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.570
the Genesis is a turncoat. Say, for example,

346
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:16.100
that she's operating under this role,

347
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.130
but isn't actually allied with Ammon or her children,

348
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:22.610
the four horsemen and is actually working directly alongside apocalypse.

349
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.100
Because remember they had that conversation before she went to the portal,

350
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.840
prepare the world for what's coming.

351
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.750
If she really has maintained her solitude all the time.

352
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.340
And she really is a good guy all this time, then things could pop off fast.

353
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.260
It could pop off so quickly and go South. So astronomically fast, right?

354
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.900
There's there's no telling what's going to happen here, but I know it.

355
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.790
I know it doesn't seem overly surprised.

356
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:46.310
Like I know it doesn't seem like this great, big, huge, crazy grandiose event,

357
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:49.970
but this right here could easily turn into the turn of the tide and everything.

358
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:53.210
Saturday is built, can come crashing down. But with that being said, guys,

359
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.320
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

360
