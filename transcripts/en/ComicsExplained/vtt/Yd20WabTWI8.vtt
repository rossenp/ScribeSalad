4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.310
What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.970
<v 1>Is Robin. And we are once again,</v>

6
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:18.320
setting our sights on taking out the mightiest beings in the universe as our

7
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:22.340
series on how to kill superheroes focuses on one of the strongest characters and

8
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.360
DC comics, John Jones, better known as Martian Manhunter.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.240
So how to kill Martian? Manhunter set him on fire.

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.860
They should watching guys hearse.

11
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.620
<v 0>Now, before.</v>

12
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.930
<v 1>We figure out how to kill the Martian, Manhunter,</v>

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.200
we're going to go over his origin and then take a look at his powers to see why

14
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:42.590
it's actually a lot harder to kill him than you believe it is.

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.610
So Marsha Manhunter was first created and appeared in detective comics.

16
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.280
Number 225 and 1955. Now,

17
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.120
as you probably guessed the Martian Manhunter hails from the planet of Pluto,

18
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.630
no, it's not actually a planet, a Martian Manhunter Hilson, the planet Mars,

19
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.840
where he served as one of the planet's law enforcement agents,

20
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.690
commonly known as man hunters. Now one day,

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.730
John is transported to earth by a beam built by scientists named Saul Earl who

22
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:12.050
dies a shock immediately upon seeing him. This was unfortunate for John as Dr.

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.480
Earl was the only one capable of operating the beam.

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.330
And so John was stuck on earth. Now on the plus side,

25
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.010
John's capable of shape-shifting.

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.950
And so he disguises himself as a human and adopts a human name,

27
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.370
which by a stroke of incredible luck happened to be the exact rhyme of his

28
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.390
martial name. So John begins a career as a detective and a superhero,

29
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.660
and would go on to be a founding member of the justice league of America.

30
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.170
Now his origin was rebooted when DC launched the new 52,

31
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.070
so that Jon Jones actually came to earth voluntarily to learn how to be alone,

32
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.490
which went against his Marsha nature. As the Martians, as a species,

33
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.990
we're all telepathically linked.

34
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.290
And so John needed to learn this skill so that he could lead the Martians.

35
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.640
But when he returned to his home planet,

36
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.580
he founded a desolate wasteland with no signs of life,

37
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.930
which led him to dedicate his life to exact revenge for his fallen people. Now,

38
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:58.100
as far as his powers go,

39
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.970
Martian Manhunter is one of the strongest characters in the DC universe.

40
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.360
And according to the JLA by grant Morrison is actually stronger than Superman.

41
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.000
His punches were able to harm super boy Pronto.

42
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.090
One of the most powerful versions of Superman to ever exist.

43
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.300
Subaru prime was also able to alter reality with his punches.

44
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:18.650
So the fact that Martian Manhunter was able to affect him is pretty freaking

45
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:19.220
impressive.

46
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.660
Now he's also able to fly at speeds that allow him to keep up with Superman and

47
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.360
the flash. He also possesses insane durability.

48
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.150
Having taken punches from some of DC's heaviest hitters,

49
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.080
as well as a regenerative healing factor that allows him to quickly recover from

50
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:34.430
whatever damage he sustains.

51
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.910
And so it's probably out of the question for us to overpower Martian Manhunter

52
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.870
or try to kill him,

53
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.080
do a purely physical means since he can take an insane amount of damage,

54
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.420
almost certainly more than we'll be able to dish out. Now,

55
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:46.820
in addition to a superhuman physical characteristics,

56
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.660
Martian Manhunter can also shapeshift in whatever form you can imagine and can

57
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:54.230
alter the density of his body to be either super dense or intangible.

58
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.220
He's also among the strongest telepath in the DC universe with the ability to

59
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:01.330
read the mind of every single person on earth. At the same time,

60
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.900
he's also able to shoot powerful energy beams with a minced destructive power

61
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.150
from his eyes. And so bearing all this in mind,

62
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.260
we can see just how difficult killing the Martian Manhunter is because he's an

63
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.940
incredibly powerful character, but it's our job. So how do we do it? Well,

64
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.470
let's first address the answer.

65
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.920
That's probably obvious to anyone familiar with Martian Manhunter his

66
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:22.870
well-publicized weakness to fire.

67
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.310
This has been a staple of the character in some form or fashion for most of his

68
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:27.940
existence.

69
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.630
Now this is time has been depicted as vulnerability or weakness to fire,

70
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.240
and sometimes simply as a fear of fire.

71
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.480
And sometimes he's only vulnerable to fire. That's magical in nature.

72
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.280
His relationship with fire really just varies depending on who's riding him at

73
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:42.790
the time.

74
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.030
And I think currently he's suddenly just afraid of fire because the entire

75
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.360
Martian race was destroyed by it. He hasn't actually vulnerable to it,

76
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.100
but I'm sure when you clicked on this video,

77
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.820
the first thing that crossed your mind was just kill him with fire doc.

78
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.090
And I don't blame you guys for thinking that because it's the obvious answer.

79
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.300
And it would definitely work because we saw Marsha man Hunter kill with fire.

80
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.820
The first issue of final crisis in 2008, he was literally just set on fire.

81
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.670
And it was kind of funny, not overly funny, but kind of funny.

82
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.160
What was really funny with during tower Babel were like,

83
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.560
they go to the forest to try to find him Martian. Manhunter like,

84
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:14.880
there's a great, big, huge forest fire.

85
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.160
And he's just like running around screaming, being on fire.

86
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.280
It was a little comedic. It wasn't supposed to be, but it was,

87
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.850
I mean, I don't mean to say that.

88
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:26.910
I think it's funny a person being on fire and running around screaming.

89
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.430
That's not funny, but Martian Manhunter. It was funny.

90
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.760
He was also killed by Superman's heat vision in the injustice comics,

91
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.080
which aren't really in continuity.

92
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.200
The characters in that series seem to be pretty much equivalent to their main

93
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:40.530
universe counterparts, albeit their powers and strengths fluctuate a little bit.

94
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.530
And so this would also be a possible way to kill Martian Manhunter if we chose

95
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:44.370
to, and again,

96
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:47.700
referencing the tower of Babel that mans planned for Martian Manhunter was to

97
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.710
use fire. So if that's that man's plan,

98
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.960
we know it's going to be pretty much full-proof, but for this video,

99
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.990
I want to go beyond the obvious and be a little less cliche.

100
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.010
So is there anything other than fire that we can use to our advantage? Well,

101
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.150
it's commonly stated the fire is the only weakness Martian Manhunter has and

102
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:07.470
that he's in vulnerable otherwise, but is that true? Well, the answer is no,

103
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.100
there is one other substance to which Martian Manhunter has an acute weakness.

104
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.680
And although it's not as well-known as his weakness to fire,

105
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.330
it's still produced devastating effects and that substance is tacos. Now,

106
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.280
if you're not familiar with chocos,

107
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:24.810
they are a chocolate sandwich cookie that exists in the DC universe that are

108
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:25.950
very similar too,

109
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.300
but legally distinct from Oreos and Martian Manhunter is addicted to them.

110
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.300
Literally they have an addictive effect on Martians. In fact,

111
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.440
he loved them so much that booster gold and blue beetle played a prank on him by

112
00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:40.650
buying up all the chocos from all the stores in the area,

113
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.850
and then just not giving them to them.

114
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.380
But this praise backfires in a major way as Martian Manhunter completely flips

115
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:49.890
out his shape-shifting goes out of control and he starts destroying the city.

116
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.460
And the longer he went without chocos the less than Tilden he became until he

117
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:57.210
was eventually just a mindless being destroying everything in his path.

118
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.410
Eventually he got some tacos and purse his body of the addiction,

119
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.730
but it then became a Cynthia and being that he had to destroy it,

120
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.950
it's kind of crazy. But anyway,

121
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.830
how can we use this to kill Martian Manhunter well, I don't know.

122
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.280
Maybe we can just sit a mountain of tacos in front of him and he'll eat so many

123
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:12.230
that his pancreas just shuts down. I mean,

124
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.220
do Martians have pancreases or maybe we just leave a trail of chocos that leads

125
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:19.460
him into a fire pit and yeah, that's technically using fire to kill him.

126
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.930
So in a way you probably didn't expect that when you clicked on this video and

127
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.200
that's what I'm going for here to come up with a fun and entertaining way to

128
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:31.310
kill your favorite superhero. That's the only thing I can really think of.

129
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.611
Right?

130
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.580
Like just have a trail of chocos that he's just like eating and then following

131
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.780
them. And he's like, Oh, he just burns alive and he dies. I'll be honest.

132
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.950
I would read that story. I think it'd be amazing, right? Like, like it's just,

133
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.010
it's just like a one-off right. DC showcase presents, tricking,

134
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.190
Martian Manhunter into like burning himself alive. It'd be amazing.

135
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.580
Would that being said, guys, we're going to bring this video to an end.

136
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.140
If you have a better way to kill Martian,

137
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.860
Manhunter posted down in the comment section. I would love to hear it and yeah,

138
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.083
I will.

139
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.260
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
