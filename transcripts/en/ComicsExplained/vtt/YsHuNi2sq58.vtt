4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.660
What's going on.

5
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.020
<v 1>Guys. This is Rob and we are back again with another installment of our,</v>

6
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:17.930
how to kill superhero series, where as the name implies,

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.470
we figure out how to bring about the demise of our favorite superheroes or

8
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:22.160
supervillains.

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.790
And the character that we're discussing today has been both a hero and a villain

10
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.940
at various times, but whichever side of the spectrum he falls on,

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.930
he is without a doubt,

12
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.590
one of the strongest characters in DC comics and a character that has been

13
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:37.580
brought back to the forefront recently with the events of dark nights, metal,

14
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.160
we're forced talking about Superboy Prague,

15
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.400
but before we figure out how to kill what is certainly one of the most powerful

16
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:46.730
versions of Superman, we'll go over his origin and his powers.

17
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.450
So the character that would become super boy prime was created by Elliot S Magen

18
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.370
and Curt Swan. And first appeared in DC comics presents number 87 in 1985,

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.270
although he would not adopt the moniker of Superboy prime until much later in

20
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.550
2006 is infinite crisis. Number two.

21
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.100
So the character is actually the Superman of earth prod,

22
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.550
which is basically DC universe's version of the earth that we live in.

23
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.790
Meaning that just like on our earth superheroes are not real.

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.790
They're simply just characters in comic books, movies, and television shows.

25
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.840
But on that earth,

26
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.110
we get a version of Khalil coming to earth from the planet Krypton.

27
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.210
And he's adopted by the Kens as a child.

28
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.500
And given the name Clark now Clark grows up normally until the age of 15,

29
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.600
when Halley's comet passes over the earth,

30
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.940
which activates Clark's latent Kryptonian powers,

31
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.390
which are all basically the same powers as Superman has superhuman strength,

32
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.990
superhuman speed in vulnerability flight x-ray vision. You guys get the deal.

33
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.470
No one earth prime is destroyed by the auntie monitor during the crisis on

34
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:40.310
infinite source event,

35
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.880
Superboy battles alongside heroes from other earth to defeat him.

36
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.710
And once the auntie monitor is vanquished,

37
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.590
Superboy goes to a paradise dimension along with earth,

38
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:52.130
two versions of Superman and Lois lane, as well as Alexander Luther,

39
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.280
the son of Lex Luther from earth three. Now, while in this dimension,

40
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.350
Superboy prime never actually ages,

41
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.950
but becomes embittered by the fact that he was robbed of his childhood and would

42
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.620
never grow up to fulfill his destiny of becoming Superman.

43
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.530
He also comes to hate the new earth version of super boy,

44
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.650
Connor Kent for filling the role that he felt was rightfully his.

45
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.260
And so during his many years in this pocket dimension,

46
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.610
just getting matter in matter,

47
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.820
Alexander Luther decides that they've all had enough and they're going to make

48
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:18.320
their way to the DC universe.

49
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.980
And so Superboy prime starts punching the barrier between the two realities,

50
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.110
which not only causes the barrier to break down,

51
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.190
but also sends ripple effects throughout reality, altering it in several ways,

52
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.740
such as bringing dead characters back to life. Furthermore,

53
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:34.040
he proves himself to be powerful enough to alter the orbits of planets,

54
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.680
as well as change the location of the center of the universe.

55
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.060
Not only was Superboy prime,

56
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:41.510
able to best Martian Manhunter a character on par with Superman in terms of

57
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.750
power, but was also able to punch his way out of the Phantom zone,

58
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.200
which up to that point was thought to be impossible. And which once again,

59
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.930
set reality altering ripple effects throughout the universe.

60
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.060
He's also said to be faster than Wally West,

61
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:56.180
who's considered to be the fastest of all the speedsters at the time and was

62
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:58.070
able to free himself from the speed force,

63
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.760
despite being exposed constant red sun radiation,

64
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.490
which dampen his powers during his time in the speed force.

65
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.150
His powers are augmented even further. As he created a conduit for himself,

66
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.780
the captured and store the energy of yellow suns from which his powers are

67
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.100
derived. Following this,

68
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.030
he was able to easily defeat the combined forces of the justice society,

69
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.820
the team Titans, the justice league and the doom patrol.

70
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.330
And so it should be clear by now that super-wide prime is not only one of the

71
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.670
strongest versions of Superman that's ever existed,

72
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.450
but it's also one of the most powerful characters in all of comics.

73
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.390
And so with that in mind, the question becomes, how do we kill them? Well,

74
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.470
first we need to address two major ways that will not be successful because

75
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.390
super boy prime is a version of Superman.

76
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.020
It might seem obvious to use Superman's traditional weakness against him.

77
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.230
The most widely known weakness of Superman is of course, kryptonite,

78
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.320
you could ask anyone that has never even picked up a comic book,

79
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.500
and they could likely tell you that kryptonite is Superman's weakness.

80
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.250
It's that ingrained in pop culture that while kryptonite does have devastating

81
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:57.880
effects on Superman, Superboy prime does not share that weakness.

82
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.100
The reason for this is that in his universe,

83
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.930
there were no fragments of his home planet,

84
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.300
Krypton that survived the destruction of the planet.

85
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.050
And the fragments of Krypton from other universes are not fumble to him.

86
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.080
And so kryptonite is not going to help us in any way.

87
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.300
Another weakness of Superman's is magic.

88
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.900
There have been countless times throughout history that this has been exploited

89
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.930
and it's well-established to be a part of his character. But once again,

90
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.800
this information is useless in our attempt to take out super boy prime because

91
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.780
he does not share this weakness either.

92
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.080
We have to remember that super boy prime comes from earth prime,

93
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.380
which is the analog to our world. So just like in our world,

94
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.940
magic does not exist there.

95
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.030
And so boy prime is not going to be vulnerable against it.

96
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.830
And so that's off the table as well. Now,

97
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:42.850
simply overwhelming Superboy prime is also not likely to give us the result that

98
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:46.240
we want when one of the guardians of the universe tries to destroy himself by

99
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:50.200
self-destructing Superboy prime simply absorbed the resulting energy,

100
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.790
and it only made it more powerful,

101
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.330
at least powerful enough to destroy an entire universe and kidnap Mr. Mixel.

102
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.390
Pedalec one of the strongest reality wipers in DC comics.

103
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.900
And so we can't just produce a powerful enough attack to take him out either.

104
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.050
And so we're going to have to figure out some weakness to exploit. Now,

105
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:06.370
if you were paying attention earlier,

106
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.250
I mentioned that when Superboy prime was stuck in the speed force,

107
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.210
he was constantly being exposed to red sun radiation, which dampened Ms. Powers.

108
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.720
However,

109
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.100
this did not seem to be overly effective since he was able to not only survive,

110
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.180
but build a suit that harnessed yellow sun energy and escape, the speed force,

111
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.830
which also would have been impossible.

112
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.470
But I think that clues us in to our answer here.

113
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.760
And that is for that as powerful as Superboy prime is he still relies on yellow

114
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:32.080
sun energy to survive.

115
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.560
And so we're going to need to find a way to cut them off from the supply of

116
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:38.110
stored yellow sun energy that is supervised.

117
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.740
And we're also going to have to block his access to any additional sunlight.

118
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.210
If we can do those two things,

119
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.080
he should theoretically be no harder to kill than the average person since

120
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:51.340
Kryptonians do not have super powers on Krypton due to the absence of a yellow

121
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:53.650
sun nearby. And so I think that's our best bet.

122
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.590
We're going to have to disrupt his connection with his power suit and also find

123
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:01.010
a way to block the sun's radiation from reaching the battlefield in order to be

124
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.690
successful. But let me know what you guys think,

125
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.540
but if you could think of a better way to take out Superboy prime,

126
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.980
let me know down in the comment section.

127
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.050
If you guys are new here to come as explain,

128
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.300
