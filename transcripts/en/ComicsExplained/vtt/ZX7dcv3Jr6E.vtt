00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.721
<v 1>What's going on guys.</v>

5
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:15.020
This is Robin and we are back with the juggernaut and in this video is the

6
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:19.010
juggernaut versus the immortal hook. And this is cool, right? This is a really,

7
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:20.390
really cool story, but here's what we're going to do.

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.800
We are going to take this a bit out of order in terms of how the comic was

9
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.930
originally done and kind of restructured things a little bit,

10
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.360
just because there's a bit of back and forth here,

11
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.020
and it's not so much that it can get confusing more so that it could be a little

12
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:33.560
bit annoying.

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.650
What we're going to do here is we're going to kind of pick up with a point where

14
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:39.020
we kind of jumped back to the past, uh, following Kane,

15
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.950
Marco's escape from limbo. And as he's in this hospital, essentially recovering,

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.440
he's met by a telepathic projection of Charles Xavier.

17
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.190
And the idea is that as came, Marco is talking to Charles Xavier, verbally,

18
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.080
Charles Xavier is talking to him telepathically.

19
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.410
So the nurse basically thinks that came up, was talking to him, right. You know,

20
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:55.910
it's one of these funny things where it,

21
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.650
where like the nurse walks in and he's like, you know,

22
00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:59.960
I appreciate you looking on me, Charles. And he's like my name's Billy,

23
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.831
you know? And he's like,

24
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:02.840
you won't feel too appreciative after you've had our meatloaf,

25
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.790
but the whole idea behind this is that, uh, Cain Marco,

26
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.240
as he's talking to Charles Xavier, he kind of asked the question like,

27
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.030
are you checking in on me to see if I'm healthy enough to travel to your new

28
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:18.050
country and rejoin the X-Men right? That's the, the, the desire of Cain Marco,

29
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:20.570
because remember before the events where he was sent to limbo,

30
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:23.810
he was essentially reforming. And the hope was that he could become a good guy.

31
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.673
And now that he's,

32
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.710
re-emerged become part of Precoa and the response of Charles Xavier,

33
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.970
isn't a rejection based on the idea that Cain Marko has a, toward it,

34
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.760
a sorted history, right? That he's been a bad guy over the years.

35
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.190
It's predicated on the idea that he's not a mutant.

36
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.010
So it was one of these interesting things where Charles Xavier doesn't really

37
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.820
seem to Harbor any animosity or ill will towards Cain, Marco. And indeed,

38
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:44.571
that kind of makes sense.

39
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.780
Historically speaking Xavier is always trying to find a way to reach Cain Marco,

40
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.270
to try to bring him back because he's family, right? He's he's blood,

41
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.740
or at least not biological blood,

42
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:54.290
but might as well be given how much history they have together. And so,

43
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:56.060
because of that, he basically says like, you know,

44
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.710
I believe that you can reform yourself,

45
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:00.830
but understand Coca-Cola is only for the mutant population.

46
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.370
We cannot allow you in here. Now. It is true that exude your could,

47
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.270
if you chose to.

48
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.810
But the reality of this is it breaks down to the argument of where do you draw

49
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.600
the line? If Charles Xavier can let his brother in Dan,

50
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:14.630
if anybody out there is related to anybody who are not mutants,

51
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.220
then why can't they let people in?

52
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.100
And that's when you start to run into a situation where you start to develop

53
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:19.791
animosity.

54
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:22.760
And that's when you run into people who are looking to basically remove you from

55
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.160
power subjugate, you, and then take over your position.

56
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.340
That's how you lead to the collapse of Kakoa envious eyes, that kind of a thing.

57
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.850
And, and we're, it may initially start out with, you know, like, you know,

58
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.170
Charles,

59
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.390
Xavier's allowing my brother to be here or allowing my sister to be here or

60
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:37.490
something like that. As most things in this world,

61
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.570
what starts out as appreciation will inevitably turn into expectation.

62
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.360
And that's what it will become. That's what it would end up turning into.

63
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.450
So that's why Xavier kind of draws a line and says, yes, your family, but no,

64
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:51.350
you can't come here for the same reason that a mutant with no powers or an

65
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.740
unexceptional mutant cannot have their family here. That if they're not mutants,

66
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.170
you cannot be here as well, right? Because at the end of the day,

67
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.580
you are not a mutant. So what we end up is picking up in Budapest,

68
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.960
following this, and Cain,

69
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.890
Marco ends up kind of traveling through these catacombs and of course pays a

70
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.540
journeyman to essentially take him through there,

71
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.130
but starts traveling through these catacombs.

72
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.690
And it's actually kind of interesting, right? Like,

73
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.020
like one of the things that this guy says is the library is 4,000 years old and

74
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.690
that a lot of old gods are kind of drawn on the walls here.

75
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.020
One of the interesting things here is you actually see the [inaudible],

76
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.850
which is drawn here, which is really, really cool.

77
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.320
Those are guys who were unfamiliar with that.

78
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.870
And we might cover this because I don't believe that we ever did,

79
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.980
but the intestines was part of something called the eighth day story, the,

80
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:31.900
the eighth day storyline and the way this works is kind of part and parcel to

81
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:35.050
the origin of Cain Marco, right? So the demon entity Ciroc,

82
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.120
which is where Kane Marco gets his powers from,

83
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:40.360
from the Crimson Jim of Cinderella considered rock was one of eight demon

84
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:42.760
entities that existed on earth at some point in time.

85
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.970
And the idea was that they were kind of feuding over which one of them was the

86
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:49.270
most powerful. And so in order to determine which of them was the most powerful,

87
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.250
they ended up creating an artifact of their own.

88
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.730
And the idea was that this artifact would be placed on earth somewhere.

89
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.680
And when the first artifact was picked up,

90
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.510
that it would lead to a kind of drive, right?

91
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.960
Somebody somewhere would be chosen to pick up another artifact and then somebody

92
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.400
would be driven to pick up another artifact.

93
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.090
And so once all eight artifacts were lifted that in turn humanity would be

94
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.880
divided into eight sections into eight equal number,

95
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.590
and they would all go to war against each other.

96
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.250
And then whichever army representing whichever deity ended up coming out on top

97
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.040
would prove that DD was stronger. I won't really spoil how it ends,

98
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.750
but I will say that eight page, other knots,

99
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.960
probably one of the most powerful versions of juggernaut to ever exist short

100
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.360
only really of his triune form. But nonetheless,

101
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.480
one of the reasons why Kane goes down here in these catacombs is because he's

102
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.000
trying to find a way to access to the rack. Now,

103
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.510
being able to access the Crimson dimension can only really happen through one of

104
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:35.440
a few different ways.

105
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.220
The first is somebody like Dr. Strange or somebody like Iliana Rasputin also

106
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:42.160
known as magic who can open portals to other dimensions, right?

107
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:46.720
The most common way to access a set of rack is to be brought there by rack

108
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:50.050
himself, right. To be chosen as an avatar, to become the new juggernaut,

109
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.840
to be brought there, and then to have that gift bestowed upon you. Right.

110
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:55.150
And that's what really kind of what happened with Cain Marko.

111
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.330
And that's what he's trying to do here. He's trying to find a new Crimson jet.

112
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.570
He's trying to find a way to access Cinderella to basically go back to his

113
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.360
position as being juggernaut. Right? And so from there,

114
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:05.590
we kind of switch over to the modern day.

115
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.740
We switched over to what's happening right now. And the idea here is that with,

116
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.850
uh, with diesel, of course,

117
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.790
the girl who who's kind of been working alongside Kane Marco to a degree,

118
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.760
the one that pitched the idea to him, that she's got the whole plan worked out.

119
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.390
The idea is that juggernauts trying to prove that he's a good guy and,

120
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:21.310
and no one really knows if he's a good guy or a bad guy, right.

121
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.710
She's almost kind of trying to rework his brand to a degree.

122
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.190
And the best way to do that is to basically have them confront the immortal

123
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.580
Hawk. And the reason why is because she's got a friend who is in,

124
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.710
what's called the victims of the whole group, right?

125
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:35.620
People who have been victimized by the whole in one way or another,

126
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:37.180
and we'll find out what some of those ways are.

127
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.240
But then it's also things like she can use a damage control,

128
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:42.010
which normally cleans up after superheroes.

129
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.770
But because of the ones that hired Kane Marco to demolish a building,

130
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.260
and then diesel was caught in that building and almost killed,

131
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.570
she can kind of pull that guilt train, right. And say like, Hey,

132
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.030
you guys need to help me out with this. Help me, help me, you know,

133
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.770
with have came Marco rebrand himself.

134
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.110
Otherwise I'm going to tell everybody everything that you did and that you

135
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:57.230
almost got me killed. Right?

136
00:05:57.231 --> 00:06:00.320
So damage control of course ends up going along with it. And so from there,

137
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:03.410
we kind of pick up with, with Kmart Marco facing off against, uh,

138
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:05.900
against the incredible Hulk, right? The immortal Hulk. And of course,

139
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.520
DeSales live streaming the whole thing.

140
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.070
But the fight between the two is interesting. For the most part,

141
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.270
it is one sided,

142
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.390
but he really is one sided in favor of the immortal Hulk and his,

143
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.330
and it's not as though Fimian the season kind of plays it like then do you think

144
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:19.430
the immortal Hulk's going to win? Like, Oh really, no.

145
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.040
Do you have to keep reading to find out that's not really what he does for like

146
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.570
right off the bat, the immortal hoax. Like,

147
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.600
I don't know why you came down here while your stupidity brought you here to

148
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.900
fight against me juggernaut, but you can't win. You know, you can't win.

149
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.950
I know you can't win.

150
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.490
And the stupid new armor that you have is not going to do you any good, right?

151
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.430
So like, like literally humbling this guy, right?

152
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:40.790
And just like thrashing juggernaut and tossing him around. Now,

153
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:43.490
one thing Fabian to Caesar does not show us here,

154
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.240
which would be pretty intriguing to get a full understanding of how these

155
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.060
characters compare against each other is whether or not the immortal whole can

156
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:52.430
stop the juggernaut when he starts moving. Now,

157
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.730
this is largely assuming that his power set still the same and we don't know,

158
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.330
right.

159
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.900
Having a new suit of armor indicates a new level of power or a different level

160
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.940
of power. We're not giving a definitive answer here.

161
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:05.330
We've just kind of seen him in his normal form. But as we know,

162
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.930
the power of the juggernaut is such that once he's moving, he cannot be stopped.

163
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.620
And outside of the version of the incredible Hawk that was powered by the heroes

164
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:16.160
reborn universe and was imbued with Celesio technology at the hands of

165
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:19.240
apocalypse, outside of that version of the Hulk, unless you have a tele,

166
00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:21.170
a telekinetic that can lift jet or not in the air,

167
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.150
no one can really physically stop him, right?

168
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.910
Like he just starts moving and he suddenly cannot be stopped.

169
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.860
And so even with world breaker hope, for example,

170
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.900
he had to divert Kane Marco's movement, right?

171
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:33.230
He had literally just like send him flying in a different direction by using his

172
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:35.180
momentum against him. Because of that, you know,

173
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:39.110
what is happening here is DSL realizing that Kane Marco's is getting pummeled

174
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:39.944
the way that he is.

175
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.940
It's all based on the idea of positioning damage control to essentially use

176
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.730
their gamma radiation siphon. And so as Kane,

177
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.410
Marco is more or less just distracting,

178
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.890
immortal Hulk and getting the crap beat out of him for his efforts. Like, well,

179
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.290
this guy, can't this guy, this guy can't win for losing. Right. It's just, it's,

180
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.830
it's, it's rough. But the whole point is that, uh,

181
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.630
the DSL basically ends up using her,

182
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:06.200
using her ability to slow momentum in order to slow the immortal Hulk down,

183
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.510
right. To kind of dis-ease him and to slow him down. Now,

184
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:11.810
the funny thing about this is she makes this comment about how immortal Hulk is

185
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:13.190
so much stronger than juggernaut.

186
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.790
Now that's an important moment because whenever you see store or whenever you

187
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:20.420
see like versus videos, right? Or you see like respect, you know,

188
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.020
immortal Hulk threads or something like that on a comic comic vine or Reddit or

189
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:26.510
wherever it is, this is the kind of thing they reference. Right.

190
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:29.900
And when people are trying to find some way to kind of power scale,

191
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.760
and usually you find somebody to kind of cook the books,

192
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.700
the idea behind this is they'll look at something like this and sort of skew it

193
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.200
a little bit, but looking at it for what it is,

194
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.690
it is the immortal Hulk is stronger than juggernaut, right?

195
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:41.330
Like DSL is kind of our intermediary there, right?

196
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:44.840
She's our litmus test on which one is stronger, you know, like juggernaut or,

197
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:45.710
or immortal Hawk.

198
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.950
And the fact that the immortal Hawk is so much harder to keep his momentum

199
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.190
contained so much harder to slow him down, as opposed to juggernaut.

200
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.670
We're literally talking about brute strength, right?

201
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.150
The ability for immortal hope to move against the,

202
00:08:58.151 --> 00:09:01.140
the ability of diesel to slow his momentum versus Jeff.

203
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.980
We're not doing the same thing. So, so it's kind of interesting. It's a,

204
00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:05.540
it's a pretty cool little concept, right?

205
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.270
1990s comics were rife with this kind of stuff.

206
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.290
But the idea is that because DSL can't hold them back any longer that she begins

207
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.330
to you kind of lure the immortal hook in, right.

208
00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:17.930
So kind of lower the influence or power has on immortal Hulk to the point to

209
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:20.390
where damage control can launch their gamma siphon. Right.

210
00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:24.110
And what it does is it basically reduces the power of the immortal Hulk enough

211
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.390
to where juggernaut can beat the crap out of it, right?

212
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.900
The way this fight basically plays out immortal hope is way stronger. Then,

213
00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:32.090
then the new juggernaut, right then Ben came markup. He,

214
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.770
you actually have to deep. How're the incredible, the immortal Hulk.

215
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.880
I would agree in order for Kane Marco to stand a chance to basically knock him

216
00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:40.550
out. Right. And that's what, that's what ends up successfully in being done.

217
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.510
Now transition to, to, to Marion North Carolina, right?

218
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:46.490
There's this kind of town hall that's going on here.

219
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.120
And the incredible Hulk is being kept in this giant status status unit.

220
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.690
And the idea behind this is that this is kind of an assembly of people who have

221
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:56.600
a gripe with the immortal Hulk, right? Who have been victimized by the,

222
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.870
over the years by the immortal, right? And this is one of those things where,

223
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.870
as they run these things off, notice the look of Kane, Marco,

224
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.640
he's watching all these guys talk, right?

225
00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:07.910
One guy's like you wrecked our tractors and cost us our crops and other persons

226
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:11.090
like you destroyed our entire apartment complex. We lost everything.

227
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.370
One other guy is like, my father was so scared of you,

228
00:10:13.371 --> 00:10:16.100
that he had a heart attack and died. Two days later, my dog died.

229
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:19.070
My car was crushed. The original star Wars action figures were destroyed.

230
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.630
All my pictures of my girl were destroyed.

231
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.990
And it's just this constant runoff of things that have happened that have been

232
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:27.890
like collateral damage of the immortal Hulk and the entire time the Hawks just

233
00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:28.724
smiling.

234
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.790
But he's smiling at all of this while this whole thing is being streamed by, uh,

235
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.490
by diesel. He's just smiling the entire time.

236
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.630
And the reason why is because once the immortal Hulk basically breaks out and

237
00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:42.630
then Cain Marco goes to respond. It says everybody needs to get out. No, no, no,

238
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:45.470
no. It's cool. Like there's no need for us to fight anymore.

239
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.320
Like they all had their say, they had their say good for them.

240
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.630
If it makes them feel better, that's cool. I don't really care,

241
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.920
but understand everything that you guys are seeing here could reply to him as

242
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:55.970
well. Not just me.

243
00:10:55.971 --> 00:11:00.050
I'm not the only rampaging beast who's torn through the United States and laid

244
00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:02.030
waste to all the things that you care about. Right.

245
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.640
I'm not the only person that's done that. He's done that as well.

246
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.790
This guy has done that as well. The result of this is that Cain Marco,

247
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.380
where were immortal, hopelessly contact, shadow base, right.

248
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.200
It kind of his base of operations for more about that.

249
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:14.270
We could probably cover immortal hope if you guys are interested,

250
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.760
story's a little hit and miss at the moment. It's a little spotty at the moment.

251
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.490
I'm waiting for things to kind of pick back up before I get back into it again,

252
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.980
but he ends up teleporting out. Right. And that's when it came.

253
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.720
Marco's kind of like, yeah. I mean, he's right.

254
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.970
I'm guilty of the exact same things that he's done.

255
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.820
The difference here is that the whole, like before he was immortal,

256
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.100
hokey was just the incredible whole, he was Savage Hawk.

257
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.240
He had the mind of a child.

258
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.660
He was just being attacked by things I couldn't really grasp or understand.

259
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.300
And he would just go on a rampage. Right. He was just a really, really,

260
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:41.540
really strong kid, but I'm a grown man. I knew what I was doing.

261
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.240
Not only did I know what I was doing, I enjoyed doing it.

262
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.000
And that's kind of the struggle that he's enduring here is that this,

263
00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:50.630
this whole kind of town hall meeting that was designed to confront the immortal

264
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.250
Hawk with all the things that he's done in his past indirectly confronts

265
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.113
juggernaut, right.

266
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.940
Kane Marco has to kind of come to grips with all the things that he's done.

267
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.140
And that's, what's cool about this.

268
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.550
It's one thing to sit down in a place and to know you've done some bad things.

269
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.880
It's another to have people confront you with the bad things that you've done,

270
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.610
right? Because now you're hearing it from other people more so than that,

271
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:11.440
you see the anger and the, the, the,

272
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.990
the rage on their face because of what you've done.

273
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.730
And you feel that guilt and that shame,

274
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.120
it's easy to kind of cast aside that guilt and chamber things that we've done

275
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:23.020
right. To say, well, you know what I mean? I did a bad thing. Yeah. It happens.

276
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.700
It's life. Just the way it works. Right. I mean, you know,

277
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.400
what kind of person would I be if I never made mistakes? Right. That's,

278
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.740
it's easy for us to kind of look at ourselves in that way.

279
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.100
But when somebody is telling us, you did this to me, you did that to me,

280
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.280
it creates a kind of guilt and a kind of shame in your mind in terms of how you

281
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:39.370
perceive yourself. And it makes you feel horrible. It's inescapable. And so,

282
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:41.110
because of that, what do you end up having is of course,

283
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.840
DSL kind of live streaming, you know, picking back up with a stream again,

284
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:46.210
because she had ended it, you know, prior to the incredible whole freaking out,

285
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:48.640
but you end up having juggernaut DeSales who basically land, you know,

286
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:52.720
back in the back in Manhattan. And they're met by the arrival of a, uh, of a,

287
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:55.930
a civil servant who basically says like you're being sued. You're like you,

288
00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:59.530
you you're being, you're Guinea, uh, receiving a summons to appear in Manhattan,

289
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:00.880
civil court, like you're being sued for,

290
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.190
for the bankruptcy of a construction company.

291
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.470
And you're being sued for $25 million.

292
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.570
So I have no idea how the juggernaut is going to pay it,

293
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.030
but welcome to the legal world. Welcome to the world of being a good guy,

294
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.620
juggernaut. It sucks, right?

295
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:13.660
Like you got to worry about how bills are going to get paid.

296
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.400
You got to worry about all that kind of stuff. When you're a bad guy,

297
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:17.590
you don't have to worry about those kinds of things when you're a good guy.

298
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:21.070
You do. So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

299
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.530
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

300
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.720
button to become part of the Rob core. You guys enjoy this video.

301
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.330
Make sure you drop a light. Now we'll catch you all later.

302
