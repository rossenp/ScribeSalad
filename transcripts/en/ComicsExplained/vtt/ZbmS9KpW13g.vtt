4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.630
All right.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.290
<v 1>Hold on guys. This is Rob and we are picking back up again with Spiderman. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.060
almost said Spiderman too, with Spiderman.

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.490
We're picking back up with miles Morales and Peter Parker.

8
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:22.130
Now this is kind of a three-pronged event, right?

9
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:25.040
Like the first time and the first issue they met and the second issue they

10
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:28.460
fought and this one they team up. So it was kind of a cool,

11
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.960
a cool bit of storytelling here. Right.

12
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.960
But in the instance where they had initially fought each other and things have

13
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.020
kind of popped off and they were sort of coming to coming to terms and,

14
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.340
you know, with regards to this reality,

15
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.060
they're suddenly met by this avatar of a, of Mysteria. Now, again,

16
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.640
this is kind of the robot slash you know,

17
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.130
we're really just straight robot that Mysterio is using.

18
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.750
He is in the main Marvel universe,

19
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.470
but he's piloting this and it's moving around in the ultimate universe. Right?

20
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.670
And so, because of that, as submitted,

21
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.660
it takes down the helicopter that Peter Parker and miles Morales were in the two

22
00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:58.160
of them start to team up to fight up.

23
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.850
Mysterial the problem with this is that that miles Morales has never really

24
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:05.630
fought anybody like Mysterio before and even Mysterio as he existed in the main

25
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.540
Marvel universe doesn't really exist the same way in the ultimate universe to

26
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:11.720
kind of give you guys some perspective of the big differences between these two

27
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.390
things. Because I believe by this point, Dr. Strange is dead. Um,

28
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.780
there came a point in the ultimate universe where Dr. Strange fought Dormamuu

29
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.060
and in the main Marvel universe, Dr. Strain has fought.

30
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.330
Dormamuu a multitude of times and won pretty much every single time.

31
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.110
And the ultimate university fights in once and dies. It's it's nuts. Like he's,

32
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.070
he's painfully outclass in comparison to the power that Dormamuu has a,

33
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.140
he kills him with a quickness and that's basically it,

34
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.770
but it happens so incredibly fast because you're talking about Mysterio who

35
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.140
still maintained his ability to create illusions,

36
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.420
despite using a kind of avatar form.

37
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.870
You end up having a Peter Parker who picks up on what's going on. Now.

38
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.810
It took him a moment to realize it because he's like something weird is going

39
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:48.501
on, right? It's a more,

40
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:51.650
more powerful strain of the illusion that he normally uses.

41
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.210
But what he ends up doing is conjuring all of Spiderman's villains and the

42
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.260
things that, that miles Morales fears the most, right?

43
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:59.360
So basically third greatest fears between the two of them.

44
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.410
And with this happening,

45
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.200
you really only ever see the scorpion from the ultimate universe.

46
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.010
You see uncle Aaron,

47
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.470
the Prowler from the ultimate universe it'll make a red for the ultimate

48
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:06.890
universe,

49
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.470
but you only really see those because those are the only really the villains

50
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:12.680
that miles Morales has fought so far for Peter Parker. It's,

51
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.350
it's a whole host of stuff, right? It's a whole host of things,

52
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:18.080
green goblin and Dr. Octopus and all that stuff.

53
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.410
But that's what makes us so bonkers is because of the fact that miles doesn't

54
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:22.940
really know how to navigate this. Now,

55
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.190
this kind of illusion that Mysterio creates.

56
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:27.830
That's one of the big things to understand his illusions can be tangible.

57
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.930
If they're powerful enough, they can be tangible.

58
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.090
And that's one of the big differences is that in the early days,

59
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:33.500
if I remember correctly in the early days,

60
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.540
his illusions were more or less intangible, right?

61
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:37.490
So he could trick you into believing you were somewhere,

62
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.850
but he couldn't really make things interact with you. And this instance he can,

63
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:43.910
and it's really kind of been that way for a number of years in Marvel comics,

64
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.410
but Mysterio uses his powers to quite literally have these guys attack, uh,

65
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.930
miles Morales and Spider-Man and Peter Parker, right?

66
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:53.420
So it was like venom and his carnage has all these guys,

67
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:56.480
and this is an incredibly dangerous because these are forces that miles isn't

68
00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:57.620
used to facing off against.

69
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.910
But this is one of the big differences here is that miles hasn't really faced

70
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.190
off against mysterial before. But at the same time,

71
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.490
this kind of magic doesn't necessarily see exist inside the, the ultimate.

72
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.620
You know, now this may seem like it would naturally work against miles Morales.

73
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.350
He's basically being exposed to something that he hasn't really seen before,

74
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.510
and wouldn't really know how to navigate those waters,

75
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.700
but instead of doing what Peter Parker seems to be doing here,

76
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:20.010
which is kind of overthinking it to a degree instead,

77
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.910
Myles actually manages to get the upper hand and basically incapacitate Mysterio

78
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:24.870
temporarily. You know,

79
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.470
if for no other reason than to basically take down his avatar form and then

80
00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:31.020
essentially, right, like a destroy that, that it,

81
00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:33.630
because miles picks up on the fact, this is the reason why it's happening now.

82
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.320
Again,

83
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.950
this is one of those instances in the ultimate Spider-Man comics where people

84
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.290
were a little finicky, they were like, I mean,

85
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.960
I have a hard time believing that miles would be able to pick up on this and

86
00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:43.860
Peter Parker. Couldn't,

87
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.590
you're talking about two characters from two different realities who navigate

88
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:49.320
waters differently. There were, when this, when this story first came out,

89
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.050
there was one group of people who looked at this and said, okay,

90
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.230
the only reason miles be able to figure this out on his own is because Ben is

91
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:57.270
writing it and Bendis is pushing miles.

92
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.570
And does it really wants to him to be like the new ultimate universe Spider-Man

93
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.500
and of what use would his character be if he didn't have some kind of caveat

94
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.080
over Peter Parker from Peter Parker in general,

95
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.290
like even from the main Marvel universe, it's one of these interesting concepts,

96
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.450
one of these interesting quad Myers, but again, you know, with,

97
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.920
with regards to Mysterio,

98
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.620
he's one of these villains whereby all standards of measurement.

99
00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:20.370
He would've gotten the upper hand on miles Morales because what makes Mysterio

100
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.020
is, uh, you know, his, his powers.

101
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.680
So incredibly potent is he's much like mastermind or somebody like Charles

102
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.240
Xavier, not in so much as the powers he possesses, he's just an illusionist,

103
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.380
right? He doesn't really have to let pithy or anything like that,

104
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.850
but much like those guys,

105
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.020
his powers can totally envelope you and convince you that you're somewhere that

106
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:39.240
you're not right. Mysterial gets his hands, it's on you.

107
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:43.080
If he can convince you that you're a world away, you know, and, and you're in,

108
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:43.291
you know,

109
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:46.230
some pirate land and you're fighting against pirates or something like that,

110
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.920
you know,

111
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.800
whether or not you're able to actually pick up on that are two distinctly

112
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.410
different things, right? Creating that illusion. If you're of sound mind,

113
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.360
you'll immediately know that something's off, right.

114
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.400
Regardless when everything kind of pops off,

115
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.430
Peter Parker actually ends up taking off. He doesn't leave the universe.

116
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.690
He just goes to explore it.

117
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.660
And where you end up having the ultimate to arrive here on the scene with the

118
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:06.210
miles Morales. Now, one of the big things that goes on here is again,

119
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.360
because these characters were designed to be a lot more toned down than the

120
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:10.370
versions that we saw in the,

121
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.650
the ultimate universe that Tony stark doesn't really know how to navigate this,

122
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:15.780
this technology, right? Like in the main Marvel universe,

123
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.910
he would have picked it up right off the bat and just been like, okay,

124
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:20.960
so here's what's going on with this instead. And the ultimate universe, he,

125
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.920
his intelligence is a little more grounded, right?

126
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:26.250
So it's not as though he's just wildly out there as intelligent as a story needs

127
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.170
him to be. Instead, it's a little more grounded here.

128
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.830
So he recognized that in so far as this, an exceedingly, you know,

129
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.060
advanced form of technology, and that is an avatar is basically being used by,

130
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.820
you know, this ministerial guy to control it, you know, control this,

131
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.740
this avatar version from someplace else.

132
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.920
But in terms of being able to reverse engineer it almost instantaneously,

133
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.380
that doesn't happen here, right. That doesn't really take place here.

134
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.030
Now from miles part, of course,

135
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.630
he ends up asking Nick fury where the other Spider-Man go and fewer responses.

136
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.570
He went out there to explore things. And that's the nature of this, right?

137
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:54.871
When you're,

138
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:58.280
when you're someone like Spider-Man and you face off against Mysterio and you've

139
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.210
gone through as illusions.

140
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.080
So many times the biggest struggle he has here is trying to figure out whether

141
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:07.010
any of this is real or false. That's the biggest struggle he has at the moment,

142
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.500
because, you know, you've got to kind of think of this from Peter's perspective.

143
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.170
He was in his own universe, he was facing off against Mysterio,

144
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.640
found himself yanked through a portal,

145
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.770
ended up in this new reality where he's dead.

146
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.320
There's a new Spiderman that took his place. Uh, and that there's a,

147
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:19.670
there's a Nick fury there, you know,

148
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:23.180
who seemingly allow the two of them new team up and then mysterious avatar,

149
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.250
piers. He ends up facing off against all of his villains,

150
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.110
even though they're illusions. And then of course,

151
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:29.600
miles Morales ends up destroying that, that avatar.

152
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.850
And now Peter is basically exploring in his mind,

153
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.090
all of this could be the illusion. And that's the truth of the thing, right?

154
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:37.700
That's the truth of the thing here, when you're facing off against material,

155
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.270
this could all be illusion it's entirely possible that Bendis could have ended

156
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.350
this story. And it was all just one big, huge illusion created by, by Mysterio.

157
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.800
And it would work. It would be believable because he's done it before, right?

158
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:52.100
That's the advancement of mysterious illusions is that it just,

159
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.120
it screws with your head so incredibly badly. But as we know,

160
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.000
Peter Parker is actually in the ultimate universe.

161
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.760
And so we basically start tracking different things down and he goes to the

162
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.040
place that would have been his apartment. He has a funny art Cornerstore.

163
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:06.200
He asked him like, how long has this been here? She's like, I don't know,

164
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:08.360
how long have you worked here? I've worked here two years, you know?

165
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.910
And he's like, okay. So there was never an apartment building here, you know,

166
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:12.470
like there, like there was never an apartment here.

167
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.270
And so basically he never stayed here.

168
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.690
The other thing that ends up happening after he beats up some guy who runs into

169
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:19.670
the place in Robinson is he asked her for, you know,

170
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:22.520
for a tablet that can help him access the internet. And when he does,

171
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:26.210
he finds an article that the Spider-Man in this universe really did die here.

172
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.330
And that it really, that everybody really knew that he was Peter Parker,

173
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.040
that he was a high school student from Queens.

174
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.990
And so it's one of these things where it's kind of like,

175
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.360
I really am in a universe, run dead. The other part of that is of course,

176
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.150
she has this little necklace around her neck.

177
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.710
And of course it's her way of paying respects to Peter Parker.

178
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.103
Spider-Man and then he's like,

179
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.650
you need to tell me exactly what happened to Peter Parker in this universe.

180
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.380
And so what we end up doing is we basically end up picking up, uh, you know,

181
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:52.430
some period of time later with aunt Mae and with Gwen Stacy from the ultimate

182
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:55.400
universe. And Peter Parker shows up on their doorstep, right?

183
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:57.020
Like literally just shows up there.

184
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.210
And this is one of the most amazing things here.

185
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.470
It's one of the most amazing moments,

186
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:03.740
because this is Peter Parker coming to grips with when Stacy,

187
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.670
who is still alive in this universe and aunt Mae and having to face the fact

188
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.730
that in their mind he's dead. And so it was kind of like, wow,

189
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:13.430
like this is one of those things is a hyper emotional story.

190
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:16.910
If you're a Peter Parker fan, right. It's, it's kind of nuts. It's Peter Parker,

191
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.470
re-encounter stirring, uh, aunt Mae and Gwen, Stacy. It's kind of nuts.

192
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.510
But with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

193
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.100
