4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.143
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.420
<v 1>He is Rob and we are back with Batman ghost stories and we get the origin</v>

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.910
of ghost maker. Now I say this origin loosely,

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.890
not because we don't get a full origin, we do,

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.310
but I feel like this might be expanded on later on by James Tinian.

9
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:28.010
So kind of keep your eyes out for the idea that we might get more of an

10
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.210
expansion here. Um,

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.160
another thing that we're doing here is I'm going to give away a Rob core ring on

12
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:35.090
the discord server.

13
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.490
So make sure you guys check out the discourse server down in the description.

14
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:37.991
Um,

15
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:42.320
I'm going to give one away on Friday at 6:00 PM Eastern time when I do my weekly

16
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.840
Q and a. So make sure you guys check that out. Uh,

17
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.960
and then I'm also going to list rubber core rings for sale again, uh,

18
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.630
once we get around to, uh, really close to Christmas time, right?

19
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.520
So maybe here in about a week or so, uh,

20
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.040
I'm going to list them for sale that way you guys can buy them and then you guys

21
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.140
can get them in time for Christmas. So that's going to be cool.

22
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.810
That's going to be fun. I also will have size 12 rings.

23
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.730
So those are the guys who need size twelves.

24
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.810
We actually have those in stock now, or they just recently came in. So yes. Uh,

25
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.380
so having said that, um, we are, we're covering this origin right now.

26
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.600
This whole thing comes in the aftermath of the last video.

27
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.980
The last story that we did were Batman alongside lb killer and Holly Quinn were

28
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:19.580
all basically captured by ghost maker. They were all defeated by ghost maker.

29
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.190
So at this point they're all basically stuck in Arkham asylum.

30
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.770
And it's one of these funny things where Batman basically wakes up before

31
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:27.200
everybody else. But that's because of the fact that he's Batman,

32
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.500
that's not true. It's because of the fact that ghost maker, uh,

33
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.880
didn't give him as much of a, or didn't give him as strong of a shot of the, uh,

34
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.550
of the, basically the thing that knocked him out of the anesthetic, uh,

35
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.830
as he did with Harley Quinn and encounter killer, right?

36
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:42.350
Because he wanted a Batman to wake up early because he wanted to have this

37
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:43.640
conversation directly with him.

38
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.910
And the whole idea is we don't really find out the full depth of this

39
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:47.960
conversation instead.

40
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.410
It's really him just kind of talking to Batman and saying that with everything

41
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.770
going on, that, that this, this clown killer kid is basically just,

42
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:56.960
or at least count Hunter, I guess his official name, uh,

43
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.840
is basically just the latest symptom of this disease, right?

44
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:03.230
That Batman has essentially failed as a superhero in almost every way, right?

45
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:06.710
That Gotham is not better because of Batman. Gotham is actually worse.

46
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.230
And so what we ended up doing here before we get this kind of full on

47
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:11.740
explanation is we switch over to Barbara Gordon, right?

48
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:14.510
We switched over to bat girl, who's basically talking to Dick Grayson, right?

49
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:16.190
While you know, a crime's kind of happening,

50
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.280
some criminals are robbing a bank and Dick Grayson's beating them up and talking

51
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:21.620
to her at the same time, which makes sense, right? Because you know,

52
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.300
Dick Grayson, he can do almost anything.

53
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.330
<v 0>And so what we.</v>

54
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.670
<v 1>Ended up finding out is that in the time with Madonna and having been missing</v>

55
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.240
for the last six hours and the time that ghost maker's been in the city of

56
00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:35.540
Gotham, uh, the professor pig was found back at Arkham asylum.

57
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:37.580
Despite the fact that he was on, he was on the loose,

58
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.300
the Yakuza triads and the whisper gang have all just abandoned the city

59
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:42.290
completely, right?

60
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.920
That six people were found dead at the iceberg lounge of the penguin and the

61
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.810
penguin himself is believed to be underground.

62
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.990
And one of his bunkers that effectively the criminal element in Gotham has just

63
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.240
vanished, tried just seemingly disappeared overnight.

64
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.060
These guys just took off and that's what night week kind of times in,

65
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:58.640
I can't believe that ghost maker actually came to Gotham.

66
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.260
And it gives us this idea that Dick Grayson knows who the ghosts maker is and is

67
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.300
something that he's actually known for quite some time,

68
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.250
because that's what Barbara Gordon has. Some she's like,

69
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.620
how do you know who the ghost maker is? And he's like, well,

70
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.920
I've known about him for a long time, right? But I've only ever seen him once.

71
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.430
And what he does is he recalls this story from back when he was younger,

72
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.040
right back when he, around the time that he first became Robin.

73
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.460
And he talks about how him and Batman had basically been chasing some guy,

74
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.060
right?

75
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.480
Some low-level guy there was making a break and fleeing the United States and

76
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.480
Batman and them had basically tracked him down to this location.

77
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.780
And once they got to an airport where this guy was going to be taking off that

78
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.330
then suddenly they were met by the arrival of a,

79
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.210
of ghost maker who had already essentially captured this villain.

80
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.660
And as soon as they get out and as soon as Batman sees its ghost maker,

81
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.720
that man gets back in the backswing and then tells Robin we're going back to

82
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.900
Gothic. And when Robin's like, why? Like, like who is this guy? Like,

83
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.880
why are we just going to go back to go back to Gotham?

84
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.450
Batman kind of starts talking about when he was younger and when he started

85
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:55.800
undergoing this whole, this whole process of becoming Batman, right? Yeah.

86
00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.100
If you guys, any of you guys recall,

87
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.280
this was especially important during Batman year one by Frank Miller,

88
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.070
which really covered all that stuff. It's one of the reasons why, uh,

89
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.070
freight Miller's Batman work is kind of considered to be some of the Seminole

90
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:09.370
Batman work that exists out there because it did so much retelling of his

91
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:09.820
origin.

92
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.640
And a lot of those things that have kind of been changed or removed over the

93
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:14.770
years are in a lot of ways, ignored by fans.

94
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.100
And it's kind of considered to be like the definitive story like Batman year one

95
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:20.500
is largely believed to be the definitive Batman story.

96
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.890
That man year zero from the new 52, a lot of fans kind of, uh,

97
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.080
basically marry that with that man year one,

98
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.690
and then just kind of combine them together for a singular story, right?

99
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:30.520
And say, this is how Bruce Wayne became Batman.

100
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.470
This is how it all sort of sort of came together.

101
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.980
But the long and short of this is that when Bruce Wayne starts talking about his

102
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:36.940
life, when he was younger,

103
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.940
than he traveled around the world to all these different places, right.

104
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:40.870
Then when his parents died,

105
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.770
he made a promise to himself made this oath that he would basically live a war

106
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.640
against criminals.

107
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.220
And he wanted to become the kind of person that could fulfill that oath.

108
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.940
And so we went from place to place training with all different kinds of people,

109
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.700
right. He trained with autonomous father. He trained with wild cat,

110
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.930
I think is what a name, his name is.

111
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.200
I don't know if he trained with all these different people, but along the way,

112
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.860
he met this young guy and this young guy that he met really kind of proved to be

113
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.010
somebody whose ego was just ridiculously unbearable,

114
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.610
but it was a person who thought very much the same way Bruce Wayne did that.

115
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:13.360
It wasn't just enough to become skilled in like a singular martial art and

116
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.440
dedicate their life to that.

117
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.370
He wanted to become the absolute best crime fighter he could possibly be.

118
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.430
And what Bruce Wayne found here was a kind of comradery, right?

119
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.610
It was him and this guy working together and kind of presenting each other with

120
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.460
these almost unsolvable mysteries, these unsolvable problems,

121
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.320
basically how to make the world a better place,

122
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:32.290
dreaming about technology in the future, how crime can be solved,

123
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.124
different things like that.

124
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.830
And so when with Bruce Wayne kind of finding this friend,

125
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.580
this guy who was basically as, as egotistical as he was, was a very,

126
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:42.670
very strong competitor and was a very close friend of Bruce Wayne.

127
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.210
Bruce Wayne finally revealed his story saying that he's the son of Thomas and

128
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.770
Martha, that his parents were killed.

129
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.220
And the following that he basically wanted to kind of wage war against crime in

130
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:52.570
order to bring all that to an end. Right.

131
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:54.250
So nobody would have to go through what he went through.

132
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.830
The response to that was ghost got. He so mad.

133
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.790
And the reason why he tried to kill Bruce Wayne is that he told him he was weak.

134
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.080
That ghost maker was angry because he believed that he found somebody like him,

135
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.780
right? Somebody who was doing all of this, the art of it,

136
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.840
probably because it was just a thing that they desire to think that they pursued

137
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.810
to suddenly just better themselves and better the world around them.

138
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.420
That it wasn't some childish idea of vengeance. Now,

139
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.110
this is a really interesting concept. This is a really interesting thing.

140
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.920
A lot of times when you see characters like ghost maker presented and comic

141
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:26.350
books that have an origin story like this,

142
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.960
where they meet the main hero and the two of them become enemies.

143
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.780
Sometimes it's because of the fact that, especially in a situation like this,

144
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.720
that they were somehow less capable than the hero themselves.

145
00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:37.660
And it's all just been an effort to prove that they're just as capable for ghost

146
00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:39.550
maker. It's not that way. It's like, no,

147
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:41.440
I really want to make the world a better place.

148
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:43.060
I want to do this to make the world better.

149
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.910
You're doing it because you're mad that your mommy and daddy got shot.

150
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.310
And it's just, and that's basically what it is. Right. And that's,

151
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.340
what's so cool is because it moves ghost maker away from this guy.

152
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.400
Who's just like once upon a time, him and Bruce Wayne met each other,

153
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.430
Bruce Wayne got a black belt before him. And he's been over since,

154
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.670
instead of that, instead of something stupid and basic like that, it's no,

155
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.200
like you're just filled with vengeance, right?

156
00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:04.990
Like you don't really have a desire to make the world better because you're

157
00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.100
being altruistic.

158
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.590
You want to make the world better because your mommy and daddy got shot.

159
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:09.350
You're full of rage.

160
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.490
You want to make sure that nobody else has to go through that again. Golly, gee,

161
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.130
you're going to save the day. And in a lot of ways,

162
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.160
it kind of diminishes Batman. If I'm being honest with you guys,

163
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.490
I feel like it kind of diminishes him. Not necessarily in a terrible way, right.

164
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:24.790
Doesn't make us any less capable, but it really puts into perspective.

165
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.200
The goal of Batman, right?

166
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.800
He's just a little kid crying because his parents got shocked that it really is

167
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.010
all just based on vengeance and anger. He's in essence,

168
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.660
every ounce of a vigilante,

169
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.950
whereas ghost maker is being presented here from the words of Batman, as a guy,

170
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.700
who's doing all this because he genuinely and truly wants to make the world

171
00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:46.510
better. And that totally changes the idea that he'll just kill villains, right?

172
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.060
It's not him killing them because it's easy. It is. I mean,

173
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:51.880
technically it is easy. So by default, that's a true statement,

174
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.450
but he does that because dead men can not be repeat offenders. Dead.

175
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:58.150
Men can not go back and commit crimes all over again.

176
00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:00.400
Now I know it seems to take away from the human element,

177
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.030
but ghost maker also seems to kind of have this, this sort of threshold, right.

178
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.240
Where it's one thing to run criminals out of town. It's another to kill them.

179
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.910
And there's this kind of standard that he arbitrarily creates,

180
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.730
which is once they start committing acts of egregious enough,

181
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.250
didn't we kill them. And it seems to be the standard he created,

182
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:18.790
which is a reasonable one, is that if a villain basically becomes a killer,

183
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.410
then we kill him in turn. Right.

184
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.860
They sacrifice the right to life when they took somebody. Else's,

185
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.720
it's kind of interesting here, right? It's,

186
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.700
it's an interesting concept because from there,

187
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:30.790
like Robin kind of looks at that in any, he's listening to the story,

188
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:33.310
the Batman's telling him and he's like, well, you know, you're not weak, right?

189
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:35.410
I mean, like, I don't have to tell you that, but you know, that's not true.

190
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.450
And Batman is like, well, I don't feel weak. And that's when,

191
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:40.630
when Dick Grayson picks up on it, but you miss your friend. And Batman is like,

192
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.290
yes, I miss my friend. I miss the person that I spent so much time with now,

193
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.221
following that.

194
00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:48.280
And when he continues kind of talking to Barbara Gordon about all this,

195
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.610
one of the things that he says is that when Batman jump-started Batman

196
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.610
incorporated, he reached out to, uh, to ghost maker. Now,

197
00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:55.740
for those of you guys don't know what that is.

198
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.620
Batman incorporated was part of the grant Morrison run, right?

199
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.340
So grant Morrison's Batman run is considered by a lot of fans to be one of the

200
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.430
absolute best band, uh, best Batman runs and rightfully so.

201
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:09.330
It's amazing laser ridiculously good Batman series of Batman stories.

202
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.690
But the idea of the chronology is that during the events of final crisis,

203
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.140
Batman was shot by doomsday with, you know, his Omega sanction or whatever.

204
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.690
And technically it should've killed Batman because it would've killed anybody

205
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.830
else who was just a regular human,

206
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.710
but he was set back in time because he's too popular for DC to cancel.

207
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.990
And so that gave us a story, the return of Bruce Wayne,

208
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.980
during that time when Bruce Wayne was traveling through time that you had Dick

209
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.220
Grayson who became Batman and Damian Wayne became a new Robin.

210
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.380
And so you've got that series of stories, you know,

211
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.260
focusing on the Dick race in Batman era. And then of course,

212
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.780
once Bruce Wayne came back, his thought was okay,

213
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.760
we need to expand the bat family. Right.

214
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:43.740
And so that's when the bat family went international.

215
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.160
And so it was basically him traveling around to all these different places where

216
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:50.610
he found individuals who were effectively people fighting crime that seemed to

217
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.840
have like minds, right?

218
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.420
So that's where you end up getting like Lucius Fox's son, you know,

219
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:56.640
where you get, you have like a bat wing, I think is what he's called.

220
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.800
You have like a lot of those characters that kind of come into play.

221
00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.671
Bruce Wayne, Brad,

222
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:03.000
a lot of these guys and then brought them into the bat family basically to kind

223
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:06.690
of make Batman a worldwide concept. Uh, when he reached out to ghost maker,

224
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.940
it apparently didn't go well, right now, this is James Tinian,

225
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.220
throwing in new information that didn't exist before, right?

226
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.470
Because ghost maker didn't exist until this story.

227
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:15.660
So he's just kind of adding this stuff. And, uh,

228
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.460
and then it turned into when Dick Grayson was working for spiral as the elder of

229
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.430
that terrible run,

230
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.670
where he was a spy that he basically ended up looking around for ghost maker and

231
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:26.970
that most of the intelligence community considers him to be an urban legend.

232
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.900
But there are a few classified reports that Dick Grayson had read that showed a

233
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:34.350
kind of run in between the great 10 in China and ghost maker himself.

234
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.930
And it was one of these things that if you knew where to look,

235
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.540
you could find evidence that ghost maker was real. Right.

236
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.420
But it's one of these things where he would basically show up into a city for

237
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:43.290
about a year or so,

238
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.800
he would eliminate all the crime and then he would leave before anybody ever

239
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:48.330
really even knew he was there or,

240
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.780
or without anybody ever even knowing he was ever there. Right. So like, it's,

241
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.290
he's just that wildly capable, you know? And so this guy is, you know,

242
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:59.460
very much lives up to his namesake. He's a ghost, right? This guy is a Phantom.

243
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.390
Now the funny thing about this, and as I was reading this, this screams,

244
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.390
the winter soldier from ed Rue bakers, captain America, right now,

245
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:08.580
it's not the first time we've ever seen anything like that. Right.

246
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.680
Ed Brewbaker was not the very first person to ever take a character or

247
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.740
previously died and then brought them back.

248
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.020
And somebody who had been used for espionage, right.

249
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.930
Eddie Baker was not the first person to ever do that. Right.

250
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:22.710
So before people show up to this, those DC who's stealing from Marvel, I guess.

251
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:22.951
I mean,

252
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:25.230
if you consider ed Brewbaker to be the only person who ever do that in the

253
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:28.830
history of literature, ah, fin. Sure. I guess, but that's not true. So, uh,

254
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:32.610
so it, it kind of, it reminded me of that in a lot of different ways. Right.

255
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.280
But the cool thing about this is you end up picking back up with Barbara Gordon

256
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.400
and you have Sandra Kane. Who's basically talking to her and saying, Hey, look,

257
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:40.620
you know, we don't, we're here. The side of this happened.

258
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:44.040
But the only evidence we have in terms of where they went is a plant on the wall

259
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.310
that basically spells Arkham. And that's how we know where he took him.

260
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.080
The poison Ivy plants what's left of poison. Ivy is basically just telling them,

261
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.130
like, go to Arkham right now. From there,

262
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.650
we switched back over to argument itself and you've got clown Hunter.

263
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:59.410
You've got Batman and Batman, of course already being awake.

264
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.620
When Harley Quinn wakes up a town, Hunter's like, Hey, like, okay,

265
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.200
what's going on here? Right. And of course, once she starts talking to him,

266
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.450
Kahn Hunter gets, right? It's on, you know, don't talk to me.

267
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.210
But Batman basically says, this is all a test, right?

268
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:14.470
This is a test by ghost maker to prove that you clown Hunter or every bit as bad

269
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:18.580
as he believes you are that if you give a criminal, the means to commit a crime,

270
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.940
that's what they will do because criminals are bad people and criminals commit

271
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:24.760
crimes that they cannot be redeemed. They cannot be fixed.

272
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.970
They cannot become better people that they just don't change.

273
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.860
Ghost maker is Gregory House from house MD. People don't change.

274
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.280
But you know, clown Hunter kind of seems to live up to this expectation.

275
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.980
Did he ends up discovering a couple of these sores, that clown, I'm sorry,

276
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.240
that ghost maker had left forum.

277
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.270
And then when Batman is like pleading with them, say, no, like, do not do this.

278
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.670
If you do this, you will prove ghost maker ripe.

279
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.980
The response to clown Hunter is I don't really care. Right?

280
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:49.780
She was there the night the jumper killed my parents.

281
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.420
And so even if it proves the point of ghost maker, I don't care.

282
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.320
I clown Hunter am going to kill Harley Clint. But with that being said, guys,

283
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.490
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

284
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.980
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

285
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:02.230
button to become part of the Rob poor. If you guys enjoyed this video,

286
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.110
make sure you drop a like, and I will catch you all later.
