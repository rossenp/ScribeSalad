4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.060
All right. What's going on guys.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.010
<v 1>Is Rob and we are picking back up again with, uh, swords of X.</v>

6
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:19.760
And in this video, we're focusing on the return of mad Jim Jasper's.

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.850
Yes we are. But before we get into that,

8
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.610
we are going to pick up with a couple of little fun things that happen here.

9
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:26.660
A couple of little small things.

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.180
The first part of this focuses on explanation number 14,

11
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.830
but this is really just exposition.

12
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.520
And the reality is we don't really learn a lot that we didn't already know

13
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.490
before, but there are a couple of things that we do pick up here.

14
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.000
The first of these things really comes with the twilight's sword and the

15
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.700
twilight's sword. Of course, as it's being wielded by apocalypse,

16
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:47.990
his wife Genesis is a weapon that's part of the 10 of swords or exosomes event,

17
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.201
right?

18
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.290
It's one of the things that the forces of Morocco had to gather in order to

19
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.590
fight against the forces of Kakowa. But as I was reading this,

20
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.800
and as yesterday was basically kind of retelling this origin of certain kind,

21
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:59.420
at least as it existed on ACARA,

22
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.870
which is originally what her COA and the Rocco were before they were split into,

23
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.240
we of course get the same expedition that we always did, right?

24
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:09.020
The Twilight sword of the enemy tore the world asunder and what was one became

25
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.440
two. And I started thinking about this right now. It says after that happened,

26
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.670
that all the enemies of amaranth basically poured into the world by poured into

27
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:19.580
the main Marvel universe, right? So they came from this other place, right?

28
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:22.660
Just this, this kind of other, other dimension. And it led to him, you know,

29
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.550
it led to them invading the world and in seeking to capture it for the most

30
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.550
part. Now, of course, as a result of that, you saw two things happening.

31
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.810
You saw apocalypse leading the mutant population against the forces of Amazon.

32
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.050
And then you saw what was basically the, the white sword, right? So this,

33
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.041
you know, external,

34
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:39.950
this immortal mutant who basically has the ability to resurrect, you know,

35
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.370
him and his 100 soldiers every single morning to kind of fight the fight again,

36
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.760
that they went through the portal alongside with, uh, alongside apocalypse,

37
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.790
his wife and the various mutants who were there for the purpose of trying to

38
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:51.650
fight these forces back right now, of course,

39
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.170
we know that just by virtue of the stories that we've read,

40
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.180
that the promise apocalypse made to his wife,

41
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.600
as he would prepare the world as a place that could hold itself against the

42
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:00.321
forces of ament,

43
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.680
which is why he's always maintained this kind of a survival of the fittest

44
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:04.461
mentality, right?

45
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:08.060
This is something that you can find in our video that we did on the new origin

46
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.740
of apocalypse in our X-Men playlist,

47
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.830
where you can get totally caught up on the Xs swords event where the tennis

48
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.440
courts event. But the more I thought about this, and this is what's so cool.

49
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.740
The more I thought about this was specifically the twilight's water, the enemy,

50
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.410
and how his forces, how about the forces, you know, once it's Twilight,

51
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.820
what's this Twilight sort of merged,

52
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.060
but the enemy basically escaped that like all these forces came pouring out.

53
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.000
If I'm a betting, man, I think that's sorter. And here's the reason why,

54
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.400
if you go back and you look at journey into mystery,

55
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.680
number 97 from way back in the day,

56
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.090
what you had was a story whereby Odin ended up facing off against Cerner.

57
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.850
And this led to Cerner being locked inside the earth.

58
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.380
Now with some future point in time,

59
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.560
and we're not really told when Cerner managed to get out right. Sorta escaped,

60
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.570
and then just kind of showed up somewhere along the line.

61
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.230
This is back in the day when Marvel wouldn't necessarily provide these clear cut

62
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:54.440
explanations in terms of how a leads into B instead, it was just,

63
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.960
you get the end of a, and then you're in the beat. And then we don't,

64
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.980
you'll really get a lot of connecting of the dots that's made Chris Claremont

65
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:00.641
style of writing.

66
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.540
So landmark was because of the fact that he did that for 17 years, right?

67
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:04.781
There was,

68
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:08.080
it was a huge thing to kind of keep the story narrative going and everything

69
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.770
tied into everything else. But if it's sort of managed to escape earth,

70
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.020
then this was, this would explain the earth kind of, you know,

71
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.500
this land proximity to why it just happen to be where sort of emerged from,

72
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.890
but the reason why I say him and nobody else is because as you guys know,

73
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.440
the main weapon of sir is a Twilight sword.

74
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.650
And so it makes perfect sense that Cerner basically emerged with a Twilight

75
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.350
sword and then went and did his thing, right? And then from there, you know,

76
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.530
all these enemy forces came pouring out and who in the heck knows where it was

77
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.350
that they came from the long and short of this is that with that bit of an

78
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.700
explanation being offered there,

79
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.720
that Genesis has kind of emerged here as a person who is in effect the leader

80
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.760
of, of seemingly everybody right now,

81
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.130
initially she dawned the golden helm of annihilation,

82
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.210
which we talked about before,

83
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.450
because it was what would allow her to control the forces of amaranth.

84
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.260
When again, we're not really given a lot of indication here. What,

85
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:55.870
what she really points here is this notion that the forces of amaranth are

86
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.740
effectively leaderless and that the individual who wields the golden helm is the

87
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:00.970
person who can control them.

88
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.780
And so it stands to reason that if Cerner was locked inside earth by Odin and

89
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.050
Cerner basically formed this private army for himself and the forces of

90
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.550
amaranth, and then somewhere along the line,

91
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.590
sort of escaped that he would just leave them all behind.

92
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.060
And so without any real leader,

93
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.150
the individual who dons the golden helm basically takes over that role.

94
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.820
The problem with this is that the golden home cannot be controlled.

95
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.090
And so just because you put it on and just because the golden helm will allow

96
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.780
you to control the forces of MF does not mean you can control the golden house.

97
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.500
And that's where she says that the will of the golden home is now her will and

98
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:32.800
the golden helm wanting to get into Precoa. And so she does as well.

99
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.740
And that's why she's basically a villain here because her stance is we're going

100
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.090
to end up fighting each other to the death.

101
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.960
And her whole goal is to win the contest or at least for a Rocco to win the

102
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:42.760
contest so they can invade cacoa.

103
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.560
So that's the whole motivation behind her character.

104
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.180
And that's how I think sorta ties into all this stuff, but for the, the,

105
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:50.940
the goodie stuff here, but the, the good little tidbit here,

106
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.750
this is when we pick up with Jim Jasper's cause I feel like that's what you guys

107
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.480
really want to see, right? You guys really, really, really want to see this.

108
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:00.030
So here's a cool thing that happens here right off the bat.

109
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.640
Let me pick up with the crooked market and you've got Jim Jasper's right.

110
00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:05.280
And it's basically telling his guys like, be super quick, right?

111
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.220
Like Saturday and will not tolerate us missing so much as a single grain of

112
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:08.790
salt, right?

113
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.700
The crooked market are the ones who are supplying the various foods,

114
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.890
things like that for this great, big, huge feast.

115
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.270
And this feast held in honor of the various people who are here that are

116
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:20.400
fighting. Now, this is not uncommon. And in fact,

117
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:24.300
this is really Jonathan Hickman borrowing from days gone by in older years,

118
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:28.500
it was common that when you had a war or conflict going on between two

119
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:30.540
territories, it was designed to settle a dispute.

120
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.140
And the conflict was being held in the location of a,

121
00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:35.100
of a non-partisan third party.

122
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.670
That third party would actually honor both groups and basically bring forth our

123
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:41.280
champions, all feast knowing full well,

124
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.350
they were probably going to kill it in the morning,

125
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.630
but that was just kind of the way that things were done back then, right.

126
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.380
There was a lot of emphasis put on decorum and really the ceremonial aspect of

127
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.510
what it meant to get involved in a conflict. Not understand.

128
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.740
There's no love loss here,

129
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.530
just because they're all sharing dinner here does not mean they're going to be

130
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:59.930
good friends, you know, even have things like, like you've got cipher,

131
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:01.490
who's out there kind of minding his own business.

132
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.430
You've got storm who looks like she's kind of flirting with a new bus.

133
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.190
It looks like a new bus anyway. And then of course you also have Wolverine.

134
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:09.950
Who's just kind of being standoffish because this Wolverine and that's what he

135
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:11.480
does, right. He's just a standoffish guy,

136
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.650
but the doors officially open the banners basically fall in the hall and then

137
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.380
it's everybody make your way in. And as they get in here,

138
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.750
it's actually an incredible sight to behold.

139
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.390
And that was one of the things about Saturday, right? She was nothing.

140
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:27.230
If not somebody who liked everyone to know just how good she had it,

141
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.380
but you end up getting this really cool situation where we're basically

142
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.850
introduced to Jasper's right,

143
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.850
where Jasper's is officially recognized and declared here. And it's like,

144
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:38.630
all of this is brought to us by Jim Jasper's of the crooked market, right?

145
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.620
We also get lady Roma of the Fe, you get best. Bereday the colony queen of the,

146
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:45.320
the Hoff hive or the hot hive, whatever you want to call it. The famine,

147
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.020
who's basically the, the region of the former kingdom of dry door.

148
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.390
And then Jim Jasper's kind of comments and says, well,

149
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.010
you may not be welcome into dry door,

150
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.010
but you are always welcome to my crooked market. Right? If you come there,

151
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.200
you can find virtually anything that you want.

152
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:59.540
But here's the funny thing about this right here. So here's,

153
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.990
what's so crazy about this. And it's something super easy to overlook here.

154
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.910
Jim Jasper's is acting incredibly casual here. He's like, yeah. I mean,

155
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:08.330
come to the crooked market if you have to,

156
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.510
but let's not be naive about this guy.

157
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.340
Jim Jaspers is a guy who was so powerful that his alternate reality counterpart

158
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.970
was a threat to the entire multi-verse. They had to kill his universe.

159
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.490
They had to wipe his universe out in order to save the multi-verse.

160
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.850
And he was still weaker than this version of Jim Jasper's here.

161
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.970
This guy is a multi-vessel force. That's all this guy is right.

162
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:31.730
This guy is just death incarnate. There are very few things,

163
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:35.120
very precious few things that could stand in the face of Jim Jasper's.

164
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.150
Now this guy is ridiculously overpower.

165
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.330
Now how his power compares to Saturday. I'm not really sure.

166
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.870
And I would really say just pump circumstance and just being,

167
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:49.190
being polite here is the only thing that's keeping Jim Jaspers from just being

168
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:50.120
like, you know what? I'm bored.

169
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.060
Let's turn everybody into cupcakes and then stomp on him. Right?

170
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:55.370
I feel like that's the only thing that's stopping him from doing that.

171
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.460
Or just waving his hand and turning everybody into blobs of goo.

172
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.510
And that's the end of them.

173
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.770
No one here could stop Jim Jasper's if he got bored and decided to kill

174
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:05.750
everybody, that's kind of what I'm telling you here. Right?

175
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.980
That's how powerful this guy is. That's how powerful Jim Jasper's is.

176
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:13.430
And that's why it's so incredibly exciting to see him back because I feel like

177
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.560
things are gonna pop off in this place. Now,

178
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.830
the other funny thing that happens here is you've got Brian Brodick right.

179
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.400
And Brian Braddock is here. Just kind of, you know, doing his thing and,

180
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.020
and just sort of chilling out and Wolverine walks up on them and he's like,

181
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:26.930
look, man, you had an opportunity to basically stop all this, right?

182
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.400
Like when it's Saturday and took you to her,

183
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:30.710
it took her to do her bed chambers and you guys were going to do it. You know,

184
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:32.240
you guys were going to do the thing, you know, you're going to,

185
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:34.790
you're going to knock boots. Like you could have just gone through with it.

186
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.950
Right. And then like, none of this would've happened in the first place.

187
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.570
You know? He's like, well, I'm a married man. And he's like, well,

188
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:39.890
here's the thing though, man. Like, you know,

189
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.180
if you really cared about all of us,

190
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.140
you would've taken one for the team is what I would've done. You know,

191
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:47.060
I would've taken one for the team and just called it a day.

192
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.390
It's kind of a funny little thing. Obviously, no respectable man would do that.

193
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.140
But you know, Wolverine is not really a respectable guy. Right?

194
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:57.180
And so what he really does here is he kind of looks at Brian Brodick is the

195
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:59.160
reason for this whole problem. He's like, you know,

196
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.290
I'm not really going to be watching anybody out there.

197
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.410
Who's who's most likely going to die. Instead, I'm going to be watching you.

198
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.850
I'm going to be keeping my eye on you.

199
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:08.880
And I'm going to know that with all the people who die from cacoa,

200
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.090
if any end up dying tomorrow at all, they will all have died because of you.

201
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.420
Now, the other part of this comes with Gordon and Eliana Rasputin.

202
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.020
Now Gorgon is a guy that we haven't really covered too much in Marvel comics.

203
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:19.350
In fact,

204
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.920
I think the only time we really offered any measure of explanation on him was

205
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:24.270
during the events of secret empire,

206
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:26.970
because he was part of the hydrate inner circle. And so we could do with a bear,

207
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:28.380
a bit of explanation here,

208
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.290
the idea behind Gorgon's powers and the reason why he wears the mask,

209
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.140
the way he does is because he essentially has the powers of Medusa.

210
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.480
If you were to take his mask off anywhere to look at you,

211
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.380
you would turn to stone.

212
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.990
And so he wears that mask in order to prevent that from happening,

213
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.360
the problem with this is it takes away his eyesight.

214
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.320
And so Gorgon is a guy who is by all standards of measurement blind,

215
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.030
even if only because he chooses to be.

216
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.690
But he's also probably one of the best fighters in all of Marvel colleagues.

217
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.220
And when I say all of Marvel comics, I mean,

218
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.450
all of Marvel comics like this guy could give almost anybody a run for their

219
00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:59.430
money. And it doesn't really matter who it is.

220
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.330
The other part of this is that with him and magic sizing up, everybody here,

221
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.780
you've also got ISCA. Now, ISCA, as a lot of the guys that you may recall,

222
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.140
she's a person whose mutant power is that she can't lose. And so if,

223
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:12.360
for example, she, you know, she's part of this whole great, big,

224
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:15.200
huge tournament, Newton power, you know, because you can't lose,

225
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:16.640
is that things going the way they are.

226
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.460
It's obvious that the forces of Gacaca are going to win.

227
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.490
She turned against the forces of Morocco. It's just the nature of her powers.

228
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.350
Now what Marvel doesn't really explain here.

229
00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:27.440
And this is the problem you have with a power. That's this ambiguous,

230
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.950
is it passive or is it active when it comes to powers and more were comics,

231
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.520
you have active and passive powers. And even in DC, it works the exact same way.

232
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.760
So something like Superman's frost breath, that's an act of power,

233
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.370
but he actually has to blow frost at somebody.

234
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.370
But something like Wolverines healing factor is a passive power.

235
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.190
He doesn't have to do anything. It just automatically happens.

236
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.880
And so we don't know if that's the case with her or if it's active or as

237
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:53.540
passive. We don't really know. We don't know if like, you know, she allies with,

238
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.410
with Precoa, I'm sorry, Colby,

239
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:58.370
because she's foreseen that a Rocco's going to win. No,

240
00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:00.080
she allies with Precoa or if she,

241
00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:03.140
if she ends up turning against the Rocco and allies with Precoa because our

242
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:06.350
mutant power tells her Cracow was going the winter. We don't really know Marvel.

243
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:07.850
Hasn't really taken the time to explain it.

244
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.610
It may be one of these things where Hickman kind of gives us a bit of a tease

245
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.120
and we don't find out how our powers work for 100 issues. Right.

246
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.260
That's entirely possible.

247
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.530
But the cool thing about this is that because they're aware of [inaudible]

248
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:22.190
ability, the question is which side does she favor that she favor her left side,

249
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:24.410
her right side, deep do her powers go, right?

250
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.060
That's the question of Borgen and magic.

251
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.610
And so what they ended up doing is basically kind of, you know,

252
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.330
offering a bit of small talk, obviously giving her a little bit of a hard time.

253
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.360
And then as a test, they dropped at the same time.

254
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.830
And because she's ambidextrous,

255
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.770
she catches them both and it doesn't drop one drop of it. That's so I was like,

256
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:42.830
okay, like, of course she's ambidextrous. If she can't lose,

257
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.020
she has all the skills she needs to succeed.

258
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.900
And so she doesn't really favor her left or right side and fighting.

259
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.870
And so she doesn't really have a definitive weakness in terms of her fighting

260
00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:51.920
style and turn,

261
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.080
she pulls the same stunt on magic in and Gordon and the magic opens a portal

262
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.360
that caused them to fall back through. And then of course it's like, you know,

263
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.650
we caught them. So again, it's one of these cool things where these foes,

264
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.740
these various fighters are learning a lot about each other because understand

265
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.920
this is the first time all of them are meeting each other, which is kind of,

266
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.540
it was a really, really cool moment here.

267
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.790
It's the first time that they're all meeting each other.

268
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.590
And so when you have this bit of a discussion here,

269
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.070
you actually end up having a having storm who approaches the horseman death.

270
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.500
And the two of them all start talking yellow of them kind of have this great,

271
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:23.050
big, huge conversation. Now there is a bit of a tease.

272
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:26.470
And so far as maybe storm is kind of romantically attracted to them.

273
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.500
Maybe it's this kind of devil may care or a bit of a mystery or intrigue,

274
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.910
but one thing to understand about storm.

275
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.760
She's not some wide-eyed girl who just stepped out into the world.

276
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.460
She's not naive, right? She's not a naive person.

277
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.910
And so while she is kind of entertaining this possibility that there could be a

278
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:43.630
romance between her and the horseman death, she basically ends at fast. Right?

279
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:45.790
And she's like, I've, I've danced with your kind before.

280
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.680
And I was curious what kind of person you were,

281
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.880
because I'm going to be fighting you.

282
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.130
And now that I know what kind of person you are, I know that one,

283
00:12:51.131 --> 00:12:53.500
you're an honorable and respectable person, but two,

284
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.810
I know that I wouldn't really have any qualms with killing you.

285
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.590
And so from there,

286
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.920
you kind of picks up with Saturday and speaking directly with, with Wolverine,

287
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.380
right. And Wolverine is really just kind of, right?

288
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.020
He's just walking around like a big grumpy, lucky he usually does,

289
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:07.750
but a little grumpier than normal and Saturday, and kind of asked him like,

290
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:10.690
you know, I know when a mind is burdened, what's all what's on your mind, right?

291
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.460
What are you thinking? And at the end of the day, like he,

292
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:14.590
he kind of holds off and having a conversation,

293
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.870
but she kind of pushes him products and he says fine, right?

294
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.460
It doesn't have to be like this.

295
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.860
All you have to do is take whatever it is that you want.

296
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.310
And then we can end this here. There's no need for some great big ceremony.

297
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.890
None of this is a necessity. You're playing a game.

298
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:31.060
You're being awfully cavalier with all of our lives, for your own entertainment.

299
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:34.150
Now for Saturday, Ann's part she's in her rights to do this, right?

300
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.970
The conflict between curricula and the conflict between a Rocco,

301
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.880
happy to come up on her doorstep. And that's the nature of the beast.

302
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.880
When two people are fighting and their fight takes them into somebody's house,

303
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.090
they don't get to dictate how the person who owns that house allows them to

304
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:49.090
fight. They fall under the rules of the person inside that house. Right?

305
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.180
A man doesn't walk into another man's home and start telling him what's what,

306
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.590
that's just the way it is. Right? And so,

307
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.540
because their conflict led to them to this point,

308
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.790
she's the one that gets to call and gets to call the rules. Right?

309
00:13:57.791 --> 00:13:59.440
And so that's just kind of the way that goes.

310
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.230
And the response you really gives here is I said,

311
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:05.980
exactly what I meant by death is the great change. Everything dies, right?

312
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:09.070
One of you guys are going to die here and everything's going to change after if

313
00:14:09.071 --> 00:14:11.560
anything, I'm just curious what it is that's going to happen.

314
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.110
And the responsible will reign is those are some famous,

315
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:18.100
last words pops his claws and stab Saturday. Would that being said, guys,

316
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.530
we're gonna bring this video to an end. If you are new here to commerce,

317
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:20.921
explain,

318
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:23.110
