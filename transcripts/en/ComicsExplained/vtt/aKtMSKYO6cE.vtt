00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>All right, what's going on guys. This is Rob. And, um,</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.480
if those of you guys who are new to the channel here, uh,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.200
it is Thanksgiving week. And that means that I give my guys the week off. Right.

4
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.050
I give them time to go spend time with their families and all that kind of stuff

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.810
because of the job that I worked at before I was a YouTuber,

6
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.250
I usually had to work on Thanksgiving.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.010
And so I know what it's like to have to give that day up. Uh,

8
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.680
and I know what it's like to not be able to have that week to go spend with your

9
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.920
friends and family. Right? So because of that, on the main comments,

10
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:30.150
explain channel here, which is where I have all my staff basically working, uh,

11
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.140
they're going to be getting the week off,

12
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.510
which means that we're not really gonna be uploading any videos this week.

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.230
The only exception to that will be on Wednesday for a Patrion,

14
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:41.370
which is the vs video and Tuesday for Patrion, which is the uncensored video.

15
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:46.130
And this part, I think is the conclusion of Punisher max, uh, the slavers,

16
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.320
I think he's the one that we're finishing up. Um,

17
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.870
and so those videos are going to go on Patrion, but aside from that,

18
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.130
where it it's going to take the week off here, the next update here is discord.

19
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.370
Um, a lot of the guys who were familiar with the discord server and who've been

20
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:01.010
around the server for awhile, know a couple of different things.

21
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.820
The first thing is that the number of channels that we had was really just kind

22
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:07.850
of absurd, but between voice channels and, and we had channels for everything.

23
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:08.960
So we had like Marvel channels.

24
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.210
Then we had like X-Men channels and all that kind of stuff.

25
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.390
And the result was that we ended up expanding too far, too fast, right?

26
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.060
We were running our discourse server. Like we had 20,000 people.

27
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.250
When in reality, we only have about 5,000,

28
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:22.190
really about 5,200 at the time that we're recording this video.

29
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
And so what we did is we brought in a guy named Trent, who is the brother of a,

30
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:27.980
another, uh, I'm sorry,

31
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:31.220
a moderator for the discourse over Derek and had him basically comb through the

32
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:33.890
whole thing. And Trent gave us a lot of really good advice and said,

33
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.000
here's what you should condense.

34
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.040
Here's what you should do with all these different, different things.

35
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.710
And so that's what we did. Um, if you go to the discord server,

36
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:43.790
now you'll find an updated FAQ section and updated rule section. Uh,

37
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.780
you'll have to verify if you want to actually communicate on the discourse

38
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.080
servers.

39
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.300
So that way we can avoid people who are going in and trolling different things

40
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:53.270
like that and causing problems. Um, but you know, it,

41
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.760
it's one of these things where it's designed to kind of clean the whole place

42
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.610
up, right? Did it to kind of do a lot of house cleaning work, um,

43
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.220
as far as all the old channels that are not there anymore,

44
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.890
they are not deleted instead they're archived.

45
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.310
And what that means is that as the channel grows or as a discord server grows,

46
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.370
we can bring those channels back and all that chat history will be there.

47
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.340
So it's not gone forever, but it's not lost forever at the moment.

48
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.730
It's just down in the staff section where nobody can see it. Um, but yeah,

49
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.020
it's designed to clean the whole thing up.

50
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.750
So if you're familiar with the server, go check it out. Um, it's,

51
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:22.790
it's far more cleaned up than it was before,

52
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:25.220
and it's a lot easier to navigate so far. Everybody's loved it,

53
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.430
which is always a good thing. Um, and for those of you guys who are new,

54
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:30.980
you'll find a permanent link down in the description, uh,

55
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.160
to be able to access a discord server and hang out with me because every Friday

56
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.660
I do a, uh,

57
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.960
I do a Q and a section with you guys when I do a Q and a session where I just

58
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.060
talked to you all for an hour and a half, two hours,

59
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.350
usually about an hour or something like that.

60
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.920
And answer questions with you guys. Um, sometimes I give away Rob core rings.

61
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.140
Uh, we also have a bunch of different games and events, right?

62
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:51.170
We have quizzes that take place. We do versus battles on the discourse server.

63
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.990
So you guys can battle it out over who ends. Um,

64
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:57.230
we are kicking around a few other ideas and we'll actually make those known as

65
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:00.490
we get closer to when we're going to release those, there was different, um,

66
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.150
you know, engaging activities and so on. But, uh,

67
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.970
but that's where the discord server is right now. Now the final update here,

68
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:10.540
and this is the one that you guys are probably here for the selling of Rob court

69
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.290
rings. Um, I am officially selling Rob court rings,

70
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.810
and I know I've been I've, I'm probably a little late on this,

71
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.880
to be honest with you guys, I probably should have done this years ago,

72
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.440
but the biggest problem that I had was finding a way to sell rubber core rings

73
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.750
and keep up with demand because in years past,

74
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.550
if I had announced that Rog court rings were for sale,

75
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.000
I would have gotten hundreds of orders, right? Hundreds and thousands of orders.

76
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.450
And that would be a little unreasonable to try to keep up with. So, uh,

77
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.170
so if you guys are interested, Rob core rings are basically, uh, you know,

78
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.020
little literally rings that you wear. And in fact, I don't have mine.

79
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.710
I gave it to a fan Andrew when I met him for lunch the other day. But, um,

80
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.420
these are rings that you,

81
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.940
where they basically identify you as being part of the Robb courtroom, right.

82
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.280
So much by being part of the Robb court. Um,

83
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.770
I'm also gonna be having t-shirts stuff like that if you guys want to partake in

84
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:58.000
that, but, um, these rings are going to be sold, uh,

85
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.710
on a limited quantity, right? So, um, I only have sizes seven, eight, nine, 10,

86
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.170
11, and 13. I do not have size 12.

87
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.050
The place that makes my rings are currently sold out of size 12.

88
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.630
So as soon as those become available, I'll update the store.

89
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.140
But if you check the link down in the description right now, you'll find rod,

90
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.010
port rings are for sale. And, uh, and yeah, so once they're sold out,

91
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:19.780
you guys will have to wait until I update the store,

92
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.480
make another announcement or something like that. And, uh,

93
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.760
I'll let you guys know, you know, when those rings are available again.

94
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.640
So I imagine some of you guys are probably just going to hover around the store

95
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:30.250
every couple of days to see if it updates or not. Um,

96
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.530
I'm probably going to do this for, for the next little while,

97
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.190
maybe on like a weekly or biweekly basis. Uh, and just gonna, you know,

98
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.450
get you guys a bunch of rings.

99
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.690
I know a lot of you guys are sort of chomping at the bit to get your hands on

100
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:44.080
some. So, um, so yeah, I just want to make this update video,

101
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.130
let you guys know what's going on,

102
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.940
but you guys know how things are progressing and, uh, yeah. So anyway.

103
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.980
<v 1>Just watching guys, please</v>

104
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.640
[inaudible].
