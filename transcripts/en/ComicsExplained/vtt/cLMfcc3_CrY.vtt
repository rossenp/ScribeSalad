4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.360
What's going on guys. This is Ryan.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.170
<v 1>And we are covering tales from the dark multiverse.</v>

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.980
It's kind of surprising that DC still releasing these, but at the same time,

7
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.400
I'm kind of not surprised because they were just so fricking cool and it kind of

8
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:25.370
sucked. The DC stopped doing it for a time, you know, but this is a cool one.

9
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.500
The next one we get after this is actually flashpoint.

10
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:30.140
So I'm really excited to see what this has in store. Now,

11
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.710
for those of you guys who are not familiar with tales from a dark multi-verse,

12
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.320
a lot of you guys are familiar with like the, the dark nights metal event,

13
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.050
right? The idea that you have the multi-verse and DC comics.

14
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.570
And then on the opposite side, you have the dark multi-verse,

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.940
which is basically worlds that are not supposed to exist,

16
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.760
worlds that are born from like nightmares and things like that.

17
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.760
And so tales of the dark multiverse what's designed to build on that.

18
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.390
And it was designed to basically give us stories involving versions of Batman

19
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:54.380
from the dark multiverse,

20
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.590
just these really terrible and twisted versions of his character.

21
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.980
And so what this does is this initially starts out by kind of giving us the

22
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.710
typical origin of Batman and the way that we normally expect, right,

23
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.620
in the sense that you've got Bruce Wayne, who's alongside his parents,

24
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.160
Thomas and Martha, after seeing the, the mask of Zorro in the process,

25
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.520
they're basically his parents were shot to death in crime alley by judge Hill.

26
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.860
And then Bruce Wayne basically goes on to travel the world,

27
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.800
learn all kinds of different skills and then come back to Gotham as Batman.

28
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.120
That's the way it normally works.

29
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.840
The way this works is that it wasn't just Bruce Thomas and Martha.

30
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.780
It was also Thomas Elliot and his parents. Now,

31
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.610
for those of you guys who don't know who Thomas Elliot is,

32
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.400
Thomas Elliot made his debut in a story that was really,

33
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:33.140
really awesome called Batman hush.

34
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.350
But this was basically a story where hush popped up out of nowhere and

35
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:39.740
essentially just like turned all of Batman's villains or really kind of took all

36
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.920
his villains and pit them against Batman and even some of his allies. Right.

37
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:46.490
And it was cool stuff like Superman falls under the control of poison Ivy.

38
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.940
It's just these amazing ways to just kind of moving characters around and in a

39
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.580
way that you don't normally see, and it was literally Batman,

40
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:55.730
just running the gauntlet. It was, it was nuts. It's an amazing story.

41
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.770
I think it's like 12 issues long or something like that.

42
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.040
And so what this does is it basically tells us that in the aftermath of Bruce

43
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.120
Wayne's parents dying,

44
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.570
that the Elliotts were the one who took in Bruce instead of Alfred.

45
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.010
And that as time went on,

46
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.150
Bruce became more and more disconnected and fell deeper and deeper into madness,

47
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:12.950
right. Basically began to kind of lose his mind.

48
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.490
And so the result of this is that we ended up picking up some years later and

49
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:18.500
Gotham city is wholly different.

50
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.520
Now instead of Gotham city being one of the mini cities among the United States,

51
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.490
it's now a city state is independent of the United States.

52
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.400
Gotham has us on precedent. It's got us on defense contractors.

53
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:31.850
It really is its own country. And you have people who play different roles here,

54
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.690
right? The person who's in charge of Gotham's defense contracting is Jason Todd.

55
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.680
The attorney general of Gotham is Harvey dent. You know, the,

56
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:41.910
the founding families, the entrepreneur, and the, the philanthropist, the,

57
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.540
the kind of big time financial guy outside of, you know,

58
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.090
the one who runs Wayne enterprises is Oswald cobble pot,

59
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.830
but really Gotham's first family,

60
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.880
the richest individuals in Gotham are essentially Thomas Elliot and Talia Al

61
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.060
Google knows a little bit of importance that I kind of want to impress upon you

62
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:58.190
guys here. Natalia algal, as you guys know,

63
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:01.540
is the biological mother of Damian Wayne. And in the main DC universe,

64
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.420
it was Talia and Bruce who ended up having Damien right now,

65
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.350
this the means by which Damien was conceived are questionable at best.

66
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.070
But the idea behind this is that Talia basically procreated with Bruce.

67
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.290
And this instance she's with Thomas Elliot.

68
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.770
Now the motivation behind that will actually become a little more apparent as

69
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.590
time goes on in terms of why she's here. But it's one of these little,

70
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.400
one of these interesting things where it we're essentially Thomas Elliot is the

71
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:28.540
one who's basically running Wayne enterprises when enterprises effectively fell

72
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.180
to him. Now, how that happened, we'll find out here in a second.

73
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.450
But the funny thing about this is that the reason why Talia is currently with

74
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:37.930
Thomas Elliot is because she's still the one who runs a league of assassins that

75
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:39.610
hasn't really changed. She killed her father,

76
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:41.410
took his place as she's the one who runs the show,

77
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.220
but the league of assassins serves as a means by which Thomas Elliot became a

78
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:48.520
Senator, right? So using power, using information, probably money,

79
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.490
different things like that. They ended up securing his place as a Senator.

80
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.150
Now we also end up getting is that we're initially our first inclination here is

81
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.040
to like the wealthy and the powerful of Gotham.

82
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.980
We end up finding out that things are a lot more dire than they are than they

83
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.120
initially appear. What you have here is very much a kind of czarist society,

84
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.480
right?

85
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.420
Are bolstered revolution type of society in the sense that when you have the

86
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.810
bulk of the Bolshevik revolution in the early 19 hundreds in Russia,

87
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.080
what you had was extreme social inequality, right?

88
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:18.130
So you had the super wealthy in the form of the [inaudible] family and those

89
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.670
individuals they can sorted with. And then you had basically everybody else,

90
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:23.590
right, who was living in destitution in squalor.

91
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.920
And that's why the Bolshevik revolution happened is because you basically had

92
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:30.010
people who had just had enough and they revolted against the czars.

93
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.130
They killed the entire czar family, including Anastasia. And then of course,

94
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:34.870
we ended up getting Vanguard, communism,

95
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:36.970
which is a form of communism that never works.

96
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.180
But the idea behind this is that you basically have this extreme inequality.

97
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.790
So you have individuals who are revolting against the government,

98
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.050
and then you have the government itself,

99
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.630
which is kind of putting out this illusion to the general public.

100
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.530
Everything's fine.

101
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:50.320
And look at how great the upper class is doing and so on and so forth.

102
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.930
That's a familiar, we basically follow Elliot when he was called away.

103
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.740
And we pick up with Dr. Crane right now, Dr. Crane is normally scarecrow,

104
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.960
but this guy's here within Arkham asylum.

105
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.270
And the idea behind this is that within Arkham,

106
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.450
most of the traditional criminals that we're familiar with have largely just

107
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.450
kind of been locked away, becoming the characters that we know, for example,

108
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.470
Jarvis touch is not actually the mad Hatter instead.

109
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.350
He's just a crazy guy in a cell who sings these songs about the devil of ARCA,

110
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.100
right? This kind of rumor or the story about how there was at one point in time,

111
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.530
a force that just kind of moved around Arkham asylum.

112
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:22.540
At least it was put forward by Amadeus Arkham, right?

113
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:25.660
The guy who originally ran and established the, the asylum itself,

114
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.750
that it was just kind of this ghostly apparition that would move between the

115
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:31.060
walls and that kind of a thing, right. You know, it's,

116
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:33.970
it's kind of creepy and the way that it's done, but the reason why, uh,

117
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.940
Thomas Ellie has been called here is because Bruce Wayne has died.

118
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.150
And he's only the most recent in a series of deaths that have happened within

119
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.670
Arkham. And for the most part, it's just kind of being swept under the rug.

120
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.940
They can kind of be explained away, but in this instance, it can't right.

121
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:49.420
The indication here is that Bruce Wayne basically rolled over on his pillow and

122
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:52.200
suffocated himself. Right. Which is a little weird, but he's got the,

123
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.690
the autopsy scars and all that kind of stuff. And it's a little crazy, right?

124
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:57.980
Because Bruce Wayne is just dead.

125
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.560
And so what you end up getting here is this arrangement that,

126
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.820
that seems to have happened where you essentially had Dr. Crane working

127
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:09.190
alongside Thomas Elliot to kind of keep Bruce Wayne in a vegetative state that

128
00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:11.450
Bruce Wayne had basically been essentially, you know,

129
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:13.160
a vegetable for quite some time.

130
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.790
Now it's not really said explicitly on the nose, like, Hey reader,

131
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.270
I helped Thomas Elliot keep Bruce Wayne in a vegetative state so that Thomas

132
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.270
Elliot could take over the Wayne fortune and keep it right because of Bruce

133
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.220
Wayne just woke up and word got out. You know,

134
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.220
even if it somehow managed to leak out that Bruce Wayne is within argument

135
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.670
silent and he's lucid, and then people would be like, what's going on here?

136
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:34.070
They were started asking questions, right. And it would lead to a great, big,

137
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:37.520
huge debacle. And so keeping them off the grid basically kept things silent.

138
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.540
The other part of this though,

139
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.840
is that within the hand of Bruce Wayne is a ticket to the Mark of Zorro.

140
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.270
And that's why things are a little wonky here because it's kind of like,

141
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.860
we've never really seen this before now,

142
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.130
following that you end up having Dr. Crane as he leaves and basically comes

143
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:52.220
across the groundsman. Who's largely alluded to be the joker,

144
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.630
but then suddenly the lights kick off.

145
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.930
And that's when you end up having this kind of, of, you know, this, this,

146
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:59.480
this rhyme, this being given by Jarvis touch, what'd,

147
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:02.960
you kind of continues on in the darkness and where the janitor is kind of like,

148
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.210
okay, you know, the lights will kick back on here in a second. You know,

149
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.370
it was cool. It happened sometimes it's super late.

150
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:08.810
We get these rolling power outages.

151
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.140
It's not really that uncommon that the emergency lights kick on and like this

152
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:15.860
just horrifying looking Batman besiege that looks like hush.

153
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.630
If you became Batman just comes flying onto a onto Dr. Crane and just

154
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:23.150
seems to kill the guy. It's kind of nuts following that,

155
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.530
like Thomas Elliot bales, right.

156
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.410
He ends up getting out of there and getting on his helicopter and flying back to

157
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:30.290
what looks to be his penthouse apartment that you have this, that man figure,

158
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.870
just perched kind of looking at them when that happens.

159
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.230
A rocket shoots out of nowhere and takes a helicopter down. And when that,

160
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.090
when the helicopter crash in lands, you end up finding out that, that,

161
00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.410
that kind of lands among, you know,

162
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.260
we're gonna have all these rebels and so on and so forth.

163
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.480
But the rebels are basically led by Barbara Gordon.

164
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.260
And the reason why is because in the rise to Gotham becoming a city state,

165
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.710
that her father Jim Gordon was killed in the process. Now, again,

166
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.420
we're not given a whole lot of indication here.

167
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.090
If we just sort of use a little bit of a combination of common sense and a

168
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:57.980
little bit of, of just kind of guesswork.

169
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.130
We can largely assume that Gotham was any city just like any other.

170
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.960
And that something seems to have happened.

171
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.900
Gotham basically decided to become an independent city state,

172
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.260
somehow it was allowed. And that in turn led to commissioner Gordon,

173
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.200
possibly a handful of others becoming part of a resistance movement.

174
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.300
And in that process, Jim Gordon was killed.

175
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.930
Barbara took up the mantle in a stead and is basically been fighting ever since.

176
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.340
And so when that happens, of course,

177
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:22.850
you end up having what's more or less a Gotham city military come to sending on,

178
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.530
right. They kind of come to sitting on this thing,

179
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.950
but you also end up having Tim Drake. Who's here along with Cassandra Kane,

180
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.150
that these guys are more or less unified absent the idea of Batman, right.

181
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:35.240
But they're still there. And they still work as a singular group in the process,

182
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.600
you know, with the, the, the helicopter crash landing, you get, uh, Cassandra,

183
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.610
Katie get Tim Drake who basically show up here.

184
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.300
And then they're met by the arrival of one of the gray sons and the gray sun is

185
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:47.690
decreasing. Now it's kind of, it's kind of weird here because gray son,

186
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.930
there's actually a really cool concept of this character that we'll talk about

187
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:55.350
here in a second. But this guy lays waste to Tim Drake and Cassandra. I mean,

188
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.260
overcomes them like that. It's not even a, it's not even a fight.

189
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.240
It's not even a contest. And he asked him Drake, like,

190
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.030
do you really want to do this fight right now? Because if we do,

191
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.060
you're going to die. And Tim Drake is like, we'll fight, but not today.

192
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.440
And he basically ends up leaving. Now.

193
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:10.830
We ended up finding out that gray son and in really the gray sons themselves

194
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.581
seem to work,

195
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:15.030
or at least are heavily involved directly with the president of Gotham,

196
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:17.730
president Lincoln, March, which is a really interesting concept.

197
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:19.230
Given the new 52 Batman run.

198
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.930
The cool thing is that with the gray son being here, he's basically told,

199
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:25.590
like I was sitting here directly from the president because we need to keep an

200
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.360
eye on you. Right. We need to keep an eye on Gotham.

201
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.980
We have to keep all this stuff under control.

202
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.540
And it's one of the interesting things here,

203
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.050
because it's not the first time this has happened that other individuals out

204
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.570
there, right? Like attorney general Harvey dent was attacked.

205
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.210
The GA basically the Gotham city security force, right?

206
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.330
So like they're their paramilitary group. Captain flashed the ones who, uh,

207
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.070
the one who runs it is missing as well.

208
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.760
There were these clippings about the old Wayne murders that were found alongside

209
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.140
these individuals where at least I'm sorry, in a,

210
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.540
in a place where these individuals work when they went missing.

211
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.390
And so there's a kind of huge mystery going on here.

212
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.720
And that's why Thomas Elliot was secured by gray sun because it's kind of like

213
00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:59.820
the powerful of Gotham are vanishing.

214
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.450
We're here to grab you to make sure that doesn't happen to you now, from there,

215
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:05.190
they ended up of course, capturing Barbara Gordon.

216
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.140
And when Grayson starts interrogating her,

217
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.300
is this interesting thing where you kind of find out that, Hey,

218
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:12.210
like her people did not bring down the Airship. They don't really know who did,

219
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.860
but then Grayson basically drops the,

220
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:16.050
the idea of like these powerful people are missing.

221
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:18.150
These news clippings are there. And then she's like, Oh,

222
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.090
it's the Wayne murders that a reason why those guys are going missing. Okay,

223
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.440
well, let's start to make a lot more sense.

224
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.540
Then I'm going to give you an easy clue here, right?

225
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.900
And this will put you back on the path of actually finding out what's going on.

226
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.280
What she tells him is that the Airship of Thomas Elliot was most likely shot

227
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:36.150
down by Lux Corp surface to air R I M 72 Raptor missile.

228
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.210
And you cannot access those in the United States. Instead,

229
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.410
the only way to get those is outside of the U S and the idea is that you can

230
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:47.370
only find them in Santa Prisca and that several containers of quote unquote

231
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:51.480
structured grade lumber from Santa Prisca arrived in Gotham Harbor last week.

232
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.840
And the person who received those is a defense contractor of Gotham.

233
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.140
It's Jason Todd. And so she basically pointed the finger and says,

234
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.560
we don't know who shot you down, but it looks like it was probably Jason Todd.

235
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.110
So you may want to go and investigate him. And then she's like,

236
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:06.720
as far as this assassination attempt that was made on your life,

237
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.570
I wouldn't really worry about that because what it looks like is you've got

238
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:11.640
much, much bigger problems. Now,

239
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.140
what we end up doing is transitioning to old town in Gotham city and old town is

240
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:20.010
basically the base of operations for where Jason Todd operates as the defense

241
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.710
contractor, of course, some pretty heavy hitters, some big henchmen.

242
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:24.840
And when they get in there, the immediate question,

243
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:27.990
the immediate interrogation from Grayson is what's going on here?

244
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.600
Why is it that you're receiving missiles and so on and so forth?

245
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.370
And when you initially have Jason Todd, who's like,

246
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:35.040
I don't really know what you're talking about. I have no idea what's going on.

247
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.010
Grayson basically says like, well, we can say Dick Grayson basically says, look,

248
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.220
I've got my drones that are going through here and there they're scanning your

249
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:44.190
entire facility. Right? And they found 12 Lux,

250
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:46.620
Corp ordinance containers containing these missiles.

251
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.280
And one of the missiles are gone, right? So by all standards of measurement,

252
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.980
this missile came from your facility and it was used,

253
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.530
try to shoot down a sitting, Senator, spill the beans on what's going on, right.

254
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.560
And literally like targets his drones on him with the intention of killing him,

255
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.650
following that you end up having all these forces that start showing up.

256
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.930
And they're actually members of the league of assassins,

257
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:06.340
which are led by Talia Al Gore.

258
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.100
And that's when Jason Todd starts to spill the beans and saying, sorry, man,

259
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.580
it's the end of the road for you. Right? Like the owls have had their time.

260
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:12.791
Right?

261
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:16.120
So this points to the idea that Dick Grayson is actually part of the court of

262
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:19.390
owls. Now the court of owls have moved beyond Gotham city and, Oh, I'm sorry.

263
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:22.450
Moved up in Gotham city on her effectively seemed to be the ones running the

264
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:25.870
show here or at the very least, or heavily involved in president Lincoln, March,

265
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:26.710
which kind of makes sense,

266
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.800
given his involvement with the court of owls and the events of new 52,

267
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.820
but with the quarter bowels,

268
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:34.030
having long been the secret of organization that worked within Gotham city

269
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:37.930
itself, that, that, that kind of concept still continues on. And so Jason,

270
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:39.970
Todd has kind of like, this is the end of the road, man.

271
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.110
Well then suddenly out of nowhere,

272
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.770
a grenade comes flying in right in like the whole place starts to burn.

273
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.730
And when that happens,

274
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.400
like you've got Thomas Elliot and you've got degrees Grayson who basically get

275
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.660
out of there as fast as they can.

276
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.020
When the Batman comes pouring in and starts tearing into everybody. Now,

277
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.870
forest park, Dick Grayson fights against Batman as best he can,

278
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.750
but he's not much of a, of a, of a competitor here. Right.

279
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.510
And so of course he basically ends up escaping. You've got a, you've gotten,

280
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.510
you know, a Batman who immediately goes after Jason, Todd and Jason Todd.

281
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:05.530
Here's the thing, man, Jason,

282
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:08.080
Todd goes down like a hero and never were like a hero.

283
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:09.520
He just goes down like the most awesome way.

284
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.180
<v 2>Where he's like, he's like, do you really think I'll go down easy? He's like,</v>

285
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:15.390
come on then. Right. He was like, come on big boy let's dash.

286
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.120
So they just start shooting. Right. It's it's the craziest thing.

287
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.910
<v 1>Well, this thing, well, following that revelation from Jason,</v>

288
00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:24.710
Todd Thomas Elliot ends up inside of Wayne Manor goes running up on Talia and

289
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.330
he's like, what's going on here? Right? Like she's like, I have like,

290
00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:29.400
where have you been? I have no idea what you're talking about. He's like,

291
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.070
I just got done talking with Jason, Tom, when all hell broke loose.

292
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.190
And he told me that the league of assassins is going to take me out and they're

293
00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:37.360
led by you. And he did it with your blessings.

294
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:39.360
So the two of you are working together to oust me.

295
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.580
So what in the heck is going on here?

296
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:45.300
And her response is the league of assassins did not have any attempt on your

297
00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:48.690
life, but do not misunderstand your place in the bigger picture. Thomas Elliot,

298
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.420
we put you where you are and we have plans for you.

299
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.030
We would like to put you in the position of president of Gotham,

300
00:13:54.031 --> 00:13:56.910
but we also recognize that you could be killed at any point in time.

301
00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.480
And so we've got backup plans for our backup plans and we needed Jason Todd's

302
00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:01.530
resources, right.

303
00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:04.380
It just happened to be that Jason Todd decided to make that move against you

304
00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:06.420
right then, because he has his own ambitions, you know,

305
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.910
and that kind of a thing it's kind of crazy because the response of Thomas

306
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.630
Elliot is if you want to maintain access to my multi-billion dollar company,

307
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.370
then you would do well to keep me alive.

308
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.970
One saying that he suddenly looks on his desk and realizes there's a comic for

309
00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:20.460
the Mark of Zorro. And he's like, where did you get this?

310
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.080
And that's when he starts freaking out.

311
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.910
Talia has no idea what he's talking about. Right?

312
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.250
She doesn't know anything about this Batman type character.

313
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.170
She thinks he's losing his mind. And he's like,

314
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.820
this Batman's guy has been in this house, right?

315
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.220
He's been in this house before this all started in one place.

316
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.680
I'm going back there and we're going to finally get answers, right?

317
00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:37.740
So we ended up going back to, what's basically Wayne Manor,

318
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.260
the original Wayne Manor house. And when he gets in there,

319
00:14:40.261 --> 00:14:43.140
he starts asking the question like, who are you? Why are you doing all this?

320
00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:45.270
And he's met by this voice. And this, this voice says,

321
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:47.400
is there something I should know about the Wayne murders?

322
00:14:47.401 --> 00:14:49.560
And that's what we end up finding out that Dick Grayson's here.

323
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.670
And the reason why he's here is he tracked down Thomas Elliot,

324
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.580
that he's got a bug on Thomas Elliot who could overhear what he says,

325
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.630
and he's got a tracker. See,

326
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.420
we can always know where his movements are and given the conversation he had

327
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:01.460
with Talia and given the, given his movements,

328
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.730
it was only a matter of logic that he would end up here. Not only that,

329
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.030
that were Dick Grayson is the head of president March's security.

330
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.570
That way you end up finding out is that president March and those guys had long

331
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:15.320
believed for quite some time that the league of assassins working alongside

332
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.190
Thomas Elliott and tended to move him above his station and replace president

333
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:22.070
Lincoln March. And so it was kind of like, we suspected that for a long,

334
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:22.700
long time.

335
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.000
And now you have basically confirmed it through your conversations with Talia,

336
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.520
that you plan on ousting the president and taking his place. Well,

337
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:30.950
in the middle of all that the floor comes crashing down, right?

338
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:32.690
Literally they get yanked through the floor.

339
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.260
And when they basically begin to come to the Thomas Elliot looks around and sees

340
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.680
Alfred, and he's singing this, this really creepy nursery rhyme, hush,

341
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.980
little baby Les, you call down the bloody bat of Gotham town.

342
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.550
He looks above desiring of a corpse to plant beneath the ground.

343
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.540
He knows your heart, your blackest deed, and follows them wherever they lead,

344
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.170
where you go, the bat will know and find you with the devil speed.

345
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.220
It's a really cool rhyme. Like I love that run, right.

346
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.430
And Thomas Elliot does not immediately recognize Alfred.

347
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.800
And this really kind of shows the fact that Thomas didn't have a whole lot of

348
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:07.970
involvement with Alfred and offered is largely been absent in the years since

349
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:10.400
Thomas took over Wayne enterprises, all that kind of stuff.

350
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.490
And so what you end up what you end up having happen as an Alfred basically

351
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:16.550
tells Thomas it was a mistake coming here, right? It was a terrible,

352
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:19.460
terrible mistake. And when the lights kick on, there's one, this,

353
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.730
this holding cell that's here, that it looks like it's intended for a,

354
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.250
for whoever the next victim is seemingly Thomas himself.

355
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.020
And then you've also got like all these other,

356
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.150
other individuals who are currently being held here,

357
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.730
Jason Todd's being held here, all these folks, right? Like, uh,

358
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.260
like Dr. Crane is being held here.

359
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.380
And that's when the bat starts to sort of pop up because Thomas asked the

360
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.500
question like Alfred, did you do all this? And the response of Alfred is no,

361
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:42.860
I'm just a humble, humble man. Servant. I serve the wanes nothing more.

362
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.310
And then he says the waves are dead Alfred. And the response of Alfred is,

363
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.860
are they master Thomas? Are they really dead? Indeed.

364
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.560
And then you end up having this Batman who shows up here right now,

365
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.280
Batman literally goes after Thomas and says like, I know what you did, Tommy.

366
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.410
Right? All those years ago, your family driver,

367
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.890
what you promised him to kill your own parents and how it all went wrong.

368
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.920
Who else? And Thomas, like, who are you? He's like, who else would I be?

369
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.160
Everyone's dead. But us, the Wayne's are dead in that alley.

370
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.680
The Elliotts were killed on the road. A few years later,

371
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.160
the driver was killed in a cell awaiting trial for another crime.

372
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.580
Even the decent cop who took the call, Jim Gordon is death. And he says,

373
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:18.650
when your parents took me in, your mother said,

374
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.820
the boys will finally get to be real brothers. How Dr. Crean laughed.

375
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.290
When I told him that story,

376
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.850
the idea that I was ever like a brother to you who took every single thing from

377
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:30.980
me, this is Bruce Wayne, right?

378
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.010
Like Thomas has worked against Bruce from the beginning, right?

379
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.130
The Thomas seemed to have wanted to take his fat ticket's parents out and then

380
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:38.420
to take out the parents of,

381
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:41.150
of Bruce and take over the Wayne fortune for himself. And,

382
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:43.760
and the response to Thomas is you're dead. I saw you die.

383
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.280
You were on the operating table. You had an autopsy done on you.

384
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.190
You had the autopsy scars. And that's when he says, no,

385
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.900
this was all planned from the very beginning.

386
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.690
You were not the only visitor in Arkham, Tommy. Right?

387
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.090
Alfred was always with me. And he says,

388
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.870
so where's the handyman that we planted at Arkham Jack Napier.

389
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.220
This is the guy who gave me the surgical scars that made it look like I had an

390
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:08.730
autopsy, right? So I could basically take my death and escape that place.

391
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.480
He gave me the drugs so I could look like I died. He says with Alfred's help.

392
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.210
I learned what happened to my parents years ago and Navy,

393
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.750
or got me access to people in Arkham who could help me avenge them.

394
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.050
All these individuals who were held within Arkham, asylum, Amadeus,

395
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.130
himself who taught criminal psychology, the dispraise spy, Nick Mason,

396
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.770
who taught him to sky's. Lockpicking all things by craft.

397
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.000
All of these individuals played a role in Bruce Wayne becoming who he was

398
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.620
becoming this version of Batman,

399
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.340
that's dark and twisted and knowing how to kill people with surgical precision

400
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.800
and disappear without ever being caught.

401
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:43.800
And so you initially have Thomas who begs, right? He's like, no, no, no, no.

402
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.500
You misunderstand. You misunderstand, right? We're we're brothers, man.

403
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.320
And together we can fix everything. We can fix Gotham.

404
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:50.430
We can make it a better place, man.

405
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:53.190
We can make it better than what it used to be. And the response is, no,

406
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.710
that's not going to happen. You're never going to see the light of day again.

407
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.990
Right. This is it you're finished. And so from there,

408
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:02.070
you switch back over to kind of like the, the Gotham state media, right.

409
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:04.440
Which is kind of going through and saying, Hey, like, you know, here's,

410
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:07.090
here's everything that's going on. You know? And that, you know, with the,

411
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.490
the vanishing of Thomas Elliot,

412
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.820
the Wayne fortune has passed on to Alfred pennyworth who was a family Butler,

413
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.200
but nobody's seen him in years.

414
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:16.800
So we have no idea where this billionaire is or what it is that he has going on.

415
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.160
That Talia algal is now on the arm of president Lincoln, March. Right.

416
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:22.950
She's with him now, you know, many of us thought Talia would see God,

417
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:26.190
the affections of Jason Todd, but he's gone. And it seems like it's pretty fast,

418
00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:26.341
right?

419
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.610
She just immediately jumped after the vanishing of Thomas Elliott directly into

420
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:33.720
the arms of Lincoln March. Right. So I program me and it's just kind of like,

421
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.330
this is pretty wild, right? Like it's pretty crazy stuff.

422
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.780
It's interesting because what you end up finding out here is the handyman is the

423
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:42.870
one who basically kind of guards all these cells. So basically the,

424
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:44.790
the joker of sorts that Alfred is just kind of,

425
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.490
they're keeping the place cleaned up as trashed as it is.

426
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.470
And that basically Batman, the silence,

427
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.920
which is what he's called now is traveling throughout Gotham and killing all

428
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:54.390
this, all the higher powered guys,

429
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.790
all the folks who are running the show and who are completely and totally

430
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:59.610
corrupted, what the end goal is. We have no clue.

431
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.230
We have no clue if he wants to just distill madness throughout the entirety of

432
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:07.440
the city. But whatever it is, this is an effect. A version of Bruce Wayne,

433
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.020
who's experienced torment, who was broken by madness,

434
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.740
who completely and totally lost his mind in the face of the fact that he had

435
00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:16.560
completely lost everything with that being said,

436
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.790
we're going to bring this video to an end.

437
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.560
If you guys are new here to come as explain mission,

438
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:21.390
you guys are the sub button to become part of the Rob poor.

439
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.090
If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you drop a light and.
