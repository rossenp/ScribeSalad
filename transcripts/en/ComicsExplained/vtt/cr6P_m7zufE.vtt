4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.790
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.490
<v 1>This is Rob and we're picking up with the very first video on DC's future state,</v>

6
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:20.150
specifically the new Batman right now DC's future state is basically kind of a

7
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:21.080
glimpse into the future.

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.380
The reality of this is DC is kind of giving this to us as a,

9
00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:27.890
as a kind of idea of like the multi-verse has now been saved and like the Batman

10
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:28.910
who laughs was defeated.

11
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:31.610
So like here's what things could look like in the future. In all honesty,

12
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:34.670
I think this is largely being done to kind of give a lot of their writers and

13
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:36.560
artists or reprieve either that, or,

14
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:39.170
or there's something much bigger going on behind a DC comics.

15
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.340
The guys have been keeping up with the news.

16
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.650
Things are a little rough over a DC colleagues, but you know,

17
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.200
we're not here to speak to that. We're here to talk about the new Batman.

18
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.680
So this initially opens up with a guy kind of making his way through an alley,

19
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.310
but also gives us a little bit of insight here and basically tells us that in

20
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:54.530
Gotham city, at this future point in time,

21
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.400
individuals who are masks are immediately shot on site by the cops that masks

22
00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.930
have an effect been outlawed.

23
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.630
Now because of the fact that we know that like Watchman for example, is,

24
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.100
is part of the DC multi-verse.

25
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.520
Now we can largely assume this is a page being taken out of the Watchman, right?

26
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:10.200
Those of you guys who read that comic, that you know, that masks and,

27
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.610
and really superhero antiques in general in the Watchman universe were banned by

28
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:16.730
the us government, right? So it's kind of taken a page out of that whole thing,

29
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.930
but this guy with a mask is immediately set upon by the new Batman right now,

30
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.360
a lot of the guys are probably going to find yourself asking who's the new

31
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.610
Batman. There's not some grand revelation here.

32
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.210
And the reason why is because DC revealed who the new who the new Batman was

33
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.310
before we even began to see a future state, right?

34
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:33.740
We know the new Batman is currently Luke Fox, right?

35
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:36.890
He's currently bat wing and the present timeline in DC comics,

36
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.160
but it is interesting to kind of have them pass the mantle over to somebody who

37
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:43.160
wouldn't normally we wouldn't normally expect the big question that we're kind

38
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:46.070
of looking for an answer to is why is it Luke Fox, right?

39
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.840
Why him and not anybody else,

40
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.600
but we end up finding out the reason why Batman is coming after this guy is

41
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.240
because this guy has committed a series of acts, a series of crimes.

42
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.000
And that kind of seems to be what the idea behind the masks are,

43
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.150
is that people who wear masks are people who are committing crimes and they're

44
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.160
wearing those masks to keep their identities hidden, right?

45
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.440
It's almost kind of a throwback to the days of the wild West,

46
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.830
but as one of these things where you basically have a kind of private police

47
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:10.340
force that exists in the city of Gotham, and whenever anybody's wearing a mask,

48
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.390
it shoot to kill, right?

49
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:14.570
Like if you're walking down the street and any of these private police guys,

50
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.280
they see you walking down the road, wearing a mask,

51
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.050
they'll get out of their car and shoot you on site. Right.

52
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:19.970
They're totally legally allowed to do that.

53
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.700
And there seems to be a much bigger reason as to why that's the case,

54
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.670
but the long and short is that Batman being the guy that he is,

55
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.430
of course wears a mask. And so he's almost kind of perceived,

56
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.730
or really even goes as far as to tell us that he's basically public enemy number

57
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:35.020
one, right. That the cops are always on the lookout for taking out Batman.

58
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.670
The issue is that Batman's not someone who's easily subdued.

59
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.030
And it's one of these things where you even see that with these two cops who end

60
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:44.210
up kind of, you know, walking up on the guy who was subdued by Batman.

61
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.240
And then when they kind of have a conversation, like, should we go after Batman?

62
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.940
They're like, no, we'll just take this guy. We'll get our, get our promotion.

63
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.110
And that'll be the end of that. Right.

64
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:54.440
So going after Batman almost seems to be a kind of fools errand,

65
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.710
but the other part of this is that we're not really given a definitive

66
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.480
explanation to, it was that happened to Bruce Wayne, right. Instead,

67
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.940
it's just kind of like somewhere along the line, Bruce, Wayne's gone by,

68
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.610
we even have Luke Fox kind of making this comment, you know, where he says,

69
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.910
I don't know how the real Batman, and then he kind of stops and says,

70
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.260
I am the real Batman. Right.

71
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.740
But the long and short of this really seems to be that Gotham C's kind of fallen

72
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.040
apart in the absence of Bruce Wayne. And it's kind of a question of why,

73
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:21.550
like what, what was, what was so significant about Bruce Wayne that the city,

74
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:22.660
you know, kind of fell apart.

75
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.140
And the reality of this is that Bruce Wayne contributed to Gotham in more than

76
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.050
one way, right? On one half he was Batman. But on the other half,

77
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.540
he was the guy who contributed financially to Gotham city,

78
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.150
donating money to various causes, improving neighborhoods,

79
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.500
different things like that. So, you know,

80
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:38.080
it was one part beating up criminals and then the other part,

81
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.700
trying to make life better for them. Right.

82
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.290
So see if you can't square that soccer,

83
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.450
why like I'm going to beat you up and I'm going to pay you the next morning.

84
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.110
I don't, I don't really know. I don't really know how you square that circle,

85
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:49.360
but that's basically what was going on in the city of Gotham.

86
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.010
But the other part of this is that Luke Fox's mom is actually working in favor

87
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:57.160
of the laws that allow people who wear masks to be shot on site.

88
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.520
And that the law itself is being challenged by the ACL. Ooh,

89
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.930
the American civil liberties union.

90
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:03.760
So of course they're challenging this on the,

91
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:07.870
on the auspices that killing individuals who are wearing masks is basically a

92
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:09.610
violation of their human rights. Right.

93
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.010
And so it makes these kind of interesting because that's one of the philosophies

94
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.010
we talked about in Batman comics over the years is that, you know,

95
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.260
people kind of say, well, I have a right to this. I have a right to that.

96
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.320
And it's like, okay, well then put that right in my hand, right? Put tape,

97
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.020
take your freedom of speech and put it in my hand, like,

98
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.850
like show me this freedom of speech you have.

99
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.670
And the reality is that is intangible. And if it's intangible,

100
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.070
it can easily be taken away. And so because of that, it's,

101
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.030
it creates a really interesting sort of dichotomy here in the sense that Luke

102
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:35.920
and his mom are really on opposing sides.

103
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.450
But because of the fact that their mother and son,

104
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:38.860
they still find a way to make sure their,

105
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.710
their parental and child relationship stays intact. But from there,

106
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.260
we switch over to a place called a little Santa Prisca.

107
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.940
What does the neighborhood inside Gotham?

108
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.900
And that it's really ran by a group of masks who have modeled themselves after

109
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.110
Bain. Now this begs even more questions, why vain? Right? Like, I mean,

110
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.750
I guess because he wears a mask and it's kind of the ultimate, you know,

111
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.660
declaration of what it means to keep your face covered and really live up to the

112
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.190
mask arc archetype,

113
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.240
but where's Bain and all this now because of the fact that this future state

114
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.070
event seems to exist in the future,

115
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.840
we don't really know if there's a definitive future.

116
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.690
You can largely kind of go with the idea that these guys are modeling their

117
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:13.210
philosophy off the events of Tom King's Batman.

118
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.060
When Bain took over the city of Gotham, regardless of, of,

119
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.600
of what the deal is here. A couple of kids are basically snatched up, right?

120
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:22.270
These two guys who were brothers are snatched up by this gang.

121
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.060
And the idea is they're trying to get them to join into the gang.

122
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:27.700
And so what they end up saying is like, if you want to be part of this group,

123
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.860
when there's a few things you need to understand when they kind of asked the

124
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.110
question, why should we join you in the first place?

125
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.840
The gains response here is because nobody cares now.

126
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.020
That's usually how gangs end up preying on younger people, right?

127
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:41.200
They kind of go to go to those who are effectively, we can desperate, right?

128
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.770
Those who feel cast off by society and they give them this kind of promise of

129
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.720
we'll be your family because of that. You know,

130
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.100
you have these guys who were kind of like, you know,

131
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:50.500
what's the requirement here in order for us to get into this gang,

132
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.530
what do we have to do? And the response is you got to kill somebody.

133
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.290
But the idea here seems to be that what they get in return,

134
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.000
that's kind of promise of family, right? The fact that they had members of,

135
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.530
you know, one of their parents who ran off, you know,

136
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:04.510
the promise of having a life and actually longing somewhere really seems to be

137
00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:06.760
what it is that they need in order to fulfill this act.

138
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:09.370
And so what they end up doing is through a couple of throw in a couple of masks

139
00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:12.460
on these guys and then basically taking them out into the street and then in

140
00:06:12.461 --> 00:06:15.730
turn saying, okay, like, let's grab a target and let's kill this guy. Now,

141
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.541
before we do that,

142
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:20.740
I want to switch over for a second to Luke Fox going and visiting a sister

143
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.220
wildly familiar about that wing. But as far as I'm aware,

144
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.250
we weren't really exposed to that. The fact that he had a brother named Tim,

145
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.830
not that I'm aware of. Right. I could have, I could, I could miss that.

146
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.970
You know, it could be wrong about that,

147
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.710
but I'm not aware that he ever had a brother.

148
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:35.080
So this seems to be a new introduction. Now, if I'm wrong,

149
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.490
feel free to correct me in the comment. That's right.

150
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:39.060
I want to make sure that I have the correct information from you guys,

151
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.920
but his sister Tam is basically in the hospital. Right.

152
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:45.880
She's here because she ended up relapsing and presumably overdosing on drugs.

153
00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:47.920
Right. And so that's why she's currently here, but there's,

154
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:51.220
there's a lot of bad blood between Luke and his brother himself in the sense

155
00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:53.650
that his brother kind of seemed to be one of these in and out kind of guys,

156
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.650
you don't ever really comes around when he needs something that in the time

157
00:06:56.651 --> 00:06:57.970
where he talks about, well, you know, I mean,

158
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.480
I came here because she's my sister and I to look now for the responses. Well,

159
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:03.160
I mean, sure you were in a military Academy,

160
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.630
but you've been out of there for a long time.

161
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.850
So what stopped you from coming back before now? Right?

162
00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:09.670
Like you're only here because you know, maybe you want something,

163
00:07:09.671 --> 00:07:10.630
maybe you need something,

164
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.510
but you're not here for her because you could have been here for her over any

165
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:17.650
amount of time that you've been free and available to come here and actually be

166
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:18.311
there for her. Right.

167
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:21.670
So we know there's kind of animosity and bad blood between the two. From there,

168
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:24.940
you ended up switching over to a guy by the name of Whitaker and of course

169
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:28.000
Whitaker's met, bye bye. A person named Chubb. Right. We can,

170
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:29.440
it looks like that's, that's, you know, her name.

171
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:30.580
I don't know if that's actually her name or not,

172
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.780
and maybe some kind of a nickname,

173
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:33.790
but of course she's got a new partner named Tanaka,

174
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.090
but the idea is a Chubb and Whitaker were, were partners at one point in time.

175
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.650
And she was always really close to them.

176
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:40.240
There's no indication that was romantic,

177
00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:43.150
but there is a lot of indication that their friendship was exceedingly strong,

178
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.820
that they were very good partners and they could talk about almost anything.

179
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.670
But the reason why she's here is that word has reached their ears,

180
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.910
that a former cop, right. Which it seems like Whitaker had basically bailed out,

181
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:54.940
but like some kind of a copper or somebody who's a former cop is basically

182
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.930
moving through the city of Gotham and helping these different masks to achieve

183
00:07:58.931 --> 00:07:59.711
crimes. Right.

184
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:02.200
To kind of give them the information they need in order to pull off different

185
00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:05.050
crimes, different Heights, and then in turn disappear. Right?

186
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.350
And so this guy basically seems to be working against the police officers in

187
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:10.090
favor of the masks. And that's, what's,

188
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:13.120
what's so interesting about this is because we don't really have a full

189
00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:16.390
perception of Gotham. We just got this little fractional depiction of it.

190
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.150
And so it's, it's really easy to look at this and to say, okay,

191
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.220
the cops are wrong because they have killed orders,

192
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.950
but we don't really know why they have kill orders. Why they were brought in,

193
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:26.530
in the first place. On the other hand is easy to say, well,

194
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:28.720
if those guys don't want to die, they shouldn't wear masks.

195
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.790
But it's one of these things where it could very well be.

196
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.700
The cops are the bad guys and the people with the masks are the good guys.

197
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:36.400
Now I don't really believe that people with masks are good guys because they're

198
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:39.220
walking around and just shooting people arbitrarily in order to get people into

199
00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:40.570
their gang. But you know,

200
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:43.240
there's a little more we're going on here than what we're initially told.

201
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.920
It's kind of what I'm making a point of saying here.

202
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.770
What do you think about this? Is that what you end up having a, you know,

203
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:51.100
kind of transitioning back to these two kids with, uh, with this gang, right?

204
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:52.300
This, this main mass gang,

205
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.060
they end up running up on this one guy where they pull a gun out, but one,

206
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.200
the brothers stops the other and says, no, we can't do this. Right.

207
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.800
We can't just arbitrarily kill people in a desire to join some kind of a gang.

208
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.970
Now in this moment where he does attracts his brother kind of moves his gun out

209
00:09:04.971 --> 00:09:07.700
of the way. And he ends up misfiring. Uh, it leads to the other guy,

210
00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:09.890
pulling a gun out and firing on them. Right?

211
00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:12.290
The problem with that is as soon as it's shots fired,

212
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.850
somebody somewhere calls a police,

213
00:09:13.851 --> 00:09:16.220
or really because there's so many surveillance cameras and everything,

214
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.740
the cops were already aware of what's going on here, right?

215
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.290
Probably saw these guys wearing a mask inside their car,

216
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.600
but basically the sirens are not that far away.

217
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.110
And so you end up having Batman who jumps in and saves the life of this would be

218
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:29.390
victim, right? This, this person that they were going to shoot.

219
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:29.961
And then in turn,

220
00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:32.750
Batman jumps in and starts beating the crap out of these guys who were wearing

221
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:35.990
masks. Now, one of the things that's shown here, and this is really important,

222
00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:39.500
one of the things has shown here is that Luke Fox has every bit of effective of

223
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:42.350
a, of a Batman as Bruce Wayne was right. The Bruce Wayne,

224
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.640
his greatest skill was his ability to appear and disappear to almost be like a

225
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:47.121
Phantom,

226
00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:50.060
like a ghost while you wouldn't really know he was there until he wanted you to

227
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:50.870
know he was there.

228
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.100
And Luke Fox largely appears to be just as capable now while these guys are

229
00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:58.520
basically driving and trying to get away and trying to shoot a Batman and so on

230
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:01.340
and so forth, they ended up crashing, you know, into, into a truck.

231
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.610
And this really allows Luke to kind of take out the main gang members,

232
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.070
but then also go after the two young girls, right? These,

233
00:10:07.071 --> 00:10:10.010
these two young kids who were potentially involved in this game,

234
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.140
but the problem with this, and what's really kind of cool here.

235
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.380
And the strong similarities between Luke and Bruce is that Luke does exactly

236
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.540
what Bruce would have done. No one, he trucks down these kids,

237
00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:20.150
he doesn't just start beating the crap out of them, you know, mast, you know,

238
00:10:20.151 --> 00:10:22.040
and they just start attacking him, you know, or anything like that.

239
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.520
And instead he realizes these two young kids were basically weaken desperate.

240
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.190
They were looking to belong somewhere and they could have potentially made a

241
00:10:28.191 --> 00:10:30.380
choice that would have destroyed their lives more so than that.

242
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.850
If they were caught by the cops,

243
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.700
the cops would have executed them or the cops would have killed them on site.

244
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.310
So from there, he's kind of like you guys, like we got to get out of here,

245
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.380
we're going to save your lives. You know, that's, that's kind of the thing.

246
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.110
That's what that meant though. The smoke bomb and these cops end up firing in,

247
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:42.891
but of course, you know,

248
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:45.710
Luke gets these two kids out of there takes them off and says like,

249
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.930
I'm handing you guys over to child services. Right.

250
00:10:47.931 --> 00:10:50.900
Whatever happens after that is, is really kind of on you. But it's, it's a,

251
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.070
it's a really cool thing, right?

252
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:53.930
Because we pick up with what looks like Whitaker.

253
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.910
And then of course Whitaker's seemingly you know,

254
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.820
prepared to be attached by a couple of other guys, uh, who are, who are,

255
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.190
you know, about potentially, you know, gang members, you know that,

256
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.370
or it's just some random guy, right? I mean, whatever case is here, uh,

257
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.910
the important thing is that Gotham is in a much darker place than it has been,

258
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.730
but it's really not one of those dark stories. Like the dark Knight returns.

259
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.100
It's one of these stories where it's potentially hopeful.

260
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.710
It's not dark and bleak and really, really crappy. Ah,

261
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.620
there's one of these things where it's like, Gotham's kind of in a bad spot,

262
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.560
you know, like, like often coffins, furloughed is kind of what it is, right.

263
00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:24.770
He's not totally unemployed he'll but he's off of his job for a little while,

264
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.110
but to suck. Absolutely. Well, there's a light at the end of the tunnel, right.

265
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.900
That's kind of what, what, you know, where Gotham is right now. And it's nice.

266
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.540
I like it. You know, to be honest, the art throws me off a little bit,

267
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.720
but the more I kind of look at this, the, the easier it becomes to accept,

268
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.900
I'm just still a little disappointed because the, the art's not bad,

269
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.820
but it is VCs. It shipped title.

270
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:44.000
And I kind of feel like they need to have a much better artist on here. Yeah.

271
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.160
But nonetheless, you know, it's cool. You know, it's, it's a, it's a,

272
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:47.420
it's a great little story. Ah,

273
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.310
let me know what you guys think down in the comments section.

274
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.900
If you guys are new here to comments, explain Michelle,
