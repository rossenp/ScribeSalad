4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.810
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.810
<v 1>This is Rob. And today I want to try something a little bit different, uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.680
with QI and black,

7
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.130
having recently come out and you guys going absolutely nuts over that video.

8
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.820
I thought it'd be a good time to go over pretty much all the symbionts in the

9
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:26.540
Marvel universe, as well as highlight some of the hosts of those symbionts.

10
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.840
And when figuring out the best way to do this, we basically have two options.

11
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.900
We can go in the chronological order based on the date of their first

12
00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:36.170
appearance, or we can go in chronological order based on where,

13
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:38.630
in the timeline of the Marvel universe they appeared.

14
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.080
And I think the second option will make the most sense as we progress throughout

15
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.880
the symbionts. And so that's what we're going to do.

16
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.540
That means that we need to start with the very beginning of the history of the

17
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:50.600
symbionts and because that history has been retcon relatively recently,

18
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.960
that means we're going to go with one of the most recent characters to be

19
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:57.270
introduced. No, the God of the symbionts. So, uh, for the,

20
00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:59.270
all the guys who are a little bit behind here,

21
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.080
Knoll was created by Donnie Cates and Ryan Stegman. And first appeared in venom,

22
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:07.520
number three in 2008 with his origin being revealed in the very next issue.

23
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.870
So Knoll is older than the Marvel universe itself existing in a dormant state

24
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.670
until he was awakened by the Celestials.

25
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.550
When they began creating the current iteration of the Marvel universe.

26
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.540
Now anchor that the Celestials were filling the void that he ruled Knoll creates

27
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.900
all black, the Necro sword and slays one of the Celestials with it,

28
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.690
a crime for which he's banished back to the void. Now,

29
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.440
no uses this opportunity to grow more formidable strengthening the all-black

30
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.190
sword in a Ford that was made from the head of the dead celestial, all black,

31
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.370
we would later learn what the prototype of the race that would become the

32
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:41.450
symbionts as we know them and the fire of the forge and the sound of nose hammer

33
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.950
would instill in all future symbionts vulnerabilities in both fire and sound.

34
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.280
Now, no goes on a murderous rampage across the universe,

35
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.420
destroying billions of solar systems in the process until he stopped by Gore,

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.690
the God butcher who defeats Knoll and takes all black from him.

37
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.430
Now in the century, following his defeat,

38
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.000
no figured out that he could actually bond his living of abyss with lesser

39
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.220
creatures and control them across galaxies,

40
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.570
thereby creating the first true symbionts. Now in terms of power, no,

41
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.130
definitely lives up to his name as God of the symbionts because he's God like in

42
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:13.760
his power,

43
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.450
his primary ability is that he can create weapons and other symbionts using the

44
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.620
living a bisque. Not only is he capable of creating literal armies of symbionts,

45
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.010
but he can also control them through a telepathic link that he shares with them.

46
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.791
In addition to this,

47
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.690
he's immortal and possess a super human strength and durability to the point of

48
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.990
being practically in vulnerable. And the thing about nose powers is this.

49
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.710
I would wager that we haven't even come close to seeing the limits of what he

50
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:37.640
can do. I mean,

51
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.450
and the most recent issue we saw him in snare Celestials into his bidding and

52
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:42.800
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

53
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.220
And so I imagine that we're probably going to see null display some ridiculous

54
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:48.320
abilities that we didn't even know that he had. Now,

55
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:51.200
one of the first symbionts that no created was the Grendel,

56
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.750
which was also created by Donnie Cates and Ryan Stegman.

57
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.520
And first appeared in venom. Number four.

58
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.440
Now Grindle was one of several symbionts that took the form of a dragon and it

59
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.580
was while piloting the Grendel Symbion that no first learned of earth now was

60
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.090
Grindle attacked a village. The villagers cried out for their hero Bay Wolf,

61
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.860
but were instead answered by Thor.

62
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.320
Now four strikes Grindle with a bolt of lightning,

63
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.770
which severs Knowles control over his symbionts and his vulnerability to

64
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:18.460
electricity. What continue to be a trait of symbionts long into the future.

65
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.070
The resulting symbions began seeking out new hosts.

66
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.080
We producing and rebelling against nil,

67
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.350
which is how the race of symbionts created by Knoll became the Clint heart,

68
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.220
which we learn. Is there a racist word for cage and imprison their deity?

69
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.220
Now the Grendel symbiont possesses, superhuman strength, stamina,

70
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.980
and durability, which are powers that are common to symbionts,

71
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.670
but Grendel's powers are of a much higher scale than most symbionts due to him

72
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.850
having such a close connection with its creator note. Now,

73
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.660
the Grinell Symbion is also able to generate other symbionts and is also able to

74
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:50.050
reanimate corpses by bonding them to its offspring. Of course,

75
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.160
the most popular Simeon and the one introduced to the Marvel universe is venom.

76
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.700
The version of venom most are familiar with was created by David Michelina and

77
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:02.260
Todd McFarland. And first appeared in the amazing Spiderman number 319 88,

78
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.410
but his origins in the Marvel universe go back much further than that.

79
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.730
The Symbion that would become known as venom was part of the 998th generation of

80
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.180
Symbion offspring and was cast out from the rest of the symbiotic for being

81
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:17.140
mentally insane before being obtained by the CRE who hoped to harness its

82
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:19.720
shape-shifting abilities and their war with the scrolls. Now,

83
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.480
the Symbian was bonded to a CRE warrior named hell cart,

84
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.140
but was eventually separated from him and returned to the Cree home world before

85
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.030
somehow making its way to battle world,

86
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.200
which leads us to the symbionts original origin story as told in secret Wars

87
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.800
number eight by Jim shooter and Mike Zack. Now in that issue of secret Wars,

88
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:37.060
which I have a whole story covered,

89
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:40.030
you can find the link to it down in the description in the ensuing chaos

90
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.070
Spider-Man's costume gets ripped up,

91
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.280
but luckily the heroes find a machine that can create any clothing that they

92
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.480
want Spiderman, however,

93
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.410
chooses the wrong machine and is covered by a black goop that becomes his new

94
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:50.950
costume,

95
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.670
kind of a fun fact here and Deadpool secret secret war Marvel actually changed

96
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.220
that. So the Deadpool was on battle world, which we didn't know about,

97
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.770
and he actually directed Spider-Man to the machine itself,

98
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.930
not realizing that it actually had a venom Simeon in it.

99
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.030
And that's how Peter Parker basically became new venom,

100
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.290
but it's kind of a small, fun,

101
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:07.840
little retcon the story's really good if you guys ever get a chance,

102
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.520
it's a really, really, really fun story,

103
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.130
but regardless Spider-Man wears this costume for awhile,

104
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.250
but then he begins to realize that it was trying to bond to him permanently.

105
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.340
And so he leaves it with the fantastic four who believe that they have the

106
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.270
Symbian contained.

107
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.750
Of course they don't and the semi escapes and bonds to Peter once again,

108
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.320
but Parker still rejected it by exploiting its weakness to Sonics and ringing

109
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:28.210
church bells to drive it away. Now,

110
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:31.930
a disgrace reporter named Eddie Brock would then wonder into the church seeking

111
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.550
some sense of direction in his life.

112
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.300
The discarded venom Symbion could tell that Eddie harbored hatred for Peter

113
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.040
Parker, who he blamed for his professional downfall.

114
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.690
So the symbiont bonded with Eddie,

115
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.000
turning him into venom and brought in the Simeon,

116
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.420
joined together in their common mission to get revenge on Peter Parker.

117
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.110
Now Venom's powers include superhuman strength and durability as well as

118
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.770
shape-shifting including the ability to disguise itself by replicating the

119
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:57.040
appearance of normal street clothes. Now, because it's bonded with Spiderman,

120
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.710
the venom Symbion has inherited super powers such as the ability to produce and

121
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.310
swing from webs and is also immune to Peter Parker's spider sense,

122
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.060
but Eddie is not the last host of the venom Symbian. And in fact,

123
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.820
the Simeon has bonded with several other individuals.

124
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.730
And I guess I'm already going out of order here in terms of chronology,

125
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.610
but since these are all hosts of the venom Simeon,

126
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.220
I figured we go ahead and discuss them all here. Anyway,

127
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.143
it kind of makes the most sense.

128
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.610
So after the venom Symbion was separated from Eddie,

129
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.810
it approached another of Spider-Man's perennial foes, the scorpion Matt Gargan.

130
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.290
And so what happens is that Norman Osborn had been imprisoned and needed

131
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.350
Spiderman to break him out, which of course Spiderman would never do,

132
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.390
except that under Norman Osborn's orders,

133
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.320
scorpion a kidnapped aunt may and would only free her if Spider-Man helped break

134
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:40.850
Norman out of jail, which makes sense.

135
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.450
Now during the conversation where Matt explains this arrangement to Peter,

136
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.110
Peter makes the remark that scorpion will always be a B-list villain

137
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:51.590
specifically saying it's not like your venom, but when Matt goes home,

138
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.710
the venom Symbion is waiting for him and offers to bond with him,

139
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.530
telling him that on his own, he'll always be a joke,

140
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.830
but if he bonds with a Symbian, no one will ever laugh at him. Again,

141
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.850
obviously scorpion takes him up on this offer, or you wouldn't be in this video.

142
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.713
And he becomes venom,

143
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.290
which granted him all the same powers that Eddie Brock had had his venom until

144
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:12.860
the Simeon was removed from Gargan after he was arrested for his antics as one

145
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:14.690
of the dark Avengers during the dark brain story.

146
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.450
Now another of Venom's notable hosts was flashed Thompson,

147
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.350
a sometimes rival and sometimes friend of Peter Parker who lost his legs in a

148
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:23.330
heroic sacrifice during the Iraq war.

149
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.450
Now with the U S government in possession of the venom Simeon at the time,

150
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.540
and the amazing Spiderman number 654 by Dan Slott,

151
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.800
they approach flash about participating in project rebirth 2.0 now why do they

152
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.070
call it that? Because the program that turned Steve Rogers into captain America,

153
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.510
what's called project rebirth.

154
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.720
And the Cardinal rule of Marvel comics is that every organization without

155
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:42.260
exception,

156
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.800
wants to replicate the success of that original program and create their own

157
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.550
super soldier.

158
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.600
Now flash agrees and is bonded with the Symbion turning him into agent venom,

159
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.350
which rents him all the powers of his favorite hero Spiderman as well as venom

160
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.770
shape-shifting abilities and a specific significance to flash the venom semi.

161
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.250
It would also allow him to walk again and he would remain bonded to the venom.

162
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.280
Symbion from 2011, up until 2016.

163
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.830
So a pretty long time by modern comic standards.

164
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.440
Something else to kind of note here, depending on who you talk to.

165
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.400
A lot of people actually liked agent venom more than they like Eddie Brock

166
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:16.220
venom. He was hugely popular when he first came out, people loved him.

167
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.010
People love the story of Asian venom. I feel like we should cover it.

168
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.210
Let me know down in the comments section,

169
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.650
if you guys want me to cover agent venom,

170
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.850
I don't know if you guys want me to or not.

171
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.020
I feel like it'd be kind of interesting,

172
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.420
but before we get into the offspring of the venom Simeon,

173
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.720
something that I do want to point out here is that there are several more hosts

174
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.290
of the venom Simeon over the years in both the main mobile continuity and even

175
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.380
in alternative realities, for example, in the old man Logan universe,

176
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.070
which basically imagines the Marvel universe as a desolate post-apocalyptic

177
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:40.610
wasteland,

178
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.210
we see the venom Symbion had actually bonded to a literal T-Rex in Wolverine

179
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.760
number 69 by Mark Miller and Steve McNiven.

180
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.210
Now this version seems to basically be identical to the Symbion of the six one

181
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:54.770
six universe. So we can assume that this venomous Rex venom venom source Rex,

182
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.920
this, I liked venomous Rex, uh, just has the normal venom powers and abilities,

183
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.510
uh, on earth 65,

184
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.200
the numerical designation of the universe where Gwen Stacy became Spidergwen.

185
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.980
There is a version of venom that was created by a scientist named Elsa Brock in

186
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:11.490
an attempt to find a cure for the lizard formula that had turned that universe

187
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.990
as Peter Parker into the lizard.

188
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:16.860
A first appearing inspired when number 19 by Jason Latour and Robbie Rodriguez,

189
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.800
the venom of earth, 65 is not an alien Symbion,

190
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.520
but as artificially created by a reaction between the radioactive spider

191
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.430
isotopes that gave Gwen her powers and the lizard formula.

192
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.000
Now Gwen would later bond with the Symbion to become Wynnum and spider when

193
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:30.834
number 24,

194
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.650
the venom to be at Grant's it's where all the powers that spider Gwen had,

195
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.770
which are essentially the same as the Spiderman of earth six one six,

196
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.910
but it also must have a compatible host as it will kill incompatible ones

197
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:44.580
through the radiation from the spider isotopes. Furthermore,

198
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.690
the Symbion makes its way are subject to overly aggressive behavior by removing

199
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.970
their inhibitions and amplifying their emotions.

200
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.190
And so this version of the Symbion also retains the weaknesses to heat Sonics of

201
00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:58.280
the main universe venom. Now moving on to the offspring of venom,

202
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.980
the first and most prominent is of course carnage,

203
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.350
which was created by David McEleney and Mark Bagley.

204
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.160
And first appeared in amazing Spider-Man number three 61 and 1992.

205
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.320
Now the car December, it was created when Eddie Brock,

206
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.360
who is bonded with the venom Simeon at the time,

207
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.080
escape from prison and unbeknownst to Eddie left an offspring behind that would

208
00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:18.470
bond with a cellmate. I'm a nickel serial killer named Cleese Cassidy.

209
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.770
Now Cassidy would be the most frequent host of the Cornett Symbion whose

210
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:24.650
abilities differ significantly from the venom symbiotic,

211
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.220
because carnage was born into an environment alien to its species,

212
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.120
the environment of earth. And so the corn of had strength surpasses that event,

213
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.730
and it also possesses advanced shape-shifting abilities,

214
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.900
allowing us host to turn appendages into weapons and can even fire projectile

215
00:10:38.901 --> 00:10:40.820
weapons made of the Symbion itself.

216
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.150
This semi gets tendrils can implant thoughts in the minds of others.

217
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.860
It can also relay information.

218
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:50.330
It perceives from any direction to its host instantaneously the CMBA grants,

219
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:52.220
its hosts, a regenerative healing factor,

220
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.400
and like venom is undetectable by Peter Parker spider sense,

221
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.130
and it's highly adaptive to its environment. For example,

222
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.980
evolving to allow its host to breathe in space.

223
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.760
Now when the codex or the genetic imprint of the carnage Symbion reacted with

224
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:07.580
the Grendel, Symbion when it reanimated Cletus Cassidy's corpse,

225
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.480
the result was a far more powerful entity than carnage had ever been before.

226
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.180
And it also gained the ability to create brain worms,

227
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.350
which you can use to infect others and turn them into copies of carnage.

228
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.130
Now in the 1993 mini series venom lethal protector by David McEleney,

229
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.870
Mark Bagley and Ron Lim. We see the introduction of five more symbionts scream,

230
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.120
riot, phage, Lasher, and agony.

231
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.810
Now the story here centers around a group called the life foundation dedicated

232
00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:36.200
to ensuring the survival of the country's wealthiest citizens in the event of an

233
00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:39.530
apocalypse type event. Now, when venom interferes with one of their plans,

234
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.310
they extract part of the venom Symbion and choose five of the life foundation

235
00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:44.150
security guards.

236
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.420
These five symbions seem to have basically the same powers as venom,

237
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.700
but also seemed to be slightly less powerful.

238
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.070
I eventually screamed murders her four siblings,

239
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.260
but only the host while the other symbionts are taken to the volt super prison

240
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.100
and merged into one Symbion known as hybrid and venom along, came a spider.

241
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:02.590
Number one by Larry Hama and Joe Saint here.

242
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.010
Now the symbionts were subjected to extremely painful experiments.

243
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.650
And once volt guard, Scott Washington discovers this,

244
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.950
he releases them from their confinement and all for bond with them.

245
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.110
Now due to the experimentation by the government,

246
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.320
these symbionts gained some unique abilities such as heightened senses.

247
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.260
In the case of phage Lasher's ability to bond with animals,

248
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.130
riots ability to move faster than the naked eye can detect and agony his ability

249
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:27.160
to increase its host musculature and spit acid.

250
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.590
And so when Scott Washington became hybrid,

251
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.100
he gained all of these powers as well as the standard Symbian powers.

252
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.400
But venom is not the only Symbion to produce offspring.

253
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.120
It's carnage has produced some itself. The first of which is toxin.

254
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.150
So toxin was created by Peter Milligan and Clayton crane.

255
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.450
And first appeared in venom carnage, number two in 2004.

256
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.880
Then when carnage found out that he was about to reproduce,

257
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.260
he began fostering a deep seated hatred for his eventual offspring fearing that

258
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:56.380
it may become more powerful than himself. And so he decides to kill it.

259
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.020
As soon as it's born. Now, venom tries to talk him out of this.

260
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:01.150
Of course it doesn't work because carnage is insane.

261
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.720
So venom tries to protect the new Symbion as he also fears that it will be the

262
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.040
Symbion that may become unstable due to being the 1000 generation of their race

263
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.150
and sort of hide the Symbion from venom carnage gives birth to it and then bonds

264
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.690
it with the New York city police officer named Patrick Mulligan and attempts to

265
00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:19.240
kill both of them. But of course he stopped by venom. Now,

266
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:22.180
once venom realizes how strong the toxin symbiont will become,

267
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.910
he decides carnage is ride and helps them try to kill it.

268
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.290
But toxin is aided in battle by Spiderman when they defeat venom and carnage.

269
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.400
Now toxin has all the venom and carnage abilities and is physically stronger

270
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.320
than either of them and also possesses,

271
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.100
inability to track any other individual and expansion of the ability that most

272
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.860
symbionts have to track other symbionts or their hosts.

273
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.460
Now the next Simeon that we're introduced to is actually not a true Symbion,

274
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.410
but it's part of a race known as the barriers,

275
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.310
which are genetically similar offshoot to the Clint har race. Now, Trent,

276
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.790
who is an agent of shield is approached by a symbiotic called payback that had

277
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:56.260
previously bonded to his father.

278
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.470
The payback semi had deferred from the venom Simeon and his progeny and a

279
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:00.490
variety of ways.

280
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.110
First it fed off the bliss of its host and was more of an entity made of energy

281
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.430
and set of organic matter.

282
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.340
In addition to enhanced physical attributes and a healing factor,

283
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.660
the payback Symbion allows its host to fly and project electromagnetic energy.

284
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.010
Of course being pure energy.

285
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.760
The payback Symbion has a vulnerability to water and coming into contact with

286
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:22.360
water. What result in Occidental expulsions of electricity? Next up,

287
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.780
we have antivenom created by Dan Slott and John Romita Jr.

288
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.220
And making his debut and amazing Spider-Man number 569 and 2008.

289
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.010
Now Eddie rock is working at a soup kitchen run by Martin Lee.

290
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.140
The supervillain known as Mr. Negative leak.

291
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:38.710
Here's Eddie of his cancer using his ability to control light force energy.

292
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.820
And shortly thereafter,

293
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.120
Eddie is attacked by Matt Gargan who was bonded to venom at the time.

294
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.430
The venom Symbion tries to rebond with Eddie,

295
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.590
but touching Eddie's skin harms venom.

296
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.950
And part of the Symbion merge with the antibodies created by the light force

297
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.810
energy to create a Holy new symbiont known as antivenom.

298
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.570
Now the antivenom Symbion has all the abilities of venom,

299
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.330
but does not possess its weaknesses to sound and fire.

300
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.050
The Simeon is able to heal others from a variety of afflictions through its

301
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:07.490
ability to produce antibodies, but using this ability drains antivenoms powers,

302
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.210
furthermore antivenom does display a weakness to dark force energy,

303
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.150
which is the dark counterpart to the light force energy that led to its

304
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.660
creation. Now this brings us to a weird one.

305
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:21.250
The mutant Symbion known as Zendesk's ZX is literally

306
00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:25.060
zzz X, X. I don't know how to pronounce that XYX XYX.

307
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.210
I have no idea what is going to call it Z credit by Chris yaasss and Dustin

308
00:15:28.211 --> 00:15:32.140
Weaver, Z first you're at an X-Men King breaker. Number two in 2009.

309
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.080
Now Z was a symbiont discovered by the sheer empire,

310
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.120
unlike any they had ever seen before,

311
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.670
as it actually fed on the brains of its host.

312
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.210
Now Zee was locked away for years as one of the five most dangerous criminals

313
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.130
the CR had ever encountered.

314
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.790
But Volkan the brother of Scott and Alex Summers chosen to be part of his

315
00:15:48.791 --> 00:15:52.660
Imperial guard and bonded him to a sheer soldier before bonding to the star

316
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.890
jammer, Roz, a long knife,

317
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.710
and eventually the cancer vers version of Charles Xavier,

318
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.860
which was basically just a giant brain for CZI to feed on is really all.

319
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.200
It was other than the bit about eating the brains of its host,

320
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.440
Z seems to have pretty much the same powers as other symbionts.

321
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.700
Then we have the second offspring of carnage, which is known as SCORM,

322
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.480
which was created by zip Wells and Clayton crane at first appeared in corners,

323
00:16:13.481 --> 00:16:16.000
number four in 2011. And so at this point,

324
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.120
carnage was ripped in half by the century and left to float through the

325
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:20.320
endlessness of space,

326
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.260
but it actually survived the experience and returned to earth.

327
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.580
Now a man named Michael Hall,

328
00:16:24.581 --> 00:16:27.790
discovers carnage and tries to use it to create artificial limbs.

329
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.220
But when a doctor named tennis knees loses his arm,

330
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.310
she gets one of these prosthetics to replace it. And as you may have guessed,

331
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.700
the results are disastrous as she's unable to control the Symbion,

332
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.770
which killed several people as it bonds to her.

333
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.770
Then when the cart Symbion finds cleanness, Cassidy, it leased Hanis,

334
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.640
but leaves behind an offspring that bonds with Tannis turning her into scorn,

335
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.200
a hybrid Symbian cyborg.

336
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.350
Now the main distinction between scoring and other symbionts is that she can

337
00:16:50.351 --> 00:16:53.860
bond herself to technology due to her techno organic physiology.

338
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.700
She's also able to communicate with and control various types of technology and

339
00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:01.120
can change yourself into any form of technology that she comes into contact

340
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:04.510
with. Now, carnage is offspring do not stop there. However, as during jelly,

341
00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:07.000
Conway's run on carnage in 2016,

342
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.260
an FBI agent named Claire Dixon is captured by coronation and use in a ritual

343
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:14.890
whereby he tries to bolster his power, using a book called the dark hole.

344
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.940
The result is that Claire is turned into a symbiont known as res who seems to

345
00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:22.600
have no powers beyond those common, to all symbionts. And finally,

346
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.620
we come to sleeper. Now sleeper was created by Mike Costa and Mark Bagley.

347
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.220
And first appeared in venom number 165 in 2018.

348
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.370
The final issue of venom before the current Donnie Kate's run began.

349
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.490
Now Claire Dixon, who we just discussed was thought to be dead,

350
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.100
but as it turns out due to her exposure to the dark hole,

351
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.840
she couldn't actually die. Anyway,

352
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.650
she captures Eddie Brock and tells him that the venom Symbion is about to give

353
00:17:44.651 --> 00:17:49.170
birth Eddie escapes and finds a doctor to help deliver the spot a process that's

354
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:52.800
difficult for the venom Symbion and despite an attempt by scorpion to steal the

355
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:53.790
spawn as it was born,

356
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.970
it successfully delivered and kept in the care of Al CAMACS.

357
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.170
Now this offspring would become known as sleeper and was stolen by Telecar the

358
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:05.370
first host of venom after the venom, Simeon refused to bond with him once more.

359
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.060
And so before Telecar could bond with sleeper, the symbiont bonded with Eddie,

360
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.480
not sleeper would later Labatt,

361
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.340
automize Telecar and use his body to explore space where he learned about Knoll

362
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.510
and came back to earth to protect Eddie and his son Dylan. No,

363
00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:19.080
in addition to the normal Symbian powers,

364
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.550
sleeper has displayed an ability to become invisible and to produce a variety of

365
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:26.760
chemicals and pheromones to produce a wide variety of effects,

366
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.520
including manipulating the thoughts and emotions of others.

367
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.630
And so that's pretty much the most major symbionts in the Marvel universe.

368
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.080
I'm not going to say all because there may have been a couple that slipped

369
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:39.540
through the cracks. I don't think they are. I think for the most part,

370
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:41.250
we pretty much caught them all up,

371
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.280
but I'm sure you'll let me know in the comments, if I did forget a few.

372
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.010
So with that being said, if you guys are new here to comments, explain,

373
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:49.230
make sure you guys are the sub button to become part of the Rob port.

374
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.190
If you guys enjoyed this video,

375
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.020
make sure you drop a light and I will catch you all later. Pers.

376
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.190
