4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.810
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.260
<v 1>Guys. This is Rob and we are back again with juggernaut. Yes.</v>

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.170
We're back again with the juggernaut solo series written by Fabian to Caesar,

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.480
probably one of the coolest writers that Marvel has,

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.880
and we're picking up with a trial of, of juggernaut,

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.090
but this is where the juggernaut was basically summoned to court for all the

10
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:29.330
damages caused or at least a huge chunk of damage to these costs and what

11
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:32.690
they're using here as evidence for a fight between himself and Spiderman.

12
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.480
And they're kind of pointing out the idea that like the fight between the two of

13
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.570
them had caused millions of dollars with a damage, right? And they came,

14
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.020
Marco was not being mind controlled, but his actions, his actions were his own.

15
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.570
His choices were zoned. And that karma and Angela, right,

16
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:47.840
this kind of New York city born and bred guy lost his scrappy construction

17
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.420
company. Now the whole thing is kind of being watched by diesel.

18
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.291
And technically,

19
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:53.840
I guess you can record it because she's considered herself to be part of the

20
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:56.210
press, which what really makes a person part of the press. Right?

21
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:58.640
I don't know if you really have to have like press credentials per se.

22
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.950
I think it's just like, I've got a phone and I want to document that.

23
00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:02.270
So I am part of the press now,

24
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.090
whether or not you're recognized that way by the rest of the press is a whole

25
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.490
different discussion. But one of the things that kind of comes out of this,

26
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:09.280
and this is what's cool is that you have the,

27
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:12.710
the defense attorney essentially for Kane Marco coming out and saying, yeah,

28
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.190
the cane marker was not the one who destroyed this. Guy's you know, this,

29
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:19.340
this guy summit, right? This guy's Wilson, the company that was Spiderman,

30
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:21.530
who did that, that was collateral damage in the conflict.

31
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.480
And Spiderman was the one who caused it. Now,

32
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.060
this is one of the interesting things that you don't really see here because

33
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.660
when it comes to the superheroes and the supervillains fighting each other on

34
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:32.120
the whole, all the collateral damage that gets done, right?

35
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:36.020
So buildings being torn up or being smashed and destroyed, things like that.

36
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.420
That's all handled by damage control incorporated, right?

37
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:41.810
It's a company with a government contract to clean up after the superheroes.

38
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.240
And they don't really differentiate between who did what,

39
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.700
it's just a matter of this was destroyed. And then that's it,

40
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.590
they usually use something like eye witness, evidence,

41
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.590
or video evidence or something along those lines to kind of figure out who

42
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:53.540
caused what damage. But in this instance, Cain,

43
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.140
Marco was also stuck inside that concrete for months, right?

44
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.160
Like for months on end.

45
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.590
But Spiderman is really the one that kind of brought this down.

46
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.910
Now let's not because find man was being,

47
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.670
being terrible is because that's just the nature of what happens when

48
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.610
superheroes fight supervillains. And so in the midst of this whole trial,

49
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.900
everything basically goes South.

50
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.340
And what you end up getting is the arrival of essentially a Sandman character,

51
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.860
but not the Sandman that you're used to. But before we get into that,

52
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.950
we actually end up jumping back to a few months ago and kind of get this

53
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.370
explanation of how it was that came Marco goddess powers.

54
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.490
And this is somewhat of an interesting concept that Marvel's rolling in here in

55
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.230
his journey to find a new gender,

56
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:30.440
not suit he's basically brought to North Korea. And as he gets there,

57
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:34.580
he ends up finding what is in essentially the forge of Ciroc right now the

58
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.050
forges center rack is this,

59
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:40.030
this concept designed to basically build things that are in the likenesses to

60
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.830
direct or to honor center rock. That's kind of the way this all works.

61
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:45.740
We talked about the [inaudible] the fact that said rock is one of eight demon

62
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.120
entities. Uh, that was,

63
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.300
that kind of was part of a giant competition to essentially take control of the

64
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:51.920
world and whoever it was, you know,

65
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.530
whoever's forces end up destroying the other forces. What come out on top,

66
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.180
I guess, a little more explanations needed there.

67
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.240
So what you have is the artisans, and this is basically eight demon entities.

68
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.500
Um,

69
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.560
each of which were arguing over who's the most powerful and the way this works

70
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.600
is that each one of them put an artifact on earth.

71
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.390
And when the artifact was picked up,

72
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.740
it would begin the [inaudible]. And that's what happened with Cain, Marco

73
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.740
. He pickled the Crimson, Jim of sitter, Rocky

74
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.740
 became the juggernaut, but he also started the OC test

75
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.573
. Now that whole thing came to a head and the eighth day storyline.

76
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.960
But the idea is that once the first artifact was picked up,

77
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.960
it would drive seven other people to want to grab the other artifacts.

78
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:24.480
And they internal what split humanity into eighths.

79
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.330
And then they would all go to war with each other and whichever army came out on

80
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:28.770
top, that being out there,

81
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.320
it represents that army would prove me that I was powerful one.

82
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.090
So if juggernaut basically, you know,

83
00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:36.810
wiped out all the other avatars of the other demon entities and then wiped out

84
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:38.880
all the other seven eights of humanity,

85
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.160
then it would prove that that center rack was the most powerful.

86
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:43.620
Now the eighth day event was stopped, especially because of Thor.

87
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:44.520
He had a huge hand in that,

88
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.120
but this is the reason why these kinds of forces are created is because they're

89
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:50.220
designed to honor these various entities.

90
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.100
And there's some out there like for like [inaudible] different people out there,

91
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:54.390
you know, different beings out there like that.

92
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.790
There's other forces out there and other artifacts out there,

93
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.090
we just don't really see them anymore. But when Cain Marco gets in here,

94
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:02.970
he's basically looking for a new suit and he tells the guy this and the guy's

95
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.640
like, well, people have come here looking for, you know,

96
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:08.400
something of Ciroc they're looking to serve as the host of Silverback.

97
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.890
What makes you special? And that's when Kmart reveals,

98
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.170
he's actually the juggernaut and the guy up above,

99
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.980
and you basically see that a new suit's been created out of the Crimson bands of

100
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.490
Ciroc.

101
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.790
The Crimson bands will sit a rack or historically something used by Steven

102
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:21.300
strange.

103
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.240
And that's one of the things to understand about Dr. Strange himself is he

104
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:26.700
doesn't really have any powers unto himself. Instead,

105
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.180
his powers are linked to him by other people by their lent to him by other

106
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.960
beings for center rock, for example, lens Dr. Strange, the Crimson bands.

107
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.410
Now it seems as though these Crimson bans are no longer being linked to Steven

108
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:40.560
strange because now they're being forged into a new suit of armor.

109
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.140
And that's what this guy does right now though.

110
00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:45.750
The other problem with this is that he spent all this time building this armor

111
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.650
under the belief that sit or act would see what he'd done and then see him as a

112
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:51.210
new host, right? He would say like, you know,

113
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.940
I bless you with becoming my new avatar because of the work you've put in to

114
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:57.330
make the soup. But as we know her ex kind of a jerk and that never happened,

115
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.060
it seemed like Ciroc was just waiting for Kiana Marco to return.

116
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.000
And so the two of them essentially get into a kind of scuffle, right?

117
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:06.630
But ultimately Ken Marco ends up coming out on top. And uh, in,

118
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:08.260
in his whole grip, acute fight, the,

119
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.830
the chains that are holding the suit up are basically destroyed.

120
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.550
And when that happens, the suit falls onto Kane, Marco, and bonds itself to him.

121
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.000
And he emerges as the new juggernaut. And that's how he got his new suit.

122
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.210
Now what its full capabilities are. We don't entirely know.

123
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.940
Usually whenever Marvel changes up the suit of a character,

124
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.440
especially if somebody like juggernaut,

125
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.810
because his powers come from the Crimson, Jim,

126
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.840
it stands to reason that there'll be upgrades, right? There'll be changed.

127
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.360
We saw that with Donnie Caitlin's venom, for example,

128
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.600
when venom encountered Knoll, he was awakened to a whole new host of abilities.

129
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.710
You didn't realize you had before.

130
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.590
So that's usually what ends up happening here is that things end up shifting up,

131
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.610
jumping back to the current level.

132
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.960
Right now you end up having DSL kind of holding off this Sandman S character as

133
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:47.220
best as you possibly can.

134
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.820
The funny thing about this is that the voice that's emanating from Sandman,

135
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.450
which basically says like, give me the girl and uh, and no one will get hurt.

136
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.410
This all does this voice really seems to be female. And as we know,

137
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.340
historically, Sandman as a guy, not only that this voice is German, right?

138
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:03.800
And so it doesn't look like it's the actual Sandman.

139
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:06.230
It looks like somebody who has the powers of Sandman, right?

140
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:08.660
Who took his powers or something along those lines. But then of course,

141
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:10.820
DSL kind of chimes in and says, her name is quicksand.

142
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.430
And so what you end up getting is of course, juggernaut jumping in.

143
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.370
But the funny thing about him is that much like the fights with Spider-Man,

144
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.850
you can't really fight Sandman in the traditional sense. You can't punch,

145
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.670
you know, anybody who's able to use sand in that way, because it's sad.

146
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.430
What all they do is create an opening where you fly right through them or

147
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:28.430
something like that. Instead you have to do it. Spider-Man historically dead,

148
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.940
which is used water, right? That's what you normally have to do, but came Marco.

149
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.920
Hasn't quite figured that out yet. And in fact,

150
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.120
it's not even really came Marco who figures that out instead where you have this

151
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.910
huge conflict and you have a diesel kind of watching all this unfold.

152
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.350
There's a couple of things that happen here.

153
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.260
The first is at diesel is referred to as a mute. Hence,

154
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.730
the reason why I said in the last video,

155
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.680
that's probably where she's going to end up being.

156
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.830
The second thing that's referred to here is that they basically realized that

157
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.170
she has a kind of energy source and her head.

158
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.160
And in order to basically stop her, you've got to remove her head essentially.

159
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.850
Now, again,

160
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.820
this is where things get a little murky here because we don't know if she's an

161
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.260
actual being issues,

162
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:07.760
just some kind of psychic entity that took on a energetic form and just

163
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.790
coalesced into a form of sand. And that's where we are right now.

164
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.080
We don't really know how all that works.

165
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.500
So what we do now is that they end up basically suffering this kind of energy

166
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.230
source in the head from the rest of the body. And when, when came,

167
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.320
Mark was able to pull that off when he does that kind of using this great big,

168
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.370
huge piece of metal, like a sword when he cuts it off. And basically the heads,

169
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:27.260
the girl, ah, which just kind of screwed up.

170
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.470
That's when this energy source is extracted and what is extracted,

171
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.990
there's this kind of realization. They,

172
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:35.210
they sort of go through and start analyzing it and they realize this has a

173
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:36.950
somewhat unique energy signature.

174
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.820
And at this energy center that it has come from only one particular location.

175
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.743
And when the question is,

176
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.560
where's this location coming from that it basically comes from absolution

177
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.850
solutions right now.

178
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.800
Anybody who knows anything about absolution solutions knows who it is that runs

179
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:55.970
this whole program, that their director of research is Artem Zola, right?

180
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.970
Like the old school villain. Now, before you guys are kind of like

181
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.181
[inaudible] in more recent years,

182
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.810
especially during recomenders run of captain America was actually amazing.

183
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:08.090
Like he literally had his own pocket dimension,

184
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.330
but he had sort of cultivated and creative and captain America was actually

185
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:13.130
stuck in there for time on the Mazola.

186
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:16.010
The funny thing about him is he's a highly capable scientist.

187
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.070
He's just one of these guys that largely gets ignored by Marvel,

188
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.510
which you wouldn't think would be the case,

189
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.210
especially in the aftermath of captain America, the winter soldier. Um,

190
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.430
I guess you really haven't seen a lot from Arnhem Zola since then,

191
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.270
but he's quite, quite literally one of the most dangerous minds and all of,

192
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:32.690
of Marvel comics, right? So I'm kind of curious to see where they go with this,

193
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.920
right? I'm kind of curious see what's happening.

194
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.970
But the big takeaway is that Arnhem Zola is experimenting on superhuman

195
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:38.540
prisoners.

196
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.480
So who knows what kind of forces we're going to see the juggernaut face off

197
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.150
against, which is really what I'm the most excited for with that being said,

198
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:45.560
guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

199
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.380
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys are the sub button

200
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:50.420
to become part of the Rob cork. You guys enjoy this video,

201
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.610
make sure you drop a light and that will cut you off.

202
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:54.640
