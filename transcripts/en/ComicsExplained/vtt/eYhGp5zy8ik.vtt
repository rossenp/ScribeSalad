4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.750
All right, what's going on?

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.580
<v 1>And guys, this is Rob and we are picking back up again with, uh, venom beyond,</v>

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.851
right?

7
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.180
And this is basically the start of the King and block and you guys will see what

8
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:21.650
I'm talking about. Once we get towards the end of this,

9
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.870
this is basically where King and black begins, right?

10
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:25.580
So I'm really excited about this.

11
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:28.760
And I think that what we might do sometime this week as part of a lead up to the

12
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.571
whole King and black thing,

13
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.110
is we might take all of Donnie Cates venom run and just kind of condense it down

14
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:35.060
into a full story. We'll call it like part one,

15
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.700
or like the canned black lead-up or something along those lines.

16
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.631
But something to indicate,

17
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:41.600
this is all the stuff that you need to know going into like the King and block.

18
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.530
But this basically picks up again with this alternate reality that we're in

19
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.090
earth, 10 51, whereby you have Dylan, this alternate reality version of any,

20
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.511
I'm sorry,

21
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:53.770
this alternate reality version of the son of Eddie Brock who basically conquered

22
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:58.160
the world and where Matt Gargan had been sent to the forces of Eddie for the

23
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.290
purpose of basically taking them down,

24
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.770
that he also operates as a kind of spy of sorts, right.

25
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.540
That Dylan can see through his symbionts.

26
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.960
But what we ended up seeing was that like the previous video scorpion was

27
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:09.800
essentially defeated.

28
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.120
And so this all kind of coincides with Dr. Octopus showing up to, to Dylan,

29
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.390
like codex, we'll call them codex for the sake of keeping this video simple,

30
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.340
instead of talking about two different versions of Dylan,

31
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.460
but he runs up on codex and he basically tells him that they've reverse

32
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:26.750
engineered the armor that scorpion wore when he was initially going after Eddie

33
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:28.790
Brock and using the name virus and that,

34
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:32.660
because this armor is based on the war machine, Mark three model,

35
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.900
it was created by Tony stark for James Rhodes. It includes,

36
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.810
what's basically automated environment scanning technology,

37
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:42.110
which essentially means that it scans the environment and then record the

38
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:44.720
environment. And this kind of confirms the statement of,

39
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.900
of scorpion to Kodak's when he was initially captured that he came from an

40
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:48.734
alternate reality.

41
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.740
But what's more important about this is that when it comes to alternate

42
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:54.020
realities and Marvel comics, you have, what's kind of,

43
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.710
what's been referred to historically as a kind of quantum frequency basically,

44
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:01.700
meaning that each individual universe has its own range more or less. Right?

45
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:04.250
So the way I like to use it as we talked about music, right?

46
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:07.610
So we say like the main Marvel universe is the key of C and the ultimate

47
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.780
universe might be like key. You know,

48
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:10.700
it might be like C sharp or something like that.

49
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.940
But if the main Marvel universe is in the key of C,

50
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.180
then what this means is that in order to access the main Marvel universe,

51
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.710
your quantum signal, or, or your ability to, to create a portal,

52
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.680
it means you have to resonate at the key of C as well, right?

53
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:26.060
So that's what this suit basically does.

54
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.390
This suit will at least accessing this suit and being able to reverse engineer,

55
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:31.370
it would allow Otto Octavius to in effect,

56
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.970
recreate a portal that would allow them to access the main Marvel universe.

57
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.060
And with his intelligence, it would only take them about two weeks to do.

58
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.160
And so the idea is get to work on it, right?

59
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:43.430
Because it means there'll be more worlds for Dylan to conquer. Essentially,

60
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.710
at that point, you switch over to, uh,

61
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.070
the underground laboratory of Reed Richards in this alternate reality,

62
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.060
the crazy Reed Richards, who's basically kind of talking to scorpion tonight,

63
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.450
Gargan,

64
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.880
and he really just kind of reiterated everything that we were already told.

65
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.890
And it's kinda nuts because there was, uh, an Ironman in this, and of course,

66
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.710
much like the main Marvel universe, Reed, Richards and Ironman were friends,

67
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.860
meaning that he's well-versed and, and, you know, starts technology.

68
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.550
The problem with this is that he's also insane. And so his response is, yes,

69
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.640
I can rebuild that gape, but it'll take me like five years to do,

70
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.520
but it'll take me like five years to do that because the resources are

71
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.820
exceedingly limited. If they have like all the resources available out there,

72
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.140
then sure. They'd be able to do it though,

73
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.230
between his insanity and a lack of resources, they simply just can't.

74
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.680
And so you have this moment here where they talk about the idea of going back

75
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.080
and then the response of Dylan is, but I don't want to,

76
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.320
the reason why is because Dylan never knew his mom,

77
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.790
but he never knew Anne Wayne.

78
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.000
And so being in this alternate reality where he meets her for the first time,

79
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.740
it makes sense. He doesn't want to go back. Right.

80
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.180
It makes sense that he doesn't want to leave anymore,

81
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.400
that he wants to stay here. He never knew his mom.

82
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.830
And so he's always wanting to get to know his mom.

83
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.250
He's now in a situation where he can, why would he want to give that up?

84
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.890
It's everything he ever wanted. And so with that being the case,

85
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.540
it's almost like he's kind of being forced, right?

86
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.390
Polled ripped away from this life that he wants so dearly.

87
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.680
And so with that being the case,

88
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.950
and just kind of realizes that it's turning into a kind of sentimental moment

89
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.730
and Anne has still not gotten over the fact that her son in this universe,

90
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.360
this reality, his version of Dylan became a bad guy, or he became codex.

91
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:10.390
He conquered the world and killed pretty much everybody that she cared about and

92
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:13.360
turn them into symbionts. And so she basically like tells everybody get out,

93
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.290
right? Everybody's got to go,

94
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.470
everybody go rest tomorrow where we're taking this water, my son right now,

95
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:19.870
it all kind of comes to a head when you've got, you know,

96
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.820
Anne doing her thing because she can't sleep.

97
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.990
And then Dylan shows up and the two of them have this very kind of sentimental

98
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:26.410
moment.

99
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.700
And the reason for that is because whenever codex came across her Symbion or

100
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.490
tried to contact her Semia, she would burn. But with Dylan,

101
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.560
from the main Marvel universe, that doesn't happen.

102
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.950
And the reason for that is because much like we've seen with like something like

103
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:41.680
the infinity gauntlet, which only works in its native universe,

104
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.280
Dylan codex can only control symbionts in his own universe.

105
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.270
And so any Symbion or any being this attached to symbionts outside of this

106
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:51.190
universe, codex cannot control.

107
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.130
And that's the reason why when Dylan approaches and weighing,

108
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.530
because he's from the main Marvel universe, he does not affect her.

109
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.620
Symbion in the same way he could hug her. He and he could interact with her.

110
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.440
He could treat her like a mom. And that's kind of what he says. Right. You know,

111
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:04.300
he says like, you know, when this is all said and done, like,

112
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:06.070
I don't really want to leave. I don't really want to go.

113
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.550
But if we do have to go back to my universe, then come with me, right? Like,

114
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:13.360
come with us, be my mom in that universe. It's a very touching moment, right?

115
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.240
This is especially touching. If you know the history of Anne Wayne,

116
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.610
how tragic her story's been over the years,

117
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:21.220
or at least was until they killed her off. I mean, it's, it's a very,

118
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:25.130
very intriguing thing to see here. And it's really, really cool as,

119
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:26.980
so what this does is kind of, you know,

120
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:30.520
really inspire a kind of renewed vigor inside of ant and the sense that she

121
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:33.040
realizes she can't run away from who our sons become,

122
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.040
why she can't run away from the fact that her son has become codex,

123
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.490
that her son has done terrible things. It's not necessarily to say that she has,

124
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.820
but it's kind of the impression that's being put off here is that historically

125
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:45.220
speaking, when it comes to her son, codex, sure.

126
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:46.300
She's been fighting the good fight,

127
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.540
but she's also been dreading the time at which she would actually have to take

128
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.740
him down. And this moment realizing that the man, her son could have become,

129
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.650
and if he can be saved, the man, he can still become,

130
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.260
then there's all the incentive in the world to kind of leave that fear and that

131
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.980
anxiety behind and travel head fast into facing off against this guy.

132
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.420
And that's exactly what they do.

133
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.170
The other part of this is that codex comes to the realization. Of course,

134
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:12.320
the one that we already realized that he cannot control the CMBS from alternate

135
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:16.430
realities, either much like Peter Parker and venom, he also can't detect them.

136
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.260
And so that's kind of the funny thing is that for him,

137
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.710
whenever he tries to reach out and detect the Symbion of Eddie Brock,

138
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.200
the venoms to be at this attached to him, he can't pick up on it, right?

139
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.500
Because it's not from his universe. And so, as they're,

140
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.860
they're kind of in the middle of all this,

141
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:31.550
and as auto Octavius is continuing to work on this, this portal of sorts,

142
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.480
there's a kind of an alarm that comes in and it's basically a unmanned aircraft.

143
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.610
That's basically heading towards the location.

144
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.610
And when Ottawa Octavia says that there's no life forms on board,

145
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.430
that's when it dawns on codex know there's life forms there,

146
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.720
but it's the venom Symbion right.

147
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:48.620
The one that I can't pick up and this thing comes cruising in and just smashes

148
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.450
right inside the ceiling of this place,

149
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.260
right from there and waves like everybody get in and they all go flooding into

150
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:57.350
that place. Right? Attacking everybody. They can now right off the bat,

151
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.160
Donnie Cates gives us codex versus venom. And it's a cool thing to see,

152
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.890
because this is basically like Spider-Man fighting venom, right?

153
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.710
Spiderman cannot detect the venom Symbian and that's one of the things that

154
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:09.350
makes venom so deadly for Spiderman, much like this here,

155
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.630
codex can not control the venom Sindia.

156
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.200
And so he's facing off against a very powerful person relative to himself who

157
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.520
Symbion, he cannot dominate and this fight ends incredibly fast. Right?

158
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.930
And that's one of the big differences here.

159
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.900
That's kind of the big weakness of codex is that you would look at him and you

160
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:24.590
would say, okay,

161
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.530
but a person who is able to conquer the world using symbionts surely he'd be

162
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:29.780
able to overtake venom, but there's a big difference here.

163
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.390
Eddie Brock has fought time and time again,

164
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.540
as venom with the Symbion facing off against a multitude of enemies.

165
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.080
The codex seemingly has not that I wouldn't go as far as to say that he rested

166
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:41.120
on his laurels while the world was being conquered.

167
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.780
But there's a difference between fighting some heavy hitting superheroes by

168
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:48.500
yourself and fighting a whole bunch of heavy hitting superheroes with hundreds

169
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.910
of symbionts at your side,

170
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.520
it really kind of diminishes what your accomplishments are.

171
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:55.370
It diminishes what it is that he could actually do, because for the most part,

172
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.130
he didn't really do it on his own. And so in response to that,

173
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:00.560
he basically calls him the entirety of the Avengers team.

174
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.500
They all come pouring in, right? All these Symbion Avengers guys.

175
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.760
And then while that's going on,

176
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.180
Gargan basically sneaks off grabs his virus suit. And in the moment,

177
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:12.080
when you have any Brock who seizes control of codex for the purpose of defeating

178
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:12.950
him, they would, he ends up,

179
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:17.210
continue to do is actually half his symbiotic bond itself, directly to codex.

180
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.910
And then in turn, show him this life that he could have had, right.

181
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.840
A kind of shared memory that's when virus mixes attack, right?

182
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:26.410
Not Gargan shows up or the most inconvenient time and starts attacking,

183
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.360
you know, Eddie Brock and basically says like,

184
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.760
you're going to take me back to prison once we get back there and that's not

185
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:32.770
going to happen either, I'm going to have my vengeance here,

186
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.470
or I'm not going to have it at all. But in the midst of his whole attack,

187
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.570
suddenly he shot in the back by Reed Richards,

188
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.780
who would basically use the technology of Tony stark to take down the war

189
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:42.880
machine suit. Right. So garden's, tight-knit, you know,

190
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:45.880
completely out of the picture, what this does is it leads to, uh,

191
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.820
to Eddie Brock being able to subdue codex yet again,

192
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.410
and then codex actually starts reaching out directly to, uh, to Dylan. Right.

193
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.280
And what this does is it allows a, of shared memory state,

194
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.300
and the sense of it's all the things that Dylan can basically pass through his

195
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:00.990
mother, uh,

196
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.780
and all the things she can pass through to him in terms of the life that he

197
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.960
always wanted to have with her, the life she always wanted to have with him.

198
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.810
And then Eddie Brock's memories of the life he had with his son,

199
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.000
bonding them all together. And when that happens,

200
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.030
codex gets a vision of what his life could have looked like.

201
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.680
They all kind of do, to be honest,

202
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.100
like it's really Eddie and it's and it's Dylan, and it's an weighing and it's,

203
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.910
uh, it's codex all kind of experiencing this joint memory of how life could have

204
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:27.720
been, how fantastic it could have been. But because of the decisions of codex,

205
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.510
it never happened that in the fact that that Eddie Brock took his own life,

206
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.790
those never came to fruition. And so because of that,

207
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:35.340
codex is completely overwhelmed by the experience.

208
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.680
But in turn basically gets rid of all the symbionts, right.

209
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.340
He just stops his influence over them and stops and kind of comes back to his

210
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:42.240
normal self. Now,

211
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.040
the other part of this seems to be that Knoll had an exceedingly strong grip

212
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.070
on Dylan, on codex. And so when this whole sort of short,

213
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.850
a shared memory took place and actually released him from the influence of Knoll

214
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.710
and kind of returned him back to his normal self,

215
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.710
but regardless of how you slice it, he's basically back to being a good guy.

216
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.980
Now, the problem is that he falls into, what's essentially a catatonic state,

217
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.260
right? So you jump forward by about a year or so.

218
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.380
And this is a pretty significant moment that in all this time that they've been

219
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:08.610
here, you have Dylan,

220
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.030
you have any Brock and you have Anne who have all just basically been spending

221
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:13.260
time together as a family,

222
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.600
the way that they always imagine themselves doing this,

223
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.450
that is basically a pretty chill world. And the response of all this. I mean,

224
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.540
I'm sure you probably have some small time criminals, but nothing too crazy,

225
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.180
but nothing too outrageous instead,

226
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.940
it's basically just them kind of enjoying their lives. And so, because of that,

227
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.010
there's always kind of looming on the horizon,

228
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.590
this idea that they're all going to have to go back, right.

229
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:33.420
That they're going to have to go back to their universe.

230
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.060
And so about a few months after that, with Dr. Octopus,

231
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:38.790
having had the absolute tar beat out of him by Reed to the point that he

232
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:41.250
actually started giving him information on how to build this thing,

233
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.990
that the portal's effectively finished,

234
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.130
but Anne is actually going to stay behind because with her son, her son, Dylan,

235
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.460
you know, I guess formerly codex now, Dylan kind of back in a catatonic state,

236
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:53.490
but also demonstrating that he basically, you know,

237
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.780
came back to being a good guy, right?

238
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.930
That he's more or less cured for lack of a better word that she's going to wait

239
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:01.200
until he reawakens and then try to nurse him back into, you know,

240
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.220
kind of having a normal life here, but for, for Dylan himself and for, uh,

241
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.090
for Eddie, of course,

242
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.000
they go back to the main Marvel universe where the King and block and everything

243
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.010
kicks off. And this is, what's really kind of interesting here.

244
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.970
It looks like a year has actually passed in the main Marvel universe as well.

245
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.660
And the reason why this matters is because with this one year time jump in that

246
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:20.910
period, no seems to have come back, right?

247
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.760
No return you return to in the main Marvel universe.

248
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.030
And the reason that the reason why we know this is because when they get back

249
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:30.180
there, all the stars are gone. There's nothing out there,

250
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:35.370
but absolute blackness that no has officially returned and is already

251
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:38.820
gone. The process of conquering the main Marvel universe with that being said,

252
00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:40.200
guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

253
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.950
If you are new here to come and explain,

254
