3
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.970
guys are the like button, if you enjoyed the video and yeah. Let's begin.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.540
Okay. So we are covering Spider-Man, but.

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.670
<v 1>Here's something that I want to throw out there real quick, right.</v>

6
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:18.980
Because I know some people are going to ask the question, Rob,

7
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.790
didn't you cover this already? What I covered was Spider-Man too. Uh,

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.380
here's the important thing about this, right?

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.630
Spider-Man is probably one of the most important.

10
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.350
<v 0>Spider-Man stories I'd say of the last 15 years. Okay.</v>

11
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.340
<v 1>The reason why is,</v>

12
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:36.260
because this is the story where Peter Parker first met miles Morales. Right? So,

13
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.130
um, one of the things that we've talked about here over the course of,

14
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:41.390
of really some of the miles Morales videos that we've done,

15
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.390
and a lot of the Peter Parker videos that we did is we kind of talked about the

16
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:47.120
nature of the ultimate universe, right? So if you guys are familiar with this,

17
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:49.610
we just finished a video yesterday where we talked about that in the miles

18
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.530
Morales one. Right? So just kind of bear with me, right.

19
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:52.970
We'll probably have some new people to the channel.

20
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.160
I know you guys kind of like to get directly into it,

21
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:58.400
but bear with me for a second while I kind of, I kind of reiterate this, uh,

22
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.760
for, for the people who are new here, but who are new to Marvel comics, um,

23
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.220
and Marvel, you have a great, big, huge multi-verse right?

24
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.830
Technically the Marvel cinematic universe it's considered part of the

25
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.440
multi-verse that makes up all of Marvel comics. Uh,

26
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.000
we know that for a couple of different reasons. One,

27
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:14.690
because it actually has a numerical designation among the Marvel multi-verse and

28
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.370
two, because there's comics based on it. Right.

29
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:18.980
So that kind of brings it closer in line with being part of the Marvel

30
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.560
multi-verse, but where you had Marvel comics,

31
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:23.900
as it was originally launched in the 1960s, right.

32
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.030
With the fantastic four number one and so on and so forth,

33
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.820
that's referred to as earth six, one six, right.

34
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.840
Also known as the main Marvel universe. What we got in,

35
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.060
in the year 2000 was the creation of the ultimate universe.

36
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.590
And this was an answer to the question.

37
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.370
What would it look like if at that point in time in the year 2000 superheroes

38
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.840
had just basically popped up, right?

39
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.720
They just kind of emerged for the very first time. Uh, what would the,

40
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.940
what would those superheroes look like? How would they function? How it,

41
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:47.960
all that stuff worked. Ah,

42
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.930
and that's basically where you got Peter Parker in the ultimate universe.

43
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.470
Now ultimate Spider-Man was exceedingly popular, right?

44
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:58.010
It was hugely popular because in a lot of ways it was kind of an indirect

45
00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:58.641
reboot, right?

46
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:01.730
Marvel didn't really reboot everything with the main Marvel universe Spider-Man

47
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.980
they just gave us a new one and people loved it. Right.

48
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:04.940
People absolutely loved it.

49
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.240
But what you saw was a story where basically Peter Parker died, right?

50
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:11.240
Peter Parker Spider-Man was killed and it might be who of us to go back and

51
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.960
cover that event. Right? Cover, uh, cataclysm and the death of, of Peter Parker.

52
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:16.970
Right. It might be who of us to do that? Just because, you know,

53
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.670
we're kind of doing a lot of this stuff because the new Spider-Man games coming

54
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:20.840
out for the PlayStation. Ah,

55
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.660
but the idea is that when that version of Peter Parker died, uh,

56
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.670
we ended up getting miles Morales and his place.

57
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.610
And when miles Morales first showed up, there was a lot of naysayers.

58
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.890
There were a lot of people who were just kind of like, Mozzerella sucks.

59
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:33.740
He's not really Spiderman. He's not really Peter Parker. That kind of a thing,

60
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.900
because it kind of came from a couple of different places.

61
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.050
A lot of fans were latched onto the idea of Peter Parker,

62
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.900
even when they were reading him before the ultimate universe was launched.

63
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:42.081
Right.

64
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:45.530
So all they really got was just another alternate reality version of Peter and

65
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.050
they loved it. A lot of people grew attached to Peter Parker.

66
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.590
Spider-Man in the ultimate universe when that was their first place to start in

67
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.424
Marvel comics,

68
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.220
but by whatever manner and whatever means a lot of people just didn't want.

69
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.560
<v 0>To see things change. This story is.</v>

70
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 1>In a lot of ways, kind of Brian, Michael snubbing,</v>

71
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:02.500
people who were naysayers of miles, Morales, right. Uh,

72
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.520
people who were just like this,

73
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:05.500
this carrot is not going to last or anything like that.

74
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.840
It was kind of been just, just being like, no, he will, well,

75
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.310
he's going to be around for a long time.

76
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.780
And that's really where this comes from.

77
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:13.810
And I tell you that because it's important that you understand the historical

78
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.240
context of the story as we get into it.

79
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.840
So you can understand why the story is considered to be so important with all

80
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:23.640
that out of the way, just jumped to the main story itself. Uh,

81
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.760
and so what we ended up getting here is picking up in the main Marvel universe

82
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.730
or six one six with Peter, for Spider-Man and it's Peter Parker,

83
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:31.800
just kind of doing this stuff that Peter Parker does, right?

84
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.080
Like swinging around, coming across some criminals,

85
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.030
some guys who were doing some things they're not supposed to do.

86
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.330
But here's the funny thing about this because of the fact this story was written

87
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.220
as a way to kind of tie into,

88
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.100
or kind of bring together the ultimate universe and the main Marvel universe.

89
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.120
This story was written in such a way to where it was designed to treat people as

90
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:50.280
if they're aware of who Spider-Man is,

91
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.200
but they don't really know much about him. Right.

92
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:54.090
They don't really know a whole lot about the character, right?

93
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:56.130
So it was kind of reiterating the nature of Peter Parker.

94
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.320
And that's one of the things that you see in Marvel comics.

95
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.350
There are certain characters out there who people know who they are, right.

96
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:04.230
People know who iron man is. Now people know who Spider-Man is.

97
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:06.440
People know who Wolverine is, but knowing,

98
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.290
knowing who the character is and understanding the history and the context of

99
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.920
the character are two distinctly different. Thanks. You know,

100
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:16.260
so a lot of people know who iron man is,

101
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.960
but I doubt they really know anything about the Mandarin or I doubt they know

102
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.350
about stories like demon in a bottle and why it's so important. Uh, what is it,

103
00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:25.380
the five nightmares run by Matt fraction, different things like that. Right?

104
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:27.450
Arno stark, Kieran Guillen's run a lot of people,

105
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:29.130
probably aren't really familiar with that.

106
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:32.730
So the idea is that we're just kind of given Peter Parker in terms of how Peter

107
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.350
Parker operates,

108
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.210
which just to say kind of amusing to himself about how much he loves New York

109
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:37.410
city and the fact that New York,

110
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.830
city's kind of like a thinking breathing entity, right?

111
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.790
That there are so many facets to this city.

112
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:44.730
You've got people who have their nose to the ground and they're just grinding

113
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:46.650
day in and day out just trying to make it by.

114
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.680
You've got people who are just super high up in their ivory, ivory towers,

115
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:49.831
you know,

116
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.500
the Tony Stark's the Reed Richards who don't really have to worry about small

117
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.740
time things. Right. But you can kind of have everybody who falls in between.

118
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.880
And there's just so many different varying types of people in the city of New

119
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.540
York that is just so unique in that way. It also has, uh, criminals,

120
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.970
there's criminals in New York city and Spiderman goes to visit some,

121
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.180
and he basically Wallops them one or two times shows him what for,

122
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.550
and then of course, pulling over the vehicle, you know,

123
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:16.410
which was their getaway car. And as soon as he's there,

124
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:18.720
he's met by the arrival of the cops, right. And the cops are just like,

125
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.210
take off your mask, shoulders, your face. You know, that, that kind of a thing.

126
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:25.320
Now the truth about this is I was never really part and parcel to this kind of

127
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:27.060
depiction of Spider-Man of Peter Parker.

128
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.850
And the reason why is because you have had stories over the years,

129
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.570
years where J Jonah Jameson and the daily bugle have kind of managed to sort of

130
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:34.530
turn, you know, the,

131
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:37.560
the idea of Spiderman into something where he can't really be trusted.

132
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.680
He's a minister, but the, the long and short of it is that over the year,

133
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.680
Spiderman was largely trusted by society. Right. You know,

134
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.990
your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man he was the good guy, right.

135
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:47.490
He was largely trusted in that way.

136
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.890
There have been times where it's waxed and waned, but in this,

137
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.050
since I kind of feel like it should have been one of those things where it's

138
00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:54.780
like, thanks, Spiderman, you know, and then that's kind of it right now,

139
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.700
the fact that the cops show up here and he's behind the,

140
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.810
behind the wheel of a getaway car, might give him a little reason to be sus.

141
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.120
Right. But I'm a why I say that all the time, Mariah started saying,

142
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.090
so now I say it all the time. Right? Like suss, so weird word. But anyway, uh,

143
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.870
once he takes off and he kind of, you know, goes and does his thing,

144
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.340
he ends up finding this building, you know, this kind of a, this,

145
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:16.660
this office building basically where the, the, the river has been shattered,

146
00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:18.190
right? The glass has been shattered. And he's kinda like,

147
00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:19.270
that's a little weird now, of course,

148
00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:22.060
he ends up being drawn to that location because of a giant, bright light,

149
00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:24.820
almost kind of an explosion of sorts. And of course, once he gets there,

150
00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:27.130
like the whole place kind of seems to be tarnished, right?

151
00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:28.810
And there's just this white light or this,

152
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.540
this bright light emanating from it all now, as he gets in there.

153
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:33.580
And as he starts investigating his initial thought,

154
00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:35.380
is this energy sources a little weird.

155
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.740
Now this story was released about a year after Spider-Man big time.

156
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:40.120
And for those of you guys who aren't really familiar,

157
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.980
if you ever wanted to get into Spiderman,

158
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.710
I always suggest people start with big time. We have that,

159
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:46.240
that whole series covered on my channel.

160
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.280
And big time was a sort of Dan slots run.

161
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.070
You had Spiderman and you had Mary Jane who were like married and all that kind

162
00:06:51.071 --> 00:06:52.540
of stuff. And then you got one more day.

163
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:55.810
Then you got brand new day where Marvel basically nullified it all because that

164
00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:58.570
was just so poorly received. Big time was kind of,

165
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.610
Marvel's huge shift with Peter Parker, right?

166
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:03.370
Focusing on like an all new age for Peter Parker Spider-Man,

167
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.140
but that's kind of the good place to start, right?

168
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:09.340
Because dance lot's run begins with that and runs all the way up through secret

169
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:12.940
Wars and after secret Wars into clone conspiracy. Right? So it's a,

170
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:17.020
it's like a 10, almost 15 year long run of Spider-Man. It's very,

171
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.990
very lengthy, but I think it's also incredibly good.

172
00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:22.000
I think it's an amazing run on Spiderman,

173
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.690
but the whole idea behind this is that, uh, that,

174
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:26.410
that this takes place about a year after that. Now,

175
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:30.220
the reason why I mentioned that is because I'm not entirely parcel a partial to

176
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:31.630
how does this handle by Bendis right.

177
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.040
Bendis is notorious for running a character and then pretending like nothing

178
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:37.510
anybody did ever happen. Right.

179
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:39.700
And it's just like the only things that matter what this character is,

180
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:42.490
what I'm doing here and ignoring continuity in its entirety. Now,

181
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:45.430
whether it's kind of Venice is always that way. I'm not a hundred percent sure.

182
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.920
I wasn't really reading Bendis back when he was part of a,

183
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:50.560
of a vet publications with Jimmy Paul and the audio and joker Sadik,

184
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.650
I wasn't really reading him back then. I only really got familiar with Brian,

185
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:56.590
Michael Bendis once he actually came into main Marvel itself and was writing

186
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.440
like new Avengers, right. A new Avengers was a wholly new thing.

187
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.850
So he could kind of get away with that.

188
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.400
It's something that I think maybe a result of the, of his,

189
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:05.800
like his huge amount of popularity. And it's kinda like I'm Bendis,

190
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.120
I can do whatever the heck I want.

191
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.500
I don't know if that's really the case or not,

192
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.500
but the reason why that matters is because during Spider-Man big time,

193
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.070
Peter Parker's intelligence had always kind of been downplayed by Marvel comics,

194
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:15.280
right.

195
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.150
They never really kind of elevated Peter Parker to being on par with like Reed

196
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.610
Richards or Tony stark. You always kind of knew he was,

197
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.950
but they never really did any of that form. Instead,

198
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.770
what you ended up getting here is Peter Parker kind of looking at this and just

199
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:28.510
be like, man, this is weird. He's like, it's not,

200
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:30.520
it's not anything alien in nature. Uh,

201
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.190
maybe I should get ahold of like Tony stark or Reed Richards or something like

202
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:34.360
that. During big time.

203
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:37.360
One of the big things that Dan Slott did was focused on the intelligence of

204
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:39.850
Peter Parker and in being like Peter Parker is actually pretty,

205
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.690
dag-gone smart and he doesn't always need Reed Richards or Tony stark to solve a

206
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:44.620
problem on his own.

207
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.380
That was kind of solidified in a story where there was like a bomb that was

208
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:49.420
going to go off and nobody else could diffuse it.

209
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.250
And Peter Parker was the one who did right.

210
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:53.340
So it was kind of elevating his intelligence up and,

211
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.970
and basically telling the reader base, Hey, Peter,

212
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.240
Parker's not as dumb as he's being made out to be, you know, he's,

213
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.970
he's not just a Spider-Man right. He's a super intelligent guy.

214
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.780
Let's start treating him that way. So not entirely partial on how this works,

215
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:05.550
but as you start to navigating this room,

216
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:08.520
he starts to realize all this stuff belongs to Mysterio,

217
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.840
but all these things belong to him.

218
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.300
And that's when Mysterio tries to sneak up behind Peter and attack him.

219
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.000
And of course, Peter Parker, spider sense goes off any basically ends up,

220
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:15.570
you know, kind of,

221
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.390
kind of being aware that he's about to be attacked and manages to Dodge out of

222
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.770
the way now with Mysterio.

223
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:22.380
And one thing that a lot of you guys are probably aware of after having seen

224
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:24.480
Spider-Man far from home Mysterio is a legitimate,

225
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.950
credible threat to Peter Parker, right?

226
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.200
He's probably one of Peter Parker's most dangerous villains,

227
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:31.500
his ability to cast solutions to basically trick Peter Parker and his spider,

228
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.990
since it can be pretty difficult to overcome the stereo.

229
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.910
And that's one of the reasons why you have, you know,

230
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.080
Peter Parker kind of saying here,

231
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:41.550
like I've got to get this guy down as fast as I can because this guy is a real

232
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.510
and serious threat.

233
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.650
The other part of this is that Mysterio keeps rambling on about how like Peter

234
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.130
Parker's ruining things and he's kind of destroying things and so on and so

235
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.110
forth. And then he goes, as far as to say, like,

236
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:53.880
you have no idea what you're dealing with, right?

237
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:55.560
You have no idea what I'm capable of. Ah,

238
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.610
I missed out when you died the first time. I'm not going to miss out this time.

239
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.900
Right. So right off the bat,

240
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:05.310
our cue is that this is some kind of ability for Mysterio to actually look

241
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.520
through into the ultimate universe where that version of Peter Parker dive and

242
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:12.300
Mysterio wants to be in that universe or Peter Parker doesn't exist. Right?

243
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.580
His main nemesis, the person that always foiled his plans,

244
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.700
he just trying to find a way to escape. And so what you end up getting here is,

245
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.790
is Peter just kind of looking at this and saying like, like, what is this thing?

246
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.190
What is this some kind of a power generator or whatever this is,

247
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.390
it's weird that this is here,

248
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:27.360
but like I can call people that can basically break this down and take this

249
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:29.460
thing apart. So we don't really have to worry about it. Right? Well,

250
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.330
Peter Parker doesn't really know what's going on with this device.

251
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.960
He knows enough about mysterial to know it's probably not a good thing, right?

252
00:10:35.961 --> 00:10:39.020
Like when supervillains start doing weird things that you don't understand,

253
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.470
you can usually just assume it's bad and you're not usually wrong in doing that

254
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.580
is a good rule of thumb to have. But of course in his desperation,

255
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.260
Mysterio ends up grabbing,

256
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.950
grabbing a handgun and firing it off and then missing Peter Parker and hitting

257
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.620
his device. And when that happens, he's yanked through, right.

258
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:57.680
Peter has seemingly yanked through, into basically the ultimate universe.

259
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.500
And this is the first time. One of the reasons why this is so big,

260
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.311
this is the very,

261
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:05.120
very first time in the history of Marvel comics that a character from the main

262
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:08.600
Marvel universe crossed over into the ultimate universe, right? This was a huge,

263
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.930
now the ultimate universe, it exists now in Marvel comics,

264
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.440
but it's nowhere near as big you'll as it was back in like the early to mid two

265
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:18.500
thousands, right around the time. And even really in the early 2000 tens,

266
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:19.580
when this story was written, ah,

267
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.980
this is when the ultimate universe was really kind of at its prime,

268
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.480
depending on, you know, what you were reading.

269
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.150
There was a lot of fall off after the death of Peter Parker. You know,

270
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:28.010
we can't really, you know, that's just an absolute thing.

271
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:29.180
We can't really argue that point,

272
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.540
but the death of Peter Parker and the ultimate universe actually made headlines,

273
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.060
tried to make national news headlines. And so because of that,

274
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:37.130
there was a lot of interest in the ultimate universe.

275
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.320
And so it was really a great time to capitalize on that, right.

276
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:42.380
To kind of give us this story, but this is a big deal when this first happened.

277
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.230
And so as Peter Parker's there, he's like, okay, this is weird.

278
00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:47.600
Like it's suddenly daytime. Uh, I don't know what that great big,

279
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:49.880
huge building is over there. That's the true, Scalian that great, big,

280
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:53.410
huge tower looking thing off in the water. You guys probably recognize true.

281
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.930
Scalian from, uh, captain America, the winter soldier,

282
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.920
that's where this comes from.

283
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.280
That's why we say the Marvel cinematic universe is a combination of the ultimate

284
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:02.980
universe, the main Marvel universe in earth, 98,

285
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:04.780
where the heroes age in real time, uh,

286
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.120
it's kind of a combination of those three things,

287
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.330
but he has of traveling back to the building where, uh, where, where you had,

288
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.280
you know, the whole, um, immuno Mysterio,

289
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.740
his base of operations and everything popping off. And, uh,

290
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.320
and he basically ends up breaking into the place only to find out that it's

291
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.050
occupied with some girl in a towel. And he's like my bed,

292
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.670
it basically bails out right. Ends up taking off from there.

293
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:27.130
He actually ends up rescuing a guy who's, you know, kind of being, uh,

294
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.120
being beat up a little bit.

295
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.580
He takes out the two of the two people who were beating this dude up.

296
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.160
And he basically says, we're just playing pool.

297
00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:33.210
And then suddenly they jumped him.

298
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.100
But the fact that he's wearing a Peter parser,

299
00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:38.820
a Peter Parker costume wearing a Spiderman costume does not go unnoticed by the

300
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:41.430
sky. And he's like, look, I appreciate you saving me, but like,

301
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.250
it's really in bad taste for you to wear that costume right now.

302
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.220
What's more so than that. He's like, you know, we all need heroes,

303
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.020
but that was Peter Parker's costume.

304
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.940
And that's one of the big things to know when Peter Parker died and, and,

305
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:55.010
and even Peter Parker is Spiderman. His identity was known like when,

306
00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:57.960
when all that popped off, his identity was known to the world. People were like,

307
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.830
the world needs to know that this is the kid who,

308
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:02.130
who tried to save everybody who died a hero.

309
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.180
That's why the death of Peter Parker was so massive in the ultimate universe,

310
00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:07.590
right? Like, imagine, for example,

311
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.160
that like in the main Marvel universe and Marvel comics did Ironman dies and

312
00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:12.360
it's this great big,

313
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:17.220
huge event that crosses over every single comic that they have. Right.

314
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.050
It's like the death of Ironman, you know,

315
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.710
the incredible Hulk and the captain America tie in and all that kind of stuff,

316
00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:22.891
right?

317
00:13:22.891 --> 00:13:27.540
Like everything ties into just the fact that iron man died and how everybody's

318
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.080
coping with it. That's what the death of Peter Parker was. It was just huge.

319
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.010
It was massive because Spider-Man had never actually been killed off in Marvel

320
00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:37.890
comics with no intention of bringing him back. Right.

321
00:13:37.891 --> 00:13:39.510
That's just never happened before. Right. I mean,

322
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.580
I kind of tried it with the clone saga,

323
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.400
but that was never going to happen with the ultimate universe.

324
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.320
It's the way it is. Peter Parker has been dead, you know,

325
00:13:46.321 --> 00:13:50.040
he's like the Peter Parker Spider-Man concept is dead and miles Morales had

326
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:53.220
taken it over and has been that way ever since. So it was kind of a big deal.

327
00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:54.510
It was a huge deal when it happened.

328
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.960
But this guy that the fact that this guy reveals that they know who Peter Parker

329
00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:01.320
is really throws like the main Marvel universe, Peter Parker off,

330
00:14:01.321 --> 00:14:05.700
because his identity is something that he keeps insanely close guarded right now

331
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.170
in the, in, in civil war.

332
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:09.510
He revealed it to the world just as kind of a proof of the,

333
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.510
that he trusted Ironman superhero registration. But of course,

334
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.580
as we saw in the aftermath of that brand new day,

335
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.670
that Dr. Strange came along and just magic everybody's memory of,

336
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.510
of Peter Parker's identity out of their heads. Right. He's just like magic.

337
00:14:21.511 --> 00:14:24.150
And then nobody remembered that Peter Parker was Spider-Man and that was

338
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:25.920
essentially it. Right? That was, that was basically it.

339
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.150
That's probably what they're going to end up doing in Spiderman. But the,

340
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:32.850
the whole point behind this is that this throws Peter Parker for a loop,

341
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.970
because he's kind of like, okay, that's crazy. Like wherever it is,

342
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.670
they're referring to me in the third person. So one,

343
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.550
this guy doesn't know who I am, but he knows who Peter Parker is.

344
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.400
So that means there was a Peter Parker here in this place,

345
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.170
what in the world is going on right now?

346
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.830
And so what is happening is he's ultimately met by the, we are rival of miles,

347
00:14:49.831 --> 00:14:53.510
Morales and miles Morales pops up. And he's just like, no way, right?

348
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:55.190
Because to the eyes of miles Morales,

349
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.590
this is the ultimate universe version of Peter Parker. It's like,

350
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.380
Peter Parker has come back. That's what kind of blew things off. Right?

351
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:03.620
That's what drives that. That's what makes miles Morales kind of go nuts here.

352
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.750
But with that being said, guys, we're going to bring this video to an end.

353
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.390
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

354
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:10.700
button to become part of the Rob court. You guys enjoyed this video.

355
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.580
Make sure you drop a light. Now we'll catch you all later.
