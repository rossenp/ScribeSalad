guys hit the like button, if you enjoyed the video and yeah, let's begin.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.760
All right, what's going on guys. This is Rob and we are covering, uh,

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.800
the first issue of soar now. Um.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.520
<v 1>I'm not really sure what direction this is all going to go in.</v>

7
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:23.360
And the reality is there's so much happening in X or not really even actually

8
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.610
swords in Dawn of X already. Um,

9
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.000
this might be one of the stories that we do where we only really cover it in

10
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:29.900
volumes, right?

11
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:32.810
So we'll cover this first issue and then we won't really cover it again until we

12
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:33.621
pick up with when,

13
00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:36.500
until it concludes with the first arc and then we'll cover all the rest of it,

14
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.230
you know, and kind of call it like a conclusion or part two, whatever it is.

15
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.730
But I do think it's important to establish that this is here because what this

16
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.750
is doing is it's moving the whole idea of Precoa and the mutant population

17
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.630
beyond earth and focusing more on the stars. Now,

18
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:53.780
the funny thing about this is that this is written by Al Ewing and in recent

19
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.990
years, Al Ewing has kind of become the new Dan Adams, right?

20
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.320
Those guys who don't know what that means for years leading up to like 2006.

21
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.680
When I say years, I mean like decades, Marvel's whole, uh,

22
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:07.340
I guess space escapades, their space opera was usually sort of, uh,

23
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.460
hit by different people here and there, but it was never really cohesive. Right?

24
00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:13.040
So you go back and you read the old Jim Starlin warlock stories,

25
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.410
or the old Jim Starlin Thanos, silver surfer stories.

26
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.360
Then you see a lot of space, very escapades there.

27
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.230
You had stories involving Wendell Vaughn as quasar. You had stories involving,

28
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.870
uh, captain Marvel himself, right. Marvel of the Creek,

29
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.590
but you didn't really have any kind of cohesiveness there. You had story arcs,

30
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.831
right?

31
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:32.060
So you had like infinity war or infinity gauntlet or the infinity crusade or

32
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:33.680
something like that. But in 2006,

33
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:37.820
Dan admin basically took the entirety of everything going on in space and Marvel

34
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.750
and consolidated all of it down into a story called annihilation and

35
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:45.230
annihilation led into an Eilish and conquest, which led into this great, big,

36
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:48.740
huge expansion of all the spacefaring operas that Marvel had going on.

37
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.860
So that's why you saw stories like rise and fall of the [inaudible] empire,

38
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.611
where Vulcan,

39
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.760
who was the third summer's brother in Omega level mutant left earth and took

40
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:56.870
over the Shar empire.

41
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:59.600
Then you had the war of Kings realm of Kings different things like that.

42
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.960
But Al Ewing in a lot of ways seems to be the guy that Marvel turns to for

43
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:04.550
writing things that have to do with space.

44
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.030
But what also want to do here is offer a bit of exposition in terms of sword.

45
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.900
So sword is this organization that was created by Josh Weeden back in

46
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:12.381
astonishing.

47
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:16.130
X-Men really just Wieden and John Cassidy back with astonishing X-Men and the

48
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:17.060
return of Colossus,

49
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:20.600
but the whole purpose behind this is that if shield monitors threats on earth,

50
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.700
then sword monitors threats to space.

51
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.240
And so it basically stands for the Sinti of world observation and response

52
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.170
directorate. And the,

53
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.600
the whole purpose is to just monitor threats that are out there that are

54
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.530
potential threats to earth, but also stand as a kind of kind of ambassador,

55
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.970
right? So if there were a great, big,

56
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.210
huge coming together of all the different alien races that exist out there in

57
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:41.300
Marvel comics, then Abigail brand would represent the solar system, right?

58
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:44.180
So you'd have like a representative for the CR and a representative for the

59
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.790
Cree. And the representative for the scrolls are really the Korean,

60
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.980
the scrolls now because they've, they've joined forces,

61
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.310
but all the different alien races that are out there and then Abigail brand

62
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.210
would represent humanity in the salt system, right in the Milky way. Galaxy, um,

63
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.910
the idea behind sword is that for a long time, it was, I mean, it was,

64
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.160
it had some okay moments here and there, but during the incursions,

65
00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.560
right during Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and new Avengers,

66
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.970
and in the aftermath of that,

67
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.050
that sword was effectively rebranded into what became the alpha flight

68
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.870
directorate or off of Fred protocol program or whatever you want to call it

69
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.370
with. Carol Danvers went in show.

70
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.820
This was an attempt by Marvel to elevate the popularity of Carol Danvers.

71
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.400
It didn't really work. The story just really wasn't that great.

72
00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:22.470
And it just really wasn't written all that well.

73
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.920
And so that kind of lasted until the empire event that we recently saw to

74
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.570
include that we didn't finish because it sucked.

75
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.260
But what you ended up getting is this segment whereby Abigail brand basically

76
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:32.610
quit the alpha flight program.

77
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.720
And the reason why is because alpha flight was a reactionary organization,

78
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.430
they would wait until a threat got there.

79
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:41.370
And then they would react that in the fact that the superheroes would never give

80
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:44.430
any information to the alpha flight program because sword success came in.

81
00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:48.090
The fact that sword could happen to all the information available to shield and

82
00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:50.670
like the NSA and the FBI and the CIA,

83
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.120
and even the various other superhero groups that would all funnel information to

84
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.000
sword to basically say, Hey, look, uh, like I summoned Galactus,

85
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.120
he's going to be stopping by, right. So he's not going to be a threat, just FYI,

86
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.850
don't shoot him with your big lasers. Otherwise you'll kill us off.

87
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.631
That was kind of what,

88
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:06.060
like the fantastic four would do or something along those lines. Um,

89
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.470
and so because of that, well, what were your,

90
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.680
what did basically have here is we don't really know the current state of the

91
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:13.050
alpha flight program. It seems to still exist.

92
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.900
I wouldn't be surprised if Manuel does kind of Whitely phases it out.

93
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:18.300
Like it's just never really seen or heard from again, I mean,

94
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:19.620
we have referenced here, right?

95
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:22.350
So it seems to exist only in so far as Abigail brand quit.

96
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.100
But if the alpha flight program still exists, then sword has become,

97
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.150
I'm an extension of the mutant population because Abigail brand is a mutant that

98
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:33.240
has the ability to speak and understand any language similar to cipher,

99
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.760
but it's kind of like an alien language,

100
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.720
just not every language in existence ever.

101
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.560
Then what this basically means is that sword operates on behalf of Precoa.

102
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.470
And that's why this opens up with Magneto showing up here,

103
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.400
because soar now operating as an extension of Precoa kind of falls under the

104
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:48.510
purview of Coca-Cola.

105
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:52.650
And that's why Abigail brand being here she's being returned as the leader of

106
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.550
sword. Right?

107
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.710
Because she was originally the leader when the group was first introduced by

108
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.160
Josh Sweden. And she's really was really kind of a return to familiarity, right?

109
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:02.580
She's white back where she belongs more or less now for cables part in the

110
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:04.140
aftermath of the 10 of swords event,

111
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.900
he's actually been elevated to the chief of security for sword.

112
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.170
But the funny thing about this is that a lot of people, and even with Magneto,

113
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.410
a lot of people don't really fully grasp the power of Magneto.

114
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.140
And it's one of these things where whenever you see him use his abilities,

115
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.960
you don't usually see him do it unlike a broad scale, right?

116
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.630
You don't really see him do like some Breezy's super ridiculous.

117
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.360
It's usually something like smaller nuanced stories,

118
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.820
maybe some kind of interesting set of circumstances,

119
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.220
but cable's mind is totally blown when,

120
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:33.360
while he's talking to Magneto and Magneto is having this conversation and

121
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:36.870
talking about the whole basis behind like the sword peak is what is called the

122
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:39.540
base operations for sword. It's called the peak Wallace called that, you know,

123
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:41.970
while, while there we're having this discussion and all that kind of stuff,

124
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.980
Magneto basically takes this 10,000 tons space station and changes it and like

125
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:50.550
moves it and puts it in a place more in line with worker Cola believes it should

126
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:52.800
be, he just doing it as an arbitrary thing. Well,

127
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:55.500
he's literally doing multiple things at the same time, right?

128
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:58.910
So like where you may find yourself something where like you aimlessly play with

129
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:02.000
something in your hands, right. Or you might tap a pencil while you talk,

130
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.580
imagine a sort of tapping that pencil, having a conversation.

131
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.560
And then thinking about a few things at the same time,

132
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.800
you're moving a 10,000 times space station across space.

133
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.490
That's basically Magneto. Now we have seen him do crazy things like that, right?

134
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.370
Like we've seen him pull like a bullet from sheer space, right.

135
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.290
Just yank it towards earth or something along those lines.

136
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.600
I think Katie pride was inside. I don't remember off the top of my head.

137
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.930
We've seen some crazy demonstrations of his power and this is yet another one.

138
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.240
Right. It's just been a while since we've seen that.

139
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.420
But that's the thing like Magneto's power is extreme, right? It's,

140
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.950
it's crazy how powerful he is.

141
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.220
And that's why I've always advocated for the idea that while I don't know if

142
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.390
it's explicitly been stated,

143
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:38.960
I don't remember if Jonathan Hickman modified this when he listed the new Omega

144
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:41.060
level mutants in Marvel comics, but Magneto,

145
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.600
if he's not listed already needs to be one, right. He's just that powerful.

146
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.470
Now from there, Magneto basically gets a tour of where things stand with the,

147
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.510
with the sword space station itself.

148
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.650
And we actually ended up picking up with a guy by the name of a Takeshi Matsuda,

149
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.980
right. To Kashi Matsuda. This guy is old school, right?

150
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.800
So he originally appeared back in the old exterminator comics, um,

151
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.060
really the exterminators, uh, in 19 1888. And he's been around for a long,

152
00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:04.630
long time.

153
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.740
I think as big as his claim to fame really came when he served on generation X.

154
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.180
So like Emma fros own X-Men team back in the day, uh, we're in a process,

155
00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:14.350
started out as a villain and she had her hellions team.

156
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.230
Eventually the hellions were destroyed and she ended up allying herself with

157
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:20.890
Charles Xavier and then lead generation X as their own personal X-Men team.

158
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:21.880
Like her own personal new music,

159
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.360
more or less to Kashi is one of these guys where he can basically kind of

160
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.810
control and really manipulate things that are part of a machine.

161
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.470
But the way the model explains this is not true just in technological fashion,

162
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.980
right? So it's not like he's a Tony stark type character that's really empower.

163
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.821
He basically,

164
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:40.390
anything that works as part of a greater cohesive unit is considered to be part

165
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.720
of a machine, right? So if you had like six mutants,

166
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.330
all of whose powers complemented themselves then to catch,

167
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.380
he could basically use that uses mutant powers and find the most optimal way for

168
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:53.440
those mutant powers to work in unison. That's kind of how this whole thing,

169
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.770
how this whole thing works. So biotechnology, uh, human technology,

170
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.140
any form of technology he can effectively manipulate.

171
00:07:59.141 --> 00:08:02.860
So its powers are pretty extreme because it goes beyond just like, you know,

172
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:06.370
I can understand how this robot works and I can reverse engineer iron man's

173
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:09.670
armor. And it, it moves way beyond that. Right? So if you put him,

174
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:12.550
I would wager that if you put them in charge of the Avengers or even just the

175
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:15.010
X-Men right, if, if like the X-Men had to go to war,

176
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.460
they would probably end up hitting up Takeshi and saying, here's our roster.

177
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.040
How would these mutant powers best work together? And he's like, well, I mean,

178
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:23.980
because you guys are working as kind of a well-oiled machine, so to speak,

179
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.860
then this guy should do this and she should do that and they should do this.

180
00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:29.650
And like these four people should fight together and those six people should

181
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:32.470
fight together. And that kind of thing. Now we don't know the full depth of it,

182
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:33.251
the full brunt of it,

183
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:36.490
Marvel never really bothered to explain the full depths of what the cashier was

184
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:40.390
capable of. Um, we, we will probably end up seeing that over time, but again,

185
00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:43.510
he's kind of the guy that's sort of helping to keep the space station together.

186
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:45.010
He kind of works as the control center.

187
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:47.080
So like the brain of the space station more or less,

188
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.510
but we kind of get this continued bit of a,

189
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.780
of an explanation for this continued bit of a tour with everything going on.

190
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.280
And that's when Abigail brand really kind of hits on the big reason why she left

191
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.490
alpha flight. And the big explanation given here is,

192
00:08:58.491 --> 00:09:01.200
is really kind of what we've already reiterated that with alpha flight,

193
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:03.870
they never really had the resources to do what they want it to do. Right?

194
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.440
The alpha flight was a publicly available government sanctioned superhero,

195
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:09.960
or really a, I guess, a space station kind of program,

196
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.710
but they never really had the right resources back in the day.

197
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.030
She'll had a blank paycheck.

198
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.390
They had whatever they needed to do to achieve anything at any point in time.

199
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.360
It's what made the old school. Nick fury such a dangerous Scott,

200
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.480
as he gets happen to any database, he had all the money in the world.

201
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.090
Nobody would ever really say no to him. And so because of that,

202
00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:29.570
they could achieve virtually anything sort of had that when Abigail brand was

203
00:09:29.571 --> 00:09:32.780
initially running it when it first popped up, but when it became awful flight,

204
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.180
then suddenly there were just massive limitations on it.

205
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.740
And it couldn't really fulfill its charter.

206
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.750
And so once she's retaken over everything,

207
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.840
he kind of came to this realization that the universe isn't a lot of ways facing

208
00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:44.780
some pretty dire threats. She doesn't go as far as to say it directly,

209
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.550
but basically Nola's heading towards earth.

210
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:49.970
So we know that like sword number one takes place before the events of King and

211
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:51.530
block. There's like various, you know,

212
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.950
alien races out there that are warring against each other that could destabilize

213
00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:59.600
galactic peace. So while sword isn't necessarily the universe's police force,

214
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.810
the purpose of sword is to monitor threats out there and to try to bring those

215
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.290
threats to an end if for no other reason than to keep earth protected. Right?

216
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:09.350
So like what we saw with the original priests for war that the Korean,

217
00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.790
the Sprole went to war against one another.

218
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.550
And while they were races that had been warring for millions of years and had

219
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.790
virtually nothing to do with earth outside of the CRE creating Inhumans on

220
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.520
earth, that when the conflict came close enough to earth,

221
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.160
that it actually threatened the earth itself. And so the purpose of,

222
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:25.310
of sword is to say, look, yes, they're warring empires that are out there.

223
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.210
You'll probably never come here, but it's entirely possible that they could.

224
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.200
And because they could,

225
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.750
we need to get involved in order to kind of bring things to an end.

226
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.120
So they're indirectly kind of responsible in that way.

227
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.150
The next person that we actually end up seeing here is a person by the name of

228
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:40.550
frenzy and frenzy. If I remember correctly,

229
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:43.580
frenzy has indestructable skin and super strength,

230
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.120
but she is a character that's really, really, really, really old school.

231
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.220
She's been around for a very long time. Kind of a fun fact.

232
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.880
She was actually working for apocalypse when he first showed up in Marvel comics

233
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.580
and the old X-Factor stories under Walter Louie Simon's son.

234
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.840
So she goes way back, right?

235
00:10:56.841 --> 00:11:00.950
The frenzy is a powerhouse rush is kind of the muscle of the team rush is the

236
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:04.040
muscle of the, of the six as they call them. That's what we kind of get, right?

237
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.650
Each of these individuals here offers something unique to the, to the,

238
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:10.010
the peak in such a way to where they can be utilized,

239
00:11:10.011 --> 00:11:11.930
or it can utilize itself at its full capacity.

240
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.920
And all that whole structure information really seems to be done by way of the

241
00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:18.500
efforts of Takeshi, right? Kind of working together and saying, look,

242
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.140
these are the other five people that I need to do.

243
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:24.440
These particular things that can basically help this thing operate in his peak

244
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:24.950
capacity.

245
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.450
Now what the sword actually does is not really just monitoring space.

246
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.840
They have a much bigger charter going on and we'll find out what that is here in

247
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:34.760
a second, because what you end up getting is this,

248
00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:36.890
this kind of group sort of coming together, you know,

249
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.590
in a mission effectively getting ready to take off, right. A mission,

250
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:41.540
getting ready to happen. And everybody, you know,

251
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:43.070
traveling to what's called the, uh,

252
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:46.160
the launch pad or the jump suite where they basically teleport. But,

253
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:48.590
but we actually get to familiar faces here. Anybody,

254
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.420
any of the guys who've been reading Marvel comics for,

255
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:52.460
I would say the better part of 20, some odd years,

256
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.390
you're going to see couple of faces here that are old school that you probably

257
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:57.640
recall. The first one is paper.

258
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.800
And I didn't initially realize that people would come back.

259
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.240
It wasn't until I was in the discord,

260
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.410
talking to you guys for the weekly Q and a that I do every Friday at 6:00 PM

261
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.360
Eastern time shameless plug. Uh, but I was,

262
00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:08.370
I was in the Q and a session talking to you guys, you know,

263
00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:10.920
answering your questions. And one of the guys asked me about sword,

264
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:14.880
and you said that paper came back. So Pieper is one of the oldest, I mean like,

265
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.460
Oh, G double O G brotherhood of evil mutants guys.

266
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.700
I think he was part of the original brotherhood of evil mutants Magneto,

267
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.150
if not the original in the second iteration. Uh, but he's super old school.

268
00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:26.610
They've been around for a very, very long time. And they've actually,

269
00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:29.460
they've been friends for a very long time. Now, the fact that paper's back,

270
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.530
of course, Magneto gruesome is an old friend, is like, dude,

271
00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:34.200
I had no idea that you were on this. We didn't get back together, man.

272
00:12:34.201 --> 00:12:36.450
Like we need to hang out, we'll grab a beer. And like we'll,

273
00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:38.400
we'll chit chat and talk about all kinds of stuff.

274
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.180
But the funny thing is that Fabian Cortez is left out of all of that.

275
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.080
Now Fabian Cortez was part of the acolytes right back in the 1990s,

276
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.320
when you got X-Men volume two and to kind of relaunch under Chris Claremont,

277
00:12:49.321 --> 00:12:49.890
Jim Lee,

278
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.950
and then eventually Scott Ladelle and a few other people once Jim Lee and Chris

279
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.820
clay Fairmont left.

280
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.210
But the acolytes were like these people who worship at Magneto, right?

281
00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:58.560
Like they basically did almost every,

282
00:12:58.561 --> 00:13:01.710
every single bit of that he could possibly do ask for Fabian courts has had the

283
00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:04.230
ability to augment the powers of other people. Um,

284
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.150
but he was by no means like a major player.

285
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.010
The funny thing about that if I remember correctly,

286
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.100
because sometimes I get the TV show and the comics us switch,

287
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.150
but I believe Fabian port has tried to topple Magneto, but whatever it is,

288
00:13:15.151 --> 00:13:17.940
Magneto doesn't really remember his name. He's like, I remember the ponytail,

289
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:18.810
but the name escapes me.

290
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:21.750
So Fabian Cortez was never really that important to him in the first place.

291
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.760
And so it leaves a little bit of room for jealousy.

292
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.100
I doubt we'll actually see that. But at that point,

293
00:13:26.101 --> 00:13:27.480
the mission begins to commence.

294
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.720
And these guys are addressing these wild looking space suits because they're not

295
00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:31.980
traveling out into space.

296
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.950
They're actually breaking the dimensional barrier and they're traveling to three

297
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:35.790
different locations.

298
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:39.330
Now these three different locations here are represented by what's called the

299
00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:43.200
far shore. The land of couldn't be shouldn't be and the white house, no,

300
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.700
the white hot room. A lot of you guys already know.

301
00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:47.850
And we'll talk about that here. The far shore in the land of couldn't be,

302
00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:48.810
shouldn't be, those are the,

303
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.630
those are the one's a lot of people probably don't really know much about right.

304
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.060
And a stands to reason because they're very new concepts.

305
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.020
And when I say very new,

306
00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:57.900
like they've been introduced in the last four or five years.

307
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.850
And so nobody's really done anything with them.

308
00:13:59.851 --> 00:14:02.280
Usually when it comes to like abstract ideas like that,

309
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.920
they have to be around for something like 20 years, right.

310
00:14:04.921 --> 00:14:08.430
Nor to actually get a general consensus of what they are because a boatload of

311
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.500
different writers and artists interpret them in different ways.

312
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:15.030
So the far shore is a concept that explained to us and really given to us during

313
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:17.100
the old ultimate line of comics, by Al Ewing,

314
00:14:17.101 --> 00:14:20.820
select the Ultimate's with Adam Bashir and black Panther and spectrum and all

315
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:23.340
those characters, part of all new, all different Marvel. Um,

316
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.090
but we never really got a definitive explanation in terms of what it really is.

317
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.140
The closest explanation that we get comes at the end of the ultimate story.

318
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.630
When we're basically told that if you look at everything,

319
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.980
the universe that exists out there,

320
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.880
every universe has this one version of like eternity or infinity or something

321
00:14:38.881 --> 00:14:39.480
like that.

322
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.170
And free version of the multi-verse has this own version of the multi-verse

323
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.600
eternity, the multi-verse infinity.

324
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.430
And so every time a universe dies and is reborn the version of eternity that

325
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:53.510
existed when that universe died, basically ceased to exist.

326
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.070
And when the universe is reborn,

327
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.370
a new version of eternity is born in to that new universe.

328
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.550
And so the question becomes if that version of eternity that died,

329
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:04.550
when the malt, when the universe died is gone, didn't board, his ego,

330
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.250
does he simply cease to exist? And for, for the most part,

331
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:09.620
I think it's just an easier explanation to say that, right,

332
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:12.830
that version of eternity, ceases to exist and like a new one takes his place.

333
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.460
But the answer that was given to us by our viewing is they go to the far shore.

334
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.180
So like when the multi-verse die during the events of secret Wars and was reborn

335
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:23.810
again, uh, that we basically ended up getting like all those versions of oils,

336
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:27.200
versions of the cosmic entity. So like eternity, infinity, master order,

337
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.070
Lord chaos, the in-betweener that all those cosmic entities basically dot.

338
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.420
And when the multi-verse was recreated by reading Richard's that for the most

339
00:15:34.421 --> 00:15:36.370
part, they were brought back the way they were before.

340
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.820
So nothing really changed. But if you look at the multi-verse, the way it died,

341
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.810
when like gallon moved into the new, uh, new multi-verse and became Galactus,

342
00:15:43.811 --> 00:15:45.550
right? That trend period, that,

343
00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:49.120
that version of eternity from the previous multi-verse that version of infinity,

344
00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:52.180
all those different cosmic entities from all of those different universes that

345
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.310
were all wiped out. When that multi-verse collapsed,

346
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.860
they all went to the far shore. Now what they do when they're there,

347
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.110
we don't know. Maybe they sit around all day and watch golden girls.

348
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.540
Maybe they play ping pong, who knows? Maybe they watch my videos.

349
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.890
I have no clue. We really don't know what it is that they do. We're never,

350
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.390
but an answer, right. It's just kind of,

351
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.230
it's basically a place where they go when they quote unquote pass on, right.

352
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.960
When they basically die and go on to whatever awaits the next.

353
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.780
And so from there you go into, what's called the land of couldn't be,

354
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:20.440
shouldn't be now the land of couldn't be, shouldn't be, it's basically, uh,

355
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.450
a kind of dimension or space that represents every conceivable possibility

356
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.610
that has not come to fruition yet. Right?

357
00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:30.190
So let's make this tangible because I know this is kind of wild.

358
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.090
Let's say that you have a plate of cookies sitting next to you.

359
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.530
You have a chocolate chip cookie,

360
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.380
you have a sugar cookie and you have an oatmeal raisin cookie, and Lola,

361
00:16:38.381 --> 00:16:41.290
anybody would eat that. Now the there's a possibility,

362
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:42.970
all those possibilities exist, right?

363
00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:45.430
There's a possibility that you could eat the chocolate chip cookie.

364
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.380
There's a possibility you could eat the sugar cookie.

365
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.900
And there's a possibility you could eat the oatmeal raisin cookie.

366
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.070
But until you do,

367
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.370
those are only possibilities where there are only options that exist out there.

368
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.250
There's there. They haven't come to fruition yet. And so that's what,

369
00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:00.790
that's what that whole kind of dimensional place answers. Right? If these ideas,

370
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.720
if these possibilities exist, then where do those possibilities come from? Now,

371
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.750
the reality is that this is adding a level of complexity to something that

372
00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:09.400
doesn't need that level of complexity.

373
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.940
We don't need a dimension to represent all the possibilities that could exist in

374
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.210
mobile commerce, right? We can just call that imagination and be done with it,

375
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.670
right? That's all it is. That's all it really needs to be.

376
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.140
But Marvel likes to assign a dimensional spaces and cosmic entities to different

377
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:26.820
ideologies. For whatever reason, it only makes sense to themselves. And so the,

378
00:17:26.821 --> 00:17:27.910
the land of couldn't be,

379
00:17:27.911 --> 00:17:31.660
shouldn't be represents those three cookies sitting on those plates.

380
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.140
Now let's say for example, that you decide to eat that chocolate chip cookie,

381
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.700
then that becomes a reality, right?

382
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.520
You now live in a universe where you ate that chocolate chip cookie.

383
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.360
There is an alternate reality out there where you ate the oatmeal raisin cookie.

384
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.080
And there's an, an alternate reality where you ate the sugar cookie, right?

385
00:17:47.081 --> 00:17:49.560
Like there's, there are now alternate realities for those,

386
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.180
because with that situation being there,

387
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:54.750
the very fact that you chose to eat a cookie means now you chose to eat all the

388
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:56.220
other cookies where you chose to eat. None of them.

389
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.890
I know it's really weird and it's really wild and Metta textual.

390
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.640
And that's why I say not everything that can exist, needs to exist.

391
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.750
Not every idea that somebody comes up with needs to actually be put in comic

392
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:08.550
books. So if you find yourself a little confused,

393
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.130
just kind of sit on that for a little while and just kind of ponder it,

394
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:13.950
and then it'll eventually make sense to you after a while. But from there,

395
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.860
they finally managed to make their way into the white hot room, right.

396
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:20.490
And access something called the Mysterium. Tremendum don't know what that is,

397
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.370
where it's the first time that we saw it at this, this stuff's kind of cool.

398
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.310
It seems a little unnecessary. And that's why I say like, it's,

399
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:27.510
it's an awesome concept,

400
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.380
but it's really kind of running like just throwing in too much wild stuff too

401
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:34.290
fast. But again, it could all make sense by the time we get to the next issue,

402
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.860
whatever this is though, this basically kind of seems to be a cosmic, uh,

403
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.280
like an elemental cosmic heart, right? The heart of the white hot room.

404
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.500
Now the white hot room feels, you guys don't know what this is.

405
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.700
This is basically where you have the Phoenix force in its full totality, right?

406
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.980
The full power of the Phoenix force. Now,

407
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.940
just because of person is possessed by the Phoenix force does not mean they can

408
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:57.120
use the Phoenix force to its full potential that in order for that to happen,

409
00:18:57.121 --> 00:19:00.930
there has to be an almost kind of alignment between the genetic potential of the

410
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:04.430
person who is, Oh, for the Phoenix force and the Phoenix force itself. Right.

411
00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:07.850
So that's where like Jean Gray is the quote unquote perfect host for the

412
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:11.750
Phoenix. Someone like I think, uh, I think Emma Frost achieved at four time.

413
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.850
I believe Rachel Summers has. Um,

414
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.820
and I think I know Quentin choir did in an alternate universe. Um,

415
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:21.050
but basically a person who is who who's able to possess the totality of the

416
00:19:21.051 --> 00:19:24.320
Phoenix powers is what's called the white Phoenix of the crowd, right?

417
00:19:24.321 --> 00:19:27.350
That's basically what they are a person who can achieve and use the Phoenix's

418
00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:29.120
abilities to their full totality,

419
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.830
a person who achieves that level occupies and exists inside the white hot room.

420
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.140
But we never really got a full on explanation beyond that. Right.

421
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:39.110
That's the old Prince Clermont stuff that was kind of revisited by grant

422
00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:43.010
Morrison during his one on X-Men with here comes tomorrow. But beyond that,

423
00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:46.250
we don't really have a full on explanation there in terms of like,

424
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.140
what all is inside the white hot room.

425
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:51.020
We're told that it's like kind of surrounded by like a lattice work, you know,

426
00:19:51.021 --> 00:19:52.550
and it's like a place of pure energy,

427
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.360
but what they seem to have done here is taken the heart of the white hot room,

428
00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:56.900
right? This,

429
00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.920
this object that can kind of maintain these sort of elemental capacities.

430
00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:03.620
Now what that means and what it does. I have no idea.

431
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.810
I don't know if attaining this makes them all God,

432
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.870
I don't know if it just allows them to tap into a level of power.

433
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.150
Maybe it makes them super smart. We don't really know.

434
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.090
It's one of these things where just because there's an artifact that holds a

435
00:20:14.091 --> 00:20:17.690
ceremonial role does not mean that artifact is going to grant a person,

436
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.270
absolute power indicative of that role. Right?

437
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:22.430
So this artifact resides in the white hot room.

438
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.670
The only people who can access the white hot room are people who are able to use

439
00:20:25.671 --> 00:20:28.310
the Phoenix force at 100% of its power air ergo,

440
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.120
anybody who has this artifact can possesses the full totality of the Phoenix has

441
00:20:32.121 --> 00:20:34.370
powers. We don't know that we're assuming that,

442
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.200
but we don't actually have an answer for that.

443
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.410
The result is we're just going to kind of have to wait and see what all this

444
00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:42.020
means. But once they attain this artifact and they bring it back,

445
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.560
the only thing that we're really told is like, this is what comes next, right?

446
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.310
Like this is basically what, what comes after all this? What that means.

447
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:51.700
I have no idea, right. As a great, big, huge mystery. I'm digging it. I like it.

448
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.400
I think it's cool. And I'm excited to see what comes of it. Uh,

449
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.800
our viewing almost never disappoints as a writer.

450
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:59.200
I don't think I've ever read a bad story that Al Ewing wrote.

451
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.500
So I'm excited to see where this goes, but it is a little wild.

452
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.860
It is a little kooky, but it leaves room for some pretty breezy events,

453
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.260
especially because we're going cosmic in this. Right?

454
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:10.780
So probably a lot of involvement involving cosmic entities,

455
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.730
different things like that. So with that being said, guys,

456
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.160
putting them in this video to an end, if you are new here to comments,

457
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.590
explain to make sure you guys have the sub button to become part of the rod
