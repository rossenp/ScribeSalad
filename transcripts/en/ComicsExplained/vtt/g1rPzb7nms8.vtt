4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.860
What's going on guys. This is Rob and, uh, I don't know.

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.610
<v 1>No, if we ever really covered this, I mean, I guess we kind of did,</v>

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.070
but if we did do it, that it was back in the day when my video sucked.

7
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:21.200
And so if we did cover it, we're going to remaster it,

8
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.360
but we're basically doing the crooked world story.

9
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.630
And the reason why we're doing this is because of what's going on with X of

10
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:29.930
swords and the return of Jim Jasper's, right. There's been a lot of talk,

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.560
especially in my videos about how powerful Jim Jasper's is about what he's

12
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:37.160
capable of and how dangerous of a character that he is. But in reality,

13
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:41.240
I don't really think a lot of people are fully aware of what Jim Jasper's can do

14
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.790
and what makes him so powerful and really so dangerous.

15
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.290
And this story really covers it. Now,

16
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:49.070
the other part of why we're doing this is because this also covers the nature of

17
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:49.970
Saturday, right?

18
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.150
The role she plays and which was really kind of first introduced in the Marvel

19
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.940
comics. Now, a couple of things to understand here, this story,

20
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:57.140
the crooked world is,

21
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.170
was technically kind of collected into a more recent seven issue story.

22
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.120
When I say recent, I mean, back in the mid nineties. Um,

23
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
but this story was really first launched when Marvel was creating what was

24
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:09.770
called Marvel UK and Marvel UK was quite literally Marvel comics attempt to

25
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.540
expand into the United Kingdom.

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.790
And of course they did it by creating captain Britain.

27
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.360
The result of this is that you had Alan Moore and Alan Davis who essentially put

28
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.313
this story together.

29
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.090
And so one part of this is kind of a reworking of the history of, uh,

30
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.830
of captain Britain in terms of rolling.

31
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:27.710
You're more in line with the main Marvel comics universe itself.

32
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.900
And then the other part is everything going on in the crooked world.

33
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.420
So we're only going to really cover the second part here. Uh,

34
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.330
we're going to kind of skim over a lot of this stuff, like the reworking of his,

35
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:37.370
of his story and his powers and things like that,

36
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.770
because that's not overly important here. What, I mean,

37
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.070
what you know about captain Britain right now in terms of reading extra swords

38
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.320
is all that really matters when it comes to his character.

39
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.170
And Jim Jasper's is really the main focus here, right? So, uh,

40
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.560
this initially picks up with both Brian Bradick, captain Britain,

41
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.600
as well as a character named Jack doff. Now,

42
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.080
Jack doll was initially introduced to the old captain Britain stories as

43
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.020
essentially a sidekick, right? Because this was written back in the 1980s.

44
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.890
And this was still a time in comic books where sidekicks were still a relatively

45
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:04.700
prominent thing.

46
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.280
The reality is the sidekicks are kind of been going the wayside, uh,

47
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.780
ever since the 1960s, right?

48
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.560
But it took about 20 years for us to see sidekicks and a lot of ways beginning

49
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:15.710
to go away. A lot of that was because of Batman because the Robin character,

50
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.550
the Robin archetype was still exceedingly popular and it really has been, um,

51
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.350
it's one of those things where I think publishers outside of DC kind of failed

52
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.990
to understand that the popularity of Robin was because he was effectively a

53
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:27.860
legacy character,

54
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.460
not every sidekick that was out there was popular or needed to be there.

55
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.980
And so Jack doll was actually one of these characters that was kind of being

56
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:36.170
phased out at the time. This story was being written.

57
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.020
The other part of this is that in the early captain Britain stories,

58
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.530
he was given a Sceptre that kind of allowed him to channel and use his powers.

59
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.690
This too is something that was being removed.

60
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.080
And that's the reason why when he sent on this mission to this alternate reality

61
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.590
in earth, two 38, but not really given any indication of what the mission is,

62
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.780
once he passes through that dimensional barrier,

63
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.240
his costume changes and he loses a Sceptre right.

64
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:59.560
This was kind of a really on the nose. Like this is the new captain now.

65
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.020
But the idea here is that once you sit into this location,

66
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.410
he immediately stumbles upon what is in effect, a bank heist, right? Like this,

67
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:06.550
this robbery going wrong.

68
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.820
Now this robbery is being held by a group called the crazy gang or being

69
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.680
orchestrated by a group called the crazy gang.

70
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.180
And captain Britain does what he does. Right.

71
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.800
He kind of beats them up a little bit and says, Hey, you know,

72
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.980
you guys need to stop all that kind of stuff, but while all that's going on,

73
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.900
Jim Jasper's is watching it happen.

74
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.540
And it's really because of the crazy gang kind of seems to be operating at the

75
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:23.830
behest of Jim Jasper's, right.

76
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.740
They're basically kiss henchmen and they're kind of carrying out his plot,

77
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.340
but the whole purpose behind this is really just more for fun and games that

78
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.760
what you have is you have Jim Jasper's who created the execution or who has the

79
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.130
execution are here and he's also got the queen of hearts, right?

80
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:39.670
So you guys kinda notice it's very similar to Alison Wonderland in terms of how

81
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.640
this goes on. And the result of this is that when he asked the queen,

82
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:45.310
what should we do? Her response is off with his head, right?

83
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.160
And that's when the executioner comes along and then it leaves captain Britain

84
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.630
taking the fight outside. Now, again,

85
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.510
Jim Jaspers is kind of watching all this unfold, right?

86
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.450
He's watching all this take place and it's kind of entertained by it, right?

87
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.010
Like this is kind of interesting, right?

88
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.650
I'm kind of intrigued by everything I'm seeing. He does of course,

89
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.290
want to see cabinet Britain defeated, but he is kind of intrigued here.

90
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.230
Now with this fight, basically getting to the outdoors and essentially,

91
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:08.290
you know, the forces of the crazy game being defeated, Jim Jasper is,

92
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.990
gets into his flying teapot and then basically takes off, right.

93
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.080
He just ends up escaping with the crazy gang and then that's basically it.

94
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.330
Right? And so, you know, the Dormouse is the one flying it.

95
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.940
So you can tell right off the bat, things were a little wonky here.

96
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.330
Where's captain Britain kind of looks around and is like,

97
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.990
none of this really makes sense. Like this is kind of wild.

98
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:27.300
I don't really understand this. And he ends up finding a poster on a wall.

99
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:29.820
This is kind of reelect the British national party light,

100
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:32.490
which is starkly different from what we see in the main Marvel universe. Well,

101
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:35.760
the British national party doesn't really exist. It's like a major figurehead,

102
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:38.730
right? They're not ruling anything. And so what you end up getting is,

103
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:39.630
is really, uh,

104
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.290
Jack doll and captain Britain kind of going through and checking out and

105
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:46.890
investigating a few things inside of, uh, inside of London itself, right?

106
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:50.100
To figure out the differences between the universe they're from,

107
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.720
and this place that they're in. Now,

108
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:54.510
this is when we kind of skim over stuff and sort of throw in a few little

109
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.760
highlights here and there. But for, for most everything else,

110
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.810
we can kind of blow it off.

111
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.020
But one of the big takeaways that comes out of all this is that everything

112
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:02.490
really is just starkly different,

113
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.380
but everything really is just starkly different.

114
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:05.700
And they don't really understand why,

115
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.600
why they're not really able to fully grasp why things are so intriguing here.

116
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.780
What you also have are three major things that take place.

117
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.150
The first is these various, you know,

118
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:18.240
homeless people who are out there that are drinking this alcohol and Jack doll

119
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:19.620
ends up drinking a little bit of it as well.

120
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.070
And it's almost like they have this kind of mental awakening of how things truly

121
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:25.110
are not for the most part because they're homeless.

122
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:28.410
And because of the outcasts of society, nobody takes them seriously.

123
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.710
And they consider the ramblings about how things have here versus how things

124
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:35.190
really are to really just be some kind of psychosis or a drunken stupor or

125
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:36.024
something like that.

126
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.720
But the second thing that happens is there's this giant heap of machinery that

127
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:42.930
actually just kind of became sensitive more or less and is walking around and

128
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:44.580
causing all kinds of chaos. Now,

129
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.670
captain Britain responds and ends up basically kind of defeating this thing,

130
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.720
but also drawing the attention of the military forces that are out there, right?

131
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.000
Or at least the kind of the kind of period military forces.

132
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.040
They're typically individuals that are specialized in taking super powered

133
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:58.520
beings.

134
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.560
And so right now we know that like super powered beings exist have existed in

135
00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:06.070
this universe. Uh, so captain Britain's on the very first one they've ever seen,

136
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.330
but he's able to kind of get up,

137
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.080
get past these guys pretty easily and take out the junk heap that walked like a

138
00:06:11.081 --> 00:06:13.630
man, right? So that happens pretty fast, pretty quickly.

139
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.990
Now these guys who exist out there for the purpose of taking out superheroes,

140
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.290
that's kind of an important thing. Those guys specifically are not,

141
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.040
but the force they will bring in for the purpose of taking down the heroes will

142
00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:26.200
be, will prove to be exceedingly important.

143
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.410
But the other thing that happens is that once this junk heap is basically

144
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:32.080
defeated, this is kind of left and this great, big, huge, you know,

145
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.390
crumble heap that you end up having captain Britain,

146
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.020
who sort of looks around for what this stuff is right for like how it is that

147
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:38.560
this happened.

148
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.020
And people are talking about a kind of fluid or something like that.

149
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.260
And he stumbled across the sewer drain where this sort of, you know,

150
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.580
reddish fluid is coming out.

151
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.970
And when he crawls to the drain and traces it back to its energy source or to

152
00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:52.660
its, to its location, he comes across a rat called auger knock, right.

153
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.670
He's just the rat thing, right. And this is a walking,

154
00:06:54.671 --> 00:06:58.000
talking rat who lives in the sewer and is like, you know, not super intelligent,

155
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.390
but like level intelligence, right? So like he's basically achieved sentience.

156
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.970
And it's kind of a strange thing because while that's happening,

157
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.340
you also have something called the avant guard.

158
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.910
And the on guard is really kind of introduced to us a little bit mysteriously.

159
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.260
We don't really know much about them.

160
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.860
All we really know is they're led by a woman who's referred to as her Wyness,

161
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.280
but she starts talking about this concept of initiating something called the

162
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.490
push and that the rat himself is the result of the push, right.

163
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.790
Which is to say this chemical, that exists, that's kind of being put out there,

164
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:25.930
uh, this wreck consumed it.

165
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.770
And that's why it's so intelligent now what all that means will come to fruition

166
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.000
exceedingly soon, right?

167
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:33.550
So I'm not gonna leave you guys hanging on why all that's important,

168
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.720
but what does matter here is a captain Britain was in effect an unexpected

169
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.030
entity here, right? He wasn't really expected to be here.

170
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.120
And so what you end up getting is essentially the avant-garde you kind of step

171
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:45.520
in for the purpose of detaining captain Britain.

172
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.110
Now he ends up getting the upper hand on him,

173
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.580
basically kind of defeating him to a degree,

174
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:50.260
or at least that seems to be the case,

175
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.390
but then ultimately they get the upper hand on him.

176
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.880
And the way in which they do this comes in the form of a question,

177
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:58.060
the mysterious energy beam, this energy meme is shot at the rat,

178
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.940
which kind of devolves him back down into a base level and then a shot of

179
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:03.550
captain Britain, which devolves him back down into a monkey. Right?

180
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:06.760
And so following that, he's basically captured and taken by the avant garde.

181
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.090
And then in turn, we're properly introduced to Saturday now, Saturday,

182
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:11.440
and Ashley's introduced here.

183
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:15.310
And as we're informed by her is basically part of a group called the Omni Versal

184
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.210
development court. Now,

185
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.330
something that I do want to point out here is that back then in the 1980s,

186
00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.320
when this story was written,

187
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.500
this was done at a time when the living tribunal was not something that was

188
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:26.230
constantly invoked nowadays in Marvel comics,

189
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.720
anything that really involves the multi-verse on a grand scale,

190
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.600
the living tribunal pops up that then it wasn't really the case.

191
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.410
The expectation on the publishing side was tell the story as if it's in

192
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:38.740
isolation and introduce new concepts. If you can, things that are interesting,

193
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.410
but don't use a living tribunal as an easy way out.

194
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:44.560
And that's why we don't really see the tribunal here. Instead,

195
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:48.040
what we get in its place is a creation by Alan Moore and Alan Davis called the

196
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:51.850
Omni Versal development court. And the way this works is that in every universe,

197
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:55.800
across the multi-verse, they all sort of progress at a particular rate.

198
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.820
And that at a particular point in time, certain things are supposed to happen,

199
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.520
right? So you have what's called the 50,000 year program,

200
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.020
which basically says that at some point we can call this 0.0 50,000 years.

201
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:08.100
From that point in time,

202
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.850
we're supposed to get a kind of evolutionary process now how this works in

203
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.670
tandem with like the celestial experimenting on humanity.

204
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.800
We're not really given a definitive explanation here.

205
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.940
We can largely kind of make assumptions that around 50,000 years before this

206
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:21.750
point in time,

207
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.290
when superheroes are supposed to have here is essentially when modern man became

208
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.080
what it is. And we can largely kind of tie these numbers together.

209
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.470
And it really kind of makes sense that about 50,000 years before the emergence

210
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.010
of superheroes is when the Celestials experimented on early math.

211
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.700
And so that's why the Omnia bristle development court seems to fall in line with

212
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.520
the Celestials right? That as part of the celestial grand experiment,

213
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.750
they travel from world to world experimenting on the early primitive versions of

214
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.750
its inhabitants. And then basically granting them powers on earth.

215
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.120
They did the exact same thing, right on earth. They showed up,

216
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.480
they took one third of humanity and then broke that one third into the,

217
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.150
into thirds itself. That one group became the Eternals.

218
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.180
Another group became a deviance and the third group were individuals whose

219
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:02.490
powers would manifest at some future point in time.

220
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.030
What seems to happen is the Omni vessel development court picks up from there.

221
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.760
And they basically make sure that this evolutionary push,

222
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.890
which is to say that the genes manifest.

223
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.100
So basically we get like X-Men and we get mutants and we get Avengers and

224
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:15.060
fantastic for that.

225
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:19.140
All that stuff happens about 50,000 years after the Celestials first visit

226
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.290
earth. And it happens across every single universe, right? And so,

227
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:24.780
because of that, on this earth, there are no superheroes.

228
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.670
And that's why Saturn EAN and the,

229
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:30.570
the really her forces are here is to initiate the push that it has to be

230
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:34.410
achieved by the year 2000. And that, because there are no SU superheroes here,

231
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.490
her assumption is that superheroes just simply never evolved, right.

232
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:41.250
For whatever reason, those genes never really activated.

233
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.820
And so the intention here is to initiate the push, to force those genes,

234
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:47.100
to activate, to create superheroes on earth, right.

235
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:50.430
It's just what the Omni versa development court does now, when that happens.

236
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.410
And when captain Britain basically kind of, uh,

237
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.660
his age back up to his normal self, right? When his,

238
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.450
when his evolution is kicked back up to where it's supposed to be,

239
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:00.030
he basically re or really evolves back into a man.

240
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.220
This is one part Allen Warren, Alan Davis,

241
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.400
giving him like new levels of super strength and speed and durability,

242
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.560
things like that enhancing his powers. But it's also,

243
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.710
it also allows him to basically kind of grabs her attorney, right, and say like,

244
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.640
what's going on here?

245
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.400
And that's when she really kind of explains everything that I just told you guys

246
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.800
in terms of what she does and all that kind of stuff.

247
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.940
But what she also ends up revealing here is that their intention is to

248
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.560
essentially take this substance,

249
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:25.800
this liquid that they have and put it into the water supply and the water

250
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.031
supply, or, you know, putting it,

251
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:30.120
there will basically allow people to consume it. And that will in turn,

252
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.610
start pushing them to a higher evolutionary state.

253
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.760
And it'll basically allow them to see the world the way that it really is.

254
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:38.130
Because one of the things that's kind of hint here is that, uh,

255
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.150
Jim Jasper versus kind of use his powers to distort the way the earth appears as

256
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:44.610
opposed to the way that it actually is. But the other thing it'll do,

257
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.670
it'll start jump-starting powers, right? People will start getting superpowers.

258
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.320
And so while that happens, you have essentially the,

259
00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:53.890
the status crew that shows up here and the status crew is kind of a military

260
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:55.570
group that works for the government in England.

261
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.960
And that's kind of the superhero group that travels around and like capture

262
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.760
super powered beings or takes them out,

263
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.460
basically eliminates super-powered threats. And for the most part,

264
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.440
they're all taken out pretty quickly by captain Britain,

265
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:08.650
Saturday in the avant guard, those guys are defeated quite handedly,

266
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.543
but in the middle of it,

267
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.160
these various guys are essentially splashed with this evolutionary chemical by

268
00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:16.830
captain Britain. And that's when I start to realize like they've been used,

269
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:19.680
right. Their minds have essentially been tricked. And so if telepathy,

270
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.990
which seems to be the case has been used by Jim Jasper's,

271
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:24.750
or at least some kind of reality warping ability that in turn,

272
00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:26.490
it basically takes away that effect.

273
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.880
And they start to see the world the way it is that by virtue of their actions,

274
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.360
they've created grave injustices, right? Like they've oppressed, social classes,

275
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:34.290
different things like that.

276
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.380
And so realizing the effect that it has happen in Britain basically ends up

277
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.470
traveling out for the purpose of ensuring that this, uh,

278
00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:43.440
this liquid is actually put into the water supply and that everything goes

279
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:44.970
according to plan now, for the most part,

280
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.510
it seemingly does right there that once this stuff is put into the water supply

281
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.760
and everything, you know, the, the push begins to happen.

282
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.630
The various citizens from across in London start to kind of have this awakening

283
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.980
where they start to realize, okay,

284
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.260
nothing in this world is the way that it's supposed to be, right.

285
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.550
If things are screwed up, you know,

286
00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:01.320
that we need to focus on making things better.

287
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.650
This is really kind of Allen Warren Allen Davis sort of criticizing society at

288
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:07.080
the time. And just kind of being like, you know, people need to wake up,

289
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.220
you know, wake up sheeple, you know,

290
00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:10.230
that kind of a thing and make the world a better place.

291
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.160
But what is going on is that while this huge celebration is happening and that

292
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:15.810
essentially this will lead to people,

293
00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:18.150
developing powers that during all this time,

294
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.660
everybody forgot about Jasper's right. Everybody forgot about Jim Jaspers.

295
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:22.650
And so did Saturday Nene,

296
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.170
or she never considered him to be important in the first place,

297
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:28.380
because in her mind, she never knew that he was the cause of all this.

298
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.430
And so Jim Jaspers watches all this unfold. He lets them stay for this moment.

299
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:35.580
And then he initiates the Jasper's war and the Jasper's work literally just

300
00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.920
starts twisting up the entirety of reality.

301
00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:40.410
Like it really just starts warping it, twisting it, skewing it,

302
00:13:40.411 --> 00:13:43.410
turning it inside out the laws of physics begin to go upside down.

303
00:13:43.411 --> 00:13:47.220
So gravity starts pushing away instead of pulling in all kinds of crazy things,

304
00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.720
start to pop off. When that happens,

305
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.260
nobody in the Omni Versal development court knows what's going on.

306
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.500
And the biggest fear is that this is a result of the push that when they did

307
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:55.770
this,

308
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.160
they did something wrong that they screwed something up and they totally screwed

309
00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:03.060
up the world. Right. They literally broke the world. And so in response to this,

310
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.691
uh, you know,

311
00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:07.080
you basically have the status crew that shows back up with a being called the

312
00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:08.520
fury. And as they describe it,

313
00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:11.940
the fury was designed and programmed for the sole purpose of killing

314
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.630
superheroes, right? That's its sole purpose is basically killing superheroes.

315
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.500
And so following that,

316
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.010
the fury literally kind of goes on the attack and where captain Britain launches

317
00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:23.130
an attack against it. Nothing happens, right? I mean, this guy has no,

318
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.130
like this guy has no answer for the power of the fury.

319
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.760
And so Saturday and seeing what's going on Ramsey avant-garde and it's like,

320
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.360
let's go like unload what's going on in this world. But this place of screwed,

321
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:33.630
right?

322
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.030
I'm just going to get while the getting's good and we'll figure out what to do

323
00:14:36.031 --> 00:14:37.620
later. And so while that happens,

324
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.340
the furious goes on a rampage and literally just starts annihilating everybody.

325
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.510
It kills Jack dock,

326
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.780
which is religious them kind of beginning the process of writing Jack doll out.

327
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.280
Uh, it goes after captain Britain.

328
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.290
And then of course in the middle of this whole fight,

329
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.690
suddenly Jim Jasper shows right in his flying teapot and rescues captain

330
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:54.080
Britain.

331
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.320
And this is when we start to get into the meat and potatoes of what it is that

332
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.830
makes mad. Jim Jasper's so powerful. And so as he's carving,

333
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.520
as he kind of grabs his hat to Britain and flies away, the fury stops, right?

334
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:07.400
The fury does nothing. It doesn't go after Jim Jasper's or anybody.

335
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.670
And so from there, Jim, Jaspers kind of starts breaking down the conversation.

336
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:13.460
Now, once Brian Brodick, once captain Britain gets in here,

337
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.780
he immediately knows something's off because the inside of this flying teapot is

338
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.090
much bigger than the flying teapot itself.

339
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.080
He kind of starts breaking hands down. And he says, here in this universe,

340
00:15:23.081 --> 00:15:27.100
that he's in that he was a person who was a member of parliament and that he

341
00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:29.080
realized, you know, at some point in time,

342
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.450
he had the ability to manipulate reality, right?

343
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.300
He had the ability to control reality on a universal scale,

344
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.280
but his powers are continually growing.

345
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.150
And so what this shows is that this version of Jasper's is still relatively new

346
00:15:40.151 --> 00:15:40.984
to his abilities.

347
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.990
And so they more or less seemed to have just recently manifested.

348
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.290
And so in light of that and realizing the power that he possessed,

349
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.860
that the wrong move to make would have just been to distort reality that the

350
00:15:50.861 --> 00:15:54.640
best move to make when it comes to taking over people is to get them to believe

351
00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:56.740
you. It's one thing to conquer people.

352
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.350
It's another to get them to be willing to be conquered.

353
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.730
And that's what he was doing. Right?

354
00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:02.470
What he ended up doing was passing legislation,

355
00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:05.920
or at least pushing through the idea of legislation of superhuman registration,

356
00:16:05.921 --> 00:16:06.251
saying like,

357
00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:09.250
we need to basically get rid of all the superheroes and because of the fact that

358
00:16:09.251 --> 00:16:12.520
he was able to rally various human various people to aside,

359
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.940
this basically led to him kind of forcing this legislation through parliament

360
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.410
and response to that. He in turn,

361
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:20.620
created the fury and literally just went through and sort of killing everybody,

362
00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:22.270
like killing all the different superheroes.

363
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.660
Now there was a captain Britain in this universe and we'll actually find more

364
00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:29.190
about her here in a little while, but the theory, just in a matter of,

365
00:16:29.191 --> 00:16:33.910
of something like two years killed every single superhero on earth, right?

366
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.150
Everybody on earth. Now there's a lot that we're not being told here.

367
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.070
We're not being told if the fury killed,

368
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:43.270
like the fantastic four and the X-Men and the Avengers Marvel UK was largely

369
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:44.620
kind of a separate imprint.

370
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.030
You did see some reprints of comics from America in Marvel, UK,

371
00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:49.750
which has them kind of,

372
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.720
that was them testing the waters and seeing if there was an interest there.

373
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.190
That's what made captain Britain so important.

374
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.100
It was the first time that Britain really got from Marvel comics,

375
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.370
their own character in a series of newly created stories,

376
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.590
as opposed to reprints of old stories. Right?

377
00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:05.710
So that's why you don't really see a lot of other superhero teams here because a

378
00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:08.260
lot of the emphasis was put directly on, uh,

379
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.410
on captain Britain because they were trying to push the idea of a British

380
00:17:11.411 --> 00:17:12.310
superhero community.

381
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.840
But what Brian Brodick comes to the realization that one Jim Jasper's created

382
00:17:16.841 --> 00:17:18.630
the fury and programmed it. And so the,

383
00:17:18.631 --> 00:17:21.400
the fury will basically kill every single superhero on earth,

384
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.760
except for Jim Jasper's is just basically programmed not to. And that,

385
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.030
to the reason Jasper's did this is because he just wanted to eliminate the

386
00:17:28.031 --> 00:17:30.550
competition. He just wanted to be the most powerful mutant on earth.

387
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.570
And the reason why everything in this reality is so weird and why you have like

388
00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:38.350
the crazy gang, a lot of things reminiscent of, of like Alison Wonderland.

389
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:38.921
And then, you know,

390
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:42.070
all this kind of crazy stuff that's happening is because of the fact that Jim

391
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.370
Jasper's powers are expanding. And while he is able to control them,

392
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.610
he's experimenting, he's exceeding, he seen what he can do,

393
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.140
how much reality he can change. And so as time progresses,

394
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.010
his hold on reality becomes stronger and stronger to the point that he initiated

395
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:58.650
this Jasper's Wharf and started twisting everything up.

396
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.650
And so what is happening is that in the middle of this conversation,

397
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.880
that basically Jim Jasper's kind of created illusions of everybody that Brian

398
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.030
Braddock knows, like, like, uh, like Jack DAW, of course, who's dead.

399
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.620
All these people he encountered, like,

400
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:13.670
it's really him just screwing with the mind of, of Brian Braddock.

401
00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:17.370
And so in the midst of all this Brian panicked and then just out of the, uh,

402
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.280
out of the teapot, he goes right out of the flying teapot. He goes,

403
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.620
and he ends up landing into, in a cemetery.

404
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.880
And then basically he's just kind of there going nuts, right. He just kind of,

405
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.220
he believes he's actually losing his mind. Right.

406
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:31.950
And he believes he's been abandoned by Merlin Merlin, of course,

407
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:34.320
being the person who's responsible for creating captain Britain.

408
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.750
And the one who sent him on this mission, uh, is kind of like,

409
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.810
why did you put me here? Why like, why have you just abandoned me in this place?

410
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.420
This is, and this is insane. Like there's no hope for me here.

411
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.990
And that's absolutely true, right? This universe is beyond saving at this point.

412
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.110
And so what you end up getting is a fury who comes out of nowhere and basically

413
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:51.570
obliterates captain Britain. And when that happened,

414
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.510
you kind of jump over to the main Marvel universe for a second.

415
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.340
And you end up seeing captain UK.

416
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.850
And what you find out is that this grave where captain Britain was killed,

417
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:03.810
where Brian Braddock was killed and tossed in that grave was meant for captain

418
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:04.290
UK.

419
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.550
The captain UK was the captain Britain from this universe that when everything

420
00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:11.820
popped off and the fury ended up losing his model theory was kind of on this

421
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:15.630
mission of killing everybody that she basically abandoned the reality, right?

422
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:20.460
She, she basically got out of the earth to 38 universe and then is essentially

423
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.780
a refugee in the main Marvel universe that nobody knew that she was there and

424
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:29.580
that she's still experiencing PTSD and anxiety from like the whole experience

425
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.120
of seeing everybody that she knows that was killed. And so following that,

426
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:36.600
you go into the resurrection of Brian Bradley, you go into captain Britain,

427
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:39.330
who's basically resurrected by Merlin and his, his daughter Roma,

428
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.280
the ones who are responsible for creating, you know,

429
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:42.870
all this captain Britain stuff. And they're kind of,

430
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.670
we're kind of given a little bit of a history there. Again,

431
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:47.010
it's not overly important. They kind of just sort of,

432
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.800
sort of ensure that he remembers everything that happened.

433
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.490
And the reason why is because sending him to the earth to 38 universe,

434
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.331
that was a test,

435
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:58.110
it was just an experiment to see how he would fare against somebody like Jim

436
00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:58.710
Jaspers.

437
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.760
And the reason why is because the purpose of him being sent on that mission was

438
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:05.700
not to really defeat the earth two 38, Jim Jasper's,

439
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.760
but to prepare him for when he faces off against magic,

440
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.620
Jasper's from the main Marvel universe.

441
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.790
Because as powerful as that version of Jim Jasper's was from earth to 38,

442
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.530
that guy is nothing,

443
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.840
absolutely nothing in comparison to the power of magic.

444
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.710
Jasper's from the main Marvel universe,

445
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.320
which is something that we'll cover in the next video with that being said,

446
00:20:25.321 --> 00:20:25.950
guys, we're going to bring.
