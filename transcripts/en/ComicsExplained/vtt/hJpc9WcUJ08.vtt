4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.020
All right, what's going on guys.

5
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.760
This is Rob and we are back with the conclusion of Marvel zombies, resurrection,

6
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.500
right? This wraps up the whole thing.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.400
And what we do here is we kind of start off a little bit ago and essentially

8
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.590
what's left of the superhero community, right?

9
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.900
Even just super hero and super villain community, right?

10
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.960
So you've got miles Morales. You've got Bucky Barnes. You got Dr. Strange,

11
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:32.870
you've got electro, right? Spider-Man villain well-known Spider-Man villain.

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.660
You've got these different characters who were here and seemingly out of

13
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:38.630
nowhere, they're met by the arrival of Spiderman,

14
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.660
who of course has Valeria Richards and Franklin Richards in tow.

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.790
So this is during the initial outbreak here.

16
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.370
Now the truth is that this is kind of cool and this kind of makes sense.

17
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.240
This is where Marvel zombies resurrection could either succeed incredibly well

18
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.570
or fail disastrously so far. The story is not too bad. I mean,

19
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:56.120
it definitely needs some work and there's definitely some expansion that I think

20
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.220
needs to be done in order to make it make more sense.

21
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.890
But there's a lot of great stories that could be told here, right?

22
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:03.620
Like everything that was going on during the initial outbreak.

23
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:04.454
And that's why I say,

24
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.790
I think that Marvel zombies started happening the way that it did as a direct

25
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:11.180
response to DCC. Right? Then we got the Marvel's Army's return one shot,

26
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.060
and then we got nothing for like a year. And then we get, you know,

27
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.140
Marvel's Army's number one long after DCC has already kind of done its thing.

28
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.790
Right. And basically told us the main story.

29
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.470
And so with Peter Parker in them alive,

30
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.030
and he basically begged anybody to save up Franklin Richards and nobody can

31
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.640
write, not even Dr. Strange, right? He's like, there's nothing I can do here.

32
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.420
I can't say Franklin, but warlock steps up and says, I can save him,

33
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.840
but it won't necessarily be the way that you think. And so again,

34
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.100
picking back up in the modern day,

35
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.430
right now we have Peter and the rest of the heroes who went to the Galactus

36
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:43.130
hive, right. Where Galactus basically crashed, landed on earth.

37
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.990
That's kind of the first of the infected. So to speak,

38
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.250
carrying all the other infected heroes and then bringing them here. And so with,

39
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.870
with Peter encountering, Mary Jane, of course, she's kind of a,

40
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.170
I'm telling them, Hey, you know, join us that kind of a thing.

41
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.240
And then basically in the middle of nowhere, you know, when,

42
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.950
when Susan goes to bite,

43
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.940
Franklin does suddenly phalanx starts emerging out of Franklin Richards and the

44
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:04.130
whole shield, everything of Susan storm lets down.

45
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.040
And that's what we end up finding out that the way that Franklin lived is that

46
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.010
this is not actually Franklin Richard's right. It is.

47
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.620
But it's not truly like the, like the true Franklin,

48
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.960
the true Franklin Richards has long since been dead. Right.

49
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:17.570
He died at the very beginning of the whole thing because he was bitten.

50
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.470
What ended up happening is that warlock use his phalanx ability, right?

51
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:24.800
So basically it's kind of like techno organic virus kind of ability to basically

52
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:26.540
create a new Franklin Richard's body.

53
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.110
And then the consciousness of Franklin was moved by Dr. Strange from his old

54
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:31.520
body into his new body.

55
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.950
And so that's why he doesn't recollect anything that happened.

56
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.070
He doesn't recall being bitten or any of that stuff because he is kind of a

57
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.390
wholly new creative character.

58
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.850
The thing about this is that he's not fully human.

59
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.480
The other part of this is that Valeria once she starts to kind of realize the

60
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.270
way things truly are that our family really can't be saved.

61
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.060
She does what she has to do. And she basically starts killing them. Right.

62
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:51.880
She starts killing off Ben Grimm and,

63
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.790
and Johnny and Reed and Susan and all them, she basically starts killing them.

64
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:57.860
All, you know, is, you know, and, and, and sucks, right?

65
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:01.300
Because she has to annihilate her. The other part of that is that chewy,

66
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.030
the cat, who of course can swallow huge amounts of stuff,

67
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.480
ends up spitting back up a bunch of the robots that,

68
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:09.310
that in a previously swallowed when they were in the machine city.

69
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.550
And so it's kind of a, you know, ad hoc reinforcements, right.

70
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.920
And things are happening super fast here.

71
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.430
And of course that basically leads to Peter accepting the fact that Mary Jane is

72
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.990
not actually his girl anymore.

73
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.710
Eliana Rasputin tries to go toe to toe with blade. And of course, you know,

74
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.540
she kind of gets the upper hand on him to a degree,

75
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.920
of course doesn't necessarily kill him.

76
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.740
But when she goes in for the killing blow Wolverine,

77
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.300
finally re-emerges and then cuts off the head of Eliana Rasputin as well.

78
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.100
That's when Valeria is like, we have to get to the Galactus hive.

79
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.010
We have to get up there as fast as we possibly can.

80
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.800
And so Peter leaves Mary Jane behind. And once they get to the,

81
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:44.920
to the Galactus hive itself, or at least as they try to make their escape manna,

82
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.750
the Sentinel kind of ends up giving them a ride.

83
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.870
But Nana isn't really able to make it as fast as she can, right.

84
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.140
Because she's basically had a whole bunch of damage done to her systems.

85
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.780
And so in their current condition, it's the fastest she can go,

86
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.140
but it's not working because everybody's catching up to them. Right?

87
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.500
All these people are traveling as fast as they possibly can to seize everybody

88
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:02.770
here.

89
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.900
And so what ends up happening is Hannah actually discharges her arms and sends

90
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.290
the rest of them flying into Galactus hive. And then she's ultimately destroyed.

91
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.400
Now, once they get there,

92
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:15.360
the big ones I ask here is what do they do now that they're in the Galactus

93
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:18.630
hive? What do they do in this situation? Is it simple? Is it more difficult?

94
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.270
Like how does all this work? And so what we end up getting is,

95
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:23.760
is Valeria basically saying like, I need two minutes.

96
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.680
And that's when the silver surfer intervenes.

97
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.220
And it makes perfect sense that he would for surfer Reno as a former Hill of

98
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:32.220
Galactus, what basically remained inside of Galactus white.

99
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.980
We're just kind of stay there as a kind of safety 50 device.

100
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.810
And you get this amazing moment between Franklin Richards and the surfer, right?

101
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:43.200
The Franklin literally uses his warlike abilities and just send us like pins,

102
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:45.540
a surfer against the wall. And when the server calls his board,

103
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:46.530
he takes the sort of,

104
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.670
of magic of Ileana recipe and the sole sword and cuts the board in half. Right.

105
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.420
And then just loses. It just says, like, you guys killed everybody,

106
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.570
you killed porridge, you killed uncle Ben, you killed uncle Johnny,

107
00:04:57.571 --> 00:04:59.310
you killed Nanak, you killed everyone.

108
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.780
And Franklin takes the full totality of the soul sword and slice a silver surfer

109
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.080
in half and basically kills it. Now, one thing to understand here,

110
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:08.730
and I think it's kind of smart that Marvel did this.

111
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.760
This is not the full totality of Franklin's pouch, right?

112
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.970
He doesn't really have his reality warping abilities anymore because seemingly

113
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:17.880
his abilities were tied to his body. Now, in all truth,

114
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.440
it shouldn't be work that way.

115
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.710
Unless you have something like a healing factor or something along those lines,

116
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.810
your powers are not tied to your body.

117
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.960
Your powers are tied to your mind's ability to control something.

118
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.760
That's why that that bit is important.

119
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:31.890
There it's how individuals like to beyond,

120
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.370
or that has no true physical form can still do the kind of things that he does,

121
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:37.410
right. The beyond her takes on a physical form.

122
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.890
But the beyond her is essentially just living energy with somebody like Alexis.

123
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.800
He's the exact same way. If you saw Galactus in his true form, he would,

124
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.680
you would just be a swirling, massive energy in a giant purple suit.

125
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.130
And that would be yet, right. So Franklin, his ability to,

126
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.780
to do what he can do is not tied to his physical body.

127
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.460
So by all standards of measurement,

128
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.950
even having his consciousness transformed or moved to a new body should still

129
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.560
mean that he can alter reality on a universal scale,

130
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.290
but such as it was Phillip Kennedy, the guy writing this story kind of,

131
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.500
but when would the idea that Franklin's ability to utilize his powers are tied

132
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.580
to his physical form, right?

133
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.000
And so that's why he's not really able to use reality warping on a massive

134
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:12.500
scale, at least not that we've seen. Now,

135
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:16.130
the other part of this of hilarious plan that what she's doing here is she's

136
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.410
basically using the power of gambit.

137
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.410
And that this hand that she has in her possession was taken by a,

138
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.110
take it by Remy LaBeau, taken by gambit, by force himself.

139
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.420
And the Ford would use it as a kind of source of energy.

140
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.560
What she's doing here is literally channeling the power of gambit into the heart

141
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.830
of Galactus and the intention it's a completely and totally destroyed.

142
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.940
And so Valeria tells Franklin, get everybody out of here as fast as you can,

143
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.420
right? The sword will know what to do. The sword will know how to get them away.

144
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.290
And so what it is up doing is whisking away, Franklin blade, the cat, Wolverine,

145
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.420
you know, everybody here, right? Everybody hears here,

146
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.560
Spider-Man Valeria herself. They all get teleported away just as galoshes.

147
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:55.430
His entire physical form is destroyed by, uh, by the hand of, of gambit.

148
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.030
Now here's the funny thing about this is that technically speaking gambit could

149
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:01.430
do this. Gambit could kill Galactus.

150
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.330
And the reason why is because Gavin's ability is to basically charge up

151
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.300
potential energy, to take potential energy, turn it into kinetic energy,

152
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.170
to basically take objects that are in rest and put them in motion exceedingly

153
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.750
fast, and to force them to spontaneously combust.

154
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.560
There are some limitations depending on, on what we're talking about here,

155
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.900
but we're also talking about this particular universe.

156
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.680
So we don't really know if gambit in this universe under what the same kind of

157
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:28.780
Labonte process that he did in the main Marvel universe, which use his powers.

158
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.320
The fact that he's powerful enough to destroy Galactus would seem that that's

159
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.080
not the case, that he actually never underwent that process.

160
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.090
And that there's no limit to the power that he has.

161
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.200
The other part of this though,

162
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:41.740
is that gambits limit in terms of his ability to destroy objects is truly

163
00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:45.370
limited by his mind because of the fact that his mind was altered to restrict

164
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:46.870
how much of his power he could use.

165
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.590
And so if you have a person who can utilize the power of gambit without any of

166
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:53.710
the blocks that gambit has in his mind and seemingly they could destroy

167
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:56.800
Galactus, right? There's as many questions being left unanswered here,

168
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.660
as there are questions being answered here,

169
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.650
but Galactus in the entire hive are completely and totally destroyed, right?

170
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:04.300
So in effect the heroes,

171
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.720
basically the one here as to what we end up doing is picking up a month later

172
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.220
with manna being rebuilt by the combined efforts of Valeria alongside Vivian,

173
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.590
right? The daughter of vision, and with a, with blade,

174
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:16.600
actually training Franklin on how to use a sword.

175
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.910
The question kind of comes down to what comes next.

176
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.620
And what will rain talks about is actually reopening the savior school, right?

177
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:25.180
Reopening the school. And because there's still mutans out there,

178
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:27.250
even though they're in hiding, there's still meetings out there.

179
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:30.010
They still have their powers and the X-Men still need to exist.

180
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.510
So it was kind of reforming the team,

181
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.780
even if only helping to combat whatever forces happened to exist out there

182
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:37.000
because not all of humanity has been destroyed.

183
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.590
Not all of humanity has been defeated.

184
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.710
And so while there are still meeting survivors, there are still human survivors.

185
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:44.350
So there's still room there to create stories of like, you know,

186
00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:46.570
mutants against humans and, and different things like that.

187
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:49.330
But Franklin ultimately ends up leaving, right? Ultimately ends up, you know,

188
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:51.610
going back inside the house and heading back into his room.

189
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.090
And what we end up finding out here is that he still has the head of silver

190
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.800
surfer because he has questions that he's been reading over the books of Charles

191
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.080
Xavier, specifically in relation to the brood.

192
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.530
And he asks every single brute hive has a queen, right?

193
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:07.890
So if the brute hive infected Galactus and then in turn,

194
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.290
Galactus was brought to earth when he infected the heroes,

195
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.960
then that means there had to have been a brood queen on earth.

196
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.210
So the question is, who's the brood queen, right?

197
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.800
Who's this person that's in charge of the brood,

198
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.820
this one individual that survived and could repopulate and basically recreate

199
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.950
this entire zombie infection yet again,

200
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.140
only improve on where they messed up before.

201
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.530
And the response is silver surfer is that she knows exactly who you are.

202
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.460
She knows who you are.

203
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.800
She knows what it is that all of you guys did on this earth.

204
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.690
And the two of you will meet soon enough.

205
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.410
And so the indication here is that the brute queen is actually Carol Danvers,

206
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.890
right? The,

207
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.770
she was infected and she's the one that's basically kind of running the show.

208
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.440
So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

209
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.970
If you guys are new here to come and explain it,

210
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:47.160
make sure you guys have the sub button to become part of the Rob core.

211
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:48.030
If you guys enjoyed this video,

212
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:50.130
make sure you drop a light and let me know what you guys thought about.

213
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.640
Marvel zombies down in the comment section. For being honest with the guys,

214
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.880
it's a much lackluster story than the original Marvel zombies.

215
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.430
It's not nearly as good, but, uh, yeah,

216
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.950
we're gonna bring this to an end and I will catch you all later.

217
