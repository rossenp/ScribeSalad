4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.903
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.620
<v 1>And we are back with death metal and this is we're almost done.</v>

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.030
This is the second to the last part.

7
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:20.360
I guess it's actually a seven issue series instead of six issues. Honestly,

8
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.450
I don't really even check online to see what the reading issues are for death

9
00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:23.991
metal anymore.

10
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.890
I just kind of letting it go and just seeing how far we get into it,

11
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.480
but I'm pretty sure we have one more part left. Um, but here's the thing.

12
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.910
So in the last video that we did, the last part of the story,

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.080
we had this scenario where we basically saw the superheroes on earth,

14
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.120
pretty much eradicating earth, right? Just eliminating the entirety of,

15
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.810
of earth itself, right? The earth populace, all that kind of stuff.

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.430
And the reason why, and I think it was,

17
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:48.590
was something that was a little bit murky in the last video that we did.

18
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.400
So we're going to try to clarify here, the reason why is because in DC comics,

19
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:55.520
this is called prime earth, right? It's the main earth of DC comics,

20
00:00:55.521 --> 00:01:00.260
the main universe and the entirety of the dark multi-verse is based off the main

21
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:03.860
universe. I mean, I guess to a degree, it does involve alien races out there,

22
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.970
but for the most part, DC,

23
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.210
hasn't really specified that instead the entirety of the dark multi-verse,

24
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.380
it seems to hinge on the entirety of everything going on in the main DC on

25
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.180
multi-verse the main DC prime earth,

26
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.340
because of the fact that whenever you look at the dark multiverse,

27
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:20.480
you don't really see like dark versions of like the red lanterns from like,

28
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:23.450
you know, the, some, some cast off planet somewhere is malt.

29
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
You don't really see like a dark version of the guardians of the universe from

30
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.880
like [inaudible], or I guess really old as it's called now.

31
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.050
You don't really see that instead.

32
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:33.500
It's all just dark versions of earth-based characters and dark versions of

33
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.801
earth.

34
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.760
So it stands to reason that at the heroes wanting to mitigate the power of that

35
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.670
man who lasts that it would basically essentially wipe out the Earth's

36
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:44.360
population because with billions and billions of people come billions and

37
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.120
billions and even countless trillions of possibilities. Now,

38
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.930
even then it does require us to sort of cook the books a little bit, right.

39
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:54.200
Because one of the things that we know whenever it comes to branch universe

40
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.940
theory and the idea of opposite,

41
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:58.820
multi versus things like that is that for every possibility,

42
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.800
there's an infinite number of other possibilities.

43
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:02.480
And it literally just branches out to infinity.

44
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.820
So as long as there's one superhero here,

45
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.240
there's an infinite number of possible versions of that superhero in the dark

46
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.270
multiparous, every conceivable fear that Superman could have,

47
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.220
and even the fierce, he doesn't even know he has, right.

48
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.760
The fears on a subconscious level exist out there on the dark multiverse, right?

49
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.290
So it's really kind of,

50
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.910
of Scott Snyder in DC taking the infinite possibilities of dark versions of

51
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.300
characters and kind of reeling it in and saying there's only so many dark

52
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.980
versions of characters that we know of. Right.

53
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.000
So it's kind of taking what is in effect, an infinite number of possibilities,

54
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.910
and just artificially convincing them down for the sake of telling a story.

55
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.260
Right? And so, because of that,

56
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:40.040
the only real life that's left here on earth are basically the superheroes that

57
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:41.780
you see here. Right. And that's essentially it,

58
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.370
there really isn't anything else. Now,

59
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.240
the other thing that we saw is that you saw all these different versions of a

60
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.050
dark worlds that had been created by the Batman who laughs showing up on earth,

61
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:52.610
right. At least, you know, coming towards earth.

62
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.730
And so one of the big guesses they make here is perhaps there is,

63
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.100
there are no other forms of life out there, right? Because they,

64
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:02.620
they basically cut off the power of the Batman who laughs from all the crisis

65
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.730
energy that existed out there and his ability to create a whole host of new

66
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.350
worlds. So long as prepared has that power, the Batman who laughs does not.

67
00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:13.320
And so he has a huge amount of power in the form of document hadn't,

68
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.830
but the ability to create different universes out there doesn't necessarily

69
00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:19.590
exist, right. His ability to do that has effectively been cut off.

70
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.200
And that's why they, the superheroes kind of guests and they say, okay,

71
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.320
with all the different, you know, dark versions of ourselves that we see here,

72
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.340
maybe this is it, right. This is all the Batman who laughs has that.

73
00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:31.710
There is nothing else there. Once these guys are done, do we basically win?

74
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.230
Right? And that's why they kind of pull out all the stops and say, okay,

75
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.130
then let's get to,

76
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.060
if the likelihood existed that there were other versions of these dark heroes on

77
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.640
earth, right? So they fight this army here when they beat this army.

78
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.670
Another army shows up when they beat that army. Another army shows up.

79
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.250
If we saw that it was going to basically be a war of attrition,

80
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.940
then the superheroes would S uh, stage their power out accordingly. Right.

81
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:54.030
They would use just enough ability to destroy these heroes and then kind of make

82
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:56.670
sure they don't exhaust themselves. Right. Nobody wants to have the rope,

83
00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:57.990
a dope technique done on them, right?

84
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:01.200
When Muhammad Ali beat George Foreman by letting George forelimb pound on him

85
00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:03.300
and hire himself out, right. And then go into the,

86
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.920
going for the kill on George Foreman,

87
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.600
the superheroes don't want to have that happen to them,

88
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.760
where they go ham on all these different, you know,

89
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.780
this army here and then have nothing left for all the different, uh, other,

90
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:15.840
other villains that show up or other twisted versions of themselves to show up

91
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:17.040
from across the dark multiverse.

92
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.430
And the other part of that is we actually switch over to wonder woman and, uh,

93
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.280
and Lobo. Now, if you guys recall with wonder woman in Lobo,

94
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.350
they're traveling to basically the world forge, right?

95
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:29.030
The idea of trying to find some way to essentially tap into, uh,

96
00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:32.190
all the anti-crisis energy that exists out there to kind of become the

97
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:35.970
antithesis of the Batman who laughs right at the Batman who laughs and Perpetua

98
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.420
are tying into the energy that's created from crisis worlds that they made right

99
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.750
to the events of crisis on infinite earths, infinite crisis vinyl prices.

100
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.650
And those, those, you know,

101
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:46.770
those worlds exist because of the actual events that took place. Right?

102
00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:50.760
So the dark multi-verse counterpart is the version of crisis on infinite earth

103
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.960
where the auntie monitor one,

104
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.010
but that dark multi-verse counterpart only exists because the crisis on infinite

105
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.720
earths event happened. If, if that,

106
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:02.220
and who lasts and Perpetua are tapping into that, you know, dark crisis power.

107
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.530
And then what it means is wonder woman, couldn't turn,

108
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:08.190
tap into the anti crisis energy, right? The idea of the antique monitor,

109
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.750
not winning, right? That kind of a thing.

110
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.570
They can kind of tap into those energies. If that's the case,

111
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.930
then what you should be seeing here in this space that they're in worse pitch

112
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.300
black or all the hopes and fears and possibilities, right?

113
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:20.580
Because what they're traveling through is basically a tunnel, right?

114
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.300
So imagine that like you're driving through some tunnel to get to some location,

115
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.780
all the cars that would be around you represent all the fears and the hopes and

116
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:28.500
things like that.

117
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.010
Of all the various humans that exist on earth because of the fact that all the

118
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:32.970
humans are basically gone.

119
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.820
There's only a handful of superheroes left and that crisis energy has

120
00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:38.140
effectively been cut off. There's nothing here. And the,

121
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:40.260
the only real last hair that exists out there,

122
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:44.070
the only real horrifying concept that exists is now basically the Batman who

123
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:47.140
laughs. Right. And that's kind of resented by the fact that all the, the,

124
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.740
the versions of, of the twisted versions of Batman,

125
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:51.330
Superman wonder woman that all existed,

126
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.450
that are currently on the battlefield seem to have basically resided here at

127
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:55.470
some point in time, right.

128
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.980
Where they've all been pulled out and they're sent to that location.

129
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.830
But because the Batman who laughs is the only real terror that's left,

130
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.000
then it's all the fears that come certain, the Batman who laughs the forums,

131
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.350
he could take different things like that.

132
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.630
Now they're not getting in a tangible form yet. Right.

133
00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:09.490
Because right now they're just fears that exist.

134
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.780
It seems like it's not until these fears manifest in the physical world that

135
00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:15.820
they suddenly take on a form. These twisted versions,

136
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.790
things like the Batman who laughs is actually the Superman who laughs or it's

137
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.700
the wonder woman who lasts or the specter who lasts or something like that.

138
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.690
It's just a concept once this, this concept leaves this, you know,

139
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.800
a theorial plane and it goes to a place like earth prime in DC in the,

140
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:32.950
in the DC comics. Uh, then it turns into the physical form,

141
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.100
the specter who lasts or something like that. Right. So it's just at the moment,

142
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:38.800
it's just thoughts that can actually attack them. But for the most part,

143
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.160
the other thing that goes on here is the actual confrontation between the Batman

144
00:06:42.161 --> 00:06:43.810
who laughs and perpetual. Remember,

145
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.850
they're still fighting over dominance of the universe.

146
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.030
There's no Perpetua kind of plays this gambit where she's like, look,

147
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.720
you have to understand here. I'm the only thing that's holding back. Those,

148
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.870
you know, power's out there from realizing what we've done. Right.

149
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.880
And that's one of the things that Scott Snyder kind of hit on it.

150
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.700
And this is one of the things that also applies to Marvel comics, right.

151
00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:04.660
That Perpetua is in effect a kind of stand in for like the one above all,

152
00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:07.330
if not like above that in Marvel comics. Right?

153
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:09.730
So a Marvel you've got the one above all, and then you have like,

154
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.240
whatever's above it, right. If they're is anything model's never said there is.

155
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.130
But if there could possibly be a thing above it,

156
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.430
then those seem to be the individuals that recruit creative perpetuate as well.

157
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.840
Because what VCs told us here is that these individuals that created Perpetua

158
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.330
and basically sent her on the mission to create the multi-verse,

159
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.660
they're the ones who run the omniverse and the omniverse is basically a

160
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:32.830
collection of multiverses. And so the omniverse in, in cases, comics,

161
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:35.860
and in cases, you know, spawn comics and different things like that. And so,

162
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.190
you know,

163
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.580
if we extrapolate this out and we're really delving into the realm of hearsay

164
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:43.120
and just guesswork, what if we, if we extrapolate that out,

165
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.440
then we can largely make a reasonable assumption that these Omni Versal entities

166
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:49.690
that exist out there that could create a, create a Perpetua.

167
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.590
Seemingly also created a presence in DC comics that created the one above all in

168
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.640
Marvel comics, right?

169
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.700
Like they're the ones that are responsible for seemingly the existence of all

170
00:07:57.701 --> 00:07:58.900
things that are out there now,

171
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.810
DC really seems to be playing it pretty fast and loose with that.

172
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.210
And basically kind of, and not even really fast and loose,

173
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:08.440
more kind of hard line and saying they're only well for the creation of DC,

174
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:08.680
right?

175
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.250
So seemingly these Omni versatile forces that are out there basically represent

176
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.100
like writers, the writers and artists that create DC comics. You know,

177
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:17.860
that really seems to be the actual explanation DC is giving us.

178
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.140
But if we move away from that actual explanation,

179
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.360
kind of replace it with our own explanation,

180
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.550
then they're basically the ones that created everything in existence,

181
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:27.700
across every form of media ever, right? Television, movies, comics,

182
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.380
actual novels, different things like that.

183
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.620
The one thing we do know is that perpetuate was not supposed to do any of this

184
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:34.750
stuff. You know, she was basically sent there for a task.

185
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.600
She deviated from her task and now she's basically gone arrive.

186
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.500
And so her being able to kind of block the actions of what she's done and the

187
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.940
multiverse as it exists from the eyes of these Omni Versal forces that,

188
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.950
that live out there, it's really kind of her saying, if you kill me,

189
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.500
they're going to become aware of what we've done and what I've done,

190
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.990
and they're going to wipe us all out and they're going to start all over again.

191
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.320
Right. They're effectively going to reboot as we it.

192
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.080
And so the Batman who laughs is kind of like, so who cares?

193
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.800
And so going on the attack again against Perpetua,

194
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.550
ultimately he ends up basically destroying her while he destroys Perpetua.

195
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.180
And actually in cases her back in the source wall and then siphons off the rest

196
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:09.871
of her power, right?

197
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:13.680
So he now has 100% of all this power across the multi-verse,

198
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.770
but the saving grace from all this really comes from wonder woman, right?

199
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:20.130
Where the book that she has in her possession is the one that would allow her to

200
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:23.910
basically kind of tap into all this anti-crisis energy and then use it for her

201
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:24.660
own purposes.

202
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.840
You were her in Lobo or basically cornered that ultimately Lobo kind of

203
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:29.340
sacrifices themselves and says like,

204
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.680
I will stay here with these copies of myself.

205
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.540
And I will basically fight off this,

206
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.600
this Batman who laughs as much as I can get outta here. Right?

207
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:39.420
Like I will be the distraction. Get out of here as fast as you can.

208
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.530
And basically save the day.

209
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.010
The problem with this is that she loses the journal and the process,

210
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.550
one of the Batman who laughs forces basically gets a hold of it and Lobo

211
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.420
essentially sacrifices himself. And so when she shows up to the forge of worlds,

212
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.840
then what this leads to you is basically this kind of formation of dark side,

213
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.960
who says like all is basically lost here. There's nothing you can do.

214
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.640
But in this moment, right now, what few hopes and fears exist out there,

215
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.110
really what few hopes exists out there? Come from your superhero,

216
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:06.480
friends on earth, but there's not really anybody left, right?

217
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:10.410
So there's no real hopes here by so the possibility of new alternate realities

218
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:14.370
being created based on the positive hopes of people who exist out there is

219
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:16.410
basically null and void. It doesn't really exist.

220
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:19.170
This forge is dwindling out and when it totally burns out,

221
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.420
it'll be because all your friends died. And then from there,

222
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.830
no new life will be created.

223
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.380
It'll allow the Batman who laughs to wipe all this away.

224
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.020
And the basically re you know, replace it with, uh, with his,

225
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.650
his depiction of how life should be kind of like a dark multi-verse 2.0,

226
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:33.330
basically. And so with that in mind,

227
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.360
wonder woman kind of starts pondering all this writing kind of starts thinking

228
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:37.141
about all this. Now,

229
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.930
the funny thing is once Batman who laughs overtake Perpetua,

230
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.700
he kind of starts to reel back his forces.

231
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.560
And when they all basically stop fighting,

232
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.770
that's when the superheroes make the false assumption that they want this to be

233
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.470
all the supervillains, all these dark twisted versions kind of stop.

234
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.410
And it's like, okay, we've won. Right. We drove them back. We demoralize them,

235
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:52.771
right. We,

236
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:55.830
we basically saved the day and that's when Batman kind of hits on the idea

237
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.200
something's wrong here, right? Like, something's wrong.

238
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:01.020
Like things are changing, right? Things are shifting. And that's when,

239
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.680
when even Jaro and almost anybody else who can subtly pick up on this starts to

240
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:07.470
realize the earth is shifting, right? Like the earth is shifting,

241
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:11.250
it's adjusting, it's modifying. We didn't beat anybody. We've lost. Right.

242
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:13.590
The Batman who lasts, took over perpetuate, she's gone.

243
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:17.580
Now he has absolute power across the multi-verse. He is in effect God.

244
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:19.710
Now there's nothing we can really do to stop him.

245
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.740
But wonder woman kind of starts to realize this thing where she starts to

246
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.830
realize, as she ponders this idea, she starts to realize what the,

247
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:28.560
what the journal had basically told her that this machine quote,

248
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:30.270
unquote kind of a loose term, you know,

249
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:33.930
this machine could be used to make everybody remember all of history, right.

250
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.070
To unite everybody in a single mindset of we're all part of this massive

251
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:40.290
tapestry. Now the question is, what does this mean? Right?

252
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:43.230
What are the consequences of wonder woman taking this revelation?

253
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:46.050
That they're all part of a massive tapestry and kind of focusing it into the

254
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:48.270
lasso and then dumbing it down into the world force.

255
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.210
What's the importance of that? Okay. So here's what this means, right?

256
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.860
Here's why this is so significant.

257
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.030
So let's wind the clock back to two action comics. We're one with nine in 1938.

258
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.450
That was the very first appearance of Superman and DC comics because of the,

259
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.560
the hilarity of Superman.

260
00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:05.310
You saw a whole bunch of other superheroes being introduced, but in DC comics,

261
00:12:05.311 --> 00:12:08.010
it wasn't until that man is Superman first crossover,

262
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.280
that they had a shared universe, but in the aftermath of that shared universe,

263
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.060
suddenly it was all these superheroes that exist out there all live on the same

264
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.480
earth and they all fight various criminals and they can all team up at any point

265
00:12:18.481 --> 00:12:22.530
in time. Now in 1956, DC introduced Barry Allen.

266
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.930
They basically got rid of Wally West, the replacement with Barry,

267
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.170
but they never offered an explanation as to what happened to Jay Garrick.

268
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.030
And so DC fixed this in 1961, I think with a flash of two worlds storyline.

269
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.050
And what this did is it basically said any superheroes that you saw out there in

270
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:41.850
DC comics that were fighting between like 1938 and 1955 or so,

271
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.330
they were all basically from a place called earth to all the superheroes that

272
00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.630
you see now with like Barry Allen going forward, that's all earth one.

273
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.970
They introduced the multi-verse for the very, very first time.

274
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.950
Now this became very chaotic and it became very hectic. And so in 19, 1985,

275
00:12:55.951 --> 00:13:00.540
86, 87 DC basically rebooted with the original crisis on definitive event. Now,

276
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.580
in the aftermath of the crisis event,

277
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.700
you got rid of the multi-verse and you only had one universe, right?

278
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.460
That was the end of it. It was just simply a place called new earth.

279
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.640
And so in that universe, a lot of the heroes got new origin stories.

280
00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:14.610
They got new, new tales, right? New adventures, different things like that.

281
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.570
And that ran all,

282
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.380
all the way up until we got to the new 52 at the flashpoint event,

283
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.530
which rebooted yet again, between those two stories,

284
00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:25.890
we got events like zero hour crisis and time where the universe was kind of

285
00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:29.160
blinked out and then blink back into existence. Again, we got infinite crisis,

286
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:31.890
which brought back the multi-verse and then you've got final crisis,

287
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.830
which made the heroes aware of the fact that the multi-verse had returned.

288
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.460
But after each one of these prices, events, new stories were written,

289
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.080
new origin stories were given. And so what really kind of happening here is,

290
00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:43.410
is DC is basically telling us,

291
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.950
and really Scott Snyder's telling us after the events of the Christ independent,

292
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:47.580
our story,

293
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.850
nobody remembers anything from before the events of Christ's on defenders,

294
00:13:50.851 --> 00:13:53.970
right? Nobody recalls that in the aftermath of infinite crisis.

295
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.480
Nobody really seems to remember the events from before infinite crisis and the

296
00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:59.430
aftermath of the events of flashpoint.

297
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.240
Nobody really seems to remember anything from before the events of flash point.

298
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.690
And then when it comes to smaller stories, like zero hour and infinite crisis,

299
00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:10.170
final crisis, that the heroes who were changed as a result of those stories,

300
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.270
don't really remember anything that came before it. Right?

301
00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:14.430
So it's kind of this hodgepodge, you know,

302
00:14:14.431 --> 00:14:18.150
sort of organized chaos among all these different heroes in terms of what parts

303
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:20.390
of their history they remember, what parts they don't want.

304
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.510
It's just kind of a patchwork,

305
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.350
just gaps in their brains of things that just have, or have not happened.

306
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.220
What's going on here is Scott. Snyder's basically clean, slating everything.

307
00:14:29.221 --> 00:14:30.054
And he's saying, okay, okay.

308
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.140
So what if after the events of crisis on infinite earths heroes remembered life

309
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.730
before the events of the crisis, right?

310
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.640
They remembered like what life was like before then they remember their origin

311
00:14:38.641 --> 00:14:41.250
stories, all that kind of stuff. And then they remember fighting during,

312
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.100
during the events of crisis on vendors. And they remember it,

313
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.920
the singular universe that came after. And what if, you know,

314
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:49.410
in the aftermath of the events of flashpoint,

315
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.410
they remembered everything that came before point.

316
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.600
You remember all their history and all that kind of stuff and stuff.

317
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.210
Instead of basically treating these stories like reboots,

318
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.120
where the characters were totally reworked, they treat them like events, right?

319
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:01.130
Like it's no different than like, you know, some,

320
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.370
some Batman versus Superman story where like they fought for a little while and

321
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.890
then they kind of go back to doing what they were doing. They recall doing that.

322
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.090
They recall all that stuff.

323
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:11.360
So it's basically DC saying none of the reboots ever happened. Right? I mean,

324
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:14.990
I guess they did, but like nobody forgot anything. They remember everything.

325
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.670
They remember everything that ever happened.

326
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.420
Superman remembers his life when his comics were being published back in the

327
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.300
1950s, right. Superman remembers dying.

328
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.900
Batman remembers having his back broken by bane and the original band, you know,

329
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.240
uh, wasn't nightfall storyline. You know, this, these are,

330
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:33.770
these are all now in continuity. And so there is no such thing in DC comics.

331
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:36.170
Now of that story is not in continuity.

332
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.180
The only exception to that are the L's world stories.

333
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.570
But like in terms of everything that's ever been published in DC comics,

334
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.330
it all happened now, but it all actually took place, right?

335
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.860
There's no more differentiating between the, the, you know, the,

336
00:15:46.861 --> 00:15:50.780
the publishing of DC before crisis and after crisis that doesn't exist anymore.

337
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.870
It's all in continuity stuff. That's basically what this means.

338
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.570
That's why it's huge. It's a massive moment, right? It's,

339
00:15:56.571 --> 00:15:59.120
it's one of the biggest things. And so with all that being said,

340
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.050
wonder woman is now completely powered by all this anti crisis energy and comes

341
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:06.950
emerging out with the intention of facing off against the Batman who laughs more

342
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:10.280
so than that because of the fact that all the heroes remember all their history.

343
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:13.370
Now they're unified in a way that they don't recall because all the,

344
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:15.170
all the previous adventures that they had together,

345
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.870
they forgot about they now remember, which makes them even closer.

346
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:20.900
They're more tight knit than they were before because they know the sacrifices

347
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.160
that the heroes that were lost that are still gone. Like all that stuff is, is,

348
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.940
is a huge, great big thing now. So this is awesome. It's colossal.

349
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.930
It's why I told you guys,

350
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.930
this is basically kind of like a reboot slash not reboot, right?

351
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:36.820
This is DC's version of secret Wars in 2015 with Marvel comics.

352
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.870
It's what it feels like. So with that being said, guys,

353
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.100
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

354
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.360
Probably the single biggest development I'd say in DC comics in the last 10 or

355
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:47.300
15 years, if not ever, but if you guys are new here to come and to explain,

356
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:49.400
make sure you guys have the sub button to become part of the Rob core.

357
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:51.050
If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you do.

358
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.680
<v 2>And I will catch you all later.</v>

359
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:20.910
