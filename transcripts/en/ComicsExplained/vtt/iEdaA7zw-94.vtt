00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.970
guys hit the like button, if you enjoy the video and yeah, let's begin,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.760
do not be too proud of this technological terror. You've constructed.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.010
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.030
or of the year 2020, which has been absolute garbage so far.

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.380
<v 1>It's going on guys? This is Rob and, uh, I woke up a little bit ago.</v>

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.140
So any of you guys who are familiar with my YouTube channel know that I have

9
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:32.480
this pretty deep voice when I first wake up, uh,

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.200
it will change as we go on through the video. The more that I talk, but we are,

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.140
uh, we're covering the secret origin of death metal, right?

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.950
This is technically super boy prime versus the Batman who laughs. But, uh,

13
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.440
it's really, really cool, right? It's a really, really amazing story.

14
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.710
So what we, what we really, I wouldn't really even say that we like anything,

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.480
what we would normally do. And so far,

16
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.360
it's kind of like doing a bit of a breakdown about Subaru prime before we

17
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:56.150
actually start the story we don't need to do because it gets covered in the

18
00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:57.710
story. And that really makes a lot of sense.

19
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.430
Given the fact that Superboy prime hasn't shown up in DC comics for quite some

20
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:04.490
time. And there is a little bit of a refresher that's needed for people who are

21
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:06.260
getting into the character for the very first time,

22
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:08.420
because a lot of people know the character by name,

23
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.180
they're aware of Superboy prime, the power he possesses.

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.360
He's probably the strongest version of Superman that be seen in any of the

25
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:16.010
crisis events minus, you know,

26
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.520
the one that adapts to everybody's powers and like a few exceptions here and

27
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:19.760
there.

28
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.090
But in terms of like the main line Superman who come from Krypton and that kind

29
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.280
of a thing he's usually considered to be the most powerful, uh,

30
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:28.340
they don't really know the history of the character. And so because of that, uh,

31
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.080
we get a little bit of a, of an explanation here.

32
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.350
One of the things that does get left out is the nature of Krypton in the sense

33
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:35.240
that this, this basically takes place on earth,

34
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:39.710
punt and earth prime is essentially DC stand in for the real world, right?

35
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.410
So like our world where you're watching this video and all that kind of good

36
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:44.930
stuff, but the whole idea behind this is that,

37
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.550
that this guy Clark Kent had basically come from Krypton here in the real world.

38
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.080
The difference is that unlike DC comics and almost any other universe or Krypton

39
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.410
explodes in his universe, Krypton is destroyed by the sun.

40
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.160
And the result of that is that there is no kryptonite from the earth prime

41
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.280
universe, right? Kryptonite comes from a planet, Krypton, shard,

42
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.170
the reader found in space or landed on earth.

43
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.810
And that's how Superman gets his weakness to green kryptonite. Uh,

44
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.020
the reality is that here there is no kryptonite anywhere in the universe.

45
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.440
And so the result is that Superboy prime does not have a weakness to kryptonite

46
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.140
because it doesn't exist. Presumably if it did, he would,

47
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.750
but the other counterpart to this or the other component to this is that

48
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:22.280
kryptonite from other dimensions,

49
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:24.830
other universes does not work on Superboy prime.

50
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.730
So he has no inherent immunity to the kryptonite in any form or fashion.

51
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.000
It's one of the things that really bolsters his power. Now in this moment,

52
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.490
he's kind of in a local comic book store, just kind of reading comics and this,

53
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:36.500
some guys show up on him and start giving them a hard time,

54
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.120
making fun of him because he likes Superman.

55
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.000
What kind of an idiot makes fun of somebody because they like Superman at this

56
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.380
point. Like these guys, right?

57
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:45.470
This kid Braverman basically ends up ripping up the common book that Clark

58
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.100
Kent's reading.

59
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.350
And then in turn either just go start beating the crap out of them, right?

60
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.600
I don't know why you'd beat somebody up for liking comics, but you know,

61
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.000
this was the 1980s. Things were a little bit different back then,

62
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.680
but then Lori comes out of nowhere,

63
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.890
basically splashes water on them and is like, my mom owns a drug store.

64
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.260
You guys are banned for life. Now, Laurie was the love interest. When,

65
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.320
when Superboy prime originally showed up in DC comics, back in the day,

66
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.190
Lori was his love interest. And by all standards of measurements,

67
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:10.890
she was essentially his at his lowest lane, right?

68
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:13.740
She was the counterpart to him by the character that would go on,

69
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:15.570
they'd have kids and have a life together and all that stuff,

70
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.040
the caveat to this and the,

71
00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:20.490
and the big kicker of all this is that when Subaru crash landed on earth was

72
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.100
ultimately adopted by John. And [inaudible] again,

73
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:25.320
he never really knew anything about it, about his origin.

74
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.280
And so the funny thing is,

75
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:30.650
it's not like it's ours came about by way of him just arbitrarily lifting up a

76
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.960
tractor one day or something like that. His powers had to be activated.

77
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.530
And the way this activation came out was that because of his love for Superman,

78
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.220
uh, Laurie got him a Superman outfit to wear to this big costume party they were

79
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:41.820
going to go to.

80
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.790
And so once they get to this beach where all their friends are dressed up as

81
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.620
superheroes and so on and so forth,

82
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:49.440
and they're all just kind of hanging out that a comment passes by.

83
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.060
And when this comment passes by,

84
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.470
it emits a kind of radiation that basically activate Superboy primes powers.

85
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.660
And now all the powers of Superman, right?

86
00:03:57.661 --> 00:03:59.130
He's flying all that kind of good stuff,

87
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.690
any kind of reminiscence about this ride.

88
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:03.900
He reminisces about his life with Laurie when its power is activated, how,

89
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:06.570
like how much he cared about her, how much they were going to go forward,

90
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.920
probably have a life together.

91
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.460
And then suddenly Superman from the main DC universe popped up and said,

92
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.700
there's an event going on called crisis on infinite earth. We need your help.

93
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.060
And ultimately this led to Subaru prime, basically, you know,

94
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.930
joining the various superheroes off against the anti monitor and in the

95
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:25.740
aftermath of that Superboy prime locked away in a paradise dimension or went to

96
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:28.140
a paradise dimension because of the fact that his whole world had been

97
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:31.440
destroyed. That earth Pont was basically gone. Laurie was gone and the,

98
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.730
the desire to get her back,

99
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:36.030
the desire for all those things basically came to fruition with him leading to

100
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:38.750
his current state. Now, if you want to know more about super white climate,

101
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.440
because we don't really have enough time to cover it all,

102
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.250
I'll have the link to infinite crisis down in the description where you can

103
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:47.430
basically get caught up with all this stuff that takes place in between ween

104
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.331
super boy prime,

105
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.480
going into the paradise dimension at the end of crisis on infinite earth.

106
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.370
And this started this story more or less, right?

107
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:55.530
There's a few other things here and there with, they're not super important,

108
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.550
but you know,

109
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.970
infinite crisis is the story that everybody references when they talk about

110
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.570
super white prod, right? Less, that's like the must read Superboy prime story.

111
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.433
And so because of that,

112
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.380
all the other heroes who were here after experiencing their battles with

113
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.690
Superboy prime and knowing him as they know him,

114
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.170
a lot of the kind of turns into can we even really trust this guy.

115
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.140
And while he's using a super hearing to kind of listen to what they're saying at

116
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:18.510
the end of the day, they're just kind of like easy kind of like, all right,

117
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:21.420
these guys still don't really like me and still don't really trust me.

118
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.450
And for good reason, I mean, this guy broke out of the paradise dimension.

119
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:26.340
He literally shattered the dimensional barrier,

120
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.000
broke out of the paradise dimension and just went on a warpath in the main DC

121
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:33.060
universe. There's one point where he fought the doom, patrol the team Titans,

122
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.721
young justice.

123
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:37.260
And I think justice league all at the same time and like overpowered all of

124
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:37.740
them, right?

125
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.220
Like he beat them all and was like killing people and all kinds of stuff.

126
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.710
He just become this really twisted and dark character,

127
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.140
which was an amazing story. The way it was done. It was,

128
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.790
it was so well written by Jeff Johns.

129
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.820
But what you end up getting here is in this moment when he's kind of accepted,

130
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.130
coming to grips with the fact that nobody really trusts him,

131
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:55.140
none of the superheroes on earth, that in reality,

132
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:58.040
while reading about them through comedy books in own universe, uh,

133
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.220
that he came to to respect and to adore that, you know,

134
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:03.800
in his loss of respect for him, for all these different guys,

135
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:06.440
with me within the paradise dimension, to the events that followed after,

136
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.530
they don't see him as a superhero. And so he effectively became the villain,

137
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:09.860
right?

138
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.590
He became the one thing he never wanted to be when he was going through and

139
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.760
reading comic books as a kid.

140
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.020
And then suddenly he's met by the arrival of crypto and crypto is, is, see,

141
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.060
this is the thing about crypto crypto is amazing, right?

142
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:22.040
The great thing about Dodge, if you guys don't own dogs,

143
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.700
the great things about dogs is that it really is just unconditional love dogs.

144
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:29.510
Don't care about, about like your, your political beliefs. They don't care.

145
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.130
They don't care about anything, right?

146
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.180
All dogs care about is that you love them and pet them and that you feed them

147
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.880
and that you take them for walks and let them go have fun.

148
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.540
That's all they care about. And they will love you unconditionally in return.

149
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.410
And that kind of unconditional love from crypto being basically shown to super

150
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.480
by prime is something that he hasn't experienced.

151
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.910
<v 2>For a long, long, long.</v>

152
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.180
<v 1>Time. And it kind of allows a little bit of a softer side to it, right.</v>

153
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.330
Where he starts talking about crypto, you know, and it's like, man, I'm when I,

154
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.240
when I first read a story about you will, as he's petting crypto,

155
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.600
suddenly super boy comes running up, right. He come showing up on him,

156
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.210
counter kids, stupid selfie, come showing up on him.

157
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.940
And it just kind of like leave crypto alone. Right. You know, like, like,

158
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.670
you know, if you, if you heard him all bash your brains in, right,

159
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:11.540
like all destroy. Now,

160
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.660
here's the reason why this has dumped the last time these two guys fought

161
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.500
Connor, Kent got rushed. And not even by a little bit, either,

162
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.870
it wasn't even like a close fight, you know, where it's like,

163
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:24.140
man counter kit's holding on by a thread guys. Do you think you'll pull it out?

164
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.300
I don't know. See what my prime is. It looked like he has much,

165
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.590
much left either commended enough.

166
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.250
Superboy prime had a full tank and was still hammering on Connor Kent. Right?

167
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.260
I mean, this guy never, he never had a chance.

168
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.740
Anybody who ever said that Connor Ken had a chance against super-prime is lying

169
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:38.600
to themselves. That's just the way that is. Right.

170
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.400
Super wind farm was just that powerful.

171
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.490
And so the reality of this is that the reason why they're all kind of here in

172
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:47.650
this moment is because they're waiting on these 52 worlds to arrive that are all

173
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:50.470
basically filled with different analogs of Superman.

174
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.550
But we saw this at the end of, I think death metal, number four, or death metal,

175
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:56.950
number five, but they're all basically just waiting on all these different,

176
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.600
these different heroes, or I guess, you know,

177
00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:01.390
twisted versions of themselves to show up so they can face off against them,

178
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:03.310
destroy them. And then, you know, that's basically it.

179
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.500
And so what you end up having here, this is a cool moment.

180
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.990
What you end up having here is that in this moment,

181
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.580
when Superboy prime faces off against this one, dark analog of Superman,

182
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.020
that assay to feed him and then ultimately kills him that he sees his world and

183
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:21.430
then feels it change. And then his thought becomes, okay, so like, why, like,

184
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:24.700
why is this the case, right. If I, if I kill this guy, right? Like if I,

185
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:28.060
if I kill this guy and take him out, then why does this world change?

186
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.070
Initially the superheroes think he's abandoning them,

187
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.620
but he takes off into space with this kind of realization. And he says,

188
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:37.270
just outside earth orbit, I see the last 52 worlds all lined up, right?

189
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:40.870
The world that this bad guy created to destroy everything in everyone,

190
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:43.420
the bad guy, of course referencing the Batman who laughs. And he says,

191
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.990
and then I wonder, can I use these? Can I change all of them?

192
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.640
If I kill this monster? Now remember did the nature of the dark multi-verse.

193
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.060
And then presumably the worlds of the Batman who laughs created is that they're

194
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.860
dark and twisted versions of essentially existing worlds or concepts.

195
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:01.170
Remember it, when it comes to the multi-verse and DC comics,

196
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.470
there's only really 52 worlds that are ever established by DC,

197
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.200
but there's an actual infinite number of worlds out there, right.

198
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:10.590
We just only ever really see 52 of them. And so, because of this,

199
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.100
what we're kind of getting here is this idea that all the Batman who laughs

200
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:14.963
basically dead,

201
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.170
it's take the idea of worlds that succeeded and then create in turn like dark

202
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:20.520
multi-verse versions of those, right?

203
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.980
Where the worlds of twisted up and the worlds have been screwed up.

204
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.620
The idea seems to be that there's an anchor point there, right?

205
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:28.800
There's a Genesis, a point by which that world changed.

206
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.410
And if you basically destroy that,

207
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.070
then what is basically doing is pulling out the wrong Jinga piece at the bottom

208
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:37.520
of a Jinga set at the wrong time. And the entire thing comes crashing down.

209
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.020
It creates a cascading effect.

210
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.140
And so if that Superman in that alternate reality is dead.

211
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.030
Then the world will shift back to normal, right?

212
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:47.780
Presumably the Batman who laughs control over that world will be removed.

213
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:49.790
And it'll, it'll go back to the way that it was supposed to be.

214
00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:53.000
Now we're not told if it's like an automatic thing, right? If like, you know,

215
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:55.940
this new, new Superman is introduced and then like there's some magic.

216
00:09:55.941 --> 00:09:58.610
This Dawn in the world is twisted up. And then like, as soon as the,

217
00:09:58.611 --> 00:09:59.720
as soon as the Superman's killed,

218
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.540
like the world just snaps back and everybody's like, wow, what happened?

219
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.610
You know, this is kind of crazy. We're not told if it's that way.

220
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.160
Or if it's because of the depth of that dark character,

221
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.940
that the world can actually begin the process of becoming a better place.

222
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.750
We're not really told if it's hard and fast or a little more nuanced in terms of

223
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:18.530
how it works. We're simply just hold that Batman who laughs. If he's destroyed,

224
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.900
these worlds will seemingly continue to exist,

225
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.780
but they're basically function in a pretty normalized way. Now,

226
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.600
one thing that I do also want to draw your attention to here is that we were

227
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:29.750
basically told at the end of the last issue with death metal,

228
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.300
if there's only going to be one continuity after all this,

229
00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:35.240
it seemingly going to be a crisis event with like a new earth, right?

230
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.380
One single universe.

231
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:39.170
There's not going to be a whole bunch of different alternate realities out

232
00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:42.230
there, whether that's true or not. I don't know. But if that's true,

233
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.710
then seemingly these worlds would have to be destroyed or removed somewhere

234
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:46.430
along the line.

235
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.190
It may just be one of these things where it's kind of like a blend between the

236
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.880
multi-verse and the new earth concept after crisis on infinite earths,

237
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.790
where basically there's a multiverse out there. We just never explore it.

238
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.780
We just never see it. Right.

239
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.750
We only ever focus on this one particular world and that's basically it,

240
00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:03.050
it could be more metaphorical that statement in way, or it could be literal,

241
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.270
right work. Every single world of the multi-verse is destroyed.

242
00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:06.620
And there's only one universe left.

243
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.860
We don't really know what we do know is that we end up seeing superway prime

244
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.680
going directly after the Batman who laughs. And one of the things,

245
00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:15.830
one of the comments we get right off the bat here is that the Batman who laughs

246
00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:17.660
kind of analyzes them and says, okay,

247
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.550
there's more to you than I thought there would be.

248
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.040
You're kind of a funny one here, right? This is a little bit different.

249
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:24.380
You're kind of a funny one here. This was a little strange.

250
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.020
And so the two of them actually ended up fighting against each other.

251
00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:31.400
Now something that happens here in something that I'm not really entirely sure

252
00:11:31.401 --> 00:11:35.420
about how I feel as that Superbowl prime is able to successfully go toe to toe

253
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:38.960
with the Batman who lasts somebody to understand the Batman who laughs is a

254
00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:42.590
version of Batman powered by basically Dr. Manhattan's powers.

255
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:47.030
What this really tells us here is that Superboy prime is equal to Dr. Manhattan

256
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.130
power, if not more powerful.

257
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.130
And the reason why is because as they fight against each other,

258
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.800
as they go to go toe to toe in this kind of bare bare knuckle just knocked down,

259
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.290
drag out Raul that there is some, some taunting,

260
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.150
there is some intimidation going back and forth.

261
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.130
And so far Subaru prime talking trash,

262
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.580
the Batman who laughs talking trash to Superboy prime and super-prime is

263
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:10.390
literally getting the upper hand and absolutely pummeling the sky and the Batman

264
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:12.820
who laughs does what he can. Right. And basically says like,

265
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.730
I can give you the world that you want the world war Lori's back where

266
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.590
everything you could possibly want would come true.

267
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.200
But silverware prime rejects it because at the end of the day,

268
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:23.710
the big difference between Superbowl prime and the Batman who laughs is that

269
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:25.480
prime wanted to do the right thing, right?

270
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:28.150
He wanted to get the heroes back to being traditional good guys.

271
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:30.820
It just happened to be, he went about it in all the wrong ways.

272
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.850
The Batman who laughs just wants to make everything evil, right?

273
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:37.240
He doesn't have any good intentions that he's implementing in the wrong way.

274
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:40.480
The way Superboy prime did. He just wants to, he just wants to cause chaos,

275
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:43.630
death instruction and just make everything really crappy. Right? And so,

276
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.930
because of that, where you end up having super prime, just humbling.

277
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:49.450
The Batman who laughs then suddenly out of nowhere,

278
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:52.570
when he goes in for the killing blow, crypto shows up and cry and he's kind of,

279
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.150
he kind of tells crypto like go right. You can't stay here.

280
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.270
And so that's when things get kind of bonkers is because the Batman who laughs

281
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:01.840
makes this comment a super-wide from you can't destroy me any more than I can

282
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:04.030
destroy you. So let me help you. And again,

283
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.950
that's where he basically offers him this opportunity again. And,

284
00:13:06.951 --> 00:13:08.020
and really like even,

285
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.290
even Batman who laughs shows him what this world could look like, right?

286
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.440
That he could see this world where he is a member of the justice league.

287
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.670
He fights alongside the other superheroes. He celebrated and accepted as a hero.

288
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.240
The world sees him as everything that he always wanted to be when he was reading

289
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:24.970
the stories about becoming Superman. But at the end of the day,

290
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.210
he closes his hand and he says, no, I can't accept that. Right?

291
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:30.220
Because it's a world without his parents.

292
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.880
It's a world without Laurie is a world without everything he ever wanted.

293
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.010
And that's all he ever did want. That's that's the,

294
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:38.350
that's the important thing to understand about Superboy product. When you,

295
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:42.220
when you reduce him down past all the infinite crisis, past pummeling,

296
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.800
the earth superheroes being stuck in the source wall,

297
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.440
being locked away by the green lanterns and science cells.

298
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.630
When you remove all that stuff, right?

299
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:53.320
All that talk and all that jargon and you reduce them down to his most base

300
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:53.950
instinct,

301
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.510
the entire motivation for everything Superboy prime has ever done in the

302
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:02.980
history of DC comics is to get back to his home with his parents and Laurie.

303
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.290
And that is what made Superboy prime,

304
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.020
such an incredible and relatable character.

305
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.160
That's what made him so awesome is because who of us has not been thrust in a

306
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:15.760
situation where we seemingly lose everything we care about, right?

307
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.430
Sometimes you don't realize what you've lost until it's gone.

308
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.710
Sometimes you realize what you're giving up as you do it.

309
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.930
But regardless of the situation you meet,

310
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.200
everybody in this world is struggling with something. And in some way,

311
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:30.010
over the course of our life, we've had to give something up. We didn't want to,

312
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.000
but we had to,

313
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.170
and Superboy prime represents that primal desire in all of us to go back to the

314
00:14:35.171 --> 00:14:37.900
way things were right to go back to that point in our life.

315
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.730
When things were at its high point. When,

316
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.360
when we seemingly had everything we could possibly want, that's a strong urge.

317
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.150
That's a strong feeling. And in his desire to get back there,

318
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.560
Superboy prime acted on that and seemingly got lost in his own cost, right?

319
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.790
He ended up becoming everything that he hated,

320
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.430
but the one thing he never wanted to be, that's the thing that he became,

321
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.600
what he sees here.

322
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.220
This is seemingly the perfect life without the one thing that he wants the most,

323
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:03.650
right? The one thing he wants the most, his parents in Laurie.

324
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.800
And as long as he doesn't have those, it's not a ward worth living it.

325
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.910
And so because of that, he literally balls up and says, okay, one last hot,

326
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.960
right? One last hunt. And he basically lets all of his dreams go right?

327
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:16.400
His dreams of being with Lori,

328
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.740
his dreams of being back with his mom and his dad, right?

329
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.230
Everything has been holding on to over the course of his life.

330
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.600
He lets all of it go. Now here's the reality of this.

331
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.960
He never would have been able to pull this off. Had he not done that? Right?

332
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.090
Had he not let himself go in that way?

333
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.660
The reality is sometimes you just have to let things go right?

334
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:36.380
And just move on as tough as it may be. And as hard as it may be,

335
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.030
sometimes that's just what you have to do. And that's what he does. Right?

336
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.510
He takes everything he ever wanted all the life. You wanted to go back to,

337
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.640
he balls it up and he just lets it go.

338
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.260
And just bam punches into the Batman who laughs and shatters him now by all

339
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:52.480
standards of definition, all standards of measurement,

340
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.200
Superboy prime has seemingly destroyed the Batman who laughs.

341
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.070
And it's kind of weird.

342
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.580
It's a little strange to believe the death of the Batman who laughs doesn't

343
00:16:00.581 --> 00:16:03.250
happen in the main story. It happens in a tie-in.

344
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.590
It's a little strange to believe that if I'm being honest,

345
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.140
I don't really think it's true. And here's the reason why,

346
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.740
what you end up getting here is super boy prime who basically just kind of crash

347
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.190
lands, right? That all these worlds, well everything's more or less destroyed.

348
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.560
Right? But everything seems to kind of crack these worlds.

349
00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:19.950
Look like they're breaking apart. They literally look like they're,

350
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.880
they're starting to kind of shake and just explode.

351
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.370
They're basically coming to an end. And when that happens,

352
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.670
superway prime comes crashing down onto the earth. But no one knows it.

353
00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:29.590
He gets there, right? No one knows it. He arrives there.

354
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.290
They don't even know that he was there facing off against the Batman who laughs.

355
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.160
They don't know about that. Crypto responds to prime and then basically howls.

356
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.320
And the pace of the fact that Subaru prime is dead.

357
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.410
And then suddenly he wakes up in his room. He just wakes up in his room,

358
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.120
reading a comic about his own death. Right.

359
00:16:43.121 --> 00:16:45.490
He's reading this secret origin comic. I know it's a little meta,

360
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.960
but that's what used to happen back in the day.

361
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.340
Like back in the day with earth prime,

362
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.260
they were basically reading comics here in the real-world.

363
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.660
So what you can do in order to make this easier on yourself,

364
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.740
assume that that we're reading a story about a kid who's like five blocks away.

365
00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.020
That's what, that's the easiest way to make this make sense, you know,

366
00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:01.960
to kind of make it a little more tangible, but then Lori walks in, right.

367
00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:03.820
And for super bowl prime kind of looking around,

368
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.710
like he remembers everything up to that point.

369
00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:07.360
And then it's like waking up from a dream.

370
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.150
He just snaps up in this place and he's like, this doesn't make any sense.

371
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.750
Like how are you here? Right. And how is like this dog? Like how's crypto here,

372
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:16.420
like how's is this white dog here? How has any of this stuff here?

373
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:19.030
This doesn't make any sense to me. Right? It shouldn't be this way.

374
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.110
Like this is a little strange.

375
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.350
And his initial thought is that it's somehow a dream or that none of it's true.

376
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.570
And like, as he's walking with Laurie, he starts talking.

377
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.600
I do remember that Tommy were on the beach and on the comment pass by.

378
00:17:28.601 --> 00:17:31.660
And then I got my powers and I flew up into the sky. Yeah. I mean, I,

379
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:34.660
that's a great story. It's a, you know, it's a cool story that you love telling,

380
00:17:34.661 --> 00:17:37.830
but like, you know your car can't without powers and that's okay. Right.

381
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.070
You're not Superman. Right.

382
00:17:39.071 --> 00:17:41.920
And so what ends up happening is as this car is driving down the road,

383
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.410
this kid goes running out into the street to chase a bouncing ball,

384
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.690
which is a pretty stupid, typical situation, right?

385
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.730
Kids just run into the streets, chasing balls.

386
00:17:48.731 --> 00:17:51.740
And so Superboy prime or at least cargo's running out there to,

387
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.290
to save this kid and ends up picking up the car right now.

388
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.740
If I'm being honest with you guys, I think this is all an illusion.

389
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.590
I think it's all fake. I think that it's basically the Batman who laughs,

390
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.350
who has this much power, power enough to create worlds.

391
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.190
I have a hard time believing he'd be toppled that quickly by Superboy prompt.

392
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.700
I think that what he's done is he's tricked Superboy five into believing that

393
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.260
he's dead. And then in turn,

394
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.830
he's basically just kind of conjured this world out of nowhere and then said

395
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:20.220
like, this is the world you could have. If you leave me be right.

396
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.620
That's basically it either that, or he's just going to torment. And again,

397
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.030
who knows, but with that being said, guys,

398
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.170
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

399
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.030
If you are new here to come and explain mission.

400
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:28.950
You guys at the sub button to become part of the rod pork.

401
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.320
If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you drop a light.

402
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.050
Now we'll catch you all later. Peace.

403
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:56.780
