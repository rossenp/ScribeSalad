4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.630
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.020
<v 1>This is Rob and we are, uh, we're going to perform an experiment here.</v>

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.400
We're going to perform a test on,

7
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.410
we are going to cover the first part of the origin of the teenage mutant Ninja

8
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:25.100
turtles, or at least the new origin from IDW 2012 run,

9
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.290
which as far as I'm aware is the current run, right?

10
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:28.700
It's still ongoing at this point.

11
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.650
I think there's like 110 issues or something like that,

12
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:32.000
but we're going to conduct an experiment here.

13
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.580
And the reason why is because this is the nature of being a YouTuber.

14
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.280
I get this question all the time. Like I want to start a YouTube channel.

15
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.900
What do I do?

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.720
One of the core aspects of being a YouTuber is to understand your analytics,

17
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.210
right into look at your, your, what your fan base wants.

18
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.500
You can look at your comments,

19
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.630
but the issue you have with comments is only a very,

20
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:51.620
very small percentage of your fan base will ever actually comment on a video,

21
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:53.840
right? Like that video that we did on the last run.

22
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.680
And it has like 110,000 views, right. But like 1800 people commented.

23
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.560
And so at the end of the day, if of those 1800 people,

24
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.870
a thousand want to see more Ninja turtle stuff, well,

25
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:05.720
we can't make a YouTube video based on that. Right. I mean, we could,

26
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:08.510
but it wouldn't really be beneficial for like continuing to grow the channel.

27
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.450
And so the only way to really know what it is that people want is to one

28
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.780
experiment like this. And then to, to follow up by looking at analytics, right?

29
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:18.080
Does the video perform well? Are people watching a lot of it? That's the test,

30
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.210
right? That's, that's the nature of what it means to be a YouTube.

31
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.920
It's one part listening to your fans.

32
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.100
And then one part listening to the fans who don't actually say anything, right.

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.250
And just going by what your YouTube analytics say. So what we're doing here is,

34
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.650
again, as far as I'm aware of, I've done some research and I could be wrong,

35
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:32.240
but I don't think I am. As far as I'm aware,

36
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:36.860
IDW basically restarted the Ninja turtles run in 2012 with this

37
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:39.620
particular story. And the idea is that this is kind of going this,

38
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.050
this sort of jumps back and forth between the past and the present.

39
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.280
We're not going to do that. Instead.

40
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:46.970
What we're going to do is kind of focus on past events and then sort of bookend

41
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:48.650
into what's going on in the current moment,

42
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:50.360
because one leads directly to the other.

43
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.440
And so what we end up doing here is basically picking up about 18 months before

44
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:56.660
the present day, at the time the story was being written.

45
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.610
But what you have here are a couple of different people.

46
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.740
You've got April O'Neil and you've got a guy named Chet,

47
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.240
really Chet Allen looks like his,

48
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.910
what his name is for those people who are really familiar with them to turtles

49
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.860
that might ring a bell for you. For me, it doesn't right.

50
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.260
It doesn't really seem particularly important here.

51
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.410
But the thing that matters is that what they're doing is they're conducting a

52
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.750
bit of an experiment involving a couple of different,

53
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.430
or really a few different animals, right?

54
00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:20.330
One comes in the form of a rat and the other comes in the form of turtles. Now,

55
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:22.610
the reason why this experiment is being conducted,

56
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:26.000
it really comes by way of a guy by the name of Dr. Stockman himself.

57
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.820
While he's talking directly to a guy named general crane, or at least, you know.

58
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.920
<v 0>Talking over the phone, but it's a little direct conversation.</v>

59
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.783
And the idea is that.

60
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.121
<v 1>Well,</v>

61
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:36.770
crane has basically provided stockmen with a kind of mutagen and using that

62
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.240
along with their own resources,

63
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.810
that what Stockman is looking to do is seemingly try to develop super soldiers

64
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.210
while at the same time use animals and the process.

65
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.180
And what they're doing here is they're kind of looking at the progress of this

66
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:47.571
experiment,

67
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:51.230
which comes in the form of what's called Terrapinn human bio armor synthesis,

68
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.260
and then road denture psychotropic serum as well, effectively.

69
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.920
It's one experiment on the turtles and then one experiment on the rat itself and

70
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:00.940
the experiment for the most part to be progressing in so far as they don't

71
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:04.620
really seem to have like a measurable determination of whether or not this rat

72
00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.630
is able to develop, uh, develop sentience.

73
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.950
But at the same time they haven't died.

74
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.870
So the fact that they haven't died is a good thing.

75
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.600
And then it's just a matter of kind of controlling the experiment a bit to see

76
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:14.790
what sort of see how things especially go from here.

77
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.730
But the explanation for this really comes by way of a woman named Lindsey. Now,

78
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.060
April O'Neill for her part is really just seems like the new girl here.

79
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.680
She really just kind of seems to be the new person.

80
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.170
Who's really more enamored with the, the animals themselves,

81
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.130
more so than the experiments,

82
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.020
but doesn't really seem to fully understand the experiment.

83
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:30.570
And so when she asks the question of Lindsay, what's going on with all this,

84
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:33.030
like the Ninja turtles, these, these little turtles are adorable. The rats,

85
00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:33.990
not very attractive.

86
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.710
Lindsay answered the question and basically saying that the Brad himself is part

87
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:39.180
of the psychotropic drug test,

88
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.270
where they're trying to essentially split the rats consciousness, right?

89
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:45.750
Split its mindset between its animal instinct and its ability to achieve

90
00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:47.790
sentience, to have human level cognition.

91
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.560
And seemingly the idea here seems to be,

92
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:52.800
to build on its human level cognition to essentially turn into a walking,

93
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.900
talking rat, right. That more or less seems to be the case.

94
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.670
So this obviously it's winter, right?

95
00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:59.940
This is obviously like the origin of splinter himself. And so from there,

96
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:02.640
what you end up doing is picking up kind of over period, as a timer,

97
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:05.100
you sort of jump ahead three months later, different things like that.

98
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.900
And you ended up finding out that what April had Donna,

99
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.550
she had actually named the turtles. The rat's name is already splintered, right?

100
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.700
This is where did the name of the rat?

101
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:13.920
And the reason why they called that is literally because of what they're trying

102
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:16.860
to do, right? Splint the way a split the way in which it's mind works,

103
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.590
where I created like a splinter and its ability to be, you know,

104
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:23.040
to develop cognitive abilities versus its animal instincts. Right?

105
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:25.320
So it already has this name, but for the turtles themselves,

106
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:27.630
because of the fact that that April basically majored,

107
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:30.750
or at least has a history of Renaissance, a one-on-one this semester,

108
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:33.540
or at least the semester she's in school, she ends up naming them after,

109
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.030
you know, Renaissance art, right. Renaissance painters.

110
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.940
So you've got Leonardo Donatello's Michelangelo and of course,

111
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.180
Raphael and Raphael's established as the guy who's a little bit feisty,

112
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.390
which since is a Dick. Here's the, here's the thing about Rafio right.

113
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.930
The guy's kind of a jerk, but at the end of the day, man, Rafi,

114
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.570
L's got at work counts. And that's the funny thing, right?

115
00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:53.600
That's the funny thing about the Ninja turtles, right? That's that's,

116
00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:56.250
that's the important thing about these Minda turtle guys, right.

117
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.560
If I here's the thing, if I had to team up with one Ninja turtle,

118
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.430
it would be Rafiel Leonardo is cool, but he's too by the book, try these two,

119
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:04.500
like, Whoa, you know what? We got to follow a splitter and you know,

120
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:06.760
what splinter wants us to do and you know, do the right thing.

121
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.240
And Michelangelo is like, he's cool to hang out with.

122
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.930
I would get beers with Michelangelo because like he's, he's, he looks fun.

123
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.750
And like, the problem with Donna tallow is like, he's too techie,

124
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.540
but he's like the MKBHD of like the Ninja turtles world. Right.

125
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:20.760
Let's let's where you'd like the marquees Brownlee of Ninja turtles.

126
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.710
So it's kind of like, okay, I want to hang out with Rafio

127
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.940
because Raphael's just, he's just, he's just the guy, right?

128
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:29.310
Like he's just the guy, here's my question for you guys.

129
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.940
Like if you could hang out with one Ninja turtle, which one would it be?

130
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.160
That's my question for you guys. But nonetheless,

131
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.760
the fact that higher level thinking within splinter become, you know,

132
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:42.090
kind of what's achieved Willy comes by way of the fact that while April O'Neil

133
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.120
is inside the buildings, sort of,

134
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.410
I think that splinter comes running up on her essentially with a CD.

135
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.260
And this has all the information of what's going on there, right?

136
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:52.500
The confidential property, the experiment that's being done on the turtles,

137
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:56.190
right? Human XO armor, synthesis, the experiment being done on splinter himself,

138
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.970
how it can be applied military battle and strategy right there.

139
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.250
So they're essentially looking to take this, uh, of this,

140
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:03.470
this research and weaponize it, this comes to,

141
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.480
comes to bear one when he does that. And two,

142
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.390
when she's met by the arrival of what are basically ninjas,

143
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.700
or they look like footclan members, right? And when they show up here,

144
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:11.840
of course, their goal is to one,

145
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.570
take the research and then two to take the animals where at least see me just

146
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:17.390
kind of take the animals. And so of course the disk is destroyed in the attack.

147
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.350
And then they immediately go after, uh, the, the mutagen, basically the,

148
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:23.510
the substances. And they go after the animals, but splinter himself,

149
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.480
realizing what's going on, goes and pulls the fire alarm. Right.

150
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.480
Which is a genius maneuver. Because what it'll do is it'll bring the authority,

151
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.350
right? It'll bring cops,

152
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.500
it will bring the police department and realizing these guys will realize that

153
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:36.050
themselves, that basically the whole process kind of gets hurried, right?

154
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:37.940
So they ended up snatching up the Ninja turtles. They throw,

155
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.440
or really snatch up the turtles themselves.

156
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.350
They throw them in a bag and in turn, of course, splinter still kind of,

157
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.390
kind of sitting around there. And when the cops show up,

158
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.700
then of course the guys have basically taken off by then.

159
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.580
Now if we're splinter forest park chases after these guys, right?

160
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:52.100
Like literally hunts these guys now. And that's kind of a cool thing, man.

161
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.250
They were not prepared. Like nobody's prepared for a rat, right.

162
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.210
This like sentience,

163
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.300
but it's what makes splinter so cool is despite his small size.

164
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:02.210
And despite the fact that he really is just a rodent that weighs a couple

165
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.000
pounds, if that he gets the upper hand on these guys, right? He goes,

166
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.820
wind up on one of these guys, claws the hell out of him. They dropped the bag,

167
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.680
right. They ended up like throwing the rat out of the way.

168
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.160
And the bag goes crashing down onto the ground and splinter falls alongside it.

169
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:16.670
But he's exposed to the mutagen and the chemicals and substances all basically

170
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:17.451
crack, right? Like,

171
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.810
like literally the turtles themselves and everything are all kind of exposed to

172
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.240
this, this substance of sorts. And so as a result of that,

173
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.900
you have a cat that ends up stumbling across this and it actually ends up taking

174
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.150
one of the turtles where the intention of consuming it.

175
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.130
And so seeing what's going on, of course, like, you know,

176
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.580
rats and cats are basically like mortal enemies, splitters. Like now son,

177
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.790
we didn't have any of that. Right? Like you're not making often,

178
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.480
you don't make it off of my turtle. It's a little weird to see a,

179
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.970
see a rat kind of guarding his turtles in such a way,

180
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.230
probably because they're so helpless,

181
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.100
but like a kind of knock-down drag-out fight goes on between these two.

182
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.890
And this is kind of cool. The cat of course, is of scratching the hell out of,

183
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.700
uh, out of splinter.

184
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.120
And then basically making off with the turtle splinter continues to go on and

185
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:58.210
try to fight by tries to fight on behalf of, of getting his turtle back.

186
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.300
But at the end of the day, one of the turtles is just kind of left box, right?

187
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.180
Like this, this turtle that fell, it seemingly left behind here.

188
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.740
And the reason why is because one,

189
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:07.990
we don't really see what happens to it when a splinter, when the,

190
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:10.830
when the cat basically ends up taking off after just one or gets them that I

191
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.950
just wonder dots that I write and like takes, it, takes it away from him.

192
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.720
And since I kept fleeing for his life,

193
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.270
but the other thing is that really only three turtles seem to be inside this

194
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:22.901
bag. Right.

195
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:25.660
And we know that because of the fact that when the Ninja is basically tracked

196
00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:28.850
down, at least come back down to try to try to attain splinter. And the,

197
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:30.430
the bag of course filled with the turtles.

198
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.100
But at the end of FOLEO splinter is of dragging them into a, into a manhole,

199
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:35.860
into a sewer drain and only three turtles fall down with it. Right?

200
00:08:35.861 --> 00:08:38.680
So it's splinter and these three turtles and that's it. Now of course,

201
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.530
this leases splinter passing out. It leads to the turtles. You know,

202
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.580
looking like they're kind of awake.

203
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.110
Analog is kind of hard to tell when it's turtles,

204
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.430
but you ended up having the cat who seems to have seen all of this. And so some,

205
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.460
some period later, we're not really given a definitive timeframe, right?

206
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:53.680
We're not really given an instance where it's like four hours later, you know,

207
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.160
splinter basically comes to. And when he does,

208
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.800
he's able to walk upright and he's able to speak English.

209
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.470
And so this basically means a heat that this goal has been achieved.

210
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.990
That's splinter himself has achieved higher level reasoning.

211
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:07.920
Now there is a lot more going on to splinter than what we're initially told

212
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:08.250
here.

213
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.010
And that's one of the important things to understand is that it's not something

214
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.920
as simple as like splinter became Cynthia.

215
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.260
And now he somehow knows martial arts because you know, when you gain sentience,

216
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:17.011
you learn martial arts,

217
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:18.990
especially when you're a rat and you teach it to turtles.

218
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.620
There's a little bit more going on with regards to splinter here.

219
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.710
But when he comes to, he basically ends up looking around and he's like,

220
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.390
one of them was like, what happened? And it's like, he's like,

221
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:29.220
what in the world is like my turtles. And they're like, yeah, man,

222
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.420
we're turtles. And like,

223
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.560
this is the first part of the origin of teenage meet Minda turtles.

224
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.310
So here's a cool thing.

225
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.560
And I'm going to throw this out here before I finish this video.

226
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.280
Ninja turtles is legit. Like I never, I didn't really think it was,

227
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.520
I was sitting here like, okay. So like the last Ronan did really well.

228
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.130
And the last is kind of a cool story. Like I can get behind this story.

229
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.050
It's really interesting. I dig this up, but I was like,

230
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.170
I don't know if like the tea that she has on 12 run is going to be any good,

231
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:54.330
but I was like, you know what? We'll read it. We'll buy it on Comixology.

232
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.600
We'll read it. And, uh, here's the thing, man, dude, it's, it's amazing.

233
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:01.260
I never realized midget turtles like Ninja turtle comics were this good man.

234
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.170
I've wished someone had told me before, but Ninja turtles is amazing.

235
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.630
Like it's really, really good. So with that being said, guys,

236
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.770
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

237
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.350
If you are new here to come and explain and make sure you guys have the sub

238
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:12.540
button to become part of the Robb core. If you guys enjoyed this video,

239
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.270
make sure you drop a light and that will catch you all later.

240
