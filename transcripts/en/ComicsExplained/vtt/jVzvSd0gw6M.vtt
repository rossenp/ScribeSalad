00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.923
<v 1>What's going on guys.</v>

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.770
This is Rob and in today's installment of our beyond Omega level series,

6
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:19.130
where we break down the origin and powers of the most powerful characters in

7
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:23.420
comics. We are focusing on one of DC comics, most powerful heroes,

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.350
firestorm.

9
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.520
So firestorm was created by Jerry Conway and Al Milgrom at first appeared in his

10
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:31.070
own self-contained series in 1978.

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.360
Now Firestorm's origin is unique in that it involves not just one individual,

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.090
but two. The first is high school student, Ronnie Raymond,

13
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:39.350
who joins an activist group,

14
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.410
opposed to the development of nuclear technology and an effort to seem

15
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:45.560
intelligent and conscientious in order to impress a girl, no one,

16
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:48.890
the group decides to blow up a nuclear power plant. Ronnie tries to intervene,

17
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.700
but the group incapacitates him and tied him up so that he would die in the

18
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.970
explosion. Now they also attacked and rendered unconscious the plants,

19
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.910
the designer, Nobel prize, winning scientists, Martin Stein.

20
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.660
And so the explosion in the nuclear reactor created a blast of atomic energy

21
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.150
that did not actually kill Ronnie and Dr. Stein,

22
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.690
but instead fuse them into one incredibly powerful entity.

23
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.110
Although the two would be able to split back into their respective bodies now

24
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:12.681
because Ronnie,

25
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.710
Raymond was conscious during the explosion and Martin Stein was not,

26
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:18.650
Ronnie was in full control of the newly created body,

27
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.480
but he could mentally communicate with Martin,

28
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.660
which would be important because his expertise provided a much better

29
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.780
understanding of their powers than Ronnie would have had on his own.

30
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.040
There was a problem. However,

31
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.610
as Dr. Martin could not remember anything from the time when he and Ronnie

32
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.190
fused. And so every time Ronnie became firestorm,

33
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.770
Martin believed himself to black out. When in reality,

34
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.380
his mind was present within the mind of Ronnie Raymond.

35
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.220
Eventually Rodney revealed to Martin, what was actually going on in firestorm.

36
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.950
We begin operating as a superhero based in New York,

37
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.830
although Ronnie was still in high school during that time. Now,

38
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:49.820
once Ronnie graduated,

39
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:53.240
he attended a university in Pittsburgh where Martin would also begin teaching

40
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.210
and they tried to find a way to sever the bond between the two of them. Now,

41
00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:59.630
there were several different iterations of the firestorm character following the

42
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.010
original version, for example,

43
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.910
what an atomic bomb was dropped on firestorm and his Soviet counterpart poser

44
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.140
whose real name was Mikhail.

45
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:10.340
Arcaden the two of them merged into a new firestorm. However, in this state,

46
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.100
firestorm was controlled by the mind of Martin Stein,

47
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.750
who at this point was a music.

48
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.990
Then there was a period where firestorm was actually revealed to be a fire

49
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:21.470
elemental. So basically the living embodiment of fire and in this form,

50
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.580
he was comprised of Ronnie Raymond Mikael Arcaden and a Russian clone of

51
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:27.290
firestorm, but not long after that,

52
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.470
Martin Stein learns that he supposed to be Earth's fire elemental.

53
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.420
So he takes over complete control of firestorm and Ronnie and Mikael were deep

54
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.350
powered and went back to their regular lives.

55
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.100
Now firestorm would then disappear into a void of space and basically

56
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:43.010
disappeared from comics for a pretty lengthy amount of time. Ronnie,

57
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:46.730
Raymond would later get cancer and see his powers restored when he began taking

58
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:48.950
chemotherapy, which doesn't really make any sense,

59
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.860
but this was short-lived as well because Ronnie would basically die during

60
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:53.900
identity crisis. Now in 2004,

61
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:57.290
a new firestorm would be introduced in the form of Jason Rush,

62
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.790
a teenager from Detroit who was possessed by the firestorm entity,

63
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.000
which needed a new house. Now that Ronnie was dead. And so over the years,

64
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.230
Jason would share firestorm duties with both Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond.

65
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.680
And once the new 52 rebooted DC's continuity, Ronnie and Jason,

66
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.340
who were classmates became firestorm after they were exposed to the God,

67
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.000
particle a creation of their teacher, Dr. Martins stunt, as a, like I said,

68
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.910
there've been a lot of different incarnations of the characters,

69
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.680
some of which makes sense. And some of which don't,

70
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.710
and I don't really plan to spend so much time talking about them all,

71
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.660
but they are all pretty powerful.

72
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.720
So let's just get into what Firestorm's powers are since that's really what you

73
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.110
guys care about. So one of Firestorm's most notable abilities is matter.

74
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:36.820
Manipulation at a molecular level,

75
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.050
firestorm can change the atomic makeup of any substance to change its shape or

76
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.540
molecular composition to anything he can imagine.

77
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.470
This is why the role of Martin Stein is so important as his expertise and

78
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.100
physics allows him to guide Ronnie in ways to rearrange molecules,

79
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.780
to achieve his desired results.

80
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.350
That was a matter manipulation ability allows firestorm to perform on nearly

81
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.760
endless variety of feeds,

82
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.540
such as creating a alleged shield out of the molecules in the air or conjuring a

83
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:04.120
cage made of kryptonite seemingly out of nothing.

84
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.260
There are countless other examples of firestorm using this ability because his

85
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.650
ability to transmute molecules is limited only by his imagination.

86
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.920
And so he can basically manipulate molecules to change any object, any,

87
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.090
any other object or even conjure any object of his choosing out of thin air

88
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.650
disability allows firestorm the power to change his shape at will and regenerate

89
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.240
any of his tissue that's damaged.

90
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.170
He can also alter his density to become intangible and phase through solid

91
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.160
objects, firestorm, possesses, superhuman, strength, durability, and stamina.

92
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.170
Having gone toe-to-toe with the new gods,

93
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.620
which are some of the strongest characters in DC comics firestorms also been

94
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:40.660
able to take hits from captain Adam,

95
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.810
who I have a beyond Omega level video on if you guys want to go check it out,

96
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.620
but who's also an incredibly powerful character and was also able to harm

97
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.070
captain Adam with his own punches. Now, in addition to his incredible strength,

98
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.100
firestorm is able to fly faster than the speed of sound.

99
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.850
Not only can firestorm transmute matter, he can manipulate energy as well.

100
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.020
He's able to absorb massive quantities of energy and can then use that energy to

101
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.830
produce nuclear explosions that have enormous destructive capability.

102
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.060
Firestorms blast have harmed new gods Orion and Calabash as well as black

103
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.450
Adam Noah Martin Stein was in sole possession of firestorm.

104
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.500
As the fire elemental,

105
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.830
he was able to produce enough energy to close off a black hole.

106
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.820
On another occasion,

107
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.690
he was able to close a rift in the multi-verse created by Alexander Luther.

108
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.140
The amount of energy firestorm could harness seems to have no upper limit.

109
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.540
And Martin Stein has theorized that in fact,

110
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.920
no limits exist and firestorm contains all the energy that was created by the

111
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:36.280
big bang and could therefore have the potential to destroy everything in

112
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:38.740
existence, except for himself. If he exploded.

113
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.550
Morton also suggests that the explosion of firestorm could trigger another big

114
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.940
bang, creating an entirely new universe. Jesus.

115
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.180
Now these are only a few of firestorms, more impressive feats,

116
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.020
but it's nowhere near an exhaustive list of everything he's done.

117
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.850
But just from these examples,

118
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.130
we know that firestorm is well beyond Omega level.

119
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.090
Anyone who can manipulate matter can pretty much do anything they want and

120
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.990
firestorm has exhibited vast matter manipulation abilities. In addition to that,

121
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.410
the fact that he could produce enough energy to bring about the destruction of

122
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:13.310
the universe makes firestorm a no brainer on the list of most powerful

123
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:14.360
characters in comics.

124
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.140
Because a lot of people's only exposure to firestorm is through the CW shows.

125
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.130
I think that many are not aware of just how insanely powerful he is.

126
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.280
If you follow his powers to the logical conclusion, there's very little,

127
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.370
the firestorm would not be able to do what would that being said, guys,

128
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.630
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

129
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.370
If you guys are new here to come and explain the mission,

130
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:33.320
you guys are the sub button to become part of the Rob port.

131
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.690
If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you drop a light.

132
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.973
Now we'll catch you all up.
