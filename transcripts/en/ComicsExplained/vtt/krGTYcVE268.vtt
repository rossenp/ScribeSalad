4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.780
What's going on guys?

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.370
<v 1>This is Rob. And, uh,</v>

6
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.200
have you guys seen the previews for future state Superman worlds of work?

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.420
It looks amazing, right? It's written by Becky Cloonan.

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.360
It basically looks like Superman, like planet Hulk with Superman,

9
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.120
but it looks cool. Like I'm super excited to check it out,

10
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.170
but I just happen to think about that.

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.220
So we are covering the origin of clown Hunter,

12
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.840
which is something that a lot of the guys have asked for.

13
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.880
And it's actually very fortuitous. We waited until now,

14
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.300
because I didn't realize DC was going to be releasing a one-shot origin of clown

15
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:41.480
Hunter, which I would have known had I just looked it up. But, uh, it's cool.

16
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.350
Right? We've got this. Now.

17
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:45.590
This is the full on origin of his character because in a lot of ways we didn't

18
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:48.200
really know what all went into his character development.

19
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.620
We simply just knew that he became clown Hunter because his parents were killed

20
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.230
during, or at least at some point by the joker. Right?

21
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.870
So this gives us the full on origin, which I'm excited to cover.

22
00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:01.370
So here's the thing this initially opens up really with Leslie Tomkins and crime

23
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:03.590
alley right now, Leslie Tomkins holds you guys who don't know,

24
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.170
she's kind of like the night nurse of DC comics, right?

25
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:07.760
She's been around for a really, really long time,

26
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.480
but she's the one who kind of runs this free clinic down in crime alley in order

27
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:14.540
to serve those individuals who were underprivileged, right? Whether they're, uh,

28
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.930
vigilantes or sometimes even criminals or people who can't afford to go to like

29
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.390
a hospital, because they don't have health insurance or something like that.

30
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.280
She basically tends to their, uh, to their,

31
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:25.460
their injuries and their wounds and so on. And so because of that,

32
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:28.130
she's very much a respected member of the community.

33
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.240
And this really is really kind of reflected when you have this guy who shows

34
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:34.160
about a nowhere looking to Robert, right?

35
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.000
Like to literally like Rob a woman who runs a free clinic in crime alley right

36
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:39.890
now, this guy, big Eddie kind of shows up and he's like,

37
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.320
look like this is Leslie Thompkins that you're robbing. So like,

38
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.570
I'm going to break you apart piece by piece. If you don't get outta here,

39
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.030
Neil you'll guy, the Robert ultimately leaves. Right.

40
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.390
But the important thing behind this is that once Leslie gets to her clinic,

41
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.300
she's met by the arrival of clown Hunter, right by by bat,

42
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.670
I think is how you pronounce his name, but the whole point behind this.

43
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.570
And the reason why this matters is because he comes in there really kind of

44
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.010
having his injuries tended to after he, uh, after he left right in the,

45
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:05.720
the last Batman story arc that we covered, where he almost killed Harley.

46
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.790
And that's kind of what he says, right? She's like, you know, why,

47
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.580
why are you here now? But like why, why come to this place now?

48
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.120
And the reality is he's experiencing an existential crisis.

49
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.420
And the reason for that is we jumped back to three years prior and you've got

50
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:19.490
him just kind of in his bedroom, playing video games,

51
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:23.360
his mom kind of gets and says, look, either you could have helped me downstairs,

52
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.210
right. Or you can help me around the house and Earl stances,

53
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:27.260
like I give you a choice, right?

54
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.840
Either you could clean up your room or you could help your father downstairs,

55
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:31.190
get ready for the dinner rush. Right. And he's like,

56
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:32.750
there were only two people in the restaurant yesterday,

57
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.610
what kind of a dinner rush is there really? But you know,

58
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:37.400
ultimately his mom's just, you know, his mom does what mom's do, you know,

59
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.190
which is like, I will, I brought you into this world now we'll take you out.

60
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.470
So ultimately of course he ends up going downstairs and helping his dad enter

61
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.830
Harley Quinn and Harley Quinn of course shows up with our two hyenas. Now,

62
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.430
given the way she's dressed and so on, you know, this is, you know,

63
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.420
relatively soon to when she ended up leaving joker or at least sometime around

64
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:58.670
relatively soon, one thing to keep in mind when it comes to comics,

65
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.140
you don't keep, uh, keep track of real-world events. So I have real world time.

66
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.560
And so while it's technically three years ago, uh, this could have been,

67
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.280
you know, 20 years ago or 10 years ago in comic book time. Right.

68
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.070
So it's one of those weird kind of funky things where it's like, eh,

69
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.620
it's just at some point along the line with Harley Quinn. Right. Uh,

70
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.920
but when she shows up here, she's kind of like, so Mr. Mitchell J the joker,

71
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.430
like we literally just got done knocking over a whole bunch of jewelry stores in

72
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.270
the diamond district and we're hungry. So I told him that, you know, I,

73
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.920
I used to have full all the time when I was younger, when I was in, uh,

74
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.860
in college. And so he wants to come here and try something, right. So, you know,

75
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.080
the joker comes walking in and he's like, we'll take a table for two.

76
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.190
And immediately.

77
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.500
<v 2>Immediately.</v>

78
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.770
<v 1>Clown Hunter's parents are like, Oh, prep and heat, Neil con Hunter,</v>

79
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:40.180
like bowel goes to reach for a knife.

80
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.970
Now it's kind of one of these funny things because his dad steps in and says,

81
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:45.910
no, we don't escalate things, right. This is the joker we're talking about. Now.

82
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.760
This is the kind of fear that the joker has on the city of Gotham.

83
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.830
Not because of the fact that he's so incredibly violent.

84
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.360
That is part of the fear factor.

85
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.490
But because of the fact that he's so unpredictable,

86
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.070
you don't know if he's going to just kind of leave, like the joke,

87
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.290
we're just leave here and then go back and do his thing.

88
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.260
Or if the joker would massacre everybody in this place, right.

89
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.740
There's no way of knowing what the Joker's going to do because the joker schemes

90
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.260
don't make sense to anybody but himself. And so, because of that,

91
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.840
you end up having Bao. Who's basically told to kind of back off.

92
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.210
And then of course, joker and Harley Quinn are eating their meal and,

93
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.190
and that kind of a thing. And so Hartley's like, you know what?

94
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.460
We should get out of here. We should go find your,

95
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.160
we should go fend for these things, you know, that kind of stuff.

96
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.730
And the joke was like, that sounds good, right? Like go grab the car and,

97
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:24.670
and take the kids. But we're, we're wholly Quinn ends up leaving.

98
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.110
The joker still stays behind.

99
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.110
And this is a very daunting situation because now it's one of these things where

100
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:32.030
it's almost kind of like, okay, now it's just the two of us, you know? And,

101
00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:33.730
and it's, it's, it's a little creepy, right?

102
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.790
Because this is usually where the joker ends up just kind of being insane.

103
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.030
And so ultimately he's told by the father of bow look the meals in the house,

104
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:43.150
man. Right. Like we really, we're really glad that you enjoyed it and, uh,

105
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.150
and make sure you get home safely. And, and the joke was like, okay, like,

106
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:47.500
you know, I really need to give you guys a big tip.

107
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.550
So here's a tip that I'm getting,

108
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.100
you don't breathe and like sprays and down with the,

109
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:53.290
with the joker talks enough. I'm going to be honest with you guys.

110
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.520
I kind of laughed when I was originally, when I was initially reading this,

111
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:00.760
I was like, okay, I know it's not funny, but it's, it's kind of,

112
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:02.920
it was kind of funny a little bit. And I was like, man, this is,

113
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.300
this is messed up. But ultimately of course it ends up exposing bow and his,

114
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:10.750
and his bows mother and father to the toxin. And that's how they're killed. Now.

115
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.800
This is why he associates Harley Quinn with that because Harley Quinn was part

116
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.030
of the duo of the joker, right.

117
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.120
She was part of the one-two punch that were Harley Quinn went, the joker went,

118
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.730
right. It's just kind of the nature of these things. And so because of that,

119
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:25.270
you know, Harley Quinn is every bit as, as complicit in the joker in this,

120
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.940
because Holly Quinn knew what the joker was going to do. Right. Well,

121
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.520
she knew that there was a high likelihood that he would kill them if the Joker's

122
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:33.490
insanity, uh, would lead him to do something bonkers. Right?

123
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.560
So she's just as guilty as the joker is, right?

124
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:38.260
Because she just kind of enabled it and allowed it to happen. Now,

125
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.970
when their bodies are being carried out,

126
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.190
this is when commissioner Gordon kind of steps up and says,

127
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:43.450
there's somebody who wants to talk to you.

128
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.660
And that's when Val comes face to face with Batman for the very first hunt.

129
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.960
And as the two of them are talking, there's a lot of anger inside Ballard.

130
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:52.240
He just lost his parents. There's a lot of anger, a lot of,

131
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.550
a lot of emotion and a lot of desire for vengeance.

132
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.620
And he asked Batman to make a promise, right?

133
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.690
Batman them a batarang and bowel says, make a promise, promise me,

134
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.720
you're going to do something about this right now, as we know with Batman,

135
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.730
he never really does anything about the joker, right?

136
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.760
So this was really a promise that Batman had no intention of keeping. And so,

137
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:08.450
because of that,

138
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.720
it basically leads to us kind of jumping back to this moment right now,

139
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.510
where you have Leslie talking directly with Bao himself.

140
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.080
And it's one of these things where it's, it's,

141
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.550
it's a really interesting conversation here because he kind of asked her,

142
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:21.680
you know, like, why did you, why are you helping me out here? Right.

143
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.810
I can be some kind of creepy weirdo killer. She's like,

144
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.270
I know that's what you are. Right. I know you're the clown Hunter.

145
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.370
I've heard of the clown, Hunter of the narrows. You know,

146
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.580
I know that you're one going around and killing everybody who work hound mask

147
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.770
during the joker war who committed all these heinous acts.

148
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.510
I know you're the person who's doing that.

149
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.200
The question I have is why did you come to me? And the funny thing is, again,

150
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:42.410
he's having a bit of an existential crisis that he found Harley Quinn,

151
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.670
that he got ahold of Harley Quinn.

152
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.040
He had the opportunity to kill Harley Quinn and he didn't.

153
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.770
And so now he doesn't know what he supposed to do, right?

154
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.810
If it's sole purpose for the last, you know,

155
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.260
however long was to basically track down and kill clowns everywhere he found

156
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:55.880
them. And then, then he let one go.

157
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.330
Now he's made an exception to the rule and because he lived his life,

158
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.180
but you know, being defined by this rule or at least lived a, you know,

159
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.430
a portion of his life being defined by this rule,

160
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.970
when you make an exception to the rule you live by then of what value is the

161
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.870
rule that you follow. And that's the, that's the, the,

162
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.180
the situation that he's in here,

163
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.630
that's what he's trying to figure out because now he's in that situation where

164
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:15.920
it comes to the line drawing, right?

165
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:18.620
That's the problem with making a substance to the rules is where do you draw the

166
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:20.810
line? Suddenly it shifts and changes all the time.

167
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.520
And that's not necessarily a bad thing,

168
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.350
depending on what rule we're talking about.

169
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.800
It's reasonable to have a hard and fast line on like killing people,

170
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.790
but like running a yellow light. No, Catherine,

171
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.490
I'm gonna pull you over for that. Right. Running a red light. Yeah. But like,

172
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.890
or going like 10 miles over the speed limit on the interstate, right.

173
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:39.040
There's kind of a hard and fast rules, right? Officially the speed limit,

174
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:43.810
75 artificially, it's like 85 or 90 possibly. If there's not really a cop that,

175
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:47.100
you know, not, not really hopping around you sometimes even a hundred or 110,

176
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.400
115, you know,

177
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.680
if you're hanging out with Benny and driving his Dodge challenger,

178
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.930
which is really well know, it depends on the situation, right.

179
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:56.140
It depends on what's going on, you know, depends on the rules.

180
00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:57.170
But then the less, you know, it's,

181
00:07:57.171 --> 00:07:59.740
it's one of these things where we're in his mind,

182
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.760
he almost kind of defines his existence in terms of video game logic right now,

183
00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:06.040
before all the gamers start coming out earlier,

184
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.250
people are playing video games are violent. That's not what,

185
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.240
that's not what they're saying here. Right. And you know, better than that, the,

186
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.780
the point that he's making here is that in video games,

187
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.390
there is a direct reward system for what you do, right.

188
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.480
As video games are predicated on some kind of a point based system.

189
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.000
Maybe not so far as a direct point based system,

190
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.180
but like a point based system than the less right. XP,

191
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.580
leveling up different things like that. And so, because of that,

192
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:29.800
you commit an act you're rewarded for that act right now,

193
00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.990
your reward may be something that you don't like, you you're,

194
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.990
you may be rewarded with a punishment, but you're rewarded nonetheless. Right?

195
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.640
And so, because of the fact that because of that,

196
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.490
he's kind of lived under the purview of his parents, right?

197
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.420
Do what I tell you to do, and you will get a positive reward. Uh, do you know,

198
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.870
do what I told you not to do, and you'll get a bad reward. You take that,

199
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.300
you combine it with the reward based system of video games.

200
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.420
And all he's really known his whole life is that if you do good things,

201
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.440
good things happen to you. If you do bad things, bad things to you.

202
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.960
And the reality is the world doesn't work that way,

203
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.670
that good things happen to bad people,

204
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.790
that bad things happen to good people and everywhere in between, right?

205
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.670
A person who has done nothing, but act like a Dick to people,

206
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:09.030
his entire life wins the lottery and a person who's been the nicest guy in the

207
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.520
world just always ends up coming up last, right?

208
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.830
Sometimes that's just the way that it works, right?

209
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.220
Not everybody gets their just desserts and walking around the world with the

210
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:20.070
philosophy of everything. Good happens to good people.

211
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.980
Everything bad happens to bad people is a recipe for disaster.

212
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.000
And this situation,

213
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.360
something terrible happened about his parents and they never did anything bad.

214
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.040
It flew in the face of everything he knew and what he desires is for sanity to

215
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.470
return to the world because his world has completely gone.

216
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:36.510
Topsy turvy it's turned upside down.

217
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.000
Now this became evident in the fact that as you know,

218
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:40.950
in the aftermath of meeting with Batman,

219
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.920
that he constantly recollected this promise that Batman made to him.

220
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.040
I promise you, I will, I will stop this. I promise you,

221
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.570
I will do something about the joker,

222
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.170
but every single time he turned on the TV or he saw the news or whatever it was.

223
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:54.960
And there was another escape by joker, from Arkham, asylum and joker,

224
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.420
going on another killing spree and killing more people.

225
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.610
And that then putting joker back in Arkham asylum,

226
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.250
and then joker escaping again, you know, like while he was, it was,

227
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.920
it was one of these things where it was constantly a case of Batman,

228
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:07.590
just never really doing anything to stop the joker.

229
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.180
Then he started to lose faith,

230
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.290
but he started to started to lose belief in the fact that joker would actually

231
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:15.060
do the right thing. And so it was one of these really,

232
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:19.860
really cool discussions that, that kind of takes place between Leslie and bow,

233
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.990
where he brings up this, this statement. He says,

234
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:25.350
there are things out there in the world that need to be done in life.

235
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.490
And that's what I don't get.

236
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.910
There's so much out there that's so obviously needs to get done,

237
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.750
but nobody's doing anything. If I don't do this, who's going to stop them.

238
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.930
All the people who took off their mask and went back to their lives.

239
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.780
And the response of Leslie is why do they need to be stopped?

240
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.160
Maybe they had a change of heart.

241
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.030
Notice the two completely differing opinions here. Leslie is a,

242
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.330
is of an opinion. Everybody should be forgiven for the things that they've done.

243
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.970
Maybe they changed their mind. Maybe they realize that they made a mistake.

244
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.920
Maybe they were somebody who was in a rough situation.

245
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.960
And it was their only real outlet, whatever it is,

246
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.040
it is an entire philosophy based on excusing people of their actions. But the,

247
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.030
but the, the stance of bow is no, we don't excuse them for what they did.

248
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.970
They did a terrible thing. They need to pay the price for what they've done.

249
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.020
That any possibility of receiving redemption went out the window when they

250
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:11.430
committed such heinous acts.

251
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.970
And this wasn't a situation of people who were going through and just like

252
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.590
robbing veins or anything like that.

253
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.860
And his mind when he goes through and he specifically targets these clowns.

254
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.470
It's because of the things that they did, that he kind of tells Leslie.

255
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.530
And he tells Leslie that the breaking straw for him was during the joker war

256
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:27.720
himself, that when he was going through, when he was,

257
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:30.420
when he was in his place and the whole thing started to pop off and all these

258
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:34.050
criminal sort of dawning clown mask and rallying themselves under the ideology

259
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:37.050
of the joker that they were doing. Things like burning people alive,

260
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.040
they were beating, beating people to death, right? They were, were satisfying.

261
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.180
Every despicable desire they had in their, in their minds and their bodies.

262
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.550
And in the, at that point in time, the way the bow saw it,

263
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.000
they were broken and they were beyond any real hope for redemption that any

264
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:53.940
chance they had of, of being able to say, Hey, look, you know, I'm,

265
00:11:53.941 --> 00:11:57.000
I'm sorry for my actions that I want to repent. That's gone. Right? That's,

266
00:11:57.001 --> 00:11:58.300
that's basically gone. Right. You know, it's,

267
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.280
it's one of these things is what does the Geneva conventions,

268
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:01.840
the Nuremberg trials saying?

269
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.390
I was just following orders is not good enough anymore.

270
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.540
And that's what makes clown Hunter so interesting because clown Hunter is kind

271
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:08.530
of the answer to the question.

272
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.310
What happens when a person doesn't believe the lies of Batman anymore?

273
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.610
When Batman says, I promise I'll do something about the joker, right?

274
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.000
What happens when somebody wakes up and says, every time Batman says this,

275
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.280
nothing ever gets done go that man,

276
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:24.400
can't be trusted to keep his promise in dealing with the joker. Right?

277
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.710
What happens when somebody gets to that point,

278
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.780
to the point that you get it's count Hunter,

279
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.750
because what ends up happening is there's a woman by the name of Mrs. NuGen,

280
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.620
who was set on fire by, by one of these guys in clown mask. And in that moment,

281
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.431
he snaps, right?

282
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.190
He has this recollection back to a statement that his mom had made to him.

283
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.990
Your father needs help. I need help. Don't lose yourself South in a fake world.

284
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.380
We need you here in the real world doing real things.

285
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.680
And that's when he kind of starts to realize the fake world is the world.

286
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.630
We're Batman will save us. The fake ones.

287
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.320
World is the world where we have to rely on Batman to make gossip a better

288
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:58.560
place, because the reality is if Batman was going to make Gotham a better place,

289
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.910
he would have, but he hasn't,

290
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.700
and therefore Batman cannot be believed or trusted.

291
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.860
And so it's one of these things where he basically says fine.

292
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.010
If Batman is going to be a half measure, then I will be a full measure.

293
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.560
And that's when he basically ends up taking the battery and he puts it into the

294
00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:13.740
bat. He basically makes it a heat, literally uses the bottom of a,

295
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.280
of a broom and just like attaches, you know, all the little straws to his hat.

296
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.770
He paints it and he goes forward as count. Hunter grabs,

297
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.990
Neo takes the baseball bat. He's the crap out of one of the,

298
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.110
one of the clowns and then sets them on fire. And it's just kind of like,

299
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.790
you know, this is, this is the end, right?

300
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.500
We're a whole bunch of other clowns come after him.

301
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.470
He and turn kills all of them as well. And notice something.

302
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.720
He did something here that Batman has never been able to do,

303
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:37.050
do at the entirety of Gotham city count.

304
00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:39.780
Hunter made these guys afraid to come to his neighborhood.

305
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.260
People are not afraid of committing crimes in Gotham because they're not afraid

306
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:46.990
of Batman. We know that because people commit crimes in Gotham, but in terms of,

307
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:50.610
of what's going on in, in crime alley, or at least in the narrows account,

308
00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:53.970
Hunter, all these guys afraid to come to his neighborhood. They never came back.

309
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.330
Once.

310
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.600
Once he went on that warpath and killed every count he found they wouldn't come

311
00:13:57.601 --> 00:14:00.090
back. And the reason why is because unlike Batman,

312
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:03.690
where all the most they have to be worried about is handed over to the justice

313
00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:05.670
system, which is probably ill-equipped to handle them.

314
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.370
And then they're thrown in jail and like they escape or something like that.

315
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.540
With, with clown Hunter,

316
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.230
they have to worry about living that he introduced a level of consequence that

317
00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:16.650
they simply just weren't willing to accept. And that's the nature of things.

318
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:18.330
That's the huge thing. That's the big difference here.

319
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.860
That was somebody like Leslie Thompkins.

320
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.040
She's avidly against the idea of using violence, right?

321
00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:24.300
She says violence never solves anything. That's not true.

322
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.900
Violence solves lots of things, right? Violence is not always the answer,

323
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:30.420
but it is a answer. And it's a very effective answer.

324
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.750
Problem with violence is it makes people uncomfortable and it disrupts the

325
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:37.620
status quo. It kind of flies in the face of the comfortable life they live.

326
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.710
And it asks them to make sacrifices that they're just not willing to make.

327
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.480
Right? So people want things to change.

328
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.170
They just don't want to have to do anything that actually requires change. But,

329
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.470
but clown Hunter stepped in and said, no things need to change.

330
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.730
If people aren't willing to do what needs to be done to at least make my

331
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:55.610
neighborhood safer, then the hell with it, I'll do it on my own. And that's,

332
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.090
that's exactly how he became the character that he became. Right.

333
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.790
That's one of the interesting things here is because violence, again,

334
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:04.090
it introduces a kind of, it does create more violence. That's true.

335
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.070
But sometimes that's just the price you pay.

336
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.790
And ultimately you kind of have to end up becoming that kind of a person that

337
00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:12.100
you have to become a kind of person where you look at a circumstance and say,

338
00:15:12.101 --> 00:15:12.610
okay,

339
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.000
I'm facing off against a situation where the people involved just cannot be

340
00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:19.120
fixed. They cannot be redeemed. There's no way to save them.

341
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.440
They're just too far gone.

342
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.410
And no matter what I do or what I try or how hard I work,

343
00:15:23.411 --> 00:15:25.060
there's no way to bring them back.

344
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.850
And so the only way to make the world better is to get rid of them.

345
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.530
It's the only way. And it's not one of these,

346
00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:31.990
these lines of logic that you use as a one-off, right?

347
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:34.960
Like that guy robbed a bank, kill him. That's not what you do. Right.

348
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.780
It's one of these things where it's like, okay, why is this guy robbing a bank?

349
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.480
Is this guy robbing a bank? Because he's in a really, really bad situation.

350
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:43.140
If he is, and how do we find a way to resolve that situation? Like,

351
00:15:43.141 --> 00:15:44.740
is he down on his luck? Is he out of a job?

352
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.410
Is there something I can do to help him get back on his feet, to get a job?

353
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.740
There's all kinds of situations out there where you can use non-violence as a

354
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.450
means to improve people's lives.

355
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.990
But the ability to use non-violence to approve a person to improve a person's

356
00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:56.980
life stops.

357
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:01.120
Once they demonstrate in corrigibility the inability and the refusal to stop

358
00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:03.220
doing what they're doing and to keep becoming,

359
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.930
to literally keep becoming more violent.

360
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.610
The issue that you run into when you use that,

361
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.890
as you kind of create your standard in terms of,

362
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.050
at what point does somebody come for you? Right?

363
00:16:11.051 --> 00:16:13.030
So if Khan Hunter is one of these guys where he's like,

364
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.680
I'm going to kill every single count out there,

365
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.830
every single clown that was there during the joker war, I'm going to kill them.

366
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.250
And then once, once they're all dead, then what do I do? Well at that point,

367
00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:23.170
then it's like, okay, like you've served your mission.

368
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.680
And that's why if you're going to use violence as a means to achieve an end,

369
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.640
you have to have a clearly defined plan for why you're using that violence and

370
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:33.940
what your end goal is. And it cannot be an end goal where you can't,

371
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.350
you can't be like Batman. And just say,

372
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.020
I want to make sure nobody experiences the pain that I experienced when I was a

373
00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:39.520
little kid. Okay. That's way too.

374
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:43.300
Open-ended what cloud Hunter has done here has actually been to create a kind of

375
00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:45.760
defined purpose for what he's doing, right?

376
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:49.810
Like all these people who dress up as clowns and attacks in the narrows and bent

377
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:51.520
to their most baseline desires.

378
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.640
These are people that I'm going to kill because it's not as though, you know,

379
00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:58.120
the whole event of the joker war turned them into something. They were not.

380
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.720
The truth is they were always that person. They were always that kind of person.

381
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.750
They were just looking for a reason to give them an excuse, to be,

382
00:17:04.751 --> 00:17:07.450
to allow that version of themselves out. And so at that point,

383
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.980
all you're doing is just sparing the world,

384
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:11.560
the existence of what is already a terrible human being.

385
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.160
And the terrible nature of that human being is not arbitrarily defined by count.

386
00:17:15.161 --> 00:17:18.890
Hunter is defined by the auctions of that human being. And so, again, it's,

387
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:22.180
it's one of these things where it makes clear and rational sense.

388
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.420
And that's why I say like hound Hunter is a full measure because he has a

389
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:29.590
clearly defined idea on who he's going to kill and why he's going to do it,

390
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.170
what the motive is and why they deserve to die.

391
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.560
And they're the reason why is because terrible people who did terrible things

392
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.830
and showed a callous disregard for everybody. Else's Hewitt for everybody,

393
00:17:38.831 --> 00:17:41.290
else's life for the life of innocent people. And that,

394
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.730
that again is a big difference, right?

395
00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:45.550
That's a huge difference going after an innocent person versus a guilty person.

396
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.490
And that's why like the world needs more clown hunters. That's me.

397
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:54.000
A crime will never go away 100%, but it can go away by a lot. Right? I mean,

398
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.470
it can go away by quite a bit, right?

399
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:57.840
Because dead men can not be repeat offenders. But the,

400
00:17:57.841 --> 00:18:00.990
the funny thing about this is that there's this kind of discussion where count

401
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.170
hunters shows the Sonic kind of resolved this kind of initiative, right?

402
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:06.390
This ability to basically say like, you know,

403
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.110
I have the wherewithal and the capability to make Gotham a better place to

404
00:18:10.111 --> 00:18:12.930
basically finish the job that Batman never finishes.

405
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.960
And what's the response he's given to you by Leslie Tonkin's come to my anger

406
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:19.320
management course, right? Like, yes, you have this incredible passion.

407
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.690
You have the ability to make Gotham better. And yes,

408
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.570
there are some people out there who just genuinely need to die,

409
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.010
but we don't want you doing that. Right.

410
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:27.510
Like come to my anger management course.

411
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.090
And it's kind of crazy because he even goes, as far as to ask her,

412
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.750
would you let the joker live? And she's like, yes, I would let the joker live.

413
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.360
I would, because deep down there there's still humanity.

414
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.580
There's something down there that can be saved, but he can't,

415
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.700
but the joker cannot be saved. There's no making him better.

416
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:44.850
There's no getting him to a place where he wakes up one day and says, my God,

417
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.940
what have I been doing all this time, man, I've just been killing people now.

418
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.980
I'm sure, glad Batman threw me into Arkham.

419
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.090
If he hadn't done it for the 100th time, I never would have learned my lesson.

420
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.090
Right. It doesn't, it's never going to happen. That's never going to happen.

421
00:18:57.091 --> 00:19:01.200
So again, I champion the ideology of count Hunter and I champion the character.

422
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.440
It kinda sucks that she's asked him to join an anger management course. Right?

423
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:06.420
Like you have the ability to change Gotham city.

424
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.830
So we're going to try to stop you from doing that. You know, it's, it's,

425
00:19:09.831 --> 00:19:13.370
it's kind of wild, but it is an amazing origin. I'll go. As far as to say that,

426
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.810
I think the origin of clown Hunter is probably one of the best origins I've

427
00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:18.960
written a long, long time. It's absolutely amazing. But with that being said,

428
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:20.460
guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

429
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.040
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

430
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:25.380
button to become part of the Rob Ford. If you guys enjoyed this video,

431
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.380
make sure you drop a light and that we'll catch you all later.

432
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.930
<v 3>Please.</v>
