00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.160
<v 1>Rob and a credit goes to aunt here for this one. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.020
aunt is a fan on the, um, on the discord server who hit me up and said,

7
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.010
Hey man, there is a change in Marvel comics about Franklin Richards.

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.620
And I was like, okay, let's take a look at this and let's see what's going on.

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.980
Right? So this comes out on the newest issue of fantastic four issue number 26.

10
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:33.890
And here's the funny thing for people who don't know the history of Franklin

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.370
Richards,

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.610
they're freaking out for people who do know the history about Franklin Richard's

13
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.970
it's like, yeah, that kind of makes sense. It was always kind of that way. Okay.

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.810
So one of the big changes they made here is there's a point in the story whereby

15
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:48.860
Franklin is trying to find a way back to Precoa and he's met by Charles Xavier.

16
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.470
Who's reading his mind and Charles Xavier says, no,

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.790
you cannot come back to Coca-Cola.

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.070
And when Franklin asked the reason why Charles says,

19
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:57.440
because you're not a mutant, right? According to Cerebro,

20
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.830
you never have been one that as a child, you dreamed of being different,

21
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.720
special without intending to you used your cosmic powers to alter every cell in

22
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:09.080
your own body, until it appeared as if you possess the XG.

23
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.110
And so basically he made himself into look like a mute, right?

24
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.420
You just kind of masqueraded himself more or less,

25
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.410
but he is not inherently a mutant. This is an accurate statement. And in fact,

26
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.250
it kind of comes from two different sources. Now it wasn't until, well,

27
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.660
we'll talk about whether that changed here in a minute. So, uh,

28
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.210
wind the clock back here, right? One o'clock back to fantastic.

29
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:30.200
Four annual number six and fantastic for issue. Number 103 now fantastic.

30
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:33.410
Four annual number six was written by Stanley and Jack Herby and issue one Oh

31
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:36.710
three was written by Stan Lee and drawn by John, uh, John Romita.

32
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.800
But the idea behind this was that in annual number six,

33
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.480
that's when Franklin was going to be born. Right.

34
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:43.880
And what you ended up finding out was that there were complications that

35
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:48.260
seemingly the power, the August, the cosmic energy that gave, uh,

36
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.110
Susan and Reed and those guys, their energy,

37
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.590
or give them their powers was effectively being siphoned off by Franklin, right?

38
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:55.640
In the same way that, you know,

39
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:58.340
a woman eats food and the baby kind of consumed it. If she doesn't eat enough,

40
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.510
it'll cause problems for her,

41
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.120
it was basically the same thing with regards to the energy she had.

42
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.490
And so in order to bounce those energy levels out,

43
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.480
what Reed and Johnny and Ben Grimm did is they traveled to the negative zone and

44
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.330
then grabbing something called the cosmic control rod.

45
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.270
And the cosmic control rod is an artifact in the negative zone.

46
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.390
That's in possession of a guy named the nihilists that allows its user to

47
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:20.630
basically wield cosmic energy and the most extreme degree, right.

48
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:23.330
To basically control the fundamental laws of the universe itself.

49
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.360
An ILS uses it for his own personal own personal benefit, right?

50
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:28.370
So like keeping himself young, different things like that.

51
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.000
But when a portion of that energy was siphoned off by Reed and it was brought to

52
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:35.510
the main Marvel universe and given to Susan that in fantastic for anyone,

53
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:38.420
number six, a portion of that energy passed onto Franklin.

54
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.660
And it basically meant the Franklin was born with the ability to alter matter on

55
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.200
a universal scale to alter matter on the atomic and subatomic level.

56
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.870
Now in fantastic four issue, number 103,

57
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.770
he was handed over to Agatha Harkness and in issues one Oh four, one Oh five,

58
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.050
one Oh six and one Oh seven, it was kind of established.

59
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.350
The Franklin just sort of had these powers as a result of the cosmic control

60
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:01.270
rod, but all that changed fantastic for issue number 130,

61
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.510
when the team's facing off against the frightful four and the frightful four has

62
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.700
some campaign where they're trying to get a hold of Franklin and it's

63
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.760
established the Franklin as a mutant for the very first time and Marvel comics

64
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.550
following that establishment from that point, going forward,

65
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.770
Marvel always referred to Franklin as a Newton.

66
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:18.390
So you had the original source of his powers and Marvel changed it and issue

67
00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:21.810
130, it remained the status and it has been ever since,

68
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.600
and we've seen it in multiple sources, right? You see it in house, an ex,

69
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.750
you saw it in a, what is it X-Men fantastic. Four or whatever it was.

70
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.690
You saw it in X-Men unlimited. Number 14, back in the day,

71
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.890
you saw it and decimation that decimation storyline, the one 98 one-shot comic,

72
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:37.650
that was like a list of all the mutants who were out there that are left and

73
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:40.260
like the most powerful ones and Franklin was listed among them.

74
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.360
What happened now in this particular story,

75
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.530
Marvel basically undoing everything that's happened since fantastic four annual

76
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.110
number six, and basically going back to the original content.

77
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.750
So I guess it's true that like they're making a great, big,

78
00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:54.510
huge rec Connor baby huge change, but not necessarily.

79
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.760
They're setting things back to the way they used to be.

80
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.050
And that's the big difference here.

81
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.050
What you're seeing here is tantamount to like when captain America,

82
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:03.120
Steve Rogers lost his super soldier serum.

83
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.840
He passed the mantle on to Sam Wilson who became the new captain America.

84
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.690
And then Steve Rogers regained a super soldier serum and went back to being

85
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:10.950
captain America again. Right.

86
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.490
It's a return to the way things used to be the difference here is that a lot of

87
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:16.230
people don't know this history about Franklin.

88
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.750
And so in their mind is not necessarily okay.

89
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.330
Marvel setting things back to the way they used to be back during like the

90
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:24.090
sixties and seventies. Yeah. And their mind is mobile, just changing things,

91
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.310
Willy nilly. And it's not to say anything wrong with that.

92
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.290
It's just not knowing the history of the character,

93
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.790
but that's the way those things work. You know,

94
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.700
that's the way that Marvel comics works. Marvel comics introduces something.

95
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.110
They'll change things up later on.

96
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.350
The important thing to understand about this is that this is the end of Dan

97
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.730
slots, Ron, as far as I'm aware,

98
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:41.060
I think we get like a whole new writer and everything at this point.

99
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.980
So likely this won't stay this way forever. And in fact,

100
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.110
it'll probably go back to things, being a certain way.

101
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.100
The thing about Franklin is the fact that he was a mutant never really mattered

102
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:50.880
in Marvel comics.

103
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.940
It was never really a relevant thing because you never really saw him doing

104
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:57.300
things in comics that could only be done because he was a mutant,

105
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.570
his ability to go to cacoa, which is where all the mutants are located at.

106
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.920
And only mutants can go there.

107
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.100
The only reason why him being a mutant mattered was because of that story.

108
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.860
But when you go look at things like heroes, reborn, where all this,

109
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.760
all the superheroes,

110
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.780
except for like the X-Men and Spider-Man died in a fight against onslaught,

111
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.351
which was when,

112
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:16.890
like the mind of Magneto and the mind of Xavier merged into a singular being

113
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:19.740
Franklin Richard's resurrecting them all from the dead and putting them in a

114
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:22.830
universe that he created of his own accord had nothing to do with the fact that

115
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.140
he was a mutant when Abraxis was free, right.

116
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:28.260
This representation of like destruction across the multi-verse,

117
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.250
whatever it was that he was.

118
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.670
And Abraxis started killing every version of Galactus from across the collar,

119
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:36.360
across the multi-verse when Franklin Richards resurrected Galactus from the dead

120
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:36.990
and that story,

121
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.540
it had nothing to do with the fact that he was a mutant when he resurrected

122
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.630
Galactus from the dead and made him into his Harold during Heckman's run,

123
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.460
it had nothing to do with the fact that he was a mutant.

124
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.800
So I don't really understand that people are kind of getting upset about that.

125
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.590
The fact that he's a mutant is irrelevant in the face of all the things he's

126
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:52.320
done, because it never had anything to do with anything. Right.

127
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:54.990
It was never a focal point of that particular story. I mean,

128
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.890
at the end of the day, you know, it's just a thing that he happened to be,

129
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.570
but it's, it's, it's intriguing to me.

130
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.120
I'm kind of curious to see where Marvel goes, but at the same time,

131
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.210
I don't really care because again, it was never really anything that mattered.

132
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.180
All I cared about with Franklin was the fact that he could just do cool stuff,

133
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.350
right? That's all I cared about.

134
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.100
That's the only thing that matters to me and the, the,

135
00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.730
the fan theory that he controls the Marvel universe feels you guys,

136
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.950
you don't know what that means. There is this fan theory.

137
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.060
That's been circling a circulating around for a number of years that if you go

138
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:22.460
and you look at the publication history of Marvel comics,

139
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.010
that Marvel always referenced current events, right?

140
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.310
Like there's stories where the fantastic four meet with like Richard Nixon and

141
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.920
stuff like that, who is a president at the time. And a lot of those stories.

142
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.150
And then when fantastic,

143
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.290
four annual number six happened that coincided with the publication of Marvel

144
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.720
ceasing to reference modern day events, right?

145
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.960
It was away from Marvel to kind of sustain suspend disbelief and just kind of

146
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.640
say, well, comics happen at any point in time,

147
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.060
but because of the fact that Marvel stopped referencing current events after

148
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.170
Franklin Richards was born,

149
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.740
then it led to this fan theory that Franklin Richards is the reason why no one

150
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.110
ages, he's a reason why everybody is the same,

151
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.260
because Franklin would have these moments in his youth when he would use his

152
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.380
powers, like age himself, up into an adult, different things like that.

153
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.110
He would make some slight alterations or some big alterations,

154
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:06.110
but he wouldn't really know what he was doing. And that on a subconscious level,

155
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.680
Franklin wants everything to stay the way that it is that Franklin doesn't want

156
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:10.520
things to change. Right?

157
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:14.150
So like the most hardcore of hardcore comic book fans and the results of this is

158
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:18.830
that Franklin uses powers unwittingly and basically froze the entirety of the

159
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:22.700
Marvel universe. So that's why Spider-Man, isn't like six years old right now.

160
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.530
Right? I mean, which would make sense. He probably be older than that.

161
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.770
Like he was a teenager when he first got his power. So fast forward, 40,

162
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.380
50 years CB in his seventies, if we were following in real time,

163
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.930
that's why those things haven't happened because Franklin Richards

164
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.420
subconsciously doesn't want them to be that way.

165
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.300
And so he keeps things the way that they're,

166
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.310
that the way that we're used to just a fan theory, I think is a really cool one.

167
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.110
But hopefully this kind of explains what's going on.

168
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:43.850
Apparently a lot of people on Twitter are freaking out,

169
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.940
but this makes sense to me. Right. I'm okay with this. It makes perfect sense.

170
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.700
It's just going back to the original history of Franklin Richards back in

171
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:52.520
fantastic four annual number six, the way he was originally created,

172
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.160
which is fine because at the end of the day, whether he's a mutant or not,

173
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.940
it doesn't matter.

174
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.960
He's still a ridiculously overpowered character and can do pretty much anything

175
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:02.180
he wants to in the universe. So with that being said, guys,

176
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.230
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

177
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.780
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

178
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.030
button to become part of the rod port. If you guys enjoyed this video,

179
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.610
make sure you drop a light and that will catch you all in.
