00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.430
<v 0>[Inaudible] what's up. Y'all what's what's what's</v>

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.160
what's up. Y'all what up?

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.350
<v 1>Oh, they are introducing core the books.</v>

4
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.250
<v 0>Sure. And the fantastic four in the MCU,</v>

5
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.700
the hype is real. The hype is real Mariah.

6
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.070
The hype is real. Is the hype not real Mariah.

7
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.440
It's very real. I'm very excited. Right. But as.

8
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.930
<v 1>Soon as I heard news, I was, I was upstairs laying in bed with my girl.</v>

9
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.570
<v 0>And, and I got in like.</v>

10
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.250
<v 1>Like the news dropped, I was looking at,</v>

11
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.890
I was looking on Twitter and people were like, Christian bale is playing Gore.

12
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:58.160
The godwits are in the MCU. And I was like, what? And then, and then like,

13
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.230
there was, there were a whole bunch of other announcements where it was like,

14
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.850
they announced the fantastic four movie.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.790
And John Watson is the one directing it. Right. John Watts, director Spiderman.

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.220
<v 0>And I was like, so.</v>

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.210
<v 1>You're telling me, they announced Gore,</v>

18
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.970
the God Busher and the fantastic four are going to be in the Marvel cinematic

19
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:15.830
universe. So-and-so and so look, here's here's here's here's the thing.

20
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:16.820
I only let me close the store.

21
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.020
<v 0>I'm going to close this. I'm going, gonna tell y'all something. Let me tell you,</v>

22
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:22.730
I was like, all right.

23
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.990
<v 1>All your people out there who don't read comics y'all are not ready.</v>

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.320
Y'all are not ready for, for the greatness that is going to,

25
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.230
that was going to befall the Marvel cinematic universe. So let's,

26
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:34.370
let's start with, go with the godwits,

27
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.220
but let's let's let's let's start with worthy God butcher, right? This dude,

28
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.470
this dude is an absolute monster, right?

29
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:43.010
So the God butcher was this guy who was on this world where it was like a

30
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:45.260
really, really harsh environment. And like his,

31
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.360
his tribe would pray to pray to the gods all the time.

32
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:50.030
And like the gods God's never answered, like he lost his wife and his child,

33
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.160
or like I said, it was a really crappy existence. Right?

34
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.110
It's like these two gods fell from the sky.

35
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.350
One of which was this guy named Noah who liked defeated the Celestials basically

36
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.184
at some point along the line,

37
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.740
but he had the sword called the all-black Negro sword.

38
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.180
So to the Godbold you're in being off at like the fact that the gods always

39
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.870
ignored them, decides to go on a crusade against the God. So he takes,

40
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.470
he takes the all-black Negro sword and then like recourses themselves,

41
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500
Gore the God watcher. And then like just goes across the universe,

42
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.680
killing every God he can find. Right. So your wives on earth,

43
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:21.620
like a few thousand years ago, he fights the war for the first time beats,

44
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.750
his sled beats the hell out of Thor. I mean, just, I mean, just,

45
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.740
just not even in hell, would you see a massacre?

46
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:29.780
Like what happened when it goes to the God, which would be the hell out of food?

47
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.240
You know what I'm saying? Like it was, it was just, there was, it was,

48
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.140
it was just, it was, he was not prepared, man. That's that's all it was so,

49
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:40.310
so Gorgon know Thor gets, gets just readily crushed by Gore. Right.

50
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:42.050
And it's just, and then the gorgeous vanishes again.

51
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.140
So then they're like Thor in the present day ends up facing off against the Gore

52
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.190
and I think he loses.

53
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.910
And so what you went to finding out is that Gore had actually like in the

54
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:50.744
future,

55
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.700
Gore had like conscripted all these gods that he didn't kill to his cause in

56
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:56.840
order to create this God bomb,

57
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.590
because he was going to basically going to detonate this bomb at a time and kill

58
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:01.900
all the gods at once, right from the past, the present and the future.

59
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.450
So it takes four from the past four, from the present and four future, right?

60
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.610
Older King Thor who liked defeated Galactus.

61
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.940
It took like all of them working together to defeat Gore.

62
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.720
And then it all came down to modern day Thor who takes the all black Negro sword

63
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:20.010
and two mule nears. And then he overpowers Gore and then manages to be him.

64
00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:24.030
Right. Go ahead. The wheel two hammers to be gourmet two hammers. Right?

65
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.680
Well that's, that's, that's, it's it's nuts, man. Like, dude,

66
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.850
here's the thing though. Gord, the guidebook,

67
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.760
which was like the coolest villain ever, right. You guys were going to chance.

68
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.540
There's a thing on my channel here on comments explaining it's basically Jason,

69
00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:40.260
Aaron's a Thor, God of thunder. We cover the whole story arc with Gore. Right.

70
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:43.800
And it's like the coolest thing. It's just this amazing story. But like Gore is,

71
00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:46.800
he's just such in such an amazing and awesome character. Well,

72
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:51.120
this is a guy who just crushed Thor like multiple times. Well,

73
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:53.760
I don't mean just like, Oh man, you know, like he got a couple of hits,

74
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.710
sounds like a high school fight, right? Where like, you know,

75
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.920
you got like one more hit than the other guys. So like you won. No, no, no.

76
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.850
This is like this, this, this, this, this, this was done.

77
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.740
Thor never had a chance, man. That's that's,

78
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.740
that's what that was like Thor never, never like in the first time they fought,

79
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.820
Thor never had a chance. Right? Like it was, it was just, it was.

80
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.410
And then we did, we got the fantastic four, right? Here's the thing.

81
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.080
If we get fantastic four, if we depend heavily for,

82
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.500
we need Jonathan Hickman's fan that we need, we need John [inaudible] son.

83
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.340
I want to say Jonathan.

84
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.480
He was fantastic for I'm tired of seeing like those terrible Fox fan have

85
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.020
planned for stick. I'm tired of seeing those stupid Fox. Fantastic four movies.

86
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.220
I want to see Jonathan. Hickman's fantastic. Four son, John inhibits.

87
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.190
Fantastic for here's why Jonathan Hickman's fan has like four, so cool. Right?

88
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:42.750
So Reed Richards has this son named Franklin and Franklin is like this reality

89
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:46.830
working kid. Right. And I'll, you'll see, I'll tell you, Matt,

90
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.450
let me tell you something. I'll tell you something in a minute, right?

91
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.090
How powerful his kid is right now. I'm sorry. I'm so excited people,

92
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.910
but it is a really it's it's an exciting time. Right? So,

93
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.360
so here's what happens. Right? So like Franklin Richards, when he was younger,

94
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.150
Reed Richards put these mental blocks in place. So we couldn't use his powers.

95
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:01.290
Why did we wish her to do that?

96
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.690
Because there was a story where Franklin Richards was watching,

97
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:06.540
he was playing with a Rubik's cube and then there was a TV in the background.

98
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:08.100
It was like, it was something like, why don't you grow up?

99
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.980
So Franklin Richard's used as like universal wide reality.

100
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.550
What bring powers to turn himself into Jesus and then like just sort of running

101
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:16.560
a muck. Right? So like once they got it back to normal,

102
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.390
he literally turned into, he looked like, Jesus, man. Well, he's,

103
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.560
he's all dressed in white with like this long hair. Like he looks like,

104
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:27.000
he looks, he looks like Jesus. Right? He looks like marbles. Jesus. So, so, um,

105
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.830
so Reed is like, okay, my kids too powerful.

106
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.170
We've got to keep this kind of under check under control. Right.

107
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.530
So I'm going to Jonathan, Hickman's fantastic. Four.

108
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.180
And like this grown guy appears out of nowhere, right? Like this,

109
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:37.831
this just grow.

110
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:42.120
This grown man just shows up in the Backstreet building out of nowhere and like

111
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.340
starts making his way towards the kids rooms. Right.

112
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:46.290
To Franklin Richard's room and Valeria Richards.

113
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:48.900
She's the daughter of Reed and Susan of Mr. And Mrs. Fantastic.

114
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.920
She's like super smart. She said the third smartest person in the world. But uh,

115
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.470
but he starts making his way towards the room and like the fact that other

116
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.830
forests are freaking out. Right? So like, man, what are we doing, man? Like,

117
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.431
what are we doing? You know,

118
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:01.100
there's this weird man who broke into our house and he's heading towards our

119
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.470
kids' rooms. Right. Well, you know, any responsible parent,

120
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.140
we go with guns and like, we would probably shoot him, you know,

121
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.710
because whatever. And so like, they go running towards lone towards this guy,

122
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.410
this guy looks at him and just like creates this foreseeable.

123
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.150
They can't get past. Right. Susan storm.

124
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.870
She was able to create force fields that could withstand the blast of Celestials

125
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.580
and she couldn't even get through it. Right.

126
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:21.860
It's like this guy was obviously not, not messing around.

127
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.010
So he grabs Franklin and then like, like he,

128
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:26.840
he like whispered something to him or something like that.

129
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:28.910
And then Franklin drops on the ground and passes out. Right.

130
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.910
And then he says something to the later yet and then leaves. Right.

131
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.920
So you get towards it, you get to like this,

132
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.670
this whole crazy story going on where like Reed Richards goes to this place

133
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.504
called the nexus.

134
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.110
We're just like all these alternate reality versions of like Mr. Fantastic.

135
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:43.400
Like one has the infinity.

136
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.950
I think three of them had the infinity gauntlets and then like,

137
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:47.420
there's someone on their powers are switched.

138
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:51.170
So like Reed Richards has the power of like the silver surfer or something like

139
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.830
that. Well, what they do is they solve the problem of everything, right?

140
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.840
Like that's, that's their whole goal. Like they just fixed problems.

141
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.050
So like there's a whole universe out there where all they do is grow food.

142
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.630
And then they just like take it to universities where food is, is not that,

143
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.080
not that prevalent. Right. It's like the coolest thing ever. Right. So, um,

144
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:09.380
so one of the reeds ends up going to this alternate reality where the Celestials

145
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:12.830
went crazy and basically forced everybody to worship them as gods.

146
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.860
And like when he came back to the nexus, the Celestials followed him back.

147
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.260
So it was like, Oh dude, this is kind of crazy, man, is this, this,

148
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.860
this is wild. So, so like the Celestials break into this whole place, right?

149
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:24.320
Just like this. Guy's like, dude, they follow me. And they're like, Oh my God,

150
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.400
we gotta, we gotta run. Right.

151
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.640
For like the infinity gauntlets don't work because the infinity gauntlets only

152
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.430
work in their own universes and they're not inside their own universes.

153
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.460
They're in like this kind of hub where like all the universities connect. Right.

154
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:35.960
You would think it works. It doesn't work.

155
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.210
So like these Celestials just come pouring in. Right.

156
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.770
And you start killing everybody.

157
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:42.290
So like Reed Richards from the main novel universe, it's like, dude, man,

158
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.360
we gotta get outta here. Right. So like he bales,

159
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.540
he goes and grabs some giant gun comes back and then like,

160
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.980
like they fight the Celestials off.

161
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.440
And like for the most part today saved and it's like, cool. All right,

162
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:52.274
this is awesome.

163
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.490
So then like what you end up finding out is the Celestials followed Reed

164
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:57.380
Richards to the main Marvel universe.

165
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.430
And so there's this point where like Reed Richards meets with Galactus. Right.

166
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.580
And galactose is like, do we need to talk about your son?

167
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:07.220
We need to talk about Franklin because its powers of woken up again. Right.

168
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:09.440
That's something that's like in the background, Franklin power,

169
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:13.130
Franklin Richard's powers, wake back up and Galactus has legitimately scared.

170
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.890
He's like, dude, your, your son's powers have woken back up man. And like,

171
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.050
it scares the hell out of me. So it was like,

172
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.630
[inaudible] go out to span. Glock is afraid of this guy. So it was like, okay,

173
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.090
like, like something's going to happen with Franklin. So,

174
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:28.010
so the mad Celestials followed read back,

175
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.190
well then like Valeria their daughter from the future shows up and tell Susan

176
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:34.100
storm, Hey, like things are gonna pop off. Uh, just so you know,

177
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:35.630
like these are gonna be really, really, really, really,

178
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:39.290
really dire when that happens, have hope that they will be safe. So you're like,

179
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:41.060
okay, cool. So, so anyways,

180
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:44.330
so the mad Celestials show up to earth with the intention of like killing Reed,

181
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:47.530
Richards and then like subjugating that whole universe and the,

182
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.500
and so like read someone's Galactus to earth and like the lack of spaces off

183
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.950
against Derek and like,

184
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.050
like his face faces off against all the Celestials and uh, and,

185
00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:00.510
and then like in the being defeated, right?

186
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:02.550
The celestial is like merged into one big celestial unless,

187
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:05.460
so he ends up being defeated. And so it was just kinda like Dan sunrise,

188
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:07.920
like a lactose is basically dead. Like they kill him. Right. So it was like.

189
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.780
So like they started, they, they, you know,

190
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:12.870
like Reed Richards and Vincent's weapon called like Saul's anvil,

191
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.080
which is designed to like just shoot energy at Celestials and destroy them.

192
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.520
And like, they, like, it ends up,

193
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:20.310
like he fires it off once which breaks the Celestials back into the,

194
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.580
there are three parts again and then like, um, and then like,

195
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.830
like Wallace charging up the selections attack. Right.

196
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.470
So like Susan storm is sitting there like holding her force field up.

197
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.080
She's got her shield up and like the Celestials are just like hammered.

198
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.070
Like they're just, they're really hammering down a hell fire. I just like, boom,

199
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.580
boom. There's just, it's like the end harms. Right?

200
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.640
Like they're just hammering down on Susan's floor and she's just sitting there

201
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:44.910
holding as best she can. And then like the words of her daughter come up, right?

202
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:46.680
Like when, when things are at their darkest,

203
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.470
like have hope and that they will be safe and like up in the sky,

204
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:52.350
this light comes out of nowhere. And it's like, who, who in the hell is that?

205
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.900
And it's Franklin Richards and Valeria from the future.

206
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.630
And what you end up finding out is that Franklin Richard's from the future,

207
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.390
what to the past to woke is wake his powers up. Right. So,

208
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.080
so like he's the man that showed up in the pan task force building. And so,

209
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.590
so like he'd been teaching himself his younger self, how to use his abilities.

210
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.890
And it's like, son, like, like, so what he ends up doing is his,

211
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:13.530
his younger self just kept all his power. It didn't really use it all,

212
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.790
but he just kind of stored it all up.

213
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.070
He combined it with the power of his older self. Right.

214
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:20.130
So like adult Franklin Richards is the guy who's fighting. He goes to Goliath.

215
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.480
Like here's, here's the most,

216
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.230
it's the most amazing moment ever in the history of this moment ever in history

217
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:26.580
comics, like, like,

218
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.610
like literally Franklin like takes this ball of energy out of him and like

219
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:33.140
throws it in the galoshes and he's like wrong. And he's like, to me,

220
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.200
my Glock just like resurrects galactose from the dead and like makes him as

221
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.130
Harold. And it's like the most it's the most B ever. Right. So,

222
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:44.250
so like GoLive tennis was like fighting, do Celeste Jones.

223
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.740
And like Franklin Richards is fighting the celestial.

224
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.690
They managed to destroy him. Right. And it's just like, you know,

225
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.960
that's sort of, it's like, it's like the most beast thing ever. Right.

226
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.390
We need that in the MCU man,

227
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:58.440
like telling me that does not sound like it's, it's, it's amazing.

228
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.100
It's amazing. But anyway, uh, it's awesome news, right.

229
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.040
I'm probably never going to be able to sleep again now because I'm super

230
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:07.230
excited. I got myself so hyped up, but, uh,

231
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.450
this is it's it's it's it's going to be exciting.

232
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.240
It's going to be super exciting. So anyway guys, Oh, Warren,

233
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.310
bring this video to an end and uh.

234
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.620
