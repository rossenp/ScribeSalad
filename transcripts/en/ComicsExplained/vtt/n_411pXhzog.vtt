1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.990
<v 0>All right. What's going on guys?</v>

2
00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:05.790
This is Rob and after the season finale of the Mandalorian,

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.010
right. Which was amazing.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.230
I had been Jonesy for star Wars and here's the funny thing.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.320
I've kind of really been wanting to cover star Wars for a while now. Right?

6
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.320
Like especially the Mandalorian Wars. I really feel like we should cover that.

7
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.980
Technically it's, there's not really like a Mandalorian Wars comic series,

8
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.040
right? Like it's covered in essentially the old Republic comics,

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.330
but it's more of like a background event.

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.660
But if anybody has any particular comics that like point directly in, you know,

11
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.360
to like the Mandalorians like anybody know anything about the Mandalorian

12
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.060
comics, send them to me, like post them in the comments and like,

13
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.570
I will cover it because do the man, I love the idea of the Mandalorians.

14
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.870
They're like basically the star Wars version of like Spartans from like ancient

15
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.690
Greece, right. Greek Spartans. So I'm, I'm, I'm covering,

16
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.190
what's probably the coolest moment ever in Darth Vader where he faces off

17
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:51.870
against like 150 like rebels, right? Like, like rebel soldiers,

18
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.580
whatever you want to call them, rebel volunteers,

19
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.530
the events of this particular story Bader down,

20
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.110
this takes place in the aftermath of a new hope. Right?

21
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.230
So like the destruction of the first death start. And as you guys know,

22
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:04.200
from seeing like a new hope that when Luke Skywalker showed up on the scene,

23
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.000
Bader was like, dude, okay. It's like this guy,

24
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.460
this guy has got the force with him and like, sort of realizing, okay,

25
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.470
there's something about this kid and all that kind of stuff.

26
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.530
And then of course we know that it's not until empire strikes back that Vader

27
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:17.130
confronted Luke Skywalker with the revelation that Darth Vader was Luke

28
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.230
Skywalker's dad. Right? And so because of that,

29
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.410
Vader is on the hunt for Luke Skywalker, right? He's on the hunt for this kid,

30
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.260
trying to find them.

31
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.190
Now Darth Vader is traveling to this planet called ragas Voss,

32
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.870
which is as far as he's aware,

33
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.720
the last known location of where Luke Skywalker was,

34
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.600
and this information comes by way of a woman named Dr. Afra.

35
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.820
Now Dr. Afra is a really, really cool character.

36
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.030
She's basically like the star Wars version of Indiana Jones. Like the hook,

37
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.820
her comic stories are amazing. It's so cool.

38
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.610
And essentially what had happened was that she was kind of greeted by Darth

39
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.070
Vader and then she was offered to join Darth Vader side,

40
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.080
no for particular cause and mission that he was going on.

41
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.870
The funny thing about this is that she's got two droids. Uh,

42
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.900
one is called [inaudible] and the other one is triple zero.

43
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.160
They're like murderous versions of C3 PO and R2D2 is effectively what they are.

44
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.760
They're hilarious. They're droids are amazing in the end,

45
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:05.820
he's given us information. This is where we believe Luke Skywalker's at,

46
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.890
as far as we're aware, it's a dead world.

47
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.930
You should be able to track them down pretty quickly,

48
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.540
grab the kid and then bring him to the service of the emperor. Right?

49
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.660
Because as we know at this point in the story, in terms of Luke,

50
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.890
Luke Skywalker's history,

51
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.740
he's nowhere near capable of going toe to toe with dark Vader, right?

52
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:22.890
It's not until he gets to Doug Bubba during empire strikes back that he actually

53
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:25.920
starts to get to the point where he could basically present himself as any

54
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.960
measure of a challenge to Vader. Because of that,

55
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:30.590
as soon as Vader comes out of hyper-speed, he arrives at,

56
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:34.890
at voguers Voss and is immediately met with like 36 X wings that were not

57
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:37.470
supposed to be there. Right. The information that they had with, like,

58
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.420
there was nobody there. There's nothing there.

59
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.060
Now these guys are here and you could call it luck of the draw,

60
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.860
but does look really have anything to do with it.

61
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.130
Like you end up confronting Darth Vader, like it's bad luck of the draw, right?

62
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:50.400
Like they're literally just on like some regular routine missions, right.

63
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.010
Just kind of doing their thing going on drills effectively. Right.

64
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:55.440
And they're just kind of canvassing the area and making sure that nobody's

65
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.150
supposed to be there. Who's not supposed to be there.

66
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.670
And as soon as they see a tie fighter, they don't that it's Darth Vader, man.

67
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.420
Let me tell you so right.

68
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.440
What you are about to see here is quite possibly one of the most

69
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.860
spectacular whippings in the history of star Wars, right.

70
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.740
They immediately jammed the frequencies of the sky and it's like, okay,

71
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.960
wherever this Thai fighter is, we don't know how he got here.

72
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.060
He's way too far to be out here by himself. Right?

73
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.770
So there's probably a fleet somewhere around here,

74
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.170
somewhere jammies communications.

75
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:21.970
So we can't go back and report to anybody because we're rebels, right?

76
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.180
We're literally a militia force running on a shoestring budget.

77
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.220
So they immediately jammed the communications a Bader.

78
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.800
But because of the fact of the communication start getting disrupted,

79
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.510
Vader's initial thought is that it was,

80
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.930
it was possibly a trap set up by Afra and goes, as far as the teller,

81
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.180
like if this was a trap, you would better hope it kills me.

82
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.100
Because if I find out that you set this trap up,

83
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.340
I'm going to come back and there's nowhere in the galaxy, you can hide, right?

84
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.890
Like there's nowhere you can go. I will find you.

85
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.280
And I will make you beg for death. Right. Which is exactly what he would do.

86
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.800
And so she's like, no, I'm not that crazy. Right?

87
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.890
Like there's no circumstance where I would like screw you over like that. Right.

88
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:55.480
Like I know who you are. I know what you're capable of.

89
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.780
And so it's one of these things where Bader basically picks up on the idea.

90
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:02.350
He begins to sense Luke Skywalker through the force that he is actually on this

91
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.710
planet. And so initially like she tells him like, you have to run.

92
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.720
And he's like, I'm the Lord of the set. So Dorothy was like,

93
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.070
I'm not running anywhere. Right.

94
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.400
They're the ones who should be running now for all these Webelos here in these X

95
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.800
wings, as far as they're aware, it's your standard,

96
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.400
Imperial pilot flying some Thai fighter. This, this guy is like,

97
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:22.700
it's literally a cakewalk to destroy a rebel. Pilar, I'm sorry. Uh, uh,

98
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.300
an Imperial pilot in a tie fighter with all these guys here.

99
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.030
But here's the thing, man, this is Vader, right? Like one of the,

100
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.720
probably the single greatest pilot in the entirety of the galaxy, right.

101
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:35.470
This guy comes flying right through. As soon as these X wings open fire,

102
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:38.830
he's like he's behind them before they even knew what happened and just starts

103
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.830
ripping them apart. Right. I mean, just new just starts crushing these guys.

104
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.930
Right. Just obliterated them from every direction.

105
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.780
They have no idea what's coming. Right. Like as soon as they turn around,

106
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.240
he's already on the offensive coming right back at him again.

107
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:51.310
And they're like all units attack. Right? And like,

108
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.800
they start to get off because they're like, who in the hell is flying?

109
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.500
This thing is one of them is like a dead man. It's Darth Vader son.

110
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.980
So like as soon as they start started,

111
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.820
start attacking him because of the fact that he's got deflector shields, right.

112
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.150
He's able to effectively deflect pretty much all the shots they fire on him.

113
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:08.410
And he just starts picking him apart piece by piece. This is insane.

114
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.070
This is probably the most spectacular living ever in the history of star Wars.

115
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.860
Not even in hell. Would you see a massacre like this? Right?

116
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:16.780
Like these guys are getting obliterated.

117
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.240
And the funny thing about it is they never even had a chance.

118
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.210
These guys started locking on torpedoes to destroy the destroy,

119
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:25.240
the tie fighter and Darth Vader just like reaches out with the force and sends

120
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.600
the torpedoes off in all these different directions and just keeps on coming

121
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.420
light. Just keeps on ripping these guys up now while that's going on,

122
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.750
Luke Skywalker is part of, part of, of red group. Right.

123
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.550
You guys know that from, from episode four, Luke,

124
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:40.540
Skywalker's out there watching all this happen. Right. And he's just like, okay,

125
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.580
that's Darth Vader. And they're, they're like, wait a minute. Like,

126
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:43.990
are you talking to like V Darth Vader? It's like,

127
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.860
do you know of another Darth Vader? What other Darth Vader in this galaxy?

128
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:50.680
Are you aware of? Who flies a tie fighter? It's insane. Right.

129
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:53.500
It's it's kind of, okay. So like as soon as he's like, it's Vader right there,

130
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:54.850
just kind of, well, it doesn't really matter who it is.

131
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:57.350
Like we're going to take them out and it's like, no, you can't. Right? Like,

132
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.890
like Bader is ridiculously capable. He's got the power of the force.

133
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.870
We can't defeat him like this. Right.

134
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.620
We can't go flying in with X wings and destroy Vader because you'll kill us all.

135
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.370
So Luke Skywalker, like literally just like, does this kamikaze run? Right.

136
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.640
It's the craziest thing. And he has this plan, right. He's banking on this idea.

137
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.090
He goes flying in towards Darth Vader and he just kind of lets, you know,

138
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.670
he basically tells like our two like close comps, right.

139
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.650
Shut off communications. And it's like, okay.

140
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.220
And so Darth Vader sees Luke Skywalker initially and doesn't realize it's him

141
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.510
and fixes just like some crazy guy who wants to go toe to toe with Vader. Right.

142
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.960
You just kinda like a worthy opponent. Cool.

143
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.750
And then immediately he senses the fact that it's Luke and he's like Holy cow.

144
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.260
So Luke basically uses the connection between Bader and himself through the

145
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.720
forest to, to momentarily distracted crashes,

146
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:42.140
headlong into Darth Vader and sends him flying down into the world. Right now,

147
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:43.910
Luke Skywalker goes crashing down to you.

148
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.850
And the initial fear is that Luke Skywalker died, right?

149
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:47.700
Like the other rebels are,

150
00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:50.870
are basically afraid that Luke Skywalker could have possibly died here.

151
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.930
The other part of this is that Bader realizing it's Luke kind of makes us

152
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:57.680
offhanded remark. If he is truly strong in the force, this will not end him.

153
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:00.260
Now, remember this is kind of a tenant of the Sith, right?

154
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.840
The idea that only the strong deserve to survive, right?

155
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:05.810
Like the rule of two that you have a master and you have an apprentice when the

156
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:07.730
apprentice becomes strong enough to kill the master,

157
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.190
he kills the master and then takes an apprentice of his own.

158
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.720
It's been that way for a long, long time.

159
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.260
It's the nature of the Sith that only the strong deserves survive because if the

160
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:18.890
race is going to survive, it needs to be led by the strongest people. Right.

161
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:22.790
So not an unreasonable philosophy, but both vessels basically go crashing down,

162
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:24.560
you know, under the, under the surface of the planet.

163
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.660
And as soon as that happens, right there, kind of like, okay,

164
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.120
obviously Bader is not going to die in a crash. Right. Like that's,

165
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.650
that's never going to happen. So they're like, okay,

166
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.010
let's get out there and let's get Bader. They ended up bringing in like Y wings,

167
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.960
right? Like they're their rebel bombers. Right.

168
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:39.380
They send out like a battalion of people and then you switch over to princess

169
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:41.650
Leia and Han solo who does, is kind of like out there. No,

170
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:46.060
I remember Han solo did come back at the end of a new hope rescue Luke,

171
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.210
but he's still kind of in that position where he's, he's, he's basically like,

172
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.650
okay, I'm on the side of the rebels,

173
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.470
but I still don't really know if I believe in the force yet,

174
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.570
but I'm still trying to bang layer. So like,

175
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.360
I'm going to hang around a little while to see if I can get her between the

176
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.130
sheets, you know? And then like, if I can cool,

177
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.710
then I'll hang around a lot longer. As we know he did. Right.

178
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:05.620
He got layered between the sheets multiple times. So like we know that happened.

179
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.860
Right. And so at this point when he's talking to her, she's kind of like, okay,

180
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.040
Bader is on, is on Vargans right. He's on, he's on this planet. Right.

181
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:15.040
Vargas boss. And it's kind of like, okay, initially Han Solo's like,

182
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:16.690
you guys are gonna go after him because Les is like,

183
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:18.460
we gotta send a whole battalion of people. Right.

184
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:20.440
Like we got to send all the rebels that we have there.

185
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.140
We're sending directly to go confront Darth Vader. And she's like,

186
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:24.610
then we also have general Donna,

187
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.730
who's basically sending an entire battalion to back them up. Right.

188
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:30.640
So she's like, we're just throwing sheer numbers at Bader,

189
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.790
hoping that we can turn it into a battle of attrition and effectively wear him

190
00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:36.400
down right. To the point that we can essentially overtake him.

191
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.600
Because when you're the rebels and you're talking about a sheer force of nature,

192
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:44.380
like Darth Vader, that's really all you can hope for is a battle of attrition.

193
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.770
Right. Just wearing him down, just throwing just huge amounts of numbers,

194
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:51.520
of people at him to the point that he can't overcome everybody. Right.

195
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:52.420
And that's kind of, what's what,

196
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.940
they're what they're shooting for now for the most part lay is like, okay,

197
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.840
I'm going to go out there. And Han Solo's like dinner.

198
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.020
You're not going out there alone. Right.

199
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:00.780
I think that what you're doing is stupid, but like, if that's where Luke is,

200
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.910
I'm not letting you go out there by yourself. So again,

201
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.250
this kind of feeds into the notion of Han solo,

202
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:09.000
caring about more than himself and going in the direction of being someone that

203
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:12.510
fights for a greater cause than his own individual interest at that particular

204
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:13.291
point in time. Right.

205
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:17.160
Kind of the shift of Han solo from becoming a scoundrel in every sense of the

206
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.660
word, both in character development,

207
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.950
as well as kind of how he sees the world moving into a traditional hero. Right.

208
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.320
Right. And so, because of that, you know, he hits up Chewbacca basically says,

209
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:28.710
okay, we're traveling to Vegas Vos. It's going to be a stupid decision.

210
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.470
Like we're literally going to go against what is in effect the current Lord of

211
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.900
the Sith outside of the emperor. Right. So like Darth Vader,

212
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.690
the second in command, we're going to go fight a man. I don't, you know,

213
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:39.810
I'm basically doing it for, for, for layer, you know? So like I can,

214
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.840
I can rescue Luke and kind of continue being a hero, that kind of a thing.

215
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.300
But like they're basically going on this mission. And so it was like, okay,

216
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.880
right. As soon as the rebel fleet goes, launching out in that direction,

217
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.760
we switched back over to Darth Vader on this planet.

218
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.770
And as he's here and he begins to emerge,

219
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.190
the why when you start showing up and the initial thought is there's no sign of

220
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:59.460
Vader. He may have died in the crash, but then they realize she's alive. Right.

221
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:00.600
They get visual confirmation,

222
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:02.490
they see them there and Vader's just standing there. And like,

223
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.120
as they come running in with their wide wings and launching a bombing run,

224
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.750
Darth Vader literally uses the force and like picks up these huge chunks of

225
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:12.390
rocks and just throws them into the ship. Right. Then just,

226
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.670
just like sends these why wins crushing, wind,

227
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.730
crashing into each other and like crashing under the ground like that. Right.

228
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:19.050
In the span of like one move,

229
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.390
he took out all these Y wings and that's the end of it.

230
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.240
Now for Luke Skywalker himself, he of course survived the,

231
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.190
the entire ordeal along with R2D2.

232
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.280
And at this point is just making his way back to the rest of the group right

233
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:33.570
now. This is probably the single best moment in the entirety of the story.

234
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:35.190
Right. It's, it's ridiculously good.

235
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.640
So as Vader's making his way there or making his way to where he believes Lou

236
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:39.480
Scott Walker should be,

237
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:42.660
or at least using the force to since looks location and traveling to where he's

238
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:46.590
at, he suddenly kind of ambushed by all these rebels. And,

239
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:49.080
and it's kind of interesting because Vader kind of looks around and he says,

240
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.260
okay, so this place is, is, is powerful in the forest, right?

241
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:54.090
It's not the most powerful place ever.

242
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:58.110
It's not the most powerful force planet ever, but there is force power here.

243
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.760
This was once the side of a Jedi temple.

244
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.460
It makes sense that Luke would lead the rebellion here, right?

245
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.910
Or the rebellion would be drawn to this location since they are more or less

246
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.520
within the node, not tied to the light side of the forest,

247
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.760
but in suddenly as he's ambushed, all these rebels are just like,

248
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.860
like Darth Vader, lay down your weapons.

249
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.570
You're completely surrounded with the most biggest response ever with the most

250
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.710
Beazer new mountain or chase on the most Bish response ever Darth Vader looks at

251
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:27.060
them all and says, all I'm surrounded by is fear and dead.

252
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.820
Ben will that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

253
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.740
If you are no here to comments, explain,

254
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:34.320
make sure you guys have the sub button to become part of the Rob Horford Carson

255
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.010
drawer, this video, make sure you drop a like, and I will catch you all.
