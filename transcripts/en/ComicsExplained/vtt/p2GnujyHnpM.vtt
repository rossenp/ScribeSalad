You got a friend and me I'm Wendy Newman.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.060
Hello everyone.

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.300
<v 1>We'll come back to comics explained, Oh, we are covering venom. Yes,</v>

8
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:27.130
we are. The, the,

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.470
the follow-up to what it is that directly happened to Eddie Brock. Right?

10
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:31.850
Because in the last video that we did,

11
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:34.220
I'll let you guys on like this one soon cliffhanger, right?

12
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.910
And like Ben died and Eddie Brock has dead wood. That being said, guys,

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.890
I'm just bounced. And you guys were like, no, it was kind of amazing.

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.790
But uh, in this video we find that what actually happened to Eddie Brock, right?

15
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:50.450
So the cool thing about this is we would largely assume that Eddie Brock had

16
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.210
died, but the, the way that Donnie Cates plays us as amazing.

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.280
And this is why Donnie Casey, this is why I'm really,

18
00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:57.620
really liking Donnie Cates when he first took over venom.

19
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.420
And even when he wrote banjos and things like that,

20
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.470
it was kind of hard to get a gauge of what kind of writer Donnie Cates was.

21
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.820
You knew he was a great writer,

22
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.460
but you didn't know the nuances behind his writing style.

23
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.700
And what we're kind of learning here is Donnie Cates is almost kind of like this

24
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.540
perfect blend between like Jonathan Hickman and Scott Snyder and Jeff Johns,

25
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.040
where he plants these little seeds,

26
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.500
these little tidbits of things that might become important later on,

27
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.830
I may actually do. Right? So in this instance, Eddie Brock,

28
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.570
when his body basically dies, right?

29
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:27.050
When he's effectively killed that he just kind of comes falling down into this

30
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:28.820
place called the abyss. Right now,

31
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.970
this happens immediately it's as soon as he hits the vehicle. Right?

32
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:35.750
So this is before he dies at the end of the last video that he was technically

33
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.370
quote, unquote dead before that happened,

34
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:40.820
that his body just kind of fallen into this, this sort of underbelly, right.

35
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:43.370
This sort of abyss. And he kind of talks about these things, right? Like,

36
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.400
you know, he's fallen before and there's only darkness and things like that,

37
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:48.050
that he can see his physical form, you know,

38
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.520
that it's kind of in the world above him,

39
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.140
but it's almost like on a spiritual level,

40
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:54.620
he's kind of losing himself and Donnie Cates almost kind of plays a fast and

41
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:57.110
loose with the idea of like, what happens when a person dies,

42
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.160
because Marvel doesn't really give us any sort of consistent explanation on

43
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.190
that, right? Like if you go and you read the old Chris Claremont X-Men stories,

44
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:04.820
for example,

45
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.180
you get a depiction of what the realm of mistress death actually looks like.

46
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.880
Right? Worst, basically just all these really, really tall pillars.

47
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.860
And each one represents somebody's afterlife.

48
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.440
But then you have like the realm of a Vista where you have, you know,

49
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.710
one of the versions of health that's basically kept by the various held Lords.

50
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.540
And then you have like the realm of Hela, right.

51
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.430
Which is called hell in and of itself, you know,

52
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.620
and that's where people who are dead go and you have all these different

53
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:29.300
indications and depictions of, of like where the soul goes when a person dies.

54
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.750
But for Eddie here, you know, in the midst of this place that he's in,

55
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.090
it's not really recognizable to him,

56
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.420
but did he kind of hears this disembodied voice? And it's just like Brock,

57
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.420
right. It's just, you know, and it just literally jars him, right. Like that.

58
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:44.900
And he's just like wake up and it's really cool, you know?

59
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.780
And he addresses him as like a soldier. He's like wake up soldier, you know?

60
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:49.970
And he's like NOLs minions. Like they have human. Like,

61
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.940
and this is when it was really given to us where we end up finding out that

62
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.430
where he's at right now is he's part of the hive. Right?

63
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:59.470
He's part of the collective hive of know the Symbian God that yes,

64
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.860
his physical body is dead, but his essence has kind of moved on.

65
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.080
And there's a reason why this happens. And it's really, really cool.

66
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.741
But you know,

67
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:08.650
one of the things that this disembodied voice basically tells them is if you're

68
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.740
going to move, right. If like what you need to do here to make yourself stop,

69
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.560
right? Like if you're going to break out of this hive where at least try to,

70
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.831
you know,

71
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.610
maintain your sanity in this hive and keep from being consumed by like all the

72
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.500
symbionts, you know, basically know himself,

73
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.180
then you have to maintain your own self.

74
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.240
And the only way to do that is to stop yourself from falling.

75
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.750
And the only way to stop yourself from falling is to brace for impact and lamp.

76
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.660
And that's exactly what he does. Or he does a superhero landing right here.

77
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.800
He does the superhero landing, and then suddenly he's met by a guy.

78
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.220
He doesn't recognize. Now, if you're, if you're familiar with Dani cases,

79
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.200
venom run, you do know who this guy is. Right.

80
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.480
And it took me a minute to remember, I was like, who in the heck of this?

81
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:46.810
And I was like, that's right. And it turns out to be ref Strickland right now,

82
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.660
Rick Strickland, the gods were a little fuzzy here on his character.

83
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.440
Direct Strickland was one of the guys who was kind of bonded to have been

84
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.400
Abyssinia during the days of the Vietnam war. I think it was the Vietnam war,

85
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.760
but he was basically one of the first people in the history of the world to be

86
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.160
bonded with a venom semi. He only had it for a few years.

87
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.190
And then ultimately Rick Strickland ended up dying as far as I'm aware.

88
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.580
And instead his Symbion basically replicated it. Right. It took its place.

89
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.430
The rest of Strickland's team ended up dying,

90
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:14.880
but all that was kind of lead up to the notion or the introduction of the idea

91
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:17.430
of the Grendel and like Knoll and all that kind of stuff. Oh,

92
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:19.520
we've got videos on it. If you guys want to go check it all out,

93
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.380
kind of get yourself fully refreshed on the nature of the character.

94
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.160
But what he basically says here, where,

95
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.760
where Eddie Brock had of asked the question, like, why am I here? Right?

96
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.120
Because he sees like a handful of people running any jumps in to try to save

97
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:31.440
them, but they're like ghosts, right.

98
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:34.080
He literally just passes right through them. He can't really touch them.

99
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.750
He can't interact with them. So it was really more him. That's the ghost.

100
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.380
And there's even like a giant dragon that comes like flying down and seems to

101
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:41.670
know that Eddie's there, right.

102
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.640
And Eddie light goes to attack it and look what he was going to do by punching a

103
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:46.800
dragon for the dragon, just kind of flies, right.

104
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.840
It just kind of blows right through them. And almost kind of,

105
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.850
it gives them the feeling that like he's being ripped apart.

106
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.400
And so what he ends up doing, or at least what he's told by, uh,

107
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.660
by record is that the reason why he's in this place is because of the codex.

108
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.950
Because if you got to remember that,

109
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:02.520
one of the things that Donnie Cates established is that every time a symbiont

110
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.880
bonds itself to a host, that when the, it leaves that host,

111
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.820
it leaves behind a kind of codex inside that host.

112
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.250
And so what this is to make this a lot easier to understand,

113
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.750
this is just one small aspect of Eddie Brock's consciousness, essentially,

114
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:17.910
right? If you could break his consciousness down to like a,

115
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.120
an almost biotechnological well organism, it would be the codex.

116
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.200
And that's where it is now, right?

117
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:25.710
His consciousness has been absorbed into Knoll by virtue of the codex,

118
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.570
because he was a Symbian at one point in time.

119
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.300
And it's one of these things where it almost seems to point to this idea that

120
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:32.790
whenever a person who is a host for a Simeon dies,

121
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.490
that they almost kind of joined this black abyss, right. It's almost like the,

122
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:38.190
the afterlife, like were speedsters joined the speed force.

123
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.620
This is where Simeon hosts go. Now it's not absolute,

124
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.790
it's not concrete because we see people here who have basically been absorbed by

125
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.800
Knoll when they were consumed by symbionts.

126
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:48.600
But it all almost kind of lends credence to it, right?

127
00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:51.990
It's not like somebody out there shot in the head and some bugging gone wrong.

128
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.650
And then now they're part of, right, like every single person that you see here,

129
00:05:55.651 --> 00:05:59.480
every single body that you see is a person who was contacted with a syndicate

130
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.110
and then absorbed into no. Well, the question becomes if that's the case,

131
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.830
if Reggie Strickland is here because of his shred of consciousness,

132
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.260
surviving through the codex and being absorbed by Knoll.

133
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.220
And if Eddie Brock is here, because his portion of his consciousness was,

134
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.590
was absorbed to the codex and, and now as part of no,

135
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.620
then why isn't anybody else moving around and talking, right?

136
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.070
Why are they the only ones who were really aware of what's going on?

137
00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:23.320
And everybody else just looks like characters out of the matrix.

138
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.680
The reason why is because of the fact that they had been bonded with symbions

139
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.960
for so long, their connection is stronger than everybody.

140
00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:30.610
Else's the one thing to keep in mind here,

141
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.300
everybody here that you see strung up, right? Ben Grimm, captain America,

142
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.691
vision,

143
00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:37.480
all these different characters that they were bonded with symbionts for moments,

144
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:39.370
right? Like it was literally seconds.

145
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.280
Or if they were bottled with the Symbion over the course of their publication

146
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:44.440
history, it was only for like a single event, right.

147
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:45.910
Or for a few moments in time.

148
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.630
Whereas Rick Strickland had SMB it for years and Eddie Brock had his tibia for a

149
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.760
year still. Right. For, for even longer than that.

150
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.860
And so it's kind of a crazy thing where, you know,

151
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.190
where Eddie doesn't fully grasp the reality of what's going on,

152
00:06:57.191 --> 00:07:00.280
that this kind of realm that they're in is almost a mirror.

153
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.780
They're almost really in the real world.

154
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.030
But the reality is it's almost like an illusion, right?

155
00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:05.530
It's almost like a mirror of the real world.

156
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.930
They can't really react with anything. They can't really touch anything.

157
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.120
They can just kind of exist in that place. And that's it.

158
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.150
They just sort of exist and they stay there and there really doesn't seem to be

159
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:15.970
any true escape. And it's one of the things that Eddie kind of asks,

160
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:18.460
well then like, why can't I go back to the real world? Right? I mean,

161
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:20.230
if my consciousness is alive here,

162
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.680
then why can't I simply just leave this place and go back? And he's like,

163
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:26.350
do you not know? Like you do, you are, you he's like, dude, you don't know.

164
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.910
And he's like, Eddie brought you're dead, man.

165
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.210
Like you're literally laying dead on a hospital bed and like your kids crying

166
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:33.820
over you like, and, and it's one of the things where Eddie freaks, right?

167
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:36.070
Eddie absolutely freaks out when he, when he hears that.

168
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.450
And this is one of the cool things, right?

169
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:39.880
This is one of the best things about this as Donnie Cates.

170
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.780
I'm going to say this. I don't care what anybody out there says,

171
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.040
Donny Kate's handling a venom is probably the single best handling of the venom

172
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:50.530
character in the history of Marvel comics. Right.

173
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.800
And I don't really even believe there's anybody who can argue that point

174
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.430
adequately.

175
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.620
Like they might be able to make a couple of good points here and there,

176
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.380
but nobody could actually maintain that point for the long haul.

177
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.720
And so they actually, age of Venom's run was much better. Know this,

178
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.560
this one is far more complex is a lot more nuanced agent. Bynum's great,

179
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.890
but it's Johnny cage venom run, right? It's just not on the same level.

180
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.280
It's kind of crazy here because what you end up getting is,

181
00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:14.380
is Eddie Brock just kind of freaking out and saying like over the course of my

182
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:16.870
whole life, I've had to gift things up. I've lost things.

183
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.130
I've had things taken from me.

184
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.400
Like I'm literally a man of sacrifice and loss and I'm not going to let them

185
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.680
take this. Right? Like I'm not going to let them take my death.

186
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.590
Like if I'm going to die, it's going to be on my terms. And so his whole,

187
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:30.820
his whole idea here is okay, if we can walk around inside this void, right?

188
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:34.780
This, uh, bits, this living of best where no rain Supreme, then if I'm here,

189
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.790
that means my symbionts here. So it's like,

190
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.770
I'm going to find myself Simeon and working together.

191
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.300
We can bust out of this place. Right.

192
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:43.870
We can literally break away from the hive mind and just kind of show up.

193
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.860
Now the reality,

194
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:48.250
and this is one of the big differences here until Eddie Brock's consciousness

195
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.700
merges with his physical body, it would basically be as consciousness, hitching,

196
00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:54.190
a ride alongside the Symbian, the CME, it would appear.

197
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:57.000
And it would look like Eddie, but it wouldn't really be as physical form,

198
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.320
assuming that even happens.

199
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.320
And the reason why I say assuming is because rec says, okay, like,

200
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.990
I believe he won this man. And I believe that you can do it, right. I mean,

201
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.420
you're a hard hitting guy. I kinda misjudged you a little bit,

202
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.660
but here's the problem that you have finding your Symbion is not going to be the

203
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:12.840
problem, getting to it and freeing it. That's the problem.

204
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.170
Because we find out that when Knoll took a Simeot of Eddie, when he took the,

205
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:19.650
took the, the actual venom Simeon, he didn't just disperse it among the,

206
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.800
you know, everything else in the Fs. Instead he keeps it close.

207
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.090
He holds onto it. Right.

208
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:27.600
So Eddie's literally gonna have to find a way to get to know and then steal his

209
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.930
symbiont back. And that's when he's kind of like, okay, well, I mean,

210
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.840
how am I supposed to get up there by, uh, by myself and the response of,

211
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.420
of Rex's none enough. You don't have to do it by yourself, man. Right?

212
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:38.280
You don't have to do it by yourself. I'm going to go with you.

213
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.910
But here's the more important thing. Yes. I recruited you for this mission in,

214
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.820
uh, you know, to help me go back and take these. Symbionts like, yes,

215
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.640
I recruited you as a kind of agent, you know, that's what I wanted you to be.

216
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.520
But the reality is that you were not an agent, Eddie Brock,

217
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.380
you were never really an agent. You know,

218
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:56.580
you were a guy who came across a Symbi at one day and did some things and,

219
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:58.470
and you've been bonded with her for a long time,

220
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.250
but you were not the kind of man I was looking for. Fortunately,

221
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.080
inside this place,

222
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.580
I did find the man that I was looking for only for us to find out that that

223
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.150
agent venom flash Thompson has returned without being said, guys,

224
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:13.350
