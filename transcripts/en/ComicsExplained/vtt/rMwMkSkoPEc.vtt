4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.870
What's going on here?

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.170
<v 1>This is Rob and we are back with Knoll.</v>

6
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:17.720
We're back with King and black number one. Now here's the thing.

7
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.950
This is a one-shot.

8
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.180
So the King and black event is very much like swords of X in the sense that we

9
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:26.180
get a one-shot to open it up and then we get all the tie-ins. And again,

10
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.460
one of the things we talked about during, during the, the, I guess,

11
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.840
10 of swords, and that's what you want to call it,

12
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.270
it's very much reminiscent of the 1990s comics, right?

13
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.150
Those are the guys who remember something like age of apocalypse. For example,

14
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.010
I think we got age of apocalypse alpha,

15
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.710
and then just a whole bunch of renamed comics, right?

16
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:42.410
So we'll basically just retitled all their comics for six months.

17
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.830
And then we got age of apocalypse Omega. That's basically what's happening here,

18
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:49.190
albeit not alpha and Omega. It's just a one-shot opening story,

19
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.520
but this story is amazing, right?

20
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.710
So if you guys are going to the comic book stores and you're buying King and

21
00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:55.010
black,

22
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.660
make sure that you guys buy the comic that actually has the King and black cover

23
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:01.040
on it by the King of black banner.

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.110
It's the only one that ties into the King of black event.

25
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.330
And of course you can find reading orders all over the place and everything,

26
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.160
but this initially picks up with Eddie Brock.

27
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:09.230
Now here's one of the funny things about this, right?

28
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:12.020
This is where things get a little, a little wonky here. Um,

29
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.150
and I'm not really sure how he got from here to there.

30
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.180
But if you guys remember the ending of the venom story,

31
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.560
Eddie Brock and his son returned to earth when there were no lights here,

32
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.570
the sky is still bright and everything now, uh,

33
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.730
we'll find out why the sky went dark,

34
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.640
but it's one of these things that kind of looks like a bit of a continuity error

35
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:30.320
on behalf of Donnie Cates and all that.

36
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.990
But I don't mind because Donnie Cates is amazing.

37
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:36.110
He does not disappoint in the story. So what we ended up getting is,

38
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:37.670
is kind of like Eddie Brock, of course,

39
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:39.290
still being possessed by the venom Simeon.

40
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.260
This starts to realize that the King kingdom life that no,

41
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:45.560
the Symbion God is on his way there. Now he's informed the Avengers.

42
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.290
He's told all of them about what's going on the arrival of Noah.

43
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.930
You know what it means, the power he possesses and all that kind of good stuff.

44
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.360
So the Avengers have basically been prepping for this, right?

45
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:54.680
They've been planning for this whole thing.

46
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.350
So the call goes out to all the Avengers, right?

47
00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:01.370
All hands on deck and Eddie Brock goes to grab Dylan. Now, once Dylan wakes up,

48
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.820
he begins to realize, okay, you know, he can feel that, that Knowles on his way.

49
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.220
And so it was time for them to basically get out of there. Now,

50
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.880
switching over to captain America, she hoped Carol Danvers, iron man,

51
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.140
the current Avengers roster,

52
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.190
Tony stark has basically taken some remnants of Cree and she,

53
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.590
our warships and then basically weaponized them, right?

54
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:20.930
Turn them into essentially debt mateable bonds, right?

55
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:23.780
Bombs that can be remote detonated from the planet earth now.

56
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.110
But when all of these kinds of that forces of,

57
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:29.480
of Knoll start showing up that all these different vessels start exploding,

58
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.781
right?

59
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:33.050
They literally start going off and Tony Stark's starts to celebrate the problem

60
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.770
with this is that you in turn have Eddie Brock who basically hits the iron man

61
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.510
and says, we killed about a hundred of them,

62
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.900
but like there's countless of these things showing up here, right?

63
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.870
It looks like millions and millions of these things showing up here,

64
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.410
seemingly one for everybody on earth, you would presume. So three, I'm sorry,

65
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:51.650
7 billion at the very most, if not, any number less than that,

66
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:55.100
which is still way more than 100. And he's like, you know,

67
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.590
we only stopped a hundred of them. Well, he can't be stopped. Now.

68
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.030
One other thing that I want to point out,

69
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.800
and it seems to only really affect Eddie at the moment is that all these bats

70
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.630
being destroyed seem to take a toll on him,

71
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.690
but it could also be because of the fact that Eddie is using his powers to

72
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.250
monitor everything out there. Right.

73
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.170
So it could just be a kind of mental strain,

74
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.470
but I didn't want to draw attention to that because all these bat forces start

75
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.220
pouring down onto the city and basically like exploding, right?

76
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.150
Like as they pour down,

77
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.460
they basically explode into their symbiont forms and literally kind of filled

78
00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:25.000
the appeal, the world with like an ocean of symbionts. Right.

79
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.020
It's basically what it looks like,

80
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.080
but you actually end up having venom Eddie Brock taking his son,

81
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.520
Dylan to a bunker that was built for Peter Parker by a ZQ now a little bit of

82
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.540
explanation here. Right? And we cover all this in my video series on, uh,

83
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.090
Dan Slott Spiderman run. So you're welcome to check that out. You know,

84
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:41.800
especially spider verse different things like that.

85
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.070
But the idea is that somewhere along the line, you had a guy named Ezekiel.

86
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.963
And then of course,

87
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.480
Zico became aware of the fact that the inheritors were hunting down Spider-Man

88
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:50.890
right. All across the multi-verse.

89
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.370
And so this bunker was built for Peter Parker to protect him if you needed to

90
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.160
stay hidden. And of course, Peter was actually confined there for some time.

91
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.130
And I think it's ETL actually use it as a base of operations for some time.

92
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.580
Now a zeal is a character that I believe was introduced during J Michael's

93
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.070
Luzinski drawn before he wrote Spider-Man one more day,

94
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.800
which is one of those things where everybody loved the run until they didn't.

95
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.521
But you know,

96
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:13.000
that's kind of a nice little nod to like the yesteryear of Spider-Man stories,

97
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.940
like just old school stuff, kind of bringing, uh, being brought back. But the,

98
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:16.151
the,

99
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:20.530
the meat and potatoes here is that this bunker should protect Dylan from Knoll

100
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:22.990
and anybody else out there that's trying to get to him one,

101
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.420
because it's difficult to know what's there. And two,

102
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:27.520
because of the fact that it's just so well guarded,

103
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.610
it's just so difficult to penetrate. And so with that being the case,

104
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.580
Dylan actually wants to go and he kind of has this genius moment. He's like,

105
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:35.470
look, I have the same powers as no, right?

106
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.890
So maybe I can seize control of NOLs army, like take it away from him.

107
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.090
But in reality here,

108
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.250
and this is something that's not really voiced by Eddie Brock.

109
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.360
I doubt that would happen.

110
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.530
And the reason why is because Dylan is still relatively new to his powers,

111
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:47.741
right?

112
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:51.310
So it was like a person could just discover telepathy versus a person who's been

113
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.040
practicing telepathy for like 50 years. It's just,

114
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.680
they're far more prodigious in the use of their powers.

115
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.220
And so for somebody like Dylan, yes, his powers are comparable to,

116
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.630
to NOLs in so far as he can control symbions. But he's not as able,

117
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.820
he's not as capable of using his powers in the same way. No is I,

118
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.480
so there's a much better chance that Dylan will be defeated and possibly consume

119
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:13.780
taken over by Knoll than he would to actually win. And because of that,

120
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:15.820
Eddie says, no, like you need to stay here.

121
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.770
I made you a promise that I will keep you safe.

122
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.720
That I would do everything I could to keep you protected.

123
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.130
That's what we're doing from there.

124
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.700
You ended up having Eddie Brock who's chimed in by captain America saying plan B

125
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.250
and plan B is exactly what we just described. Right?

126
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:29.410
The idea that all these symbionts come pouring down. Well,

127
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.790
while that's happening, the Avengers are largely waiting on for right there.

128
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.890
They're hoping for Thor to get there. You've got Dr. Strange, you've got name,

129
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:38.860
or you've got, uh, you've got iron fist. You have all this great, big,

130
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:41.260
huge roster of people who've ever been Avengers who were here.

131
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.940
But Thor is also one of these guys.

132
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.180
We're having the ability to control the lightning and fire and lightning being

133
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:50.710
one of the weaknesses of Simeon's would go a long way towards being able to stim

134
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:53.350
this conflict. But currently Thor's not here.

135
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.050
What they get is something better in their stead, right? Well,

136
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:58.490
everything is popping off, right? Well, everything is popping off.

137
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.180
You have this,

138
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.620
this like speech bubble and you guys know speech bubbles usually mean telepathy.

139
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.680
So this voice pops in and says, iron man, captain America, please exclude it.

140
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:10.170
Please. Excuse the intrusion into your minds. This is Charles ex-Navy.

141
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.390
If you require backup, please stand by. My X-Men have arrived.

142
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.770
So you have table who shows up here, Cyclops, but I think you have Phantom X,

143
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:21.790
which is kind of weird. You've got Nightcrawler, right? You've got stormed,

144
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:24.530
Jean Gray, a full contingent of the X-Men of Roth.

145
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.150
And it's one of these things where Xavier's kinda like,

146
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.260
I know you guys are waiting on Thor,

147
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.450
but surely like a woman who could control the,

148
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:32.690
the thunder and the lightning would be pretty much just as good. Now,

149
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:37.160
the other part of this is that with plan B basically commencing that Eddie Brock

150
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.050
actually ends up going to the, uh,

151
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.890
going to the throne that was used by carnage and carnage use this during the

152
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.150
absolute carnage event to control the army that he created. And the,

153
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:50.270
the hope of Eddie Brock is that he can basically use the throne to extend his,

154
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.720
his reach all the way out to the symbionts here on earth that have been brought

155
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:57.170
here by Knoll, and then basically take over control of those symbionts right.

156
00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:01.610
So using the throne to do what Dylan could do, but on a more grandiose scale,

157
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:03.710
right on a, on a more, on a more fine tuned scale.

158
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.030
The problem with this is Eddie Brock is having a wildly difficult time punching

159
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:12.200
through this kind of control that no has over a symbiotic at the same time.

160
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.030
Dr. Strange it's facing off as best.

161
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:17.750
He can only for us to realize just how powerful Knoll is in the sense that all

162
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.760
these little symbiont monster things that he has,

163
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.220
where all these little dragons are just punching right through.

164
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:25.490
Dr. Strange is shields. There's no, there's no way for him to stop them. Right.

165
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.950
But just in this, this small moment, right. When they,

166
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:31.100
when they have a chance when like Dr. Strange falls and in a Brock is like,

167
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.980
okay, I'm pushing through, right. I'm pushing through to the other side.

168
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.480
And I should be able to take over this.

169
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.290
80 comes to this massive realization that all hope is lost.

170
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:43.250
And the reason why when he punches through he realized is not just the dragons.

171
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.850
And it's not just no, no first enemies with the Celestials.

172
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.250
When Noah arrived here, he bought haunted to the Celestials and took them over.

173
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:51.791
No,

174
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:56.320
the Sybian God has conquered the celestial race in the

175
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.860
barbel university, man. That's dude, it's nuts. It's like,

176
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.240
all these Celestials come pouring down. And at that point, the Avengers, man,

177
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.880
hold on, you guys start prepping their pants. What else could I do?

178
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.960
Did you do at that point?

179
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:11.320
Like one of the holes open up and know comes walking out and he's just like,

180
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.260
so who are you guys? Right? Like, who are you supposed to be?

181
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.780
Are you guys like the forces here to assemble,

182
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:19.090
to take me out now while all this was going on,

183
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.970
they were waiting for like this big, heavy hitter to show up. Right?

184
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:24.820
It's not Thor, but they're waiting for this big, heavy hitter to show up. Right?

185
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.970
Finally, this heavy hitter finally arrives right now.

186
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.470
I was sitting there looking at this and I was like, man,

187
00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:30.880
I really hope there's this who I think it is.

188
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.550
And it turned out to be exactly who I thought it was, right? Like,

189
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.580
like literally iron man chimes into captain America and says, okay,

190
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.370
the guy's here, right? Like he's going to be here in 10 seconds. He's here.

191
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:42.040
And he's waiting your orders. Does he have permission to engage?

192
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.500
And the response of captain America is permission to grant it.

193
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.210
Only first I find out it's the century, man, it's Rob a rental son, son, man.

194
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.820
It's rubber rental. This century has finally returned. And I was like, okay,

195
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.200
this guy comes flying through.

196
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.520
Boosh comes flying through punches hole through a symbions head. Right.

197
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.580
It's like Durham, Sunday, like punches a hole to this NBA head. Dude. He goes,

198
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.660
fly for no knows, like, no, like no way. Right? So like, he comes,

199
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.110
he's like rubber Reynolds grabs no flies up into the air. And he's like, hi,

200
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.950
my name's Bob. Uh, you can call me the century. This will be over in a second.

201
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.190
I was like, no son now, son, man, let me, let me tell you something.

202
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.830
He grabs a hold of Robert Reynolds. He goes to rip him in half. He's like,

203
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.030
Oh God, did he rip? He ripped them in half. Right. Pulls,

204
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.360
pulls the void right out of, right out of the century. Right.

205
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:29.130
Pulls a void out of the century. Right. And he's just like child. I am no.

206
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.310
Right. I'm the Lord of the abyss. God of the,

207
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.500
symbions the darkness inside of you. That darkness bounced to me. I am the void.

208
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:41.580
Like literally just crushes the century and one fell swoop. And it's like, well,

209
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.010
you go, any chance you have had is gone. Right. I guess that's, that's madness.

210
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.370
That's basically it like, you will all fall like the rest. Right.

211
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.950
I've met your Army's little ones meet mine.

212
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.520
So he literally just like takes control of the symbionts and pours them all over

213
00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:56.540
the various superheroes.

214
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.110
And all the superheroes are completely conquered by the stimulus from there.

215
00:10:00.111 --> 00:10:02.840
He's just like, let's get rid of this. Let's get rid of the stars out there.

216
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.880
So we in turn takes all those dragon forces,

217
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.050
merging them together and then wraps them around the world and blocks out all

218
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:12.170
the light. And it's just like. Right. So like storm,

219
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.130
the only one left standing, right? Like storms, like the only one left standing.

220
00:10:16.131 --> 00:10:20.390
So storm goes out like that hero, man. Right? She's like, okay, look,

221
00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:24.080
you just think if I'm going to fall to this weird looking guy who looks like a

222
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:27.890
failed eighties rock did like, I'm going to go out with a bang, right?

223
00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:29.000
Like I'm going to go out with a bang, right.

224
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.710
Just summons every ounce of lightening,

225
00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:34.060
she possibly can just start shocking the out of these things. Right?

226
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.650
It's just electric heat in these things all over the place. No,

227
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:39.650
basically summons is his symbionts again, they go wrapping up into the,

228
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.830
you know, into the Spire over top of where, where are right. Worst storm is.

229
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.800
And just like snatch her up storm is basically gone.

230
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.390
This one person who can control the lightening.

231
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:51.110
And that was the only real weakness of these Symbian dragon. Things is now done.

232
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.710
And the Savior's. So you end up having this thing worse where Eddie's like,

233
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.870
and he's like, okay man, here's what we're going to do. Right? No,

234
00:10:56.871 --> 00:11:00.770
showed up here said, give me Brock and I will kill you as painless as possible.

235
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.950
Now the reality is no intends to destroy the world.

236
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.020
But Eddie brought stance here is no, no, no, no, no.

237
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.230
If I hand myself over then like maybe I could say, look,

238
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.740
I will hand myself over to you. My Symbion over to you. You'll be complete.

239
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.070
And then like, just leave earth, right? Just, just leave us alone. You know,

240
00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:18.560
just let us live. It's it's a hope against hope. Right?

241
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.200
It's it's a terrible idea, but it's a hope against hope. Right?

242
00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:23.900
So what ends up happening is you get this really touching moment, right?

243
00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:25.320
Where like Eddie rocket has been, uh,

244
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.220
his Symbion have this conversation and the symbionts like,

245
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.270
look at him like you need to know, you know? And,

246
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:31.700
and it doesn't really finish a sentence,

247
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.190
but largely it looks like the semi was getting ready to say, like,

248
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:36.440
because of you, Eddie, I become better. Right?

249
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:39.680
Like I was lost and I was kind of villainous and I was all over the place.

250
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.870
I didn't really know what my greater purpose in the world was,

251
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.470
what it meant to be in this, in this space. But since I've been a part of you,

252
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.690
you've made me better and I've made you better.

253
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.180
We truly have become great heroes. Right.

254
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.410
We don't really get that much being said, but it's really cool because like,

255
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:55.570
okay, let's go meet our maker. Right.

256
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:57.640
So they basically kind of broadcast their signal, right?

257
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:00.640
Like the venom Symbion taps into NOLs Knowles forces,

258
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.800
which basically tells us exactly where he is. Right.

259
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:06.010
It's just firing up a flare in the sky essentially. And so no locates,

260
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:09.760
venom goes and grabs him. He snatches up Eddie Brock and brings him to him.

261
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:12.460
And then it's just like, okay, you can take me. That's fine.

262
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.450
But leave the world. Right. Just, just leave the world alone.

263
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.040
Take me and we'll call it eight. He's like, wait a minute. I remember you.

264
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.620
You're the one who beat my dragon. Like I thought you died. Well,

265
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:22.750
it's kind of weird, but no, I'm not here for you.

266
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.190
I should have specified which Brock I wanted. I don't want you. I want your son.

267
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.450
I want Dylan Brock. And when Eddie starts to realize what's going on,

268
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.700
he's just like, no, that's not going to happen. Right. Like, you know,

269
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:36.340
your fight is with us, right? Like leave my son out of it. And,

270
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:37.750
and the response of, of, no,

271
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.480
he rips the Symbion off of Eddie and it's just like,

272
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.360
I will take your Simeon away from you. I will make it mine again.

273
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.890
And then I'll take your son and drops Eddie Brock from the top of the sky all

274
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:50.050
the way down to the ground. Well, that being said, guys,

275
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.740
we're gonna bring this video to an end. This was amazing.

276
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.330
This is a great way to start this, start this story. So I'm his man Sansa.

277
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.750
