00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.290
<v 1>Let's begin. What's going on guys. This is.</v>

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.790
<v 0>Rob. It's been a while since we've done a beyond Omega level video.</v>

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.910
And at long last, after countless requests.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.340
<v 1>Most of them coming from Erin Wilder, I'm finally giving.</v>

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.760
<v 0>In.</v>

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.290
Let it never be said that I am not a benevolent ruler of the Rob core because

10
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:31.550
today on beyond Omega level, we're covering resurrection, man.

11
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.490
So without further ado, let's get into his origin.

12
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.690
So resurrection man was created by Dan Abnett, Andy landing and Jackson geese,

13
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.050
and first appeared and resurrection man, number one in 1997.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.370
And according to his creators,

15
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.880
resurrection man was based on a Marvel character called Mr. Immortal,

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.710
who was a member of the great lakes. Avengers.

17
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.730
What is basically a comedy team filled with characters that their powers were

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.020
honestly kind of stupid, but as his name suggests, Mr. Mortals power was simple.

19
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.690
He was a mortal. He could be killed, but every time he died,

20
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.490
he'd be in voluntarily resurrected.

21
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.070
And that's basically it that's his only superpower.

22
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.370
He has no other extraordinary abilities whatsoever.

23
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.240
And so admin and landing realized that immortality on its own is a pretty

24
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:12.770
terrible superpower to have,

25
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.530
but it gave them an idea for a new character to create,

26
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.690
which is similar in concept to Mr. Immortal,

27
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.030
but with a twist that makes them less useless.

28
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.430
So resurrection man's real name is Mitch Shelly,

29
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.880
who was a lawyer in South Carolina that actually had mob connections because

30
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.110
everyone knows South Carolina is a hotspot for mafia activity. But anyway,

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.550
a group simply known as the lab used Mitch as an unwilling test subject for

32
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.100
technology, they were developing, known as tech tights,

33
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.520
which are basically microscopic nanobots that heal damaged cells.

34
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.850
The result of this experimentation was that Shelly lost his memory,

35
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.820
but gained the ability to resurrect himself upon his death.

36
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.460
The twist that admin Atlantic added to resurrection, man,

37
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.250
is that not only does he return to life every time he dies,

38
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.720
but each time he's resurrected,

39
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.110
he gains a new superpower that is related to the way he died.

40
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.230
Now we would learn a bit more about Mitch's true nature during his encounter

41
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:03.920
with a Phantom stranger, a being that's walked the earth from millennia, Noah,

42
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.210
Mitch. Isn't a comatose state.

43
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.630
He's approached by the Phantom stranger who tells him that the two of them have

44
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:11.000
worked together over the course of many lifetimes.

45
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.900
And that Mitch is one of his oldest friends suggesting that Mitch is much older

46
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:15.920
than we originally thought.

47
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.440
Now the Phantom stranger also reveals that in the past,

48
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.730
Mitch would not resurrect,

49
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.110
but instead be reincarnated as a completely new person and did not gain new

50
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.360
powers. Each time he died, as it turned out,

51
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.700
those abilities were given to him by the lab.

52
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.040
But before that Mitch was something much older.

53
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.110
And as he reaches out into the astral plane,

54
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.770
he recognizes the face of his longtime, nemesis Vandal Savage.

55
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.870
That's where the end of his first solo series.

56
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.470
It would be revealed that while the source of Mitch's mortality is unknown,

57
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.580
the lab gave him his power of instant resurrection and revolving superpowers was

58
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:48.560
working under the direction of Vandal Savage.

59
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.370
Now upon realizing he possesses the ability to resurrect with new powers,

60
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.540
Mitch wonders the earth,

61
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.870
trying to remember his identity and how he received his abilities.

62
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.920
One of the few things he remembers is that he was to fly,

63
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.490
which is something he finds out mere seconds before being shot by some gang

64
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.700
members executing a drive-by. Now Mitch also falls to his death,

65
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.460
but then wakes up to realize not only that he's alive,

66
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.930
but that now instead of flight,

67
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.040
he possesses the ability to manipulate the air around him into a hard construct

68
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:15.520
of sorts.

69
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.570
He uses this ability to stop an out-of-control semi as a Kareem's toward a diner

70
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.400
while trying to rescue the driver. The truck explodes killing him once again,

71
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.700
but then he reawakens this time assessing pyro Kinesis.

72
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.320
And so all those deaths and resurrections took place within just one issue was

73
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:33.300
erection man, number one, but in the next issue,

74
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:37.110
we see a good example of resurrection man's abilities in relation to some more

75
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.230
well-known DC characters, as he happens upon the justice league,

76
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.870
as they battle the super-villain amazing.

77
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.090
Who's a giant Android with the ability to mimic the powers of those.

78
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.590
He comes into contact with now,

79
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:48.810
the justice league have their hands full with the mezzo,

80
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.630
but resurrection man gets involved in the battle in order to help some

81
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:55.980
bystanders and also uses his pirate Kinesis to cauterize a wound suffered by the

82
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:59.640
flash. No, in the building that Mitch's in explodes. He dies once again,

83
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.330
but this time he comes back from the dead with the ability to create powerful

84
00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:07.230
explosions, which he uses to blow amaze Ole apart, ending the battle.

85
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.550
And so this is an impressive feat as amazing had been too much for the combined

86
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:15.600
forces of the flash green lantern, Martian Manhunter wonder woman and Superman,

87
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.800
but even though it's impressive,

88
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.500
it does not really even come close to being Omega level.

89
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.250
And Michonne self says as much in the aftermath remarking that he isn't in the

90
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:27.060
same league as the heroes who are able to level cities and save millions while

91
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:30.030
he only has, as he describes it, budget superpowers.

92
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.450
So he has like the scifi channel version of superpowers right now later,

93
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.450
Mitch would encounter Tommy Monahan, better known as Hitman,

94
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.600
who decides that he's going to help Mitch take on the lab by killing him

95
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:43.470
repeatedly until he gets a power that's strong enough upon his resurrection.

96
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.480
We really need to cover this guy's stories.

97
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.540
Now after several attempts where Mitch comes back to life with the ability to

98
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:52.230
create colorful butterflies made of light or change colors, like a chameleon,

99
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.670
Hitman is finally satisfied when Mitch gains the ability to manipulate cosmic

100
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.100
energy, along with a sort of cosmic awareness.

101
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.520
Now it could be argued that resurrection man was bordering on Omega level at

102
00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:03.120
this point,

103
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.900
as he seemed to be able to manipulate both energy and matter on an atomic level.

104
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.600
And this shows us why we can consider resurrection man, uh,

105
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.950
beyond Omega level character,

106
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.270
because at any time he could be killed and come back to life with any power,

107
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.690
including those that would make him a planetary or universal threat.

108
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.830
The problem is he rarely keeps those powers for very long and he dies a lot

109
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.920
because dying and coming back to life with different powers is kind of what

110
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.060
makes his character interesting.

111
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.720
Now there would be other instances where resurrection man could be at or near

112
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:31.830
Omega level as well,

113
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.460
such as the time he was subjected to the reality warping abilities of a villain

114
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.323
known as schism,

115
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.110
which resulted in him dying and gaining what he calls quantum telekinesis,

116
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.290
which in practice seems to be a form of reality. Warping. In fact,

117
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.190
miss describes this ability by saying that he feels like he can do anything he

118
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:50.190
wants. And Superman describes his power as reality warping,

119
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.370
which leads him to find you as a wretched man and bringing him in to help the

120
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:55.650
justice league defeat a villain called major force,

121
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.210
who I believe was the same guy that stuffed Kyle Rainer's girlfriend in a

122
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:02.210
refrigerator. The guy was kind of a Dick now Mitch helps them,

123
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.990
but ultimately decides not to join the justice league saying that the superhero

124
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.410
life was simply not for him. And so over the course of his history,

125
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.460
resurrection man has had a variety of powers and it would really take too long

126
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:16.910
to list them here. But everything from super strength to energy absorption,

127
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.510
to super speed, to shape-shifting to oblate blast, if it's a superpower,

128
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.580
you can think of he's probably had it,

129
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.240
but what makes him potentially beyond Omega level or at least definitely beyond

130
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:30.320
Omega level is the possibility that at any time he could resurrect with a power

131
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.000
that has devastating potential.

132
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.760
And that happened on a couple of occasions when he gained a matter of

133
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.660
manipulation and reality warping powers in the DC 1 million mini series,

134
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.530
a possible future was revealed where Mitch had a device known as the resurrector

135
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.280
that allowed him to choose the power he would have upon his resurrection.

136
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.600
And in that instance,

137
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.800
he could definitely be a beyond Omega level character as he could grant himself,

138
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.750
all those powers at any point in time,

139
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.510
keep in mind that it's not considered in continuity,

140
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.100
but should it ever come to pass?

141
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.940
Whereas erection man would become one of the most powerful characters in DC

142
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:05.270
comics on a permanent basis, instead of only for short stints,

143
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.720
when he possessed matter of manipulation and reality warping before being killed

144
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:11.390
again. Oh, that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end,

145
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.230
Aaron Wilder. I hope you're happy that you got a video on resurrection, Mattamy.

146
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:19.970
God knows you actually got a whole ton of members of the Rob force to rally to

147
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:20.990
your side. Right?

148
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:24.350
Like it was kind of funny cause I was always wondering how long this was going

149
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:26.960
to go on for. And like literally it wasn't,

150
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:30.020
it stopped being just you asking for resurrection man.

151
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.210
And it started being groups of people, right?

152
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:35.240
Like whole groups of people who were like, don't worry, Aaron Wilder.

153
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.400
We're going to get robbed to do a video on resurrection, man.

154
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.080
So I hope you're happy that you have it.

155
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.720
You managed to rally the wrong court to your side.

156
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.880
And so I have done it for real, for true though.

157
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.830
It wasn't that I was ignoring you. It was just,

158
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.370
I get so many different requests. It's really hard to, hard to fulfill them all.

159
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:53.150
So, ah, here you go, man. Your video resurrection, man. I hope you enjoyed it.

160
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.660
I have no doubt that Aaron Wilder is going to ask for more stuff.

161
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.390
You guys always do. I literally had a guy who did that, right.

162
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.940
He asked for a beyond Omega level video. I made a comment.

163
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:04.880
He was probably going to ask for more stuff and he did so, uh,

164
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.410
as always hosted requests down below in the comments section.

165
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.700
