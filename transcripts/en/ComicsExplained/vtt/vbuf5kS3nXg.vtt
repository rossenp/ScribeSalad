4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.810
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.620
<v 1>This is Rob. And for this week's episode of our beyond Omega level series,</v>

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.430
we're stepping into Marvel's ultimate universe and discussing one of its most

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.690
powerful mutants magician, or as I like to call him ultimate Matthew Malloy.

8
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.340
Here's the funny thing he kind of is,

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.090
but he kind of isn't technically he was created before Matthew Malloy, uh,

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.470
actually a while before Matthew Malloy,

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.090
Matthew malaria was introduced as part of original sin in 2014. Uh,

12
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.760
and this guy was introduced back in 2006, right?

13
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.950
So technically not the exact same character,

14
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.790
but you guys will see why I consider them to be very, very similar in terms of,

15
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.500
uh, of the characters overall, right?

16
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.770
So for those of you that may not be familiar with Marvel's ultimate universe,

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.100
it was an alternate reality to the main Marvel universe that was created in the

18
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:56.630
year 2000 to feature updated modern takes on classic Marvel characters without

19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.820
effecting the longstanding Marvel continuity.

20
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.740
Now this proved to be incredibly popular with readers and the imprint ran for 15

21
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:04.071
years.

22
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:07.370
And one of the most popular titles throughout that time was the ultimate X-Men.

23
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.720
Now magician was introduced in issue number 66 of ultimate X-Men in 2006 by

24
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.910
writer, Robert Kirkman and artists, Tom Rainey.

25
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.690
Now magician is the codename of Elliot bogs who suddenly finds himself in a

26
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:21.380
mansion that he doesn't recognize and wonders down the hall to find his parents

27
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.070
had been killed.

28
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.750
Suddenly the police bust in the house and tell Elliott that he's responsible for

29
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:30.650
their deaths, but he also has no recollection of doing anything to them.

30
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.010
And so when an instant Elliot finds himself no longer in the house,

31
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.430
but in the middle of a field where he's immediately accosted by Nick fury of

32
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:37.910
shield.

33
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.690
Now Nick theory tells Elliot that he is a danger to himself and those around him

34
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.310
and demands Elliot come with him.

35
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.740
And so Elliot seems to have no clue what's going on,

36
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
but then fury tells him that he's a mutant and that his powers have manifested

37
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.540
overnight and are now out of control.

38
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.400
And so instead of agreeing to go with fury,

39
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.700
Elliot ends up resisting and his powers begin to manifest again,

40
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.630
turning the guns of,

41
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.380
to shield agents into snakes and causing a massive explosion. Now,

42
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:03.920
one of the shield agents hits Elliot with a tranquilizer dart and fury shows up

43
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.380
at Charles Xavier school with Elliot under sedation.

44
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.670
Now we asked Xavier to take Elliot in saying that the only other option is lucky

45
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:13.880
him away for the rest of his life due to his out of control powers,

46
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.480
which seems to include reality manipulation in the most extreme degree,

47
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.880
no ex-Navy or agrees to allow Elliot to stay.

48
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.730
And Elliot immediately begins asking to join the X-Men,

49
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.570
but sock hops tells him that he's not nearly ready as he hasn't even shown the

50
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:30.140
ability to control his powers before finally remarking that either several

51
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:33.620
months would have to pass or something really bad would have to happen before

52
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.890
Elliot is allowed to suit up for the X-Men. And so, as it turns out,

53
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.520
that's not the smartest thing to say to a person who can alter reality on a

54
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.340
universal scale as almost on cue Cyclops.

55
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.520
It gets a call from Colossus that he's been attacked by their brotherhood of

56
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:47.390
mutant supremacy.

57
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.300
And so psych hops allows Elliot to come along on the mission to help now,

58
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:51.140
as the X-Men battle,

59
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:54.560
the brotherhood Elliot puts his powers on display by splitting an atom,

60
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.260
causing an explosion powerful enough to move the blob,

61
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.270
which is generally thought to be completely and follows it up by moving the

62
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.100
earth to swallow up the blob.

63
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.740
He also displays the ability to alter the laws of physics.

64
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.970
As he decreases the gravity around the blob to effectively make him the

65
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.550
wait-lists before restoring it to cinema crashing back to earth.

66
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.260
After the X-Men to feed the brotherhood.

67
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.070
Elliott is interviewed by reporters who give him the nickname magician and his

68
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:21.090
interviews actually go a long way towards swaying public opinion and the X-Men

69
00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:25.140
favor. And so magicians heroics also catch the eye of someone else. Nick fury,

70
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.950
who comes to Xavier, demanding that he be allowed to recruit Elliot to his team,

71
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.100
the ultimate, which are the ultimate universes version of the Avengers.

72
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.130
Now they get into an argument and fury threatens to get Elliot's parents

73
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.410
involved since he's a minor, which as you might expect,

74
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.010
come as a surprise to exude yer because when fury brought Elliot to a school,

75
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.580
one of the first things he told him is that Elliot's powers went haywire and

76
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:45.480
killed his parents.

77
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.320
And so when a savior confronts Nick fury on this fury says that he's never even

78
00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:53.010
heard of Elliot before he saw him on television fighting alongside the X-Men.

79
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.240
And so they ultimately conclude that Eliot must've created an illusion of fury

80
00:03:57.241 --> 00:04:01.350
bringing him to Xavier school and was able to block Charles Xavier from sensing

81
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.090
any of that illusion, telepathically.

82
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.450
They also discuss the scope of his powers and reason that the fact that they're

83
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:10.680
able to talk without Elliot influencing them must mean that he needs to be aware

84
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:12.870
of what's going on in order to manipulate it.

85
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.000
And so when they confront Elliot in front of the X-Men,

86
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.980
he says that he doesn't know what they're talking about,

87
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.310
but they quickly figure out that he is manipulating their minds once again.

88
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.290
And so the X-Men try and subdue Elliot,

89
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.800
but he proves himself to be far too powerful for them and also displays

90
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.790
inability to negate all of their powers. And so when Elliot finally comes clean,

91
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.850
he confesses that he'd always been a fan of the X-Men and had always wanted to

92
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.890
be part of the team. And so to accomplish that,

93
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.160
he started manipulating and deceiving everyone to make it happen.

94
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.340
He goes on to explain that originally he wanted to make the world,

95
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.490
love the X-Men, but now that they've messed up, he has to kill them all.

96
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.290
And so he's then confronted by Jean Gray.

97
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.290
Who's in possession of the Phoenix force. And so magician summons,

98
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:52.290
manifestations of the brotherhood and defeats Jean Gray,

99
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.610
but astound by Wolverine and vanishes without a trace with Xavier saying that

100
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.610
there is no trace of anything that was suggested he ever existed.

101
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.880
Now later Elliot appears to kitty pride whom he'd had developed a bit of a

102
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:06.210
flirtatious relationship with despite her being Spiderman's girlfriend at the

103
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:09.240
time. And he tells her that he never wanted to hurt the X-Men,

104
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.000
but that he was unable to exercise any control of his powers.

105
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.710
And so his reality warping ability,

106
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:16.650
he explains simply provides him with whatever he wants.

107
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:19.800
What did he knows it or not? And so once he wanted to join the X-Men,

108
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.130
he unwittingly began manipulating reality to make that happen.

109
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.560
And so knowing that [inaudible] would not stop coming after him,

110
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.940
if he knew that he was still alive,

111
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.570
Elliot made it so that none of them would ever know he existed including kitty

112
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.450
and would ultimately go somewhere that he wouldn't be a threat to anyone else

113
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.920
like Antarctica. And yeah,

114
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.890
that's pretty much everything there is to know about magician.

115
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.430
He only appears in a handful of issues, but in the brief time that we see him,

116
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.060
we see just how ridiculously powerful he can be more often than not.

117
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.250
When it comes to reality warping in Marvel comics,

118
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.540
this is done from the perspective of somebody altering intentionally, right?

119
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.940
Franklin Richards creates a pocket universe in his bedroom,

120
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.970
or he does it the aftermath of, or really as part of heroes, reborn,

121
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.110
where he literally creates a whole universe where all the heroes are resurrected

122
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.600
and live their own lives. As Franklin Richards has created them,

123
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.820
or as it is kind of evolve and do their own thing,

124
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.660
magic Jasper could ultra reality in such a way to where he could twist it and

125
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.390
skew it depending on what goal he wanted to achieve. Ultimately,

126
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.231
Jim Jasper has met,

127
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:15.500
has met his demise of the hands of the fury who could adapt to any power that

128
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.960
anybody had and then find a way to overcome it, right?

129
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.440
That's the reason why the fury teleported Jim Jasper's to a place where there

130
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.620
was no reality because he knew that the only way for Jim Jaspers to be as

131
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:27.320
powerful as he was, was to have a reality that to manipulate,

132
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.900
if there was no reality, he'd be weak. And then he just, of course,

133
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.010
totally incinerated it.

134
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.220
That's usually the way that reality warping works in Marvel comics.

135
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.440
What makes magician so incredibly powerful?

136
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:39.260
And what I think really kind of makes him on par and kind of the ultimate

137
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:40.670
universe version of Matthew Malloy,

138
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.760
is it Matthew Malloy couldn't really even control his powers and his powers

139
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:46.730
acted subconsciously. And so if Matthew Malloy wanted something,

140
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.670
but wasn't aware that he was triggering his powers in order to make it happen,

141
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.630
it would happen right now.

142
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:53.420
There were some things that Matthew Malloy did like resurrecting himself from

143
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:55.850
the dead different things like that. But with somebody like magician,

144
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.390
it's the exact same way his powers operate subconsciously because he doesn't

145
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.940
know how to control them. And so he can make anything happen.

146
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.520
And there's no limit to the, to the height of his powers, right?

147
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.620
Operating on a universal scale, possibly even beyond, right.

148
00:07:07.621 --> 00:07:08.361
That's one of the good things,

149
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.060
or one of the interesting things about having a person with reality,

150
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.470
warping being powers that are so vague.

151
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.230
There's no definition as to what it is that he can achieve.

152
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.690
So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

153
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.950
If you are new here to comments,

154
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:21.320
explain to make sure you guys have the sub button to become part of the Rob

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.570
core. If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you drop a, like,

156
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.660
I'm definitely looking forward.

157
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.530
Looking forward to the comments that you guys are inevitably going to leave down

158
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:31.100
there, magician versus the marquee of death magician versus Matthew Malloy,

159
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.550
magician versus magic. Jasper's magician versus this guy, that guy,

160
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.640
that guy and that guy. I know you guys are going to ask those questions.

161
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.610
Some of them we might even answer, but I will catch you all that.
