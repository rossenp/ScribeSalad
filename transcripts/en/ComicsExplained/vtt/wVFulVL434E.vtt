00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
Good. Rob core. How's your day.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.430
What's going on guys. This is Robin. I love journey, but we are covering the.

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.320
<v 1>Man Dr. Doom tie in for the King and black and this story.</v>

8
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.790
<v 0>It's amazing. This story is hilarious and I absolutely.</v>

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.040
<v 1>I love it. Right. It's great to kind of have this reprieve, right. I mean,</v>

10
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.680
there's some serious notes in here, but it's also just a really, really,

11
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:43.250
really good story. So initially this picks up at some point in the past, right?

12
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:43.550
This,

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.210
this is a really important in so far as what happens as much as the meaning

14
00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.030
behind it. But it's one of these things where for like his birthday,

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.450
as a little kid, Tony stark has given a piece of prime real estate by his dad.

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.230
He buys this place called the Johnson and Bernstein building, uh,

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.640
this like prime Manhattan real estate.

18
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.760
Now Tony stark ends up selling it when he's like 13 years old for 6 million

19
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.190
bucks of his dad's like, you know, cool, like good job, you know,

20
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:06.890
you made a profit, you know, so that's kind of, that's kind of interesting,

21
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:09.470
but the funny thing about this is that when Tony gets the gift,

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.050
he gets kind of pause it off and it's like, thanks dad. And he's like, no son,

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.910
Santa's got it for you. And he's like, it's okay.

24
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:15.290
Like I know how this stuff works.

25
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.930
And his dad gives him this really good piece of advice. And he says,

26
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.530
there are times in this life when you don't really want to suck the magic out of

27
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:24.290
things, right. Just let the Badger, you know, let the magic be what it is,

28
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.550
even if you know the truth behind it.

29
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.920
Sometimes it's just more fun to buy into the illusion.

30
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.410
And the reason why is because when you lose that magic,

31
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.130
the world will turn cold and gray and the spice of life will basically be gone.

32
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.650
And that's kind of where Ironman is here at the moment, right?

33
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.260
Not in so far as he's lost the magic or anything like that.

34
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.830
But because what he's facing is basically the death of Eddie Brock and the sense

35
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.320
that it was his actions that led to Eddie dying, right?

36
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.230
The fact that he went and got that Grendel Symbion he brought it back believing

37
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.600
that Eddie could basically use it. He could tap into Knoll.

38
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.330
It appeared to be more than Eddie could handle in any Brocket seems to have

39
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:56.300
basically been killed because of it. And he literally flat-lined in the story.

40
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.200
And so because of that, Tony starts kind of coping with the struggle of this,

41
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:02.390
right? That he was directly responsible for the death of a hero.

42
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.260
More so than that,

43
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.410
the death of Eddie Brock basically seems to be the death of everything else,

44
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:09.020
right. That Eddie seemed to be the only one who could really stand against it.

45
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:12.050
And then suddenly out of nowhere, he's met by the arrival of Dr. Doom.

46
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.870
Now we're not really given an explanation as to why Dr. Dumas here,

47
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.250
but given the nature of his character,

48
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:19.790
we can largely surmise that he was watching everything unfold in Liberia and

49
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:22.370
then seeing what it was at Ironman did and knowing Ironman,

50
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.960
the way he does basically comes here.

51
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.640
The important thing to understand is that there is a kind of,

52
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:30.440
of history there between iron man and Dr. Duke specifically the concept of

53
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.140
infamous Ironman, right? That in the aftermath of civil war two,

54
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:36.200
when Tony stark was killed, that Dr. Doom basically took over the world,

55
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.780
iron man. He's like, there's, there needs to be an iron man out there. Right?

56
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:39.980
So I'm going to take over that role.

57
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.110
It was kind of his way of redeeming himself, right?

58
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.600
Going from like the traditional villain to trying to become a good guy.

59
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.530
And it was a great story.

60
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.290
It was not the most financially successful story Marvel wrote,

61
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.440
but it was a great story. I loved infamous Ironman, but because of that,

62
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.050
there's a little bit of history here and there's a lot of respect between the

63
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.230
two. And so with that being the case, it's kind of him not so much, you know,

64
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:00.400
kind of nursing him back to health, but asking him some important questions.

65
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.840
If it were me who had died, right.

66
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:03.760
You would grab the Greenville semi at you'd bonded it to me.

67
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.320
Would you mourn me in the same way?

68
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.360
And it's one of these things where it's kind of like, you know, I don't,

69
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.280
I don't know if, you know,

70
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.900
if I really understand what it is that you're getting out here,

71
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.130
but before they're really able to get, you know, too far into this discussion,

72
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.700
suddenly like iron man picks up on what looks like some object flying in the

73
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.320
sky, right. Something flying in the sky.

74
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.750
And he's kind of like what in the world? You know? And, and like, of course,

75
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.640
you know, Dr. Doom kind of picks up on it too. And he's like,

76
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.670
is that an doctor names? Like no iron man's like, it's December. Right? Like,

77
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.710
I don't even really remember if it's a Semper anymore. Right.

78
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.020
Everything kind of blurs together, you know? And, and of course,

79
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.460
Dr. Doom understands what it is that iron man is asking here. And he was like,

80
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:39.520
no, what you're asking is absurd. Right. Like it's not even Christmas Eve.

81
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.190
Right. He's like, but, but like IMS, like, but look at the thing though, man,

82
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:46.000
like, it looks like it really is, you know, like, like it really looks,

83
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.760
it looks like that's really, that's really the case, you know? And, and like,

84
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.240
they're both trying to deny the truth, but the reality is it's Santa.

85
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.110
It really is Santa Claus. The problem with this is that Santa Claus has been.

86
00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.880
<v 2>Again.</v>

87
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.750
<v 1>Well, this has been taken over by Knoll and this is amazing.</v>

88
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.140
I just like sleigh bells, sting and perdition, you know, it's amazing, right?

89
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:08.880
Like a victimized Santa.

90
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.160
<v 2>Claus. And this.</v>

91
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.070
<v 1>Is one of these things where like Dr. Doom has like the best response ever.</v>

92
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:16.350
Right. He's like, it cannot be your hollowed gift giver. Right?

93
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.240
TIS merely some solos perversion.

94
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.543
<v 2>You can meet one.</v>

95
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.840
<v 1>I love doctrine dooms. I love the way he talks, but I am. It's like, no, man.</v>

96
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:27.990
Like, like we can't let this happen. Right. Like, look, yes.

97
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:30.840
Things are kind of crazy right now. Yes. No one has shown up on earth.

98
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.150
He's pretty much conquered everybody in New York,

99
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.970
but we cannot let him ruin the holidays.

100
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.590
We cannot let him enslave Santa Claus to his whims. Right.

101
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:43.260
So like they literally go hunting after him. Now this is, this is the,

102
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:46.950
this is the funniest thing. Like Dr. Doom shows up here and then like, uh, like,

103
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.320
like I am as like, dude watch out, we will watch for the reindeer. Right?

104
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.650
Like keep an eye on those things. And they spit venom at Dr. Duke right now.

105
00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:54.390
Of course they get burned off because of, you know,

106
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.370
Dr. Doom being mystic and so on and so forth.

107
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.220
And then like Santa Claus throws an explosive president at them,

108
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.900
which sends them flying into a building.

109
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.150
<v 2>And.</v>

110
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.410
<v 1>And, and it's, it's kind of wild, right?</v>

111
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.380
Because in the middle of all this iron man's like, Jesus, like this is insane,

112
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.380
right? Like first I killed Eddie Brock and now I've got to kill Santa.

113
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.630
<v 2>Claus. And this was kind.</v>

114
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.990
<v 1>Of a cool little moment here, Dr. Doom sort of muses on the nature of Eddie.</v>

115
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:18.720
Right? He says Eddie Brock was weak, that he was an addict in many ways,

116
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.150
a slave to the Symbian. And it's one of these things where I am,

117
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.100
it's kind of like, I don't know if that's really the case.

118
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.400
The world would have been a much worse place. Had we not had Eddie,

119
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.110
Eddie Brock became venom, venom,

120
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.960
pushed Spider-Man to new Heights because before venom Spider-Man,

121
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:33.150
hadn't really faced a villain like that.

122
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.550
And so Spider-Man had to push himself to greater Heights.

123
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.880
And so in turn that made Spiderman better, Spider-Man becoming better,

124
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.290
made the world superheroes better.

125
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.420
And then there's even stories where Eddie Brock was a,

126
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:44.370
was a hero where he fought alongside the, the,

127
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:47.100
the various heroes who were out there and basically was the reason why they

128
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.230
survived. Right? So pad Eddie not been there.

129
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.870
The world would have been a far more screwed up place than it is. Right.

130
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:52.770
Had it not been for any,

131
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.040
they never even would have known that NOLA was coming in the first place. Right.

132
00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:59.990
So it's one of these situations where Eddie has, uh, has an important role here.

133
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.050
And so what you end up getting is Dr. Doom kind of pilling Ironman.

134
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:05.300
Like I'm here to simply tell you that Eddie,

135
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.990
Eddie Brock dying was worth the sacrifice. And the question of iron man is like,

136
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.840
why was it worth losing Eddie and the response of, of Dr. Dumas?

137
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:16.550
Because it gave us you because in your actions and in your desire to prove that

138
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.090
Eddie's death was an accident, that you're not somebody who's clumsy or buffoon,

139
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.350
that what you've done, whether,

140
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:24.230
whether it was by your own direct action or your unintentional action,

141
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.770
was that you effectively merged the venom symbiont with your extremist armor.

142
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.050
You've created a new victimized suit.

143
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.590
And so what this does is it will allow you to go forward in this battle against

144
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:36.610
snow, using a kind of technology that you'd never really utilized before.

145
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.480
You can call it a Knoll Buster suit, if you want to.

146
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.560
I don't know if I would call it that yet,

147
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.960
because you'll probably end up having something like that later on.

148
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.640
But it's iron, man's new venom suits.

149
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.730
We're seeing a paradigm shift in terms of how iron man's armor works,

150
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.900
because now it's, it's a,

151
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:52.850
it's a living synthetic organism that he is essentially enslaved in bonded

152
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:55.460
to his suit. It's cool because it's not like extremis right.

153
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:57.590
Or anything like that. It's kind of a modified version of it.

154
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.170
But jumping back into the fray, he basically ends up grabbing,

155
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.030
grabbing Santa Claus. Right. And it's like, okay,

156
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.910
like we got to regain control of the sleigh and we've got to take out Santa.

157
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.990
And then he's like experience my pain, dear. That's what he calls his reindeer,

158
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.880
his pain, dear. This is just good, old fashioned fun.

159
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.720
And this is what comics are supposed to be. Right.

160
00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:14.690
The people who take themselves too seriously, we'll be like,

161
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.570
this is not how comics are supposed to be. They're supposed to be 100% serious,

162
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:20.990
100% of the time and never deviate and never have fun. Screw that. Right.

163
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.310
I love comics that are fun.

164
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:25.670
And just sometimes they're goofy and it's great to have like, especially now,

165
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.460
right with the world being the way it is, we're edging to the end of 2020,

166
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.620
Oh God. Right. We need some humor in this world. And Dr.

167
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:34.900
Doom came up with iron man who has a modified,

168
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:38.680
minimized iron man suit facing off against a minimized Santa Claus. It's cool.

169
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.810
Right. It's the kind of humor that we needed. And it's great. Right.

170
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:44.440
So ultimately where iron man tries to seize control of the sleigh,

171
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.770
this basically leads to, to,

172
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.480
to essentially Santa Claus falling out of it and just plummeting down into a

173
00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:52.120
vehicle. Right. And it's kinda like, okay, so iron man's like,

174
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.010
did I kill Santa Claus just now? Right. Like, did I, did I, did I have that?

175
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.380
Did I just kill him right now? Kind of a crazy thing.

176
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:00.670
Like I think I just killed Santa Claus.

177
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.820
Now the other thing that we ended up learning here, and this is something cool.

178
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.190
The other thing that we end up learning here is that the suit of iron man

179
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.520
functions almost identical to a venom Simeon or any kind of symbiotic in the

180
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:13.240
sense that pieces of a suit had broken off because of the fact that it's tied to

181
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:16.630
the Symbion, it actually returns to them. And that's cool, right?

182
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.960
Like literally pieces of a suit kind of liquefy and bond back to him again.

183
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:22.000
Right. Which is, which is really awesome. Now Santa Claus,

184
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:24.550
of course is not dead. He just explodes out of this car,

185
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:28.360
screaming obscenities at everybody, you know? And he's like,

186
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:30.880
don't you believe in me? You know? And that kind of a thing, you know, and it's,

187
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:32.620
and it's kinda nuts. He says like, you know,

188
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.140
nothing's going to go back to normal, right? Like this Christmas.

189
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.680
And for all time forward, Christmas will be a black Christmas. Right.

190
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:41.860
And then it just goes on the attack against, you know, Ironman and Dr. Doom.

191
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:44.260
Now of course, iron man gets the upper hand. And then in turn,

192
00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:46.720
what he actually ends up doing is it seems like he lets off this kind of

193
00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:51.070
repulsor blast that actually blows the Symbio directly off of Santa Claus.

194
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.810
Right. Like not to get off of him.

195
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.550
So now iron man looks like he has a kind of modified version of Dylan's

196
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:58.620
abilities. Probably not in the same extreme. Right.

197
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.710
He can't really control symbionts he can't destroy them on a whim,

198
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.960
but he has the ability to kind of knock them off, right.

199
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.470
To basically blow them off of an individual and kind of remove them in that way.

200
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.840
Right. So the ability to remove ischemia from somebody else, no,

201
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.720
this is something that's noticed by, by Dr. Duke, right?

202
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.780
It's something that's noticed by him. And it's like, this is cool, man. Right?

203
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:17.690
This is, this is interesting, but it's, it's, it's,

204
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.030
it's kind of a funny line because Dr. Doom's like, you have eradicated Nicholas,

205
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.040
the jolliest of men, but ultimately of course, you know, Santa Claus,

206
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:28.680
isn't dead. And, uh, he basically ends up kind of coming to right. You know,

207
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.590
he kind of, kind of comes back and he looks at Tony. He's like, you know,

208
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:33.840
Tony stark, you were always such a good boy and Victor,

209
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.750
one of the naughtiest to have ever lived. And so we just kind of like,

210
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.670
I'm outta here. So he ends up, he ends up leaving. Now,

211
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.760
one of the things that they realized when they basically smashed his license up

212
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.470
is they realized that he's not really Santa Claus.

213
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.590
He's just a guy named Mike Dunwoody. Right. Who just kind of lives out there.

214
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.340
And I think New Jersey is where he's from, from, from pyramids, New Jersey.

215
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.800
And that said, he's just an average, Joe. But then suddenly, like,

216
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.800
they kind of start asking questions. One of the funny things is adopted him,

217
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:57.060
wants the suit of Ironman. Right.

218
00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:00.170
So you can use it for his own ends to kind of destroy Nolan iron. Man's like,

219
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.830
that's not going to happen. Right. I don't trust. And he's like,

220
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.660
don't dismiss my viability. And he's like, no,

221
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.120
it's really just because you're a villain, if anything else, but that's,

222
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:07.080
that's not really going to happen.

223
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.690
But as they're walking along and they're kind of leaving,

224
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.730
Dr. Duma has this thought, he's like, you know,

225
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.490
and literally he says like something perplexes me, right?

226
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.540
Michael Dunwoody referred to both of us by our real names. And I am, it's like,

227
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.940
well, neither of us really has a secret identity, but then the doctor deems,

228
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.610
like, but in tandem, he, so arrogantly quantified this,

229
00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:28.170
some moral value of our respective deeds and IMS, like also not really hard,

230
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.540
you know? And then Dr. Tim's like thought, and then I imagine,

231
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.081
are you telling me,

232
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:34.290
you believe in Santa Dr. Jamie was like preposterous by merely conducting an

233
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.520
intellectual investigation of what just occurred. Dr. Dan believes in Santa,

234
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.810
that needs to be said, but this isn't, this is why I love this. Right.

235
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.080
It's a fun story. You know, that's ultimately, that was kind of like, okay,

236
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.090
you know, maybe it was Santa, maybe it wasn't.

237
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.870
But what it does do is it actually kind of gives iron man this sort of reprieve

238
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:55.140
that he needed to kind of regain his confidence a bit and to kind of get past

239
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:57.960
the fact that his actions led to the death of Eddie Brock. Yes they did.

240
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.380
But moping over the fact that Eddie's dead is not going to do anybody any good.

241
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.640
There'll be time for that. Right.

242
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.700
There'll be time for iron man to sit down and come to grips with the fact that

243
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:08.880
he killed Eddie in the moment they need the mind of Tony stark. They need him,

244
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.800
right. They need him at his absolute best.

245
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.360
He's got to get back into the battle again,

246
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.480
but the story does leave off on a pretty cool moment where Dr. Doom ponders,

247
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:18.690
whether or not Santa Claus could be a sorcerer of Supreme. Both that being said,

248
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:20.040
guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

249
