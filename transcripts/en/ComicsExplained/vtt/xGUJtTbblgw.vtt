<v 1>Hold on guys. This is Rob. And, um,</v>

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.860
first things first before we started this video,

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.030
I have never gotten into teenage mutant Ninja turtles, but just to say,

7
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.720
I watched the TV show briefly when I was a little kid, like a couple episodes.

8
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.640
I saw the second Weiss, all three movies.

9
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.040
I think the second one is the best one. Uh, and that's about it,

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.140
but I've never really read Ninja turtles comics.

11
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.450
I've never really gotten into any of the, any of the Lords.

12
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:35.510
So I've done enough research that hopefully I kind of get these things right.

13
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.990
But for those of you guys who are members of the Rob cor, uh,

14
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.560
and our teenage mutant Ninja turtle fans, now's your time to shine, right?

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.880
Like take to the comments and educate all of us on teenage mutant Ninja turtles,

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
uh,

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.240
especially me because I love reaching out to you guys and learning stuff from

18
00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:50.750
you guys.

19
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.690
And this was one of those chances where you guys get to teach me things.

20
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.760
So the last Ronin was,

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.090
is really kind of released here as the story where it's basically,

22
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.250
I wouldn't say the end of the road for the Ninja turtles,

23
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.090
but seems to kind of take place in some dystopian future by some kind of

24
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:05.924
dystopian future.

25
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.320
And initially here we pick up with one of the Ninja turtles or seemingly one of

26
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:10.070
the Ninja turtles,

27
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.340
but we're not really given any indicators as to who this person is.

28
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.680
And this comes from a variety of different sources.

29
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.500
The first is the fact that their bandana or ice trap,

30
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:20.390
whatever you want to call it is basically black, right?

31
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.720
So it's not designed to cater towards any one of the Ninja turtles, right?

32
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:27.650
Like it's not orange, it's not purple. It's not blue. It's not, uh, not red.

33
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.510
And so we don't really know which guy this is.

34
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:32.990
Now we could look at the weapons to give us an indicator of which Ninja total.

35
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.960
This is where this guy has the staff. He's got the sword,

36
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:39.710
he's got the size and presumably he's got nunchucks in there somewhere, right?

37
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:42.710
So we're not really given an answer on who this guy is.

38
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:44.840
And of course that's obviously designed to be intentional.

39
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.490
But the other part of that is that they're basically making his way towards what

40
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:52.370
looks like a completely cordoned off Manhattan, right?

41
00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:54.350
A completely cordoned off Manhattan Island. Now,

42
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.840
the other part of that is it looks as though like with this,

43
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:59.840
this kind of sludge, basically what passes for water being toxic,

44
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.610
that would it being at some point in the future,

45
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.290
things like climate change pollution,

46
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.440
stuff like that have all seemed to have kind of run rampant and almost puts

47
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:10.460
forward this idea that the earth or, or seemingly this part of the world,

48
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:14.000
maybe New York, isn't a lot of ways, just kind of a derelict place. Now,

49
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.700
a lot of those pollutions stuff seems to be coming from this city.

50
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:18.200
So maybe it may not just be the world,

51
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.250
but it looks like it's one of these things where in a typical post-apocalyptic

52
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:24.260
landscape, you have what you normally see,

53
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.200
which is to say the more or less collapsed of modern society.

54
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.590
And what came out of it was essentially the rise of strong men in petty

55
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:32.720
warlords, regardless of the situation, you know,

56
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:36.080
this guy starts making his way through all this, all this water, you know,

57
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.200
throw basically takes out a couple of, of Ninja stars and takes out cameras,

58
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:39.381
right?

59
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.520
So this mission is basically one of infiltration and it's looking to kind of get

60
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.860
revenge on a particular person, right? And that's,

61
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:48.530
what's kind of wild about this because the statement here,

62
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:51.200
or at least we're getting statements like it's time to finish this or die

63
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:53.570
trying. And so there seems to be some history here, right?

64
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.660
There's seems to be some history in so far as if this is the only Mendez hurdle

65
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.430
that we see. And the story is called the last Ronin, basically this person, or,

66
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.180
you know, this, this,

67
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.330
this experience happened in such a way to where all the other Ninja turtles are

68
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:04.840
killed,

69
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.500
but it is a little strange because what we seem to kind of get here are these

70
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.550
conversations, right?

71
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.610
You have like three Ninja turtles in the background and are basically talking to

72
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.100
this guy and this guy in turn is talking back to them.

73
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.000
So it's a little bit mysterious here. Now, the fact that they're,

74
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.170
they're dressed in your typical Ninja turtle garb,

75
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.770
the fact that we're just now being introduced to them seems to lend itself,

76
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.220
or seems to lend credence to the idea that he's only seeing, uh, seeing them.

77
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.930
And they're only seeing him, but again,

78
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.620
the mystery and build buildup here is actually pretty amazing, right? It's,

79
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.230
it's, it's pretty awesome. But once it gets into the city,

80
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.740
we get a little more of an indication of what this guy's capable of,

81
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:42.190
or at least how in particular it is that this guy sees the world, right?

82
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:45.580
Because as soon as he gets there, we're kind of given this indication that,

83
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.270
you know, Manhattan more or less as it exists now exists in two different ways,

84
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.340
right? Like New York exists in, in two different forms.

85
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:52.930
There's kind of the lower city and the upper city.

86
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.350
And you guys will see what I'm talking about here in a minute. But the,

87
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:58.930
the conversation between this guy and seemingly the other Ninja turtles is this

88
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.510
guy expressed a little bit of frustration in the sense that once he gets out

89
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:04.660
there to the street, he realizes this place is wildly overcrowded. Right?

90
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.720
So this is kind of an indication that he hasn't been here for quite some time.

91
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:09.010
Now the other one did turtles are like,

92
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.720
what did you think it was going to be like a stroll in the park?

93
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.450
You just kind of casually make your way up to the tower. And then every,

94
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.490
then they just kind of inaccurate revenge and that's it.

95
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.400
And how did you see this playing out in your head? Right?

96
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:19.470
Like you're in the world world now. Like you gotta,

97
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.100
you gotta be able to navigate the real world. And that's the kind of thing that,

98
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:26.550
that we get here is one of the things hell's himself is adapt and overcome,

99
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.850
right. Or do not. Right. You know, like one of these two things has to happen.

100
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:32.880
It's not necessarily a thing about luck is a thing about being able to examine

101
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.850
your circumstances and overcome your circumstances accordingly. Yeah.

102
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.960
So what ends up happening here is that a handful of basically bikers ended up

103
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:42.480
coming out of what looks like a local bar or a local restaurant.

104
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.630
And then basically the bike of a woman named Jones is missing. Now,

105
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.100
if I'm a betting, man, I would say,

106
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:49.260
this person is somehow connected to Casey Jones.

107
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.810
I don't know if that's true or not. I'm just kind of speculating or whatever,

108
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:55.110
really given any indication here. But if I remember correctly, back in the day,

109
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.720
they used to refer to Casey Jones as Jones. Right?

110
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:01.560
So do not take that as an absolute, I could be entirely wrong,

111
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.550
but of course this Ninja turtle,

112
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.260
basically there's a racing off of the motorcycle.

113
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.500
But when they get to what looks like this kind of tower of sorts, right? This,

114
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:09.870
this had building, did they end up finding a bit of a road,

115
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.110
a bit of a roadblock in the sense that there's no easy,

116
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:15.690
accessible way in where they won't be detected.

117
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.150
And so what they actually ended up doing is creating a diversion and one of the

118
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.680
coolest ways possible, right?

119
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:22.650
Like they even say it's as far as like snake plus skin style, right?

120
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:24.630
So like most of you guys who don't know who snake plus skin is,

121
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.530
he's from escape from New York and escape from Los Angeles. It was uh,

122
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.230
Oh my God, what was his name? Kurt Russell. That's what I'm thinking of.

123
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.480
It was Kurt Russell. Uh, but nonetheless, this is like,

124
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:36.360
what this guy ends up doing is basically getting on the motorcycle, right.

125
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:37.350
Riding back a little ways,

126
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:41.430
getting on the motorcycle and jumping it over the fence and into a tanker truck.

127
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.490
Right. Blows the whole thing and gets himself to the wall.

128
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.880
And then basically through what looks like a, like a drainage hole.

129
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.790
And so once he starts kind of climbing through there, going through all this,

130
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.380
this cabling and all that kind of stuff,

131
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.180
that he basically ends up making his way through it.

132
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.350
But notice this like a kind of conversation between himself and the Ninja

133
00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:00.200
turtles, it's kind of cool, right? They're like, well, that was graceful, right?

134
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.270
You literally blew up a tanker in order to get yourself here.

135
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.890
So you can get yourself into this, into this building.

136
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.870
And now you're going to climb through, what's basically a manhole.

137
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.180
He said it worked, didn't it like, that's the only thing that really matters.

138
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.160
It's like it works. And he's like,

139
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.660
and then the other thing he offers here is like,

140
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.500
don't let your eyes deceive you, right? Like this nose never forgets the smell.

141
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.070
Even if it looks different, this is still our turf. Right. Nothing's changed.

142
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.880
What matters is like, this is our, this, this is still our home turf.

143
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.160
And so as he gets in there, once he crawls through the hole,

144
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.710
he ends up quite literally in the middle of everything.

145
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.380
So this is kind of like the worst, the worst situation to happen, I guess,

146
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.730
outside of like, you know,

147
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.970
basically crawling out and into like the middle of the police department in the

148
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:38.510
barracks, right? Like that seems to be probably maybe worse than this,

149
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:40.120
but in this instance, he crawls out of the hole.

150
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.860
He's just surrounded by everybody. And as soon as that happens,

151
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.060
we get a couple indications, right. Immediately the, the armored guards, what,

152
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.460
what,

153
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.700
what basically passes for street cops and this particular landscape immediately

154
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.650
started activating under like intruder grabbing.

155
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.650
And the other thing that we're showing here is by way of the people dressing,

156
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.360
right? Looking a lot more casual, you know,

157
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:57.860
kind of dressing a little more high end,

158
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.750
this kind of looks to be the upper city.

159
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.970
And we get that from a couple of places in the sense that you've got this kind

160
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:04.610
of dome the stretches over the top, you've got taller buildings.

161
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.310
So it's not like it's just a store. This is an actual street, you know,

162
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:10.430
with people on it and things along those lines. And so as soon as that happens,

163
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.400
this guy is on the run and that's the way it's going to be like for the most

164
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:16.430
part, the rest of this. Right. But he's going to continually be on the run.

165
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.850
He throws down smoke bombs that offer a distraction and then basically takes

166
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:22.490
off. Is that happening? Uh, he ends up getting, you know, or at least these,

167
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:24.800
these guys end up reporting, you know, Hey, like there's an intruder,

168
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:28.550
he's heading down this location and so on. And as he takes out this cop, uh,

169
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.850
basically beats the crap out of him with a nightstick as he takes this cop out.

170
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.580
Uh, this, this guy just kind of keeps reiterating the same thing, right.

171
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:37.670
Just saying halt. But when he's defeated and part of his mask is broken,

172
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.810
he looks human underneath.

173
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.470
And the conversation between this guy and the other Ninja turtles is okay, uh,

174
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.360
is this guy human or easy synthetic?

175
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.850
And the logical assumption is that he's synthetic, right?

176
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.880
That this guy has knowledge of technology, right? Knowledge of,

177
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.580
of advanced technology. And this guy looks at that and it says,

178
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.220
it looks like he's synthetic, right? That's, that's what it looks like.

179
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.010
Like this guy looks like he's just a normal person or at least one of the other

180
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.530
Ninja turtles seems to say that this guy is like a normal guy. Right.

181
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:02.360
So it was kinda like, okay, it's interesting. I mean,

182
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:05.150
because largely at this point we can assume like that's Donna Tello,

183
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.750
that's that's Michelangelo or it's Leonardo or it's Raphael.

184
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.180
We don't really know who the other three are because we don't know who this guy

185
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:14.270
is. Right. We just know he's one of the Ninja turtles. And so because of that,

186
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.090
you kind of get this sort of pink, a couple other officers show up,

187
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:18.920
realize this guy has been been disabled.

188
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:22.550
But what it means is he has to basically speed up his timeline because now that

189
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:26.300
the enemy force is aware that he's there and these guys kind of look, I mean,

190
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:29.060
they got swords, they look like foot where they look like the foot soldiers.

191
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.640
Now that we've, now they know this guy's here. Didn't one.

192
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:34.550
He has to incapacitate them as best he can. But two,

193
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.460
because they're being incapacitated, they're not reporting back.

194
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.790
And because they're not reporting back, that means something's going on. Right?

195
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:42.680
I mean, we already know there's an intruder there. So now,

196
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.980
like the intruder is not being caught and that's going to lead to heightened

197
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:47.030
levels of security.

198
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.670
And so this guy literally jumps from like apartment building,

199
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:52.670
to apartment building, going from place to place, just literally quite,

200
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.590
you know, fleeing for his life and trying to achieve his goal.

201
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.480
And constantly being caught up with these guys.

202
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:01.020
But notice this for the most part, he's able to overcome them quite readily.

203
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.330
Like they're not a huge threat to this guy.

204
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.310
One of the other cool things that you get here is of course,

205
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.560
this is kind of a place where you have hover cars and different things like

206
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.140
that. Right? So technology is full on advanced here.

207
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.550
He actually like jumps off a bridge, lands on a car, like lands in a police car,

208
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.190
throws the cop out, and then commandeers the car.

209
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.590
And then the car crashes through, through like a sign.

210
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.600
So then he jumps out of the car, lands on the ground and takes off running form,

211
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.990
like takes off running for his life. Right.

212
00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:28.700
Just kind of going and going and going. Now,

213
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.300
what we're going to finding out here is this person is looking to track down a

214
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:35.720
Roku. Hiroto not from here, we switch over to Hiroto himself.

215
00:09:35.721 --> 00:09:37.640
And we only get this brief little moment here. Right.

216
00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:40.700
In the sense that he's talking to this guy is talking to his captain and he

217
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:43.010
says, yeah, we've got kind of a situation down there.

218
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.640
Geraldo his initial response is, or at least has he's informed by his captain.

219
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.210
It's an intruder, maybe like a rogue derelict from the bottom district. Right?

220
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:51.290
So somebody from the very,

221
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.680
very bottom who is basically operating in the middle district or causing

222
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:56.900
problems, and this really kind of shows a couple of things.

223
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.010
The first thing it shows us is that, that the, the kind of cat the society,

224
00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:03.560
which is to say like hierarchies, right? So the,

225
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.830
the class society rather is still intact, right? The lower class,

226
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.100
the middle class and the upper class. The other thing is shows is that this guy,

227
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.610
I really kind of underestimates the various forces that are out there, right?

228
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:15.470
That you have people who were in the lower class,

229
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.590
who seemed to rebel on not really a regular frequency,

230
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.880
but every once in a while,

231
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.150
by trying to like destroy things in the middle-class or the upper-class or

232
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:26.420
something along those lines, now they seem to be put down with quite harshly.

233
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.360
And that really seems to be the case because one Hiroto is not too concerned.

234
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:32.150
Right? So it's one of these things where his attitude indicates that previous

235
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:36.170
instances, previous attempts to rebel have been quashed quite readily readily.

236
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.080
So he's pretty confident in his ability to quash this one as well.

237
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.770
And he actually authorizes a lethal force, right? So this guy had this, this,

238
00:10:42.771 --> 00:10:47.630
this guy here has no problem using lethal force against basically lower class,

239
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.390
lower class citizens to keep people in their place, right.

240
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:53.900
To make an example of what happens when you try to step outside of your class.

241
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:54.770
Now, at that point,

242
00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:57.530
we switched back over to this Ninja turtle and we get a little bit of history

243
00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:58.010
here.

244
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.240
What we ended up finding out that this guy is so called master of the foot clan,

245
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:03.200
as it exists today,

246
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:08.120
that he's basically a Corizon bastard son and the shredders grandson now who cry

247
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.630
is I have no idea, right? Ninja turtle fans. This is your time.

248
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.000
Teach me something. Right. Teach me something down in the comment section.

249
00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:16.760
Like it gets a typing, right? Teach me all that stuff. Um, I mean,

250
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:18.500
I guess I could look it up, but in all honesty,

251
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.770
sometimes I just don't like looking things up and I like asking you guys. Right.

252
00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:24.590
That's one of the things that I've learned from a discord server is that a lot

253
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:27.860
of you guys really just like teaching me stuff. Right. Like,

254
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.320
and I think that's kind of cool, right? To kind of sidetrack here for a second.

255
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.900
I'm going to be honest. I don't really see that as a lazy thing.

256
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.550
I see that as a cool thing,

257
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.310
because one of the things that you guys have always seemed to express interest

258
00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:39.890
in is as much as I've taught you guys about comics,

259
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.720
like about like Marvel and DC comics,

260
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:44.960
like you guys have wanted to teach me things about like other comic books,

261
00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:47.660
right? Like there's been times where I've gone into discord and be like,

262
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:50.390
Hey guys, can you guys teach me about like transformers and where to start?

263
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.370
You guys come out of the woodwork. Right?

264
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:55.540
Like you guys come of nowhere and just, and Louis was like, yeah, man, dude,

265
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:57.990
let me teach you day. I think I know about like, about transformers, right?

266
00:11:57.991 --> 00:12:00.960
Like you guys seem to love that kind of banter. So I like leaning into that.

267
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.111
Right.

268
00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:04.530
I like playing into that and giving you guys the chance to basically be heard

269
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.410
and to like teach me stuff. Right. You guys really seem to enjoy that.

270
00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:09.120
So nonetheless, you know, this guy,

271
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.640
as he makes his way into what is kind of like this upper-class and,

272
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:15.900
and seemingly what looks like this sort of point where he could actually enter

273
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.550
the tower proper, uh, you know,

274
00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:20.790
security is exactly what you would expect it to be. It's far more heightened,

275
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.400
right? You're talking about what it looks like, their police force, right?

276
00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:26.850
So you're talking about like arms and armament that are pretty significant,

277
00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:30.120
but this guy also draws a pretty logical conclusion and says, okay,

278
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.850
like I need to get a ride into this place because what they won't be,

279
00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:35.190
it won't be expecting is a direct attack.

280
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.610
They won't be expecting somebody to directly infiltrate their tower that,

281
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:42.120
that kind of combined with the fact that this is like military grade,

282
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.990
military grade equipment, things like that combined with our understanding of,

283
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.510
uh, of Hiroto basically seems to indicate that like,

284
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.850
no one's ever really made it this far. Right?

285
00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:53.520
So it's one thing they wouldn't expect that if there's some kind of an intruder

286
00:12:53.521 --> 00:12:55.920
out there, there would be put down hard and fast,

287
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:57.090
which is a kind of a great way,

288
00:12:57.091 --> 00:13:00.480
or at least seemingly a poignant way to show anybody else out there.

289
00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:03.900
If you try to rebel, we'll take care of you with a quickness. But what,

290
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:06.180
what you're dealing with here is a Ninja turtle, right?

291
00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:09.600
This is not some average, Joe. Who's just really fed up with their lot in life,

292
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.970
picks up a handgun and decides to take it to the man, right?

293
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.450
Like this is a guy who's trained in espionage, trained in ninjitsu,

294
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.720
trained to infiltrate, to strike hard and get out fast. Right.

295
00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:21.150
That's what this guy is trained to do. And so with that being the case,

296
00:13:21.151 --> 00:13:24.480
like literally every weapon that he has at his disposal comes into play.

297
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:27.090
Like he just bust into this place, right?

298
00:13:27.091 --> 00:13:31.260
Like head on straight attack and immediately goes to work on these guys and

299
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:33.750
notice this, this guy one man wrecking crew.

300
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:36.480
And it's kind of nuts to be honest, right?

301
00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:38.370
Like this guy's weapons are coming out of the woodwork. Right?

302
00:13:38.371 --> 00:13:41.430
So like his Ninja sized Houstonian smoke, bottlers, little, little explosives,

303
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.390
like literally taking these guys out super fast. The other part of this though,

304
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.780
is that unlike the guys, he fought on the street, these are more elite. Right.

305
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:51.000
They're more militarized. And so because of that,

306
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:53.010
these guys strike just as hard, right.

307
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.700
They are exceedingly fast and wildly capable. The funny thing about this though,

308
00:13:56.701 --> 00:14:00.090
is that this is a digital kind of looking at that and says like the machines do

309
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:02.820
all the fighting for this guy. Like that's kind of pathetic. Right.

310
00:14:02.821 --> 00:14:05.400
And it's very, very gutless. Like what kind of a person,

311
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:08.550
what kind of a leader who calls himself a master has no honor.

312
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:11.580
And has other people do his bidding for him. Right. Like, you know, what's,

313
00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:14.520
what's the idea behind that. Like, you can't simply come down here. Now,

314
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.490
the other part of this comes from us sort of transitioning back and forth

315
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:20.250
between Hurghada and this guy. And so, you know,

316
00:14:20.251 --> 00:14:22.620
in so far as Hiroto kind of looks at this and says like,

317
00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:25.200
why is this guy in my lower levels? Right? Like, you know,

318
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.040
you don't understand that I'm going to have his head on a pike before this day

319
00:14:29.041 --> 00:14:32.700
is over and keep sending all his various forces in. Now,

320
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.210
the funny thing about this is that once this guy appears on a camera,

321
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.000
then Hirono realizes this guy is a Ninja turtle. Right.

322
00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:42.270
So they're not supposed to exist seemingly right. They're supposed to be gone.

323
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.440
And so with that being the case,

324
00:14:43.441 --> 00:14:46.830
this guy's like every single member of the foot and bring them in. Right.

325
00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:50.070
So as most of you guys have figured out by now, this is all foot stuff, right.

326
00:14:50.071 --> 00:14:53.060
This city is ran by a guy who's the master of the foot.

327
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.480
And the foot are no longer just like ninjas who exist out there. I mean,

328
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:59.240
they are to a degree, but there seems to be a kind of blend that took place,

329
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.630
turning them all, basically into cyborgs, with varying levels of technology,

330
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:05.870
right? Like, you know, like, like street-level foot are basically cops,

331
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.420
the more advanced ones are military, that kind of a thing.

332
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.850
And we'll see even more advanced ones than these guys,

333
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.910
but it's kind of nuts here because you end up seeing, of course the sky ticking,

334
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.760
each one of these guys out, right. Taking each one of these guys on,

335
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.330
and then he ends up coming across what are basically the elite Ninja foot clamp,

336
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.870
right? These are these elite soldiers who he takes out with a quickness as well.

337
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.290
Right. I mean, there's not really much in the way of, of a battle going on here.

338
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:31.310
I mean, in the span of, of like six panels, like it's not even six pages,

339
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.840
six panels, right.

340
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.310
It's like foot and the neck and then like overcome this guy and then stab him

341
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.590
through the chest and then cut a guy's arm off and then cut it.

342
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:42.620
Like literally just chopping these guys down piece by piece,

343
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.810
taking these guys down bit by bit.

344
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.540
And then it turns into activate the Stockman tech.

345
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.910
Now I have no idea what the Stockman tech is,

346
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.330
but I don't know what that references. I, I see like, okay, here's a,

347
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:55.640
here's one thing to understand about comics guys and comic books.

348
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.870
Whenever you see a word or a name that's in bold, it's a reference to something.

349
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.300
And I feel like those of you guys out there who know what this is,

350
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:07.310
are just like, just like, this is amazing. You guys like, this is amazing.

351
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.160
This is awesome. Like it's, it's, it's, it's kinda cool.

352
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:14.480
Like if I'm being honest, I'm super excited to read your comments. Well,

353
00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:18.590
the other thing about that is that this guy keeps calling out Hiroto right.

354
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:20.960
He keeps calling him out, like, come and face me. Right? Like,

355
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.930
like your destiny is at hand, come and face me here.

356
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.620
The problem with this is that this guy keeps sending his own robots. Right.

357
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:30.620
And so what he ends up doing is by sending out the stockmen to, Oh,

358
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.190
wait a minute. Stockman was the fly guy. Wasn't he? He was the fly dude from,

359
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:37.700
from the cartoon shows back in the day. Yeah. John saw he was not John sock.

360
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.540
When I was talking with him,

361
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.210
he was the guy who was like part fly or something like that. I don't remember.

362
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.760
I remember there was a Ninja turtles movie back in the day and maybe it,

363
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.760
I don't remember how we explained how we got bebop and Rocksteady,

364
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.800
which I'm kind of sad to see. They're not here to be honest.

365
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.240
I miss bebop and Rocksteady.

366
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.660
<v 2>Hey boss, this, this food sucks, boss.</v>

367
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.560
<v 1>Terrible Bosch rudder. You get beat all the time. But nonetheless,</v>

368
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.070
I kind of miss bebop and Rocksteady, right? They were, they were kind of funny.

369
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.360
But nonetheless like this, this guy,

370
00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:07.450
he ends up throwing out like an EMP takes care of the small ones with the big

371
00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:09.280
ones. He kind of goes in for a direct attack.

372
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.080
And that's where he gets tripped up.

373
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.690
Because what ends up happening is this guy just is running at him,

374
00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:17.800
full speed dives at him. And he can't slow their momentum. Right? And so Lou,

375
00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:20.980
they both go crashing through a window and this guy goes falling, right?

376
00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:24.040
Falling, falling, falling, falling, and then smashes into the ground.

377
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:27.850
Now he does survive it, but just barely this guy's bleeding out of the mouth.

378
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.500
He's like Geraldo, like you're a coward,

379
00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:32.650
having your guys do your business for you. Like this is, this is ridiculous.

380
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.950
And starts calling him out right? Saying like this was not done yet. You know,

381
00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:38.800
like everything in my body feels broken. Somehow I'm still alive.

382
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.560
And then suddenly these guys start showing up these police, you know,

383
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.050
more or less are showing up and saying like everybody disperse, right.

384
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:47.440
Everybody get out of here. But people are dispersing. People are curious. Right.

385
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:50.700
And their curiosity, they stick around and kind of watch what happens.

386
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.160
And that's when they're like lethal force authorized. And they're like,

387
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.810
we're going to start killing you if you don't leave.

388
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:57.030
And so basically this girl Jones says, Hey, ah,

389
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.740
the guy you're looking for went that way.

390
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:00.480
And since these guys in the wrong direction,

391
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.300
and then she basically ends up following this kind of trail of blood into a

392
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:06.660
sewer main. But now once he gets down to the sewer main, you kind of have this,

393
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:10.550
this interesting situation where you have her following this Ninja turtle,

394
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.600
right. Through all this, you know,

395
00:18:11.601 --> 00:18:14.960
eventually located and then realizing it's a Ninja turtle, right?

396
00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:18.050
Like realizing, Oh my God. Now, before she finds him, what you will,

397
00:18:18.051 --> 00:18:21.680
what you get is this guy basically kind of taking his, digging his garb off.

398
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.231
Right. And,

399
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:26.120
and literally like pulling his weapons out and then seemingly coming to terms

400
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.790
with where he's at, right? The other Ninja turtles talking to him and saying,

401
00:18:28.791 --> 00:18:32.150
dude like, you don't have to do this. And he's like, stop no more talking.

402
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.460
Like if I'm going to end this, I'm going to end it on my terms. Right.

403
00:18:34.461 --> 00:18:37.340
For my family, for my honor, he seems to more or less accepted,

404
00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:40.100
he's been soundly defeated. And so what he ends up doing, and this is,

405
00:18:40.101 --> 00:18:41.390
what's crazy about this. And you know,

406
00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:43.580
what he ends up doing is taking all the eye,

407
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.550
all the eye bands of the Ninja turtles in laying them down. Right.

408
00:18:46.551 --> 00:18:49.850
So like Leonardo Raphael, Donna Tam, Donald telos, and Michael Andrew.

409
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:51.950
And so the initial thought was, okay,

410
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:54.410
this guy is a wholly different Ninja turtle, right? Like this guy,

411
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.930
isn't even one of the original Ninja turtles. He's a wholly different guy,

412
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.090
which seems kind of crazy, you know? And then he says like,

413
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.090
I miss my brothers so much. And this is cool because if this,

414
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.750
if this gives us the idea that it is a wholly different Ninja turtle,

415
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.670
this is not related to any of the other four.

416
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.040
Then my question immediately becomes, where did he come from?

417
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.490
Why have we never heard of him? And what is this dude's origin story, right.

418
00:19:13.491 --> 00:19:16.220
Like that's kind of nuts. And then he goes, as far as to say, I miss my father,

419
00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:17.300
right. So I miss splinter.

420
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.720
And so he lays down all their personal belongings and seemingly in a kind of

421
00:19:20.721 --> 00:19:23.360
tribute offers some, some measure of a prayer to them.

422
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.480
And then he in turn intends to commit to Sepracor right.

423
00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:27.830
To basically commit suicide.

424
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.920
And so where he initially goes to try to stop by themselves, he says, no,

425
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.970
I can't do that. I can't do it. Not yet. Not like this, my, it was not complete.

426
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.910
And so we basically ended up passing out and that's when this girl realizes,

427
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.520
Oh my God is a Ninja turtle. Right. So from that point,

428
00:19:40.521 --> 00:19:42.620
this guy's vital signs seem to go flat. Right.

429
00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:44.450
So he seems to just kind of die more or less.

430
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:46.910
It kind of seems to be the case or the very least kind of pass out. Right.

431
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.200
His vitals super weak.

432
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.590
And then he wakes up in this bed and he's surrounded all the other Ninja

433
00:19:51.591 --> 00:19:53.990
turtles. Right. He's surrounded by like everybody right else.

434
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.470
And it's kind of nuts because we're still not told who this guy is and said,

435
00:19:57.471 --> 00:20:00.110
he's kind of like, like where, where are we at? Like, you know, when,

436
00:20:00.111 --> 00:20:01.910
when the guys wake them up, they're like, you know, we got things to do.

437
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.070
He's like, where like, like where are we at man? Like,

438
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.410
like somebody crashes a men truck into my school. Right.

439
00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:09.740
And it's the kind of banter that we're used to with the Ninja turtles. Right.

440
00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:13.310
This kind of brotherly conversation between these four guys. And so again,

441
00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:16.370
this guy looks like he is one of the original, original India turtles. Right.

442
00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:19.340
So it kind of destroys that theory right off the bat that he's kind of a missing

443
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:21.650
one that we didn't really know anything about or something along those lines.

444
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.110
He's like, he's like, is this the old sewer? And they're like, yeah, man.

445
00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:25.670
I mean, what did you think you were in the Ritz? Like,

446
00:20:25.671 --> 00:20:27.380
we're gonna do the turtles, man. We operate in the sewer.

447
00:20:27.381 --> 00:20:32.180
Like we've always been broke. We've never had money, man. Like, come on man.

448
00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:34.870
Like, we've always been the guys away, ramen noodles and pizza, like these,

449
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.150
like that's, that's kind of what it is. Right. And so finally he wakes up,

450
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.040
right? Like somebody says like, thank God you're up.

451
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.820
And this guy snaps up only to be met by the arrival of April O'Neill and it's

452
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:47.500
like, Holy cow, like April O'Neil's here. Right. And he's like, it really,

453
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.850
you she's like, yeah, it's me, you know?

454
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:52.120
And I'm relieved to see that you're awake, but like who were you talking to?

455
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.090
And she calls him Michael Angelo. And so it's official.

456
00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.010
The last surviving Ninja turtle is none other than Michelangelo will that being

457
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:01.690
said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

458
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.460
