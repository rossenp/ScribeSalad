4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.630
All right. What's.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.141
<v 1>Hold on guys.</v>

6
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:16.010
This is Rob and we are back with the King in black from Marvel comics.

7
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:17.360
Something that I do want to clarify though.

8
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.840
I was incorrect in the first King and black video that I made that it was simply

9
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:23.510
just a one-shot the reading order I'd looked at before.

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.390
It did not show King and black parts two through five.

11
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.880
So I thought it was simply just a one-shot opening comic.

12
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:29.780
And that was basically it,

13
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.020
it turns out the King and black is an actual main series, right?

14
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:35.720
So his issues one through five, a King of black, one through five,

15
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.480
and then a whole bunch of tie-ins for it. So I do want to correct that. Um,

16
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.710
I was, I was incorrect about that.

17
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:41.900
A lot of the guys pointed that out in the comments. So thank you for that.

18
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.080
I would not have known had you guys not mentioned it, but, uh,

19
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.780
but this one kind of opens up. This is the venom tie-in right.

20
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.680
This one opens up basically with Eddie Brock kind of falling to his death at the

21
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.060
end of the first King of black story,

22
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.400
when Noel just stripped him of his symbiont and then dropped him.

23
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.430
But what this does is it initially starts out with Rick Strickland.

24
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.510
Now Rick Strickland was the first of the individuals out there to be bonded to

25
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:06.350
the Grendel. Right? So just kind of a reminder of the timeline here. Um, if we,

26
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:09.710
if we go on the way things used to be before Donnie Cade's venom run,

27
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.280
all you had was a venom Symia Davon into Eddie Brock over the years,

28
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.960
a lot has been done to change things.

29
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.170
And Donnie Cates has introduced a lot of information that we didn't previously

30
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.390
have. And what Donnie Cates introduced was the character of Knoll who,

31
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.011
by this point,

32
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:24.710
you guys should know as kind of the guy who created the symbionts,

33
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.430
but then also the Grendel and the Grendel was kind of a step above your regular

34
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.100
Simeon, right? So you have like the one that bonds to Eddie Brock,

35
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:31.970
which makes him venom,

36
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.730
or like the current symbiont that bonds to Cletus Cassidy,

37
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.380
which makes them carnage so on and so forth.

38
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.210
The Grinnell is kind of a step above that, right?

39
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:39.560
So if there were a hierarchy here,

40
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.890
he be between venom and like Knoll or something along those lines.

41
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.731
And even with a mat,

42
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:47.000
you have your own little hierarchy in so far as like where the venom symbionts

43
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.890
rank. And we might create a video like that, right?

44
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:52.010
Like ranking the venom Cypriots from strongest to weakest. But, uh,

45
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.850
but the idea is that Rex Strickland and his team were basically bonded to what

46
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:59.060
was the Grindle Symbion. So they were a little more powerful than venom.

47
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.840
Normally is there was a point where really in the beginning of Donnie Cates,

48
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.400
Ron, when he first started on venom,

49
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.700
where Eddie was contacted by Rex Strickland and then sent on a mission.

50
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.000
Now we ended up learning that Rex had actually bonded or really the simulated

51
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.150
had kind of replaced Rex after Rexha died. So he's kind of a walking,

52
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:17.090
talking symbiotic, but Eddie was still on a mission to basically save, you know,

53
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:19.040
those guys who were out there, those other symbionts,

54
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.340
what we never really saw was what was going on in the background while Eddie was

55
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.870
doing that involving Rex.

56
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.470
And what Rex really does is he kind of talks about the nature of Eddie. Now,

57
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.430
this is important because this kind of monologue that Rick Strickland offers in

58
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:35.870
the form of a diary entry kind of overlays everything that we see going on in

59
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:36.860
this comic. Right?

60
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.040
And so one of the things that he sort of hits out here is that sending Eddie on

61
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:44.390
this mission was almost as much of a test as it was just the need for help.

62
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.600
And the reason why the test aspect came in is because with Rick Strickland and

63
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.720
his Grendel, he became aware of the nature of Knoll Knoll's existence,

64
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.840
the power he possessed, and the fact that no would return to earth one day.

65
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.120
And so looking at that, it was kind of like, okay,

66
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.010
if Eddie can't do something as simple as like face off against Grendel's and

67
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.390
basically stop them, uh,

68
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.690
then what hope could he possibly have against somebody like, Nope,

69
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.010
but as you saw with kind of talking about, uh,

70
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.690
Eddie Brock him and so on and so forth,

71
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.570
one of the things that he talks about is flash Thompson, his agent venom,

72
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.650
and the flash Thompson,

73
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:16.980
his agent venom was a far more effective venom than Eddie Brock was.

74
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.100
Now a lot of that was because of the military training and history that flash

75
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:20.820
Thompson had.

76
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.970
And the fact that he was basically a government sanctioned symbiont kind of

77
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.700
operating out there doing his own thing, but he was a lot more effective.

78
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.540
He understood the necessity of nuance. He understood, uh, getting in there and,

79
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.050
and kind of practicing espionage, stealth tactics, different things like that.

80
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:37.830
He's not like Eddie, Eddie is a guy who just goes running in guns blazing,

81
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:40.770
right. Even if he doesn't need to. And even when he shouldn't, it's all,

82
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:41.670
he really knows, right.

83
00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:44.640
He's just kind of a blunt object just attacking whatever's in front of him.

84
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.310
That's why a lot of fans really liked flash Thompson,

85
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.200
his agent venom more than that Eddie Brock,

86
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.830
because you got to see somebody use the venom Symbion in a way that you normally

87
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:53.670
never really see,

88
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.820
which is why I say we should probably cover that story if for no other reason

89
00:03:56.821 --> 00:04:00.330
than the fact that it could kind of permeate and attach itself to this story

90
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:02.280
kind of bookend and show us how the other, you know,

91
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:05.990
how the Semites can be used. But at the end of the day, uh, Rex kind of, he,

92
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:07.740
he hopes the best for Eddie Brock,

93
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.860
but he's not a hundred percent sure that Eddie Brock can really even succeed

94
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.540
because looking at everything that's going on,

95
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.030
individuals possessed by the Grendel Symbian and all that kind of stuff.

96
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.700
The return of North, his fear is that Eddie will fail, right.

97
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.830
Will feel to rise to this occasion. And in the end,

98
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.600
he'll end up dying just like everybody else.

99
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.660
And that's kind of the thing that we get here because we transition to the

100
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:27.900
moment when Knoll drops Eddie Brock and with a quickness,

101
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.180
Eddie was taken over exceedingly fast.

102
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.480
And that's one of the big struggles that we're kind of left to solve here with

103
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.100
regards to the King and black story,

104
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.490
because what you're talking about is a being so astronomically powerful.

105
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.570
He was able to overtake the overtake, the Celestials that's no small feat,

106
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.780
right? Being able to run up on a celestial, being these guys create like,

107
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.620
you know, life,

108
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.940
they create stars and galaxies they're on par with Galactus in terms of power.

109
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.380
And so being able to subjugate a multitude of Celestials is not a small thing

110
00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:58.440
here. So then you have like Eddie Brock with a venom Symbion and it's,

111
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.131
it's kind of like,

112
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.040
how could he possibly what we hope to stand against Knoll in the first place?

113
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.800
And that's the first thing that, and Kate showed us, right? No,

114
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.890
rip the Simeon off of Eddie Brock dropped Eddie Brock to his death.

115
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.530
And the semi had actually begs and pleats, right? As like, no,

116
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.110
like do not take me from Eddie. He absolutely needs me.

117
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.650
This is really one of the best developments that came from the work of Donnie

118
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.980
Cates.

119
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.560
And even some of the people that came before him with regards to the venom

120
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:23.550
stories is it gave the venom Symbion more humanity instead of it just being the

121
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.570
symbol, the bonnet into Eddie Brock. And it was off the Spiderman, rejected it,

122
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.710
going to get revenge by doing bad things.

123
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.690
And then eventually teamed up with Spider-Man to fight carnage.

124
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.230
Instead of something like that, the venom Simeon, she has a mind of its own.

125
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:37.710
It has desires. It has ambition. It wants to stay a good guy.

126
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.890
It doesn't want to be real kind of envelope into the fold of,

127
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.560
of Knoll and kind of take into a place of subservience.

128
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.040
It wants to keep being a good guy alongside Eddie. And that's cool.

129
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.930
That's a really, really amazing concept,

130
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:52.830
but ultimately the venom Symbion is seemingly absorbed by Knoll back into his

131
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:56.190
essence. And then in turn, Eddie is just kind of left to fall to his death.

132
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.240
Now this is probably of the most beautiful moments of this story, right?

133
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.000
And this is why Donnie Cates smashes it when it comes to his,

134
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.890
his handling of venom. So here's the thing. This is,

135
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:06.170
this is what's so cool about this stories like this.

136
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.230
These are the kind of stories that we reference when we do character explanation

137
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.560
videos or something like that, about how like a character is totally reworked.

138
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.600
So like when we talked about Magneto, for example,

139
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.820
we talked about how like with uncanny X-Men issue,

140
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:19.730
number 200 Magneto totally changed and became a good guy.

141
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.360
This is the equivalent of that. It's a little long,

142
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.100
a little more long form and so forth.

143
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.460
The transition of Eddie Brock becoming a good guy is certainly, you know,

144
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.980
happened a lot longer than the transition of Magneto,

145
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.600
but the principle is still the same, right?

146
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.520
If in 10 years we do a video kind of an updated video on venom explained,

147
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.650
we'll reference this, right? And we'll say like,

148
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.270
once Donnie Cates took over the title,

149
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.990
he totally changed up Eddie Brock and the venom symbiont and kind of revamped

150
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.270
them into a whole new format and so on and so forth.

151
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.860
This is what we're talking about here, right?

152
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:50.320
So you guys are kind of seeing this happen in real time,

153
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.700
but for Eddie Brock himself,

154
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.760
he kind of looks at this and literally starts to pray.

155
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.160
And that's something that we don't really see of Eddie because Eddie's not an

156
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.510
overly religious man. And just kind of says, look like, you know, I I'm,

157
00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:02.740
I'm praying to whatever God is up there listening.

158
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.470
I'm not really worried about me. I'm probably just gonna fall to my death.

159
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.100
This'll be the end. But, but what I'm asking here is that you do not,

160
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:13.120
that you basically keep an eye on my kid, right? Make sure my son is okay,

161
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.690
that Dylan does not deserve to inherit my darkness, right? This,

162
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:20.110
this kind of horrific circumstance that I've been living in my entire life,

163
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.650
this desire for revenge and all this anger and wrath that I've been filled with

164
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.560
over the course of my life, right? This thing that's dominated me, right? This,

165
00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:28.810
this thing has controlled every waking hour, you know,

166
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:31.900
everything that makes me who I am, do not let my son inherit. Now,

167
00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:34.990
one thing that I do want to point out pretty much everything from the time that

168
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:36.400
Knoll drops Eddie Brock,

169
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.790
until we get to the end of this comic happens in the span of 32 seconds,

170
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.300
32 seconds. And that's all you get. And I love stories like that, right?

171
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:46.540
Where like all these things happen in the, in the span of 32 seconds. Well,

172
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.440
Eddie Brock's falling to his death. These symbionts of no, or are dirt, dirt,

173
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.080
they're getting to work, right? Like they're attacking New York. Uh,

174
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:55.750
the Avengers are all being just kind of taken over by, uh,

175
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.300
by the symbionts right. Spiderman is doing what he can captain.

176
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.610
America's doing what he can, but they're literally fighting a living army of,

177
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.900
of beings through almost kind of like a walking, talking liquid. It's,

178
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.760
it's very difficult to overcome that.

179
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.510
Especially when they're empowered by a guy who's a multi-vessel force of power,

180
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:13.900
right? It's not a simple thing. And so as any rock continues to fall,

181
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:17.350
he begins to realize the entirety of New York is basically lost. Right?

182
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:19.960
It's it's essentially conquered. Now, from there, you switch over to Dylan,

183
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.900
right? Again, this is still in the span of this 32 seconds.

184
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.940
You switch over to Dylan and Dylan, you know,

185
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:29.170
kind of has a radio of sorts and manages to Hijacker or somehow attach himself

186
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:31.570
to the frequency that Ironman and all the offenders are wrong.

187
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.030
And iron man is kinda like how in the world did you possibly get this? You know,

188
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.070
he's like, well, I got it from some person Spider-Man, you know,

189
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:38.530
he gets off with Spider-Man because he thinks he's the one that gave it to

190
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:41.650
Dylan. But, but at the end of the day, iron man's like, look,

191
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.870
you got to keep this radio channel clear, right?

192
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:45.910
Like this is how the vendors are talking to each other.

193
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:48.610
We need to know what's going on. We can't have some kid, you know,

194
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:51.400
hijacking the airways, wanting to know what happened to his death. You know,

195
00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:53.710
we've got it under control. We're doing the best we can here.

196
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.710
If you've got a TV watch instead,

197
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.880
and then cuts off Dylan and Dylan starts to get off. Because when that happens,

198
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:01.890
he literally tries to reach out with his, uh,

199
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.830
with his ability to tap into knowledge and kind of see what's happening.

200
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.650
But then the actual venom Simeot itself, which is still part of no,

201
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.190
actually pushes out Dylan and says, no, you cannot access this.

202
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.670
You cannot access. No, if you access, no, he'll know where you are. Right.

203
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.160
You'll figure out where, where it is that you're at and he'll come for you.

204
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.630
Right. So not like get out of the brain of Knoll and just forefoot,

205
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.850
forcefully objects, him and the, you know, for, for Dylan's part,

206
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.320
when he was talking to the Symbian,

207
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.290
he felt fear when he felt fear and absolute panic.

208
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.230
And that's when he's kind of like, you know, my son, my connection was severed.

209
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.630
What did they not like? What didn't it want me to see?

210
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.620
And that's when he looks up at the TV and he sees no ripping off the Symbian of

211
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:40.440
Eddie Brock. Now, of course, he's seeing this after it's already happened,

212
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.380
but he's seeing like the symbiont being ripped off Eddie and then Eddie being

213
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:46.110
thrown to his death. And so as Eddie continues to fall,

214
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.530
there's actually a helicopter. This trying to outrun one of these giant,

215
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.140
you know, these, these Grindle's right. One of these giant, uh, you know,

216
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.780
Symbian bats, whatever you want to call them, send me a dragons.

217
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.330
Eddie kind of warns them. Like you can't out fly this thing, right?

218
00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:58.500
Like you've got to just,

219
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.620
you literally have to land somewhere and just run for your life.

220
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.640
But by that point,

221
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:05.520
the dragon gets a hold of the hold of the helicopter helicopter basically ends

222
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:09.840
up crashing down and then Eddie kind of cottony explosion gets, gets set flying.

223
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.231
Now,

224
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:13.830
the funny thing about this is that the very fact that he was sent flying through

225
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:15.600
here starts bouncing off these, you know,

226
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:17.220
the kind of walls and things like that.

227
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.210
It's probably broken every single bone in his body, or at least most of them,

228
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.270
but he'll survive. And the reason why is because he goes crash,

229
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.660
landing on new a car, which is covered in symbiotic goo.

230
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.730
But with that being said, guys, that's where it ends this massive cliff hanger.

231
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.560
Uh, if you guys are new here to come and explain,

232
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.870
