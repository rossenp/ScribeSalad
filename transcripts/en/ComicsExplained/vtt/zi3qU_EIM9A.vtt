4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.270
What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.660
<v 1>And we are picking back up again with a one shot from the Avengers comics from</v>

6
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:19.040
Jason, Aaron. This is the,

7
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.860
I guess kind of like the prologue is what it's called from. Enter the Phoenix.

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.070
Enter the Phoenix is the current ongoing story in our vendors right now,

9
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:27.440
where does not covering or wait until it's done and then we'll cover the whole

10
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:28.790
thing, but this is kind of intriguing.

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.710
And the reason why is because I don't really know how I feel about this kind of

12
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:35.570
change as being introduced here. And really,

13
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.880
I'm not even really sure how I feel about the whole idea of the Phoenix.

14
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:39.200
And then I'll explain why here in a minute.

15
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.470
But the important thing about this is that this initially picks up with the

16
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.650
woman who would become the first host of the Phoenix force on earth 1 million

17
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.590
years ago, basically kind of like in this, this kind of fire pit, right?

18
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.810
Not necessarily a pit that's actually like on fire,

19
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.730
but like the burnt place is what she calls it.

20
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:56.210
And the idea behind this is that like a lot of early tribes and a lot of early

21
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:59.960
history and humanity because humanity in its early days was basically stupid.

22
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:03.650
Whenever you had beings that looked different or seem different,

23
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.360
they would abandoned them there. And this instance,

24
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.240
this little girl was abandoned in this place because she had red hair and

25
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.400
presumably they considered it an ill omen.

26
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.350
And the result was that they just kind of left her, you know,

27
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:13.940
left her in this location. Of course, again,

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.040
kind of only something that a stupid person would really do.

29
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.140
But the idea is that you have these,

30
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.200
these kind of vultures that seemingly show up with the intention of consuming

31
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:22.070
her. And then of course,

32
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.820
Wolf show up and then basically saver following that she's actually raised by

33
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:29.000
wolves. Quite literally. She's raised by Wolf. She's a feral human being,

34
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.020
but it's kind of cool, right? While she's with Wolf, she learns to hunt.

35
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.920
She learns to track.

36
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.980
She learns all of these important things on how to survive out there in the

37
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:39.260
wilderness and to do what she needs to do in order to make it.

38
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.400
But every so often she would return back to the birth place to try to save

39
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:44.450
individuals. She could,

40
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.730
if there were people who were left there or something along those lines,

41
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.430
and in one instance where she stumbled across the baby, that was there,

42
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.151
she threw a rocket.

43
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.150
One of the bowsers chased them away only for us to realize it's basically a

44
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.100
psych pops us here. Now in that moment,

45
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.070
she kind of receives this telepathic message from a being that tells her,

46
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:02.060
like don't be afraid and then kind of escorts her back to effectively a safe

47
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.730
place. Now this individual is never actually given, uh,

48
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.800
never really given a name here instead.

49
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:10.880
He's very much presented to us as a kind of Charles Xavier character, right?

50
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.250
This guy who basically, you know, kind of existed, you know,

51
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:15.890
1 million years ago when mutants were first starting to pop up.

52
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.290
And then the result was that he kind of grabbed them and then took them,

53
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.620
brought them this location and just kind of helped them to learn how to harness

54
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:22.640
and use their powers. Now,

55
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.820
this is where things are changing a lot over the course of, of Marvel comics,

56
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.500
really with Jason, Aaron, and the Avengers,

57
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.710
specifically with the idea of Newtons and the reason why is because when you,

58
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.700
whenever you go through the history of the mutant population and Marvel comics,

59
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.410
what you have here is you have, uh,

60
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.640
have a woman by the name of saline and saline was born about 10,000 years. Uh,

61
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.911
well,

62
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:44.540
really about 17,000 years ago during the high Borean age and is by and large

63
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:46.740
considered to be the first meeting to exist,

64
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.760
which is to say a person who had a gene that activated and then in turn gave her

65
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.660
powers. Now, the idea is that with saline, she's technically an external, um,

66
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.450
basically meaning that she has to, she's essentially a mortal,

67
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.940
but then the important thing to understand is that in Marvel,

68
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.020
whether you look at, uh, look at saline, you look at proton mutants.

69
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.030
So people like Gabriel Shepherd, whatever the case is,

70
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.160
Munis did not exist before 10,000 years ago. There are things like the,

71
00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:09.550
the Serafin and CI RFM,

72
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.950
but they're largely considered to be extra dimensional beings, right?

73
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:13.900
I guess they're kind of mutans, but not really.

74
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.900
But traditional mutants were just to say somebody who's gene manifests when

75
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.840
they, when they become a teenager, whether through stress or through puberty,

76
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.760
they didn't exist before 10,000 years ago.

77
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.980
This is Jason Aaron kind of making it,

78
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.480
making it up and saying actually they did.

79
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.270
But the idea here is that with her being in this location,

80
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.150
it basically gives her the ability to live among her own time, right?

81
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.600
People who have powers now, we're not explicitly told this girl has powers,

82
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.930
but this really seems to come into play when she starts getting these headaches.

83
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:40.420
Now at 10 years old, this is when her body starts changing.

84
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.570
And that's usually around the time when mutant powers will slowly begin to kind

85
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:47.170
of manifest right where the mutant gene will activate somewhere in that time

86
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:49.330
period. Usually between the ages of like 10, 11,

87
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.250
all the way up to like 14 or 15 years old, right?

88
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.440
Doing that point when the body begins to change,

89
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.210
that's when the meat and gene begins to activate.

90
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.570
And so with that being the case, basically she ends up developing telepathy,

91
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.810
but this telepathy comes by way of her, not really understanding what it is,

92
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.270
but only picking up on the emotional, I guess,

93
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.690
the emotional state of individuals who were coming for them with the intention

94
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:08.471
of killing them. Now,

95
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:11.620
the people who are coming for them are the ones who are basically leaving babies

96
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.850
in that burnt place. Right.

97
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.460
Let's just leaving on in that location because there were two strains,

98
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.930
there were two different that kind of a thing.

99
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.610
And that's kind of what's going on here. Why they,

100
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:21.400
they discovered that there's this group here that's just different and they just

101
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.040
kind of want to kill them. Right? So basically the 1 million year ago,

102
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.430
version of what's going on right now in Marvel comics with regards to the mutant

103
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.181
population, right?

104
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:31.570
So basically Cubans have been hunting for at least a million years is basically

105
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.100
what Jason Aaron's telling us now with this guy who kind of shows up you're East

106
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.980
called the high Walker.

107
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.110
That's kind of the leader of the Charles Xavier S character.

108
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.940
That's the only real name we're given for him.

109
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.940
He initially tries to use peace and kindness and so on and so forth,

110
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.140
but it doesn't really work what,

111
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:47.470
instead like their fear begins to override their senses and where you end up

112
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.400
having this young girl who basically begins to realize this is telepathy.

113
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.660
That she's, that she's kind of, uh,

114
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.890
she's basically activating and sorta gets sort of angry and irritated and off,

115
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.250
and doesn't really want to leave. It leads to high Walker,

116
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.410
basically being exposed for a brief moment, only for him to be killed.

117
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.770
And that leads the other mutants jumping in and basically going in, you know,

118
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.050
getting into a fight with all the different humans and all the groups,

119
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.441
basically, you know,

120
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.590
both groups slaughtering each other to the point that this little girl is the

121
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:13.420
only one left. She's the only one left.

122
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:15.460
But for her kind of going forward from here,

123
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.310
she realizes that she basically has telepathy right now.

124
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:21.190
She doesn't quite know what to call it. She's not really sure what it is.

125
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.130
She's somebody just knows.

126
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.030
She can communicate with her mind and pick up on the feelings of others,

127
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.080
the revelation and the realization of what she has and what she's capable of.

128
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.480
Doesn't really come until some future period.

129
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:34.540
When she basically goes back to the burn place to kind of sacrifice herself to

130
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:37.810
the vultures. And then in turn, it's possessed by the Phoenix force.

131
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:41.260
Now this is where I'm not really big on this great, big, huge change.

132
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.020
Not necessarily because I'm against change,

133
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.010
but I'm not one of those common book fans. And just doesn't like it.

134
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.710
When things change, I'm a reading for 20 something years. Believe me,

135
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.210
I'm aware that comics change.

136
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.280
What really kind of baffles me here is it really seems to fly in the face of

137
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.100
everything that made the dark Phoenix saga, what it was the whole,

138
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.580
the whole idea behind the dark Phoenix saga in Marvel comics in the eighties,

139
00:06:00.581 --> 00:06:02.980
when Claremont wrote it, agent was common answer to the question.

140
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.840
What happens if some sort of primordial cosmic entity that's never really known

141
00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:10.630
hatred or anger bonds itself to a human being,

142
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.380
how do they kind of cope in that situation? Jean Gray, basically, you know,

143
00:06:14.381 --> 00:06:16.090
really the Phoenix force becoming Jean Gray,

144
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:18.790
which is revealed to the end of the dark Phoenix saga. But, but Jean Gray,

145
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:21.100
you know, being a host for the Phoenix or however you want to slice it,

146
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.490
introduce the Phoenix force to emotions that had never experienced before,

147
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.190
right? Lust, anger, wrath, different things like that.

148
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.050
And the Phoenix didn't really know how to handle it.

149
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.060
And so it basically went insane. Now there are,

150
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:35.230
there have been instances past where the Phoenix has encountered living beams

151
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.140
and Excalibur volume, one issues 42 through 50.

152
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:41.560
I think it was that kind of introduced the idea of like net chrom and fare on

153
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.980
and those guys and how like nut basically tricked the Phoenix and to like

154
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:46.960
creating all these different pillars and things like that.

155
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:49.270
But the Phoenix wasn't actually bonded to a person instead.

156
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:52.270
It was the Phoenix being manipulated into doing a thing. But for the most part,

157
00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:54.610
the Phoenix just kind of existed in isolation in space.

158
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.690
And so having an instance where the Phoenix bonds to a young girl here and then

159
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.330
learns all these emotions really kind of [inaudible] question,

160
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.180
did the Phoenix forget when it got to,

161
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.620
when it got to the Phoenix to the dark Phoenix saga, you know,

162
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:08.170
a million years of memories of just kind of forgot what happened, right? I mean,

163
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:11.380
I have a hard time believing that a cosmic entity could forget something like

164
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.170
Ali G when I put my phone, you know, it, it doesn't really work that way.

165
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.420
I'm by no means railing against this.

166
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.180
It's just one of these things where I'm trying to find a way to consolidate and

167
00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:22.150
reconcile these two columns. And it doesn't really seem to be a way to do it.

168
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.270
But the idea behind this is that with this girl being possessed by the Phoenix,

169
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.410
that initially rage and vengeance are really what overtake her right rage and

170
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:31.540
vengeance against like these baseline humans, right?

171
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.930
These normal humans out there that are basically governed by fear that the human

172
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:37.750
race, because in its earliest days was governed by fear.

173
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.930
It would forever more be governed by fear. And in truth,

174
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.180
that's actually an honest way to look at it, right?

175
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:45.400
That despite human sentience and things like that,

176
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.670
the most primal basic emotion of humanity is fear.

177
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.060
And times of desperation and times of fear and times of doubt,

178
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.010
people will believe what they want to believe,

179
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.300
even if it doesn't make any sense,

180
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.910
just because of the fact that it gives them some measure of comfort, right?

181
00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:01.300
Humans are always kind of fleeing and trying to find some measure of comfort

182
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.380
regardless of how it may be.

183
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.340
But the important thing is that what she sees here in the base level of humanity

184
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.970
and kind of looking out into the future of what, of what a weight's humanity is,

185
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.370
it's always going to be the same thing, right? Like this,

186
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:16.360
this fear of things they don't understand is going to govern the very nature of

187
00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:17.800
humanity from now going forward,

188
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.920
as she ponders the idea of just wiping it all away, right?

189
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.000
I've literally just wiping out the entirety of the earth of ending all life on

190
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.310
the planet and then just kind of letting it start over, right?

191
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:29.050
Because that's kind of what the Phoenix force stops.

192
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.960
The Phoenix force gets rid of things that don't work, why it does that.

193
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.090
I don't know. It's an answer grant Morrison gave us.

194
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:36.670
And it's one that Marvel never bothered to clarify. So that's it,

195
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.290
that's the only real response that we get.

196
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.970
But the end result of her really ending the entirety of humanity comes by way

197
00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:45.580
of one of the wolves, right? Which basically looks her hand.

198
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.560
And in that moment she kind of experiences,

199
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:49.690
it kind of brings her back to an era of kindness, right?

200
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.330
Where these wolves could have killed her instead, they took her to race.

201
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.620
And so it's kind of interesting because animals are cool people or are really

202
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:58.950
cool humans suck like that. That's kind of the perspective she gives us.

203
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.990
PETA would absolutely love this girl.

204
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.100
But the important thing here is that she really kind of backs away, right?

205
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:07.890
She moves away from this concept. And so at some point in the future,

206
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:11.040
we're not really given a definitive timeframe that the Phoenix just age this

207
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.140
girl up to basically, you know, basically adulthood,

208
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.940
but she ends up traveling directly to Asgard.

209
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.030
And one of the funniest things that we get is that you have Odin trying to lift

210
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.440
the hammer mule near what you can do,

211
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.860
because this happens after he put the sentience storm inside the hammer.

212
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.770
So the hammer now has a will of its own and just doesn't want to be lifted by

213
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.600
Odin. And so we're all as it's happening.

214
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.780
Something the Phoenix force shows up here and starts laying waste to all the

215
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:34.740
forces of the, of the as guardians. And when it busts into where Odin's at,

216
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.320
the Phoenix basically says, you can call me the Phoenix, right?

217
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:41.250
I'm putting a team together to save the world from itself and from people like

218
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:42.750
you and me, are you in?

219
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.680
So this was really kind of how the Phoenix and Odin first met each other,

220
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.410
which is really kind of a crazy question because the thing that I would ask you

221
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:51.750
this, this is really the question that I would have to ask is Thor,

222
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.550
really the child of Odin and Gaia or store the child of Phoenix and Odin.

223
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.550
That's my question, because I feel like Jason, Aaron's going to change that.

224
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.300
And if four is actually the child of the Phoenix force, that would enter a,

225
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.570
that would bring in a whole new level of power, it'd be kind of bonkers.

226
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.640
But with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

227
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.320
If you guys are new here to come and to explain,

228
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.510
to make sure you guys are the sub button to become part of the rod core.

229
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.470
If you guys enjoyed this video,

230
