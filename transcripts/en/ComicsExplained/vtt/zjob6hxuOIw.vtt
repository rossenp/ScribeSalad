4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.720
All right, what's going on.

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.640
<v 1>Guys. This is Rob and we are continuing our Dawn of X coverage. Yes we are.</v>

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.520
And in this video we are picking up with Excalibur.

7
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.010
Here's the cool thing about this, but here's the cool thing about this.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.850
This is really going to kind of allow us a chance to offer some pretty cool

9
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:28.670
explanations. And so far as how are the captain Britain core works?

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.610
Jonathan Hickman's Avengers, a new Avengers, the collapse of the multi-verse,

11
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:35.510
how all that stuff ties into what's going on right now with this X-Men run.

12
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.150
This is why I always tell people,

13
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.870
if you want to read Jonathan Hickman's work, read it by itself.

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.390
Do not read anything else unless you absolutely have to.

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.120
This is an example of where you kind of have to write because other people are

16
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:49.940
writing the swords of X story, as opposed to just Jonathan Hickman.

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.350
And it all basically ties together,

18
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.040
but you can literally just read Hickman by himself and read nothing else.

19
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.170
And just maybe catch up on a couple of things here and there.

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.560
But the cool thing here is it offered, it allows us a bit of an explanation,

21
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.180
but before we get to that point,

22
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.990
we pick up with the arrival of Jamie Bradick and Brian Bradick as they've been

23
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:09.770
summoned by Saturday. And the whole idea is that as they're meeting, uh, Betsy,

24
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.020
Bradick here, right as they're meeting, you know, captain Brittany here,

25
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.630
once they arrive, things get pretty murky pretty fast.

26
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.210
And the reason why is because as Brian Braddock shows up here,

27
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.840
that's you realizes he's in possession of the sword of mite. And when she asks,

28
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.080
why is that here? His response is because I brought it for you. And the,

29
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.440
the idea of Brian Bradick is to basically switch these things right,

30
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.410
for Brian to retake the ambulance and for, for Betty, uh,

31
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:32.240
for Betsy to take the sword of Mike. Now,

32
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.000
here's the reason why that matters because once all that passes and they're

33
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.120
basically met by the arrival of Saturday and that she's assembled them here,

34
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.030
and it looks like it's basically a kind of giant get together to honor the

35
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:44.000
fallen captain Britain core that existed before the events of Hickman's of

36
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.250
vendors and new Avengers. But the idea is that this,

37
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.730
this kind of argument is taking place in such a way to where Brian wants things

38
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:52.220
to go back to the way they were before that one of the things that Saturday

39
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:54.620
talks about is the fall of the captain Britain court. Now,

40
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:57.380
the way this worked was the result of Hickman's offenders into new Avengers,

41
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.621
right?

42
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:01.730
So the captain Britain Corps in previous years was largely created by Merlin and

43
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:04.610
then Roma, and a combination of both. And the way this will play out,

44
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.030
is that an,

45
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.750
any one universe on any one earth out there that what you would have,

46
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.220
if some individual who would be met at some point in time by Merlin or Roma or

47
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:16.010
both, and what they would do is they would present them with an option.

48
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.491
They would say,

49
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:20.000
you have the choice of the sort of mite or the amulet of right there.

50
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.460
Wasn't really a wrong answer there, but whichever one they took,

51
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:25.490
they would go forward with those corresponding powers and they would in effect,

52
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.590
become the captain Britain of their universe.

53
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.290
And the idea is that the captain Britain of that universe,

54
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.250
which serve to protect that universe, but also serve as part of a larger whole,

55
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.700
they would protect the multi-verse alongside other captain Britain members.

56
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.340
And so think of it as a more localized version of like, I'm sorry,

57
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.410
a much larger version of the green lantern Corps.

58
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.470
And so the result of this is that during Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and new

59
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:47.300
Avengers, as we covered with that story,

60
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.050
that there came a point where Saturnino and the Omni Versal development court

61
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.230
were trying to understand why the multi-verse was collapsing,

62
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.670
why they didn't fully understand it.

63
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.340
And so what they ended up doing was getting their hands on a map maker with a

64
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:02.200
desire to crack the map maker, understand its code, and then get a,

65
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.031
get a bigger picture. Sure.

66
00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:06.330
The problem with this was that the map maker ended up submitting its own forces,

67
00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:08.040
right? And it really was more of a Sierra Madre,

68
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.240
so that as opposed to a map maker,

69
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:12.540
but they ended up somebody in the forces of both the ivory Kings and the ivory

70
00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:13.290
King soldiers,

71
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.160
and this led to the complete and total annihilation of the captain Britain

72
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:17.520
court,

73
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.780
the only person who survived was Brian Braddock and Ryan Radek only survived

74
00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:24.840
because Saturday took all the knowledge of the Starlight Citadel, right?

75
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:28.920
So all information containing the existence of the multi-verse and everything

76
00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:32.520
that she knew about the multi-verse and literally use telepathy to put it in the

77
00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:34.800
mind of Brian Bradick and then cast him out, right?

78
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.350
And he basically ended up showing back up to the Illuminati at some point in

79
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:39.450
time, but that's how they captain Britain core fell.

80
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.880
Now following the restoration of the multi-verse,

81
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.890
the category and core was not restored.

82
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.250
The reason for that is because the method and manner of choosing the captain

83
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.640
Britain court is not arbitrary, the sort of mite or the amulet of right.

84
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.370
And in years past, this is kind of what's happening says here in years,

85
00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:54.630
past captain Britain's,

86
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:57.990
who were chosen for that particular had to undergo that test.

87
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.650
What we're told here is there are captain Britains out there in the multi-verse,

88
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.600
but Saturday and considers them to be heretical. She's considered them to be,

89
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.850
to be heretics because they have not undergone the process of choosing between

90
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:10.170
the sword or the ambulance as well,

91
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:12.300
because they have not undergone that traditional process.

92
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.030
They're not real captain Britain's for all intents and purposes,

93
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:18.150
the way the Saturday views it. Somebody just grabbed a captain Britain uniform,

94
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.890
slapped it on, and now they're that character,

95
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.680
but they're not the rightful character. They have an undergone the process.

96
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:26.040
A person should undergo an order to become that in order to overtake that role.

97
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.410
And so, because of that, while there are captain Britain's there,

98
00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:31.500
she's basically captured them and she's holding them until she decides when

99
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.770
they're ready to be destroyed. And so in this frustration and this irritation,

100
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.670
as far as Saturnino is concerned while Brian Braddock is not in possession of

101
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:40.740
the ambulance, he isn't possession of the, of the sort.

102
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:43.290
And Brian Brodick is the only true captain Britain,

103
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.970
but Betsy Bradick is not the Bessie.

104
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.810
Braddock is considered to be a heretic and the eyes of Saturday.

105
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.490
And this really is kind of doubled down by Betsy's own admission.

106
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:53.640
What Saturday makes the case about the sword and the amulet. And Betsy says,

107
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:56.010
I never had to make either choice. And that's when Saturday is like,

108
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:59.070
those are your words, not mine in effect in the eyes of Saturnian Betsy,

109
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.970
Brodick doomed herself.

110
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.910
And she basically gave Saturnian license to take her captive. Right.

111
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:05.010
And that's what she kind of says, like the exits that way, right?

112
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.650
You don't need to be here. Like there's no reason for you to be here. Now,

113
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.290
Ashley goes to kind of make her way she's met by Bryant.

114
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.950
And the crazy thing about this is that she kind of challenges Brian to a fight,

115
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:15.720
right? She's like, let's get the song, right? Let's let's,

116
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.870
let's figure this out once. And for all, like who is the actual captain Britain?

117
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.770
The cool thing about this.

118
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:23.400
And what's interesting here is that Brian's response is I gave you the amulet.

119
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.920
If you guys remember the Excalibur story, the first one that we did,

120
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.520
his response was I gave you the ambulance because I was being taken over by

121
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:31.080
Morgan Le Fay. In this moment,

122
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.420
when I was basically being transformed into her henchmen,

123
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.840
I did not want her to have a henchman that had the power or of the ambulance.

124
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:39.570
So I gave it to you, but this was only ever meant to be temporary.

125
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.210
That ultimately I knew that you guys would win against Morgan Le Fay.

126
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.390
And when that time came, I hoped that you would give the amulet back to me.

127
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.830
That's why I gave you the sword.

128
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.110
The response of Betsy is I don't want to give it back to you.

129
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.040
I like being captain Britain. I want to stay captain Britain. The whole idea of,

130
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.100
of, of Brian Bradick is, but you don't even live in England.

131
00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:58.340
Like you live in Coca-Cola, you live in a whole different place.

132
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.530
What kind of captain Britain could you possibly be?

133
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:02.930
If you don't even live in the place you represent, right.

134
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.860
It doesn't really make any sense.

135
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.380
It's like a president of the United States that lives in Japan.

136
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.980
It's nonsensical. There's no, it just,

137
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.440
it just doesn't work that way right now at this point,

138
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.630
it's really just kind of arguing geographic location.

139
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.370
But if we're being honest with ourselves,

140
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.140
because a captain Britain can become that way by taking the sword or the amulet,

141
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.490
then we're really just kind of arguing.

142
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:26.090
Semantics is really what's happening here. That's all is coming down to.

143
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.790
But the funny thing about this is that as they kind of begin to get into the,

144
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.810
to a little bit of their fights,

145
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.780
Betsy Braddock does make a really good point in saying that becoming captain

146
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:36.170
Britain is an honor. It's not a birthright, right? You're not owed this.

147
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.440
You're not owed the role of captain Britain, despite what the lineage is.

148
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.740
And despite your ties to King Arthur, you're not owed this role.

149
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.380
You have this role bestowed upon you at one point in time,

150
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.700
but it could also have been taken away.

151
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.370
And if it can be taken away from you that it's not a thing that you inherently

152
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:49.880
own, right?

153
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.520
It's the thing that's just given to you for some temporary amount of time.

154
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.730
Even at that temporary amount of time just happens to be your entire life.

155
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.290
It can be taken away at any point in time.

156
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.360
And so what you end up doing here is you kind of have this,

157
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:02.780
this whole situation that's kind of interrupted right by Saturday, you know,

158
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.340
and she's like, you guys need to calm down.

159
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.520
But the funny thing about this is she kind of seems to be sewing discord among

160
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.520
the two, right? Like she kind of seems to be creating a rift among these two.

161
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:14.050
Now what we end up doing is picking up later that night. And when that happens,

162
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.300
you end up having, uh, having, you know, Jamie,

163
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:20.560
Jamie who's kind of sleeping in his guest quarters and is met by what are,

164
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.620
what's essentially an assemblage of captain Britons that are different other

165
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.360
different characters based on the X-Men right?

166
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.510
So rogue who's a captain Britain gambit, who's a captain Britain Jubilee.

167
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.150
That kind of a thing as a result of this is that they basically say like,

168
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.840
we sentence you to die right now, the motivation for why they send some to die.

169
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.300
We're not really given a definitive explanation here instead,

170
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.500
what is happening and, and,

171
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.170
and how it looks as though Jamie may have sold them out. But the,

172
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.820
but what it looks like happened here,

173
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.760
or at least what does happen here is you have Betsy and you have Brian who of

174
00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:47.710
course respond. And then once they get in there,

175
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.350
Jamie's got all these guys seized right now. Again,

176
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.050
Jimmy Bradick can warp reality on a universal scale.

177
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.930
And that's what those strings are, right? Those strings that emanate that's him.

178
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:57.670
That's how it is that he controls reality.

179
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.460
Now this is just kind of shown to us for artistic license.

180
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.630
It's just kind of shown to us like,

181
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.320
this is what he's actually doing in terms of how it is at like Betsy and Bryan,

182
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.530
Bryan. Bradick see it.

183
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.040
He's just standing there and they're floating in thin air and all hell's popping

184
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.930
loose. Right? That's, that's all it kind of looks to them.

185
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.110
This is just kind of shows that we can get an artistic understanding of how his

186
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:17.230
powers work. But the whole point behind this is he's kind of like, okay,

187
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.300
they showed up here with the intention of killing me.

188
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.240
I can't just let that slide, but if I can't kill them all,

189
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.360
then I'll just kill one to help them understand their place, your picture.

190
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.960
And so in doing that, he kills the captain Britain Jubilee, right?

191
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:31.750
He kills the Jubilee version of captain Britain. And so once she's dead,

192
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.200
it off all the others, right. They go after them and they end up taking off,

193
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.670
right. They ended up basically bailing out.

194
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.090
Radek ultimately ends up drawing the sword of Mike from the scabbard.

195
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:40.840
And when he does,

196
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.560
he becomes a version of captain Britain using the sword of Mike right now at

197
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:45.610
that moment, he in turn,

198
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.100
turns it on the rest of the captain Britain core and says, okay,

199
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.440
they will strike you down if I have to, I don't want to,

200
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.920
but I will kill you if I have to. But that's when Saturn needs steps in.

201
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.730
And so she basically, she, she kind of appeals to Brian.

202
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.550
Bradick right with this idea kind of, kind of appealing to him.

203
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.010
It's his manly nature, right? Being a little romantic and so on. And the same,

204
00:09:03.011 --> 00:09:05.540
like, you know, get rid of this sort of my, you don't need this anymore. Right?

205
00:09:05.541 --> 00:09:09.740
I am the sole occupant of the Starlight, Citadel Merlin and Roma or long debt.

206
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.130
I determine who's going to be the captain Britain from this point going forward.

207
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.140
And so she basically tells them, get rid of the sword.

208
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.990
She tries to strip the amulet away from Betsy Bradick with the intention of

209
00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:21.440
giving it to Brian. But Betsy uses it combination of her, of her power,

210
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.610
along with some spells,

211
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.030
learn from apocalypse and destroys the amulet and the process. Now,

212
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.810
the reason why this matters is because the amulet is what gives KA though that

213
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:31.250
version of captain Britain, their power, right?

214
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:33.560
So like flight forcefield different than that, that suit, you know,

215
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:36.470
enhanced strength, super speed. So on and so forth. Without the amulet,

216
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.210
those powers can't freely be given, right.

217
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:40.220
It would have to be restored or something along those lines.

218
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.031
As a result of that,

219
00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:44.780
she ends up having Betsy body taken away and takes Brian to what is basically

220
00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:48.830
her bed chamber. And so, as a result of this, you pick up with,

221
00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:51.260
with Betsy Brodick right. Kind of down in this holding cell.

222
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.200
And she kind of tries to reach out so far. She hasn't really been successful,

223
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.770
but she tries to reach out and is ultimately met by the gambit version of

224
00:09:57.771 --> 00:10:00.800
captain Britain from, from whatever alternate reality that happens to be.

225
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.680
And once you basically says is at least having this conversation with them,

226
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.330
she asks like, you know, are you guys okay? What is everything? Okay. And the,

227
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.440
the, the funny thing is like, she tells him like, we'll try it. Like,

228
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:10.550
I'm going to try to find a way out.

229
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:14.270
But what she's told by gambit is escaping the cells is no small thing.

230
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.830
If all you had to do is pick a lock and leave.

231
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.390
It wouldn't really be much of a prison cell.

232
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.140
And so what he tells her is there are spells bits around this cell and the way

233
00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:23.570
in which it works is that when Roe tried to break out,

234
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.710
she literally just drives her,

235
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:28.100
fly out of it and got exceedingly cold and she can't get any warm net. Right?

236
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.830
Like she got cold, she got lost and she can't warm up. Right.

237
00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.540
So there's an effect that it has on you.

238
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.930
It's that kind of magic that keeps people contained within these cells.

239
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.900
And so what is happening is that while she's telepathically communicating with

240
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.440
gambit, the Jimmy Bradick piggybacks onto their communications. Right. And says,

241
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.780
okay, so like, you need to jump out, jump out the window now,

242
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.160
and I will catch you. What I mean, they're,

243
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.710
they're so high up that if you were to jump out and you'd probably end up

244
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:50.270
getting yourself killed when you hit the ground.

245
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.860
And the fact that she doesn't really have the,

246
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.010
it means per normal powers of the powers of cat of Britain, aren't readily,

247
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.540
readily available to you. Now,

248
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.600
you could kind of ask the question if she really is that powerful in terms of

249
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:02.810
her telekinesis, why couldn't she just fly? That's a good question to ask.

250
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.550
I don't know why we don't get an answer to that,

251
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.820
but it kind of seems to be this sort of revolving spell that exists right there.

252
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:10.430
Like if she jumps out the window and then she gets caught up in the spell.

253
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.980
And so the response to this of, of, of Jimmy Bradick is okay,

254
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:14.480
you could stay here, but keep in mind,

255
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.600
you're in other world and they're going to execute you at Dawn. So when you die,

256
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.690
like if you die or when the time comes, if you're executed and you die,

257
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.850
they can bring you back on cacoa. But remember guys,

258
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.240
if you die in other world and they resurrect you in Precoa you come back,

259
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.610
all screwed up, right? You come back all twisted and screwed up.

260
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:30.540
We saw that in the last couple of videos that we made.

261
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.680
That's one of the important points about dying in other worlds that remains for

262
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:35.990
the rest of swords of X. If you die out there,

263
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.780
there's no guarantee to the version of you that comes back will be the version

264
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:42.020
who died. It could be any other alternate reality version of yourself, right?

265
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:45.950
So maybe Betsy Brodick jumps out or she's executed in the morning and Kurkova

266
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:49.070
resurrects her. And she comes back and it's like some crazy, some,

267
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.130
some absolutely nuts girl who's helped been on world domination, right?

268
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.580
There's no way of knowing if that's going to be the case, right?

269
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:57.460
No way of knowing what version of her will come back. And so, because of that,

270
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:00.190
you end up having her, of course, making this leap of faith out the window,

271
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.000
and then being caught by a Griffin, right? Th that belongs to, uh,

272
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.140
to Jimmy Brodick who of course rescues her.

273
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.750
And the two of them make their way towards Saturday Dean's bed chamber.

274
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.620
And as she's there, what she ends up doing is basically telling Brian Bradick,

275
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.590
you're the one that needs to represent this prophecy, right?

276
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:17.290
You're the one that needs to wrote to, to basically wheel this Starlight.

277
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.340
Sor not Betsy Bradick, she's not a real captain Britain. This has to be you,

278
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.830
you have to be the one to return to wheel this weapon.

279
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.550
And so what she ends up doing is basically crafting the Starlight sort itself.

280
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.170
Now, one of the things to keep in mind here,

281
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:31.000
and this is something that we may not have really covered,

282
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.000
or hadn't been too clear on is that this whole idea that, of course, you know,

283
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.100
once Betsy Brodick and them show up, you know, and like,

284
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.770
literally you have Saturday making out with Brian Braddock, right? So, you know,

285
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.050
like let's, let's touch naughty bets, right? You have like a,

286
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.700
you have bet Syria, and you have, uh,

287
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.530
Jamie who were kind of watching everything go down.

288
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.960
And then Brian Bradick realizes she's there. And he's like, Betsy,

289
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:49.570
take the sword now. Right. Betsy runs in grabs a sword.

290
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:52.510
And we realized that Brian Bradick was never actually on the side of Saturday.

291
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.480
And, but he was basically playing her in order to give Betsy time to steal the

292
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:56.620
Starlight sword herself.

293
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.170
Because that's part of the prophecy for the swords of X event.

294
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.440
One of the things to understand here is this prophecy is not something that

295
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:03.850
predates satiny, right?

296
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:07.030
It's not as though it's a prophecy that's been around for like millennia.

297
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.160
And it's just now coming to fruition.

298
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.100
This is a game that Saturday Dean herself created, right.

299
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.770
She created the prophecy, she created all of this, right.

300
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.560
It's kind of her great, big, huge game to just sort of see what happens.

301
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:19.420
We don't really know what the end result of this is.

302
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.820
We don't really know what it is that she's trying to achieve.

303
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.580
What's the point of standing in the way of the forces of, of,

304
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:27.910
of a Rocco that wants to invade the main Marvel universe and kill everybody

305
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:30.280
there. What's the point of that, right? If you're in the Starlight Citadel,

306
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.830
what's the whole point. I mean, you're not really affected by any of it.

307
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.120
So why does it matter to you? Right.

308
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.610
We don't really know what the end result of her whole campaign is.

309
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:41.350
What we do now is this kind of effort between Brian and Betty has ultimately

310
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:44.590
worked that what it's done is this drove sadder Nene to create the Starlights

311
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:44.831
award,

312
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:48.430
which was the missing weapon that they needed in order to secure the forces of

313
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.370
earth budding as the forces of a Rocco. And so now they have both,

314
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.800
they have the sort of mind and they have the Starlight sword.

315
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.770
And so it solidifies this position. Right? And so from here,

316
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.550
it just boils down to three more sorts. Right? All we have are three more.

317
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.810
My question here,

318
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.790
and this is the question that I feel like a lot of you guys are asking my

319
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:07.480
question here is when are we going to see the return of mad Jim? Jasper's,

320
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.410
that's what I want. I want to see Jim Jasper's come back. I want to see him.

321
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.320
And I want to see the fury. I want to see that. Cause the theory we should,

322
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.170
I don't know if we ever did no mega mega level video on the fury.

323
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.930
I think we did. And if we did, uh, you know, the, my,

324
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:21.550
my guys will have it down in the description.

325
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.650
The fury is wildly overpowered while he's insanely powerful. It's,

326
00:14:25.651 --> 00:14:27.460
it's kind of nuts. But with that being said, guys,

327
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.690
we're going to read this video to an end.

328
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.270
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

329
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.520
button to become part of the rod port. If you guys enjoyed this video,

330
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.860
make sure you drop a light. Now we'll catch you up.
