00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.900
let's be honest of the cities that are a little jealous, you know,

11
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:46.040
especially Boston. You ever noticed Boston hates New York. You know what?

12
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.080
The funny thing is, we're not thinking about them.

13
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.393

<v 1>Boston treats, New York, like we used to date way back in the day.</v>

16
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.810
Now we moved on with our lives.

17
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:06.680
It became somebody that just FAQ and stalking our Facebook page.

18
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.080
You're Kwok SACA It's like Boston. Let it go,

19
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.990
dude. We are way out of your league. All right, go date Philadelphia.

20
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.973
You got it.

21
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.470
<v 0>You can tell Boston's a city.</v>

22
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.170
<v 1>Do you ever notice every movie about Boston is about some guy trying to get out</v>

23
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.004
of bed.

24
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.260
<v 1>It's like, well, if I see you here in the morning, I will kill you myself.</v>

26
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.020
You go make something of yourself, kid.

27
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.070
You're not going to just hang around here. Wearing construction boots in a car.

28
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.850
Ben Affleck's sitting by a river bank. Finally found serenity with a hipster,

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:54.740
beard Credit.

30
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.860
They love their teams. They got a lot of pride. They just take a little too far.

31
00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:00.650
You know, I shot my half-hour special there. And I came,

32
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:01.490
I was wearing a Yankee hat.

33
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:04.070
They treated me like I was wearing an ISIS t-shirt or something. And I was like,

34
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.000
slow it down. It's just the baseball team. I like, you know, it's like,

35
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.430
I'm a Yankee fan. I get it. I'm a hardcore Yankee fan.

36
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:13.100
But like I don't wear Yankees pajamas to bed every night.

37
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.043
<v 0>No.</v>

38
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.770
<v 1>Yankees don't win. I'll be all right. This stuff to do here.</v>

39
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.010
Not like Boston red Sox lose the crime rate,

00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:26.840
shoots up 15% people start hitting their family members.

41
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.680
The cops show up like what's going on here? It's like,

42
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:35.660
well off the set of red Sox laws, Keep hitting them.

43
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:38.570
