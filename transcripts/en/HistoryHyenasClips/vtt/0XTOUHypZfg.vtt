1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>So you got to bottom out first to the point and close some sort of like</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.110
addiction that when you come back to do the character again,

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.900
you don't really quite look like you anymore. And you're older.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.650
You've got to add that sad element to it. Yeah. Well,

5
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:15.350
it's kind of like that now, because with Eno now at, towards the end,

6
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:17.420
he was just, he wouldn't shave anymore.

7
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.270
He would just kind of half-ass it with the wig on and it kind of looked,

8
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.280
he wouldn't mention how funny it looked. Yeah.

9
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.100
Cause he used to be real seriously.

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.300
I used to shave when you do a character is like a guy with a puppet where you

11
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:33.200
start hate in the puppet. You start hating the wig. After a while, you know,

12
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.940
I don't live in some Twilight zone and then wig and starts

13
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:41.240
talking to you. You ain't nothing without me,

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.980
nobody buys it. [inaudible]

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.400
let me be honest. Yeah. I didn't want you. Yeah,

16
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.050
you were nothing without me. Yeah. It's kind of a little, I never got that.

17
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.510
I know Pete comics would always ask me and they'd say, Hey,

18
00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:00.200
are you sick of doing it? I was like, no, it's so fun. You know? I think if it,

19
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.830
if an question, are you sick of what's selling tickets? Oh,

20
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.060
well people do that all the time. Yeah. We'll do that. Me as a Patriots fan.

21
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.410
You gotta be secret only Superbowls. Yeah. No, they're great. Yeah.

22
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.780
It's going to end one day. I want to enjoy all of them. Yeah. Yeah. No,

23
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:17.420
I didn't. I didn't, uh, I didn't resent it or hate it for one.

24
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.840
It was so much fun. It was such a fun show doing it live.

25
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.240
Cause women would go crazy. They would go.

26
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.670
And it's fun to be in that character and just say wild.

27
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.030
I would say the funniest thing was like making straight guys uncomfortable in

28
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.960
the audience. I was sucked out. Look at him. Holly said,

29
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.540
are you a cop or a firefighter? I didn't know what a hero was.

30
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.870
And then just watching them kind of score him. Yeah. You stupid, man. You know,

31
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:40.800
just kind of try to get away. Yo man,

32
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.790
wild boy with their girls and their girls were loving it. And I,

33
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.420
so it was just fun to with people like that. That's the best of the best.

34
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.160
The best is the guy. That level of fun. There's nothing worse than it.

35
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.310
Wasn't a better, I'm sorry. The tickets were never dying down.

36
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.900
Now they start dying. Even in New York,

37
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.870
they start dying because you did somebody show kind of publicity.

38
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.800
You don't need that's right. And it was still don't go good. No instinct.

39
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.960
This thing that's working. I'm not doing it anymore.

40
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.380
And then you're going to hear the tickets book. man. Nah, caramel

41
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.150
people. Didn't like it. Everyone was offended. Yeah.

42
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.590
I started to like beat a woman with the wig. It's not coming back.

43
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:22.070
The wig took me, took over who I was. Yeah, it was all right.

44
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.940
Well we're not going to talk you back into your golden pony here. No. Yeah.

45
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.600
It's like, I think, you know, well just put it into the hyenas done.

46
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.090
I got a movie idea. Yeah.

47
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.200
You get sick of trying to talk him back into the dream. Okay.

48
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.540
Some chick breaks up with you. Something happens to you.

49
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.130
You come home and you're mad and for whatever reason you see the wig and then

50
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:47.450
you start doing it and then you start making all the money.

51
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.890
And then one day he runs into like Chris, what the is great. Yeah.

52
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:55.490
And then I don't, I can never get a movie pass the stupid second act.

53
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.580
Was that the first 10 pages? I don't know what it is then be like in it.

54
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:02.080
And you're like the, um, like the mic, the manager who's telling him, take,

55
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.380
take the wig. You do it. Like if he's not going to do it and I have this deep,

56
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.940
dark secret and you never know what it is.

57
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.600
And you find out later that I used to at the same thing happen to me.

58
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.520
And I started wearing a wig cause I lost my hair. And then you're just like,

59
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.880
you got one more in you. And I say, yeah. And then we go, we take him down.

60
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.000
And then the end I opened for you with my wig and then love it. Yeah.

61
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.100
We'll call it a wig. And he's in comedy jam. Comedy jails. Yeah.

62
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.240
We'll call it. Third act is the hardest to land one dream, two wigs.

63
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.350
What do we call this? A tough wigs. Um,

64
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.600

65
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.590
for the hustler. It's like the hustler. And then, um, what was the,

66
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.730
what was the follow-up movie with? Um, other money?

67
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.700
It's almost like cuddle money. Yeah. A little bit good name.

68
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.240
Polar money is one of the most underrated Scorsese movies of all time.

69
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.570
I love color money. I didn't even know he did that one. Yeah.

70
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.200
A lot of people don't I love that. Rack them up for Mr. Fast. Eddie.

71
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.310
That's what it is. Yeah.

72
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.690
