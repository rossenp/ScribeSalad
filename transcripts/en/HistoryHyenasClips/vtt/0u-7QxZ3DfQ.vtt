WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Now me and Tim, me and Tim went on the, as cruise together last year.</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.000
You can't make it this year because of previous thing you have,

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.830
you have other work things you can't mess. Yeah.

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.710
<v 1>But I really just canceled it. Cause I don't want to go.</v>

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.860
Let's just be honest with you because you're a wild kid. Yeah.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.900
You're your treat for humanity. I was trying to just spit it for you. I got it.

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.920
I'm just going to be open and honest. I don't want to go. The fans are weird.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.920
I'm going to get Legionnaires' disease. I don't want to lose my wifi.

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.840
I got a kid at home and big Jay Oakerson creeped me out. He's going to love it.

10
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.260
He's going to love it. He goes, every year he was at,

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.890
was he on with us last year though? But he likes that one pant leg up.

12
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.490
He loves it. Yeah. He loves it. But tell the people I wanted your perspective.

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.020
Did I get away Sean Chan for that? Yeah. Well here's the problem.

14
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:52.820
I knew there was a problem because you meet it. The cruise.

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.670
<v 0>Terminal, we'll go. We all go into new Orleans and we meet.</v>

16
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.620
<v 1>Cruise terminal.</v>

17
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.050
And many of the people that were taking the cruise had decided to bring food and

18
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:04.760
beverages with them automatically. I knew this was what you can't do,

19
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.030
right? The, well, here's the thing. You can't do it in certain cases.

20
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:12.260
But I knew this was a group. So bringing food and drinks on vacation with you,

21
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.590
that's a certain type of person. You know, that's a certain type of person.

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.150
Let's be honest. That's a disgusting person. It's not for me that much.

23
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.890
Not for me. So I saw people dragging coolers, all kinds of stuff. Now we're,

24
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:26.990
we're cruising into the middle of the ocean,

25
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.500
but this boat is the size of a mall. It really is.

26
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.140
So you'd imagine there'd be food on it. But these people were like,

27
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.940
just in case that runs low. I have snacks. Yeah. So for the room,

28
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.220
one of the ladies said to me, I swear to God. She goes,

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.150
I have brought snacks for the room. I said for the room,

30
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.050
there's a 24 hour buffet. Give you an idea.

31
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:52.430
These people didn't want to be caught in the room.

32
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.290
Hungry. They didn't want artists are talking about it.

33
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.670
There's not. If, if there's even a little space in their stomach,

34
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.100
even a little bubble there, I mean,

35
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:11.510
you see, it looks like you're at, you looks like you're at a fare,

36
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.660
watching a go-cart. It looks like a go-cart festival.

37
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.920
Just medieval times on the boat. There's scooters everywhere.

38
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:21.800
These people are here. It is. Let me tell you right now,

39
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.120
it is crazy because I'm a big dude.

40
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.550
And I understand that there's it's, you know,

41
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.390
there's a whole fat activist movement where people are like, you know,

42
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:35.450
you should be fat. And I never was into that. I was always like, I eat too.

43
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.850
I eat too much. I should, I should watch.

44
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.880
I can't go to sleep til four in the morning to my food. This is not good.

45
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.920
This is a bad thing. I'm slowly killing myself.

46
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.380
When I used to do cocaine for years, I never did cocaine.

47
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.250
And thought about starting a blog on everybody. Get, start doing up your nose.

48
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:52.820
It's great. Everybody should lay in bed till 4:00 AM. And with their throat,

49
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:54.800
all scratch. I feel discriminated.

50
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.720
<v 0>Against. When someone said, Hey, you might want to quit.</v>

51
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.780
<v 1>Cocaine. And my gear oppressing me. Yeah.</v>

52
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.190
So I think food is like a drug.

53
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.240
You see people on this boat that is their

54
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:11.560
lifestyle is like, they're like that.

55
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.590
And they're not even. And I hate to say like, they're not even fat off,

56
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.060
good food. You got fat off Pringles and TV,

57
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.620
your TV, dinner, fat, your RBS fat, your buffet fat.

58
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.080
Like you're not, you've never even had a good thing, right?

59
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.180
They would come to New York. They would have a stroke.

60
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:30.430
If they ate any of this food, they'd be dead in a week.

61
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.710
They don't even know like this exists.

62
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.380
They've never had proper tomato sauce or anything.

63
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.470
These are Domino's people and they're on the boat.

64
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.850
And let me tell you right now, man,

65
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.810
the kids are like little cinnamon buns.

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.720
<v 2>The kids are huge. Yeah. The kids.</v>

67
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.800
<v 1>Are big. The pool is the size of a postage stamp.</v>

68
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.170
There's about two or three people that could fit in this pool at once.

69
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.100
Maybe one person and her two children and the pool is completely full.

70
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.560
I thought they would have a big pool water slide.

71
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.320
There's no Waterslide because everybody keeps getting stuck enough to plunge

72
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.300
them out. Um, there was a buffet, 24 hours too. And the,

73
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.270
and the boat, they want to prevent an outbreak of disease.

74
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.970
So when you walk into the boat, that's a nice, friendly reminder.

75
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:18.190
Every time it's a Filipino guy,

76
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.440
because everybody who works in the boat lives in the Philippines.

77
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.350
This is the fact that all the cruise industry lives in the Philippines.

78
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.720
You never see them when they're not working.

79
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.640
They make them live in a pipe in the middle of the ship.

80
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.480
There were allowed out once a day. They're always working. You never see them.

81
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:37.420
He got us talking about, I go, you never, there's no breaks.

82
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.060
You never see two crews, employees being like, you know,

83
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:42.820
you don't remember the last crew. None of that hard at work.

84
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.370
harder work with it gone. Yeah. I don't know where they are.

85
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.910
Maybe they go overboard, but you never see them. They go back to the pipe.

86
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.880
So this one, dude, he would just stand in the front of the buffet, go washy,

87
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:54.670
washy. And he would spray your hands. And I'm talking about,

88
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.350
this was not hand sanitizer. This was like a poison,

89
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:03.970
like killing everything on you get hurt when he sprayed your hands.

90
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.720
Like it was like ammonia that you had to rub your hands.

91
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:12.460
You rubbed the layer of skin off your hands because everybody was so they were

92
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:14.920
so nervous about cause it's a Petri dish. They're like,

93
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:16.650
we don't want these people spread.

94
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.220
Cause if there are cases where like 1800 people get sick and then the party's

95
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:24.490
over the Legionnaires' disease virus, then party's over.

96
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.510
And what these cruise lines do,

97
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:28.030
carnival cruise will abandon these in the middle of the ocean.

98
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.850
They don't give a. Cause none of these people are rich.

99
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.550
None of these people have lawyers. They know they're not doing anything.

100
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.360
So Carnival's like, leave them out there. And. Sometimes there's like a,

101
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.080
the electrical critical down on one of these faults or carnivals, like whatever,

102
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:43.300
just let the military of whatever conscience figure it out.

103
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.850
They don't give a because these people are disposable.

104
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.900
Carnival knows these don't have a lawyer not going to come.

105
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.580
This isn't a river cruise going down the Daniels, you know,

106
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.450
these are gonna deal with it. It is what it is. Half of them won't notice,

107
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.150
you know? Wow. Yeah. That's fun. See, but that's what I'm saying.

108
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:03.410
Like that's why no it's bad. All that stuff I got. If I'm being honest with you,

109
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.410
what it started with made me make a bad excuse.

110
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.880
It started with me and Yonis in there before the thing took

111
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:15.020
off. We knew I, yeah, you want it to get off before it light? It won't be there.

112
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:17.390
Yeah. Like if, if they would have come up to you and said, listen,

113
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:19.640
you guys can get off. If you want. You're not going to get paid,

114
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.710
but you can get off. You have gone to be honest. You're also New York.

115
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.600
Conch is kind of the term. So a lot of people love it.

116
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.950
A lot of our peers love it.

117
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.620
They let me tell you right now they adore it and that's okay.

118
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.410
There's nothing wrong with that. They were born in other places. This is,

119
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.350
I guess it's exciting for them because of that. Yeah. It's very exciting.

120
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.720
The boat is, isn't a boat. Big. Get me out.

121
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.770
Get me away from you and your thought process. Um, I get on a boat,

122
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.611
honest gets on the boat.

123
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.680
We start looking around and we start saying to ourselves,

124
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.140
we're looking at all the P the mouth breathers.

125
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.860
And they have them in like a FEMA tent. They haven't been a big cruise terminal,

126
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.600
I think, got their food and the potato chips.

127
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.630
And then they'll start lumbering on this thing. And we're like,

128
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.610
it just hits us immediately. Oh,

129
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:02.000
we're about to go into the middle of the ocean with these people, with Walmart.

130
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.020
And that's exactly what it is. That's what it is. And there's nowhere to gut.

131
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:09.800
There's nowhere to go and listen, it's not a tropical pack. It's cold.

132
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.010
You can out in the middle of the ocean. You think it's like a tropical paradise.

133
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.970
It's people, weren't hoodies. It's kind of windy. It's not that sunny.

134
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.790
You dock at a, like, uh,

135
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.960
like a weird sandbar that Royal Caribbean and carnival cruise bought.

136
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.080
And it turned into Costa Maya, Mexico, which doesn't exist.

137
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.220
And it's these guys that are dressed up like conquistadores and pirates.

138
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.400
And these idiots, these fat idiots, they sell them jewelry.

139
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.150
There's a 24 hour news channel in your little. And by the way,

140
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:41.360
the accommodations you have, you stay in like a little,

141
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.240
I don't know how some of those people fit in those cabins. They don't,

142
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.470
they shut the door on their fat, like tuck.

143
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.470
It it's like the way that I fit into a jacket.

144
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:51.770
They fit into the cabin there in the cabin. They put on a channel.

145
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.880
The channel is 24 hour. Uh, what you can buy when you get to this Island.

146
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.530
And it's just some guy going, Hey,

147
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.010
I've been in the cruise and jewelry industry for 25 years and you go,

148
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.830
that's not a thing. There is no cruise. And he goes,

149
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.790
the deals you're going to get. When we land in Costa, Maya are amazing.

150
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.360
And he starts showing you these bracelets and earrings.

151
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.780
And then what happens is he fat people get off the boat and they go to these

152
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.070
little jewelry stands and they're all like kiosks on the beach. And then they,

153
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.600
they jam these necklaces around these fat ladies necks and they pay money.

154
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:27.500
And then they get back on the boat and it is, it is a mess. And by the way,

155
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.730
they take you, you get on, like you get in a cab. When you go to a resort,

156
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:35.930
they take great pains to disguise how the rest of the area is the best part.

157
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.170
They pick you up and they take you right to the resort. They don't around.

158
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.110
When you go on a cruise and you land in the Island.

159
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.780
If you want to go to the restaurant or the beach or something like that,

160
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.740
they got to drive you through the rest of the Island before you get there.

161
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.780
So you get in this little like golf cart,

162
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:55.770
that seats about eight people and you drive through, I am not kidding. Hellish,

163
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.850
third world. Hellscape where there's guys with no shoes,

164
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.780
chasing roosters for dinner. They're sitting,

165
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.220
everybody's 400 pounds. There's people playing the xylophone on their ribs,

166
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.170
wasting away on the side of the road. Like there's people that would kill you.

167
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:16.560
If they were hung, they're emaciated. They lack the strength, the plunge,

168
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:18.630
a knife in your throat. They would, if they could,

169
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.910
and you wouldn't blame them either. I'd be like.

170
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.110
If I was starving and they just caught it around fat people, it is,

171
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.640
it is the craziest thing. And I just said to myself, I'm like, how?

172
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.830
And then you start listening to people around you. And they're like, well,

173
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:34.680
we took carnival last year. And I'm like, Oh, this is a thing that people do.

174
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.860
And they enjoy it. And it's like, I don't even want to be part of.

175
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.060
<v 0>It's just such a mix because it's so true. He says that they like,</v>

176
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.730
there's this where you dock this little area.

177
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:47.330
That's just completely commercialized tourist with the cookies doors.

178
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.770
And then you just travel a little farther out. You're in a 10th world country.

179
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.930
And what we do is we just show up in this moving mall with all the

180
00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:57.920
food in the world.

181
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.550
<v 1>Yeah. And if we just took that food and gave it to the people,</v>

182
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.970
they'd be happy when we go, no, we're getting off. We're buying a key chain.

183
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.760
And then we're getting back on us and taking the food away.

184
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.450
People think you're having a cultural experience. Is Fatma people from Ohio,

185
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.180
walking around eating churros, pointing at fake,

186
00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:18.470
like what do they call those statues? Uh, the, um, the, the totem poles,

187
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.170
totem poles are fake. They're not all thick.

188
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:24.890
They were built three years ago by Royal Caribbean and carnival cruise line.

189
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.460
And this fat idiot. You're like, Oh, it's Mexican chocolate. They're boiling.

190
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:32.900
Hershey's these don't know I'm not eating churros. And they all, and here's,

191
00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:35.560
what's most disturbing. This is I think what disturbed me. And you're honest,

192
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.120
the mouse, this is what was the most dystopian about it.

193
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.990
Everybody thought it was great.

194
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.740
Everybody enjoyed it so much that you went so crazy. You're like, am I wrong?

195
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.850
<v 0>They just started realizing how over we are.</v>

196
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.151
<v 1>You know,</v>

197
00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:49.940
you realize that it's really is over because everyone thought it was a great

198
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:53.480
time and it was raining and cold. And so, okay. Cause that was my question.

199
00:10:53.481 --> 00:10:56.000
So like, cause like it's February right now, you guys have to say in February,

200
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.750
other than that, we had a great time. Other than that, it was fine.

201
00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:01.610
I understand leaving the Florida. I understand leaving the ports.

202
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.800
It's going to be cold, but you're saying even when you get to Mexico,

203
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:04.730
it's still cold there.
