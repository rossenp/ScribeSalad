00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>Yeah, they need to stay in the bubble. I think baseball's probably,</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:05.550
I would give it a 0% chance of finishing the season,

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.160
but I think the NBA will be okay because they're staying,

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.360
they're going to stay in the bubble. Yeah.

5
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:12.330
And this is the time the excitement's a little down because there's no fans or

6
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.710
whatever. This is the time where you just,

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.800
you got to look the other way with steroids.

8
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.050
Let these boys juice up and roid, rage all over each other.

9
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.080
I don't want to see a home run. I want them to see them hit Pluto. Yeah.

10
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.260
It's a different, yeah. So by the way, why, why do they,

11
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.420
why are people against steroids at all? Like, here's what happens when you're,

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.370
when you have a policy against steroids,

13
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:36.740
is that all these little kids grow up thinking, Oh,

14
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:39.710
I'm going to be a baseball star. I'm going to be an Olympic star.

15
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:41.750
I'm going to be a weightlifting star, a bicyclist.

16
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.950
And then they finally reached like the top 100 in the world and somebody tells

17
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:47.690
them, Hey, we forgot to tell you.

18
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.200
You need to start taking this if you want to wait. Yeah. Well we have a,

19
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.440
we got it. We got a steroid expert on our podcast, Chris,

20
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.060
what's it like to do cycles.

21
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.110
I've done a few cycles of Winstrol and I've never felt better. I'm back on it.

22
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.520
And um, I, I agree with you, James. And I've been saying this, I think,

23
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.450
especially baseball. It's so boring.

24
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:12.020
It's unbelievable how boring it is. And now there's no fans.

25
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.660
Even my dad was watched baseball his whole life. He's like,

26
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:18.230
I can't sit through a nine inning game anymore. Have ever had that least,

27
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.900
if you want to have a steroid league and a regular league.

28
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.410
And in the steroid league, one player out one batter,

29
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.000
a game gets a metal bat. They put boards up around the stadium.

30
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.090
They put the pitcher in like riot gear. And you know,

31
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.780
you have a chance to get an 800 foot home run. And it's a pack of the pitcher.

32
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.560
You know, maybe the pitcher dies. Maybe he does it. And you know, seriously.

33
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.950
Cause it's like, well, how long can we continue with this? Yeah. I mean,

34
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.380
we've got to adapt to the times. No more traditional sports.

35
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:50.360
Like Chris is saying new sport, you got a federal courthouse. You got 10 Antifa,

36
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.000
you got 10 proud boys fighting.

37
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.480
Ultimate protests are fighting a new American gladiators.

38
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:01.250
Who's going to win the communists or the libertarians have added baby,

39
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:05.060
put them in a dome and let them go. I agree with that.

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.840
How many people like Chris when you started taking steroids?

41
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.180
I don't even know if it's a joke or not. When you started taking steroids,

42
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.710
did someone say like, Hey man, if you want to be great at basketball, take this.

43
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.870
What happened? Was his jump got a little bigger,

44
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.630
but then occasionally he would punch a few meter maids.

45
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.770
It's one is what happens, you know, relatively punch a Chinese on the street.

46
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.370
It happens. It's what happens. It's called roid rage. I was 19 years old.

47
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.490
I was 19 years old. I did a cycle, a Winnie.

48
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.900
We used to call it Winstrol and yeah. I mean, why did you take it though?

49
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.260
Like why, why did you, that would be a good thing. And by the way,

50
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:41.420
I'm not arguing whether it's a good thing or not, but why did you take it?

51
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.220
Cause I, I don't know, dude,

52
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.250
he was playing basketball and he needed to try to compete with the blacks when

53
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.560
he, I ask him what he is. I mean, it.

54
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.860
It's a simple answer for a question like that. And he's a white kid.

55
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.500
He was playing basketball. There's a lot of of blacks and play basketball.

56
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.200
You want to jump higher? You got to take a little, it is a lot of,

57
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.830
I mean, do my vertical leap went up like four inches.

58
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.480
I was putting up like two 50, like 20 times at once,

59
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.040
but it didn't help my jump shot. It didn't help. Like, yeah, it gave advantages.

60
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.470
But like that's my argument, baseball. It's like,

61
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.490
you still have to play the sport. Like all these events,

62
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.040
all these talks about it gives you an unfair advantage.

63
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:24.700
It's like kind of in baseball, kind of it does.

64
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.070
You still have to be so good at baseball.

65
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.440
