WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>And our fact in, um, you know, ancient China's, uh, like where, like, you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.940
their equivalent of like Washington DC,

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:07.830
like the white house was called the forbidden city.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.100
And you are not allowed into the forbidden city as a man,

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:13.110
unless you were a unit that's right. That's just water.

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.300
<v 1>It was so many Unix actually rose to have</v>

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.380
extreme power. Yeah. And, uh, and a lot of those dynasties,

8
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:22.370
what a lot of Chinese.

9
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.790
<v 0>Families would do back in the day is because the only way to get into the</v>

10
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.030
forbidden city and really get like an audience with the emperor at that time,

11
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:30.710
if they needed something, if they had like a beef,

12
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.490
they would take one of their sons and castrate them and cut their own balls off

13
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.970
with a hope that they would one day be allowed into the forbidden city and get

14
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:42.140
an audience with the emperor and then be able to tell the emperor to do,

15
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.720
you know, to, to, to help the family of the castrated.

16
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.500
<v 1>Boy out. So yeah,</v>

17
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.250
get revenge on whoever wrong them and get rid because now their Unix son has

18
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:52.250
power and has the emperor's ear and he tells the emperor, Hey,

19
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.990
we got to take out this landlord.

20
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.550
And really it's just the father who castrated his son, sent that son into the,

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.800
to the emperor's house with the hopes that one day that kid would have enough

22
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:05.720
power with his position.

23
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:09.890
So close to the emperor to get revenge on whoever wrong that family.

24
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.450
There is actually a famous uniq who we will get to who did that. Uh,

25
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.420
but it ended up, he never really, he, it didn't work out.

26
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.200
He didn't actually ever get revenge because as soon as he got made it to the,

27
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.730
uh, to get to the emperor that emperor passed away and so on. And so, yeah,

28
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.880
well.

29
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.130

33
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:38.780

00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:35.040
because his piece off his father cut his father cut his piece off because his

84
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.100
father had beef with his neighbors. And then unfortunately the emperor,

85
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:42.600
after three weeks into his surge, after he woke up, uh, the emperor died.

86
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.720
<v 1>So yeah, the new emperor didn't care.</v>

87
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.120
The cat made it all the way to the emperor's side, uh, to be as advisor.

88
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.230
And then the emperor died. So that kid, uh, he never got revenge for his family.

89
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.380
What are.

90
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.730
<v 0>You going to do? You know, that's a chance.</v>

00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:01.800
That that's how brutal history was that a father was like, you know what?

94
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.500
To get revenge on this beef. I have,

95
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.510
I'm going to cut my son's balls off in the hopes that maybe he will be

96
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:13.950
picked to be an advisor to the most powerful man in this region.

97
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.060
What a wild thing. That's not really a good dad like that.

98
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:22.080
Kid's going to have a lot of issues that therapy will not be able to solve.

99
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.630
Yeah. Like my going to walk in and be like, I have some issues with my dad.

100
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.040
He cut my nuts out.

101
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.470
<v 0>Yet. Well, here's the thing. My dad, I told you,</v>

102
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.950
I've told you guys on podcasts before was a compulsive gambler and still is a

103
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:35.250
compulsive gambler. And did unfortunately bet $800,

104
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:38.520
which was pretty close to my mom's life savings at the time on my gender,

105
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.240
he bet $800 and paid up to his friends that I was going to have a vagina.

106
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.400
And I did in fact, come up with a Dick and balls,

107
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.030
but at least my dad did not turn around and cut my balls off immediately to win

108
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:51.060
the bet. Hold on, hold on.

109
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.910
You got to have that ready. That's good. We're going to have that for future.

110
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.903
