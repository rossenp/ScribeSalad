WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.470
<v 0>Yeah. So the guy was just a little all over the place. Um, his,</v>

2
00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:12.200
his tour wasn't that tight, you know, we went on so many tours.

3
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:15.860
I started to like really rate the tour guide. Yeah. I put the tours together,

4
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:19.610
by the way, because I get a congrat or like a good job or something.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.350
You're just so good at it. Yeah.

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.350
You're so good at planning how we're going to see the kids.

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.880
<v 1>Thing. And y'all know, she mentioned this too,</v>

8
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:29.240
when we were sitting in mine plots on the last day, you know,

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.940
we had a flight to catch in about an hour and a half.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.380
<v 0>But you think the German company,</v>

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.920
the German government was alerted to us being there because they were like,

12
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:39.260
why are these two guys bopping around?

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.510
You're going to every single tour this city has to offer, who are these kids?

14
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.710
We just kept going on tours.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.510
<v 1>Yeah. You know, I, you know, me having my German roots and as being Greek kid,</v>

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.810
you know, Yanis just wants to like look at sculptures and you know,

17
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:55.400
he's just looking around, taking his time.

18
00:00:55.401 --> 00:01:00.350
He's always late for things and I'm just more anal with it. Cause the chairman.

19
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.820
So like I kind of,

20
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:06.380
after being four or five days and being almost late for everything the last day

21
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.190
I kind of, and Yanis mentioned this, I kind of was like, you know what?

22
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.863
Maybe I just want to,

23
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.350
maybe I just want to see what happens when I turn the temperature a blessing.

24
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.380
<v 0>Maybe I just want a fry. That's what happened? That's it? Yeah. Let me,</v>

25
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.280
let me just, let me just.

26
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.380
<v 1>See if I can just put some panko and breadcrumb on him.</v>

27
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.380
<v 0>Let me just throw him in the office. Yeah. That's it. You see, we figured,</v>

28
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.660
we figured out what's behind the German personality of the 1930s and

29
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:34.610
forties that led to Nazi-ism and fascism by our relations because yeah,

30
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.090
I was a little late. Chris is really organized with the tour.

31
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.470
Like we saw when we would go to sleep, we were sleeping. Basically.

32
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:44.540
We were sleeping in a hostel with these farmers. We slept.

33
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.610
<v 1>He literally had to, I'm a grown man with a family.</v>

34
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.330
Yonis is 43 years old about to get married and we've slept in twin beds.

35
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.380
Two twin beds.

36
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.790
<v 0>We did have a phone charge for the whole trip. I know. Well, I got.</v>

37
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.460
<v 1>That. You got to do dig. Get. Gave me the one for England.</v>

38
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.190
<v 0>Anyway. So Chris is just always the one like, okay. Cast that saw to sleep at,</v>

39
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.320
uh, 1300 hours,

40
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.150
Toby app at 7:15 AM because of how to go to the talk

41
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.740
FARs that forced the haircuts to York. When he was a young child,

42
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.480
you and Nick with dogs to wake up,

43
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:21.290
then he wakes up and he sounded the alarm will go on. And I'm a Greek kid.

44
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.600
We'll go ahead. Hey, listen, come on.

45
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.920
Having a cup of coffee drink is hanging out. We're just taking our time here,

46
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:31.190
baby. We'll relax. We're ready. Lux, philosophical, paperboard.

47
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.880
And he's going well, come on. I see.

48
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.820
<v 1>So the battle.</v>

49
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.210
<v 0>Between this went on for days until about the T the fourth day,</v>

50
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.180
Chris just kind of was running out of patience and that's when he slowly,

51
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.160
it's just, that's how Nazis it. They just kind of like pick your efficiency,

52
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:51.620
gets challenged and you just, by the fourth day,

53
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.660
you're just going ice and it just comes out.

54
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.920
<v 1>Yeah, because Yannis kept. Yeah. He, for some reason,</v>

55
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.890
ganas just kept the wrong way.

56
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.100
Even though the cars come the same way as the U S I don't even think you notice

57
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.590
it. You just kept thinking we're in England, you were looking the wrong way.

58
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.140
And we were crossing the street once walking back to the hotel. And I said,

59
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.900
let him just look the other way. And I wouldn't tell him a Cod's coming.

60
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.980
You were going to push me, weren't you.

61
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.260
I was just going to give a little push and then say, I don't know.

62
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.970
So that would happen. I just,

63
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.730
I hate that you walked into this Tufin strife and street.

64
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.980
