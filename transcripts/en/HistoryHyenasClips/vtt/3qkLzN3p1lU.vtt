00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.133
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.750
<v 1>We've been doing a lot of episodes that have been heavy on race and religion and</v>

3
00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:10.940
what the culture is doing. And we want you to take a break from that.

4
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:14.840
So today we thought we'd go right into sodomy with [inaudible]

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
. Let me tell you something about the marquee decide reality was a

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
 suggestion for this kid. This kid did whatever the he wanted. He was charismatic. He was, he was definitely manipulative. Overall. I think the kid was so 

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
sick. He day side. What, what, you know, first of all, you know, as Yoni

8
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
 said before, the word sadism statistics, statistic

9
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
, even some people say, you know, the, the big sex movements

10
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
, like 50 shades of gray and all that sexual evolution

11
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
 stuff, they say kind of begins with him, even though Marquis de shod was just a complete psychopath 

12
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
[inaudible], um,  was just a complete psychopath. And, uh,  and kind of the

13
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
, I don't think his victims thought this was sexy at all. I think they were

14
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
feared for their life. Um,

15
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
 he has a very interesting life. First of all, the kid was 14 years old and he fought in the seven 

16
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
years

17
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.840
 war. It's weird because he's mostly considered bad. He did a lot of horrible things. He got a lot of pleasure out of giving people pain, but then he created this whole genre of, that women kind of go crazy over because what is that movie called? Shades of gray? 50 shades of gray 

18
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.673
is art about sadism V is, is getting whipped hot.

19
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.460
<v 0>Um, isn't 50 shades of gray. Something like, uh, in the family of,</v>

20
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.043
is it isn't.

21
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.470
<v 1>VSA 50 shades of grays in the family. I think he does some,</v>

22
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.850
but it's not technically, I think it is. I think it's S and M I think it's SNM,

23
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.410
but it's definitely sadism light. Marquis de sod was doing grimy.

24
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.080
Shadae was doing grimy for years,

25
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:48.140
but he kind of only got busted when he got this too.

26
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.400
There's two named Rose Keller, not Helen Keller Rose Keller. Um,

27
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.560
and he basically, he got her in a room and he started really, you know,

28
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.630
beat, you know, beating the out of her. And, uh,

29
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.480
he was coming in her open wounds and flogging her,

30
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.390
which is what was done to him. But the, and Rose Keller escape,

31
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.670
when he went to go, have you want to go get food?

32
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.510
And she tied bedsheets and threw them out the window and escaped and went to the

33
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.380
police. And I believe the priests and the crime that she said,

34
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.900
she didn't mention the flogging and the sexual crimes.

35
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.590
He was thrown in jail and his crime started get exposed because she said he was

36
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:24.380
committing blasphemy. He was coming on my face,

37
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:27.770
but he was putting the cross on my face and coming on my face on the cross.

38
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:30.380
And he was coming on the crucifix. And that was the crime,

39
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:35.060
the biggest crime in 17 hundreds, France. Yeah. Which is wild.

40
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.020
I mean, that's when you cross the line, I mean, the guy was cut me and, uh,

41
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.870
pouring hot candle wax into my wounds. Um,

42
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.070
but when he went too far was when he got the crucifix involved.

43
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.030
I understand why, especially in 17th century France, it's like, you know,

44
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:53.810
you don't want me to get horny for Jesus, but you, every painting of Jesus,

45
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:56.870
he's just a hot buff dude. Yeah. I mean, that's like, what do you want me to do?

46
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.340
I mean, it's almost like he's asking for it. What do you want me to do? I mean,

47
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.710
this guy's, butt-naked hanging there. You know,

48
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.710
he's got abs and he's ripped up and he's always in like a little little Toga

49
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.900
thing. It's like, what am I supposed to do? Not move my monkey little bit.

50
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.030
I mean, cause there no, that's why I love Allah. Yeah. And here's the thing.

51
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.750
I mean, they, Jesus, at that time was in his thirties, you know,

52
00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:19.770
his metabolism had slowed down a little bit to the point where he wasn't that

53
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:21.000
repped. Right. I mean,

54
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.520
people are as Shaun King is complaining that they made him white,

55
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:24.151
but you know what else?

56
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:26.820
They made him that he wasn't was ripped because guess what?

57
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:30.960
They didn't have back then CrossFit. So how the did he get looking like that?

58
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:35.280
I mean, the guy was like a poor beggar on the street. The kid was not Jack.

59
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.240
He probably had a little bit of a hummus gut and he did not look like that.

60
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.200
He didn't a hundred percent did not 33 year old kid.

61
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:46.140
Doesn't have a little bit of a dad. Bod. Yeah. Did have a wife.

62
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.200
He wanted the wife. So there's every, everyone has to have a beard.

63
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.900
Everyone has to have a beard. And it's just one of those things where it's like,

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.420
you know, one man's trash is another man's treasure.

65
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.030
And he had a wife and the wife's mother.

66
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.980
So Marquis they shot his mother-in-law hated him and his nickname

67
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.230
for the mother one. And this is true. He could go, this was,

68
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:08.610
he called her the hyena, which is wild, a wild coincidence.

69
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:13.470
This kid was just like raping and abusing and hurting people for sexual

70
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:14.610
pleasure while jerked off.

71
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.320
And even he had problems with his mother-in-law even he gave into an old trope

72
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.950
of the mother-in-law that he, that he can't get along. Yeah.

73
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.230
And then at T it's like, how did the marquee day shot? Hey,

74
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.770
find love and not yeah.

75
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.730
120 days of Sodom and Justine were his two most famous works,

76
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.900
but make no mistake altogether. He's done like 10 novels, many books.

77
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.290
The kid wrote, one of them I think is like 1200 pages.

78
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.990
That's like 200 pages more than world. And he wrote them,

79
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.780
he wrote them mostly in jail. And he wrote the mostly in very,

80
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:48.120
very small print on toilet paper that had gotten the shale set.

81
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.980
And it was very interesting as one of Marquis de Shadae sons actually burned,

82
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.370
they say 90% of his work after he died.

83
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:59.850
So there's actually so much that we don't even know about Marquis de Shadae

84
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.570
cause it was just burned. Um, but yeah, but the one that,

85
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:07.320
the one that bothered me the most was the, the pregnancy one, that one,

86
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:11.730
which was, um, which was, uh, he said that he, he had a fantasy,

87
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:14.910
he wrote this story about a pregnant woman and him kidnapping her and tying her

88
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:18.390
to a table and stretching her out and mutilating her. And then, you know, sec,

89
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.660
uh,

90
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.500
raping her and then driving a hot metal spike through her stomach to kill her

91
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:25.800
and the baby. And that's how he would come. I mean, weirdo. Yeah.

92
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.690
I mean it's repetitive skinned alive, mutilated, genitals just brutal,

93
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:34.800
brutal, brutal. It's actually weird that people are split on the Markita side.

94
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.140
Some people think that, uh, you know, he,

95
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.050
he was a pioneer in accessing this dark side of our brain that,

96
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.360
uh, explores this sort of sexuality through this dark side.

97
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.470
And other people just think he was a psychopathic murderer who derived pleasure

98
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:53.730
from pain. And some people think both. I tend to think he's the latter. I mean,

99
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.310
how is this? How is this guy not a psychopath and bad?

100
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.550
It ended up blood was running through the streets, man, that they were guilty.

101
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.890
Meaning if you were rich, you lost your head.

102
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.890
And somehow he was able to charge his way charm his way,

103
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.150
not only to not get killed,

104
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.560
but to align himself with them and get in the government to have a position of

105
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.680
power by which when he, when he got that position,

106
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.510
he pardoned his in-laws who hated him. He parted his mother-in-law,

107
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.120
the hyena. He pardoned the hyena who hated him.

108
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.960
And it actually was said to give him pleasure to do that because she knew and

109
00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:31.300
how much they were kind of begging for their life. And he just,

110
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.600
when their name came up, because his in-laws came from a very,

111
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.520
he married into a very rich family, but his family had the, the, the, whatever,

112
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.000
the name, the title. So it said to think that she,

113
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.330
her family was happy because they got the title and his family was happy cause

114
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:48.100
they married into some money. So it was a win-win for them.

115
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.110
Well muffin man of his victims,

116
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.280
even one of his victims who he with their father,

117
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.560
that girl's father came and tried to shoot him at point blank,

118
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.940
rage and miss how Frank said, PG gotta be the miss point, blank. This kid,

119
00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:04.090
for some reason, the sun always shined on him.

120
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.290
And he was one of the most awful people in France at that time,

121
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.890
because you know,

122
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.930
at the highly visible finished last nice guys finish last and now,

123
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.740
and even still, here's the funny thing about my Markita son. He did hard here.

124
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.380
Maybe we didn't emphasize, emphasize the amount of horrible things he did.

125
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.440
I mean, he tortured these prostitutes. He tortured,

126
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:26.380
these girls hit the last girl. I told you she was 14.

127
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:30.370
He was her in the when he was 74. No boy, you would hurt people.

128
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.630
And that's how he got his pleasure.

129
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.620
And somehow he always evaded capture evaded,

130
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.460
evaded consequences. And then even after his death,

131
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.350
he's considered by many to be the pioneer of a sexual preference that a lot of

132
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:49.270
people indulge in Revere it, I mean, somehow this kid is charged, came to power,

133
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.540
right. He was actually hopeful that Napoleon was going to dig them.

134
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.090
But Napoleon went the other way and called him one of the most vile thing.

135
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.730
I think Napoleon, he said the most disgusting book,

136
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:04.210
the most deprived imagination has ever birthed. Yeah. And then, uh, yeah,

137
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:08.980
they sent it to Sharon Tohn asylum and that's where he was a 74 having a affair

138
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:09.731
with a 14 year old girl.

139
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:12.910
And he was so fat and disgusting by then from all the cars.

140
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.930
What part of hypersexuality was also over it? He just had to indulge always.

141
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.930
So all the eating and drinking, sitting in prison,

142
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.650
he weighed something like 300 pounds.

143
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.170
And he had this affair with this 14 year old girl who had died of a heart

144
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:24.004
attack.

145
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.180
Just not some point to someone just stabbed and killed his kid from all the

146
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:30.520
things he did, all the parents in these people. I mean,

147
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:31.331
a lot of the things he did,

148
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:34.270
he did to prostitutes and people who are lower class. And back then the,

149
00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:36.040
you know, the upper-class has looked at those people.

150
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:39.490
Like they weren't even people. So they're, they, they didn't really have any,

151
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.730
uh, recourse for, you know, a retribution.

152
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.460
But at some point someone could have just stabbed this guy, but he,

153
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.440
he survived through all this till 74 years old, doing all this foul,

154
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:54.670
foul that was not woke and dope. And at the end,

155
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.540
after he S he was let out of the, uh,

156
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.230
institution and then Napoleon puts them back into the asylum.

157
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.180
He continues to find a way to get his hands on a 14 year old girl.

158
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.440
And her. I mean, can someone stop this kid? I mean,

159
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.280
disgusting. It's all disgusting. Brutal. Yeah.

160
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.390
She was the daughter of a German psychiatrist, right? Who was a screw machine?

161
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.440
She was a no, no, no, no. The girl, I don't know the girl, his daughter,

162
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.630
she was the 14 year old daughter. Can you look that up real quick?

163
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.750
The last girl that he had affair with, uh, on the day that he died,

164
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:32.700
he died in his sleep. By the way earlier that day, he was having sodomy.

165
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.320
He was doing sodomy with a 14 year old girl as a 74 year old man. I mean,

166
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.450
how did he make it all more an employee at Sharon tiny asylum that he was at.

167
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.840
And then it wasn't until 1910. I believe.

168
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.140
So these hundred and 20 days of Sodom, which are very famous. Now,

169
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.860
nobody knew about them during his life because he had hid them inside a jail.

170
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.720
And it was found by IWiN Bach,

171
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:59.280
a German psychiatrist discovered 120 days of Sodom and potion in 1904.

172
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.800
So it's one of those things where he was famous,

173
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.590
a marquee day shot at the time for all his heinous crimes.

174
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:09.060
But this hundred and 20 days of Sodom, which they made a national treasure book.

175
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.380
What's found years,

176
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:13.710
hundreds of years after he died over a hundred years after he died. Yeah. And,

177
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.540
um, he, I think he is the personification of what they call Infinie.

178
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.650
His fame was, he was so kind of re repulsed.

179
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.130
He was so repulsive to people. So well known. He was infamous. I mean,

180
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:30.990
he Markita side is a name that lives on an infantry and they named

181
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:35.010
some after him. So you can't whoever's last,

182
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.490
name's not the Rona whoever's last name is, was sod.

183
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.070
They probably just change your name. Now, is there any sod yet?

184
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.830
Or you have to pronounce it. Shadae spelled the same way.

185
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.330
So he's sort of the father of BD M which is a,

186
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.280
discipline domination, and some, Oh, he's the father of sadism now, uh,

187
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.670
say to us or not, now this is say this, this is what they say about themselves.

188
00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:00.360
They say, they're not psychopaths or sociopaths. They're just,

189
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.490
they're in the pain. So, and I guess there are people who are into that.

190
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.720
I am not, I am not into that. I do not like to mix my pain with pleasure.

191
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.910
I'm a soft Kesser,

192
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:16.260
I'll give you some Eskimo kisses and I will cuddle and I'll blow on your face,

193
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.230
but I'm definitely not going to, it happened to me once where a woman was like,

194
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.650
hit me, like, cause people are into it. I was, I was with a woman way back,

195
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:26.340
way long time ago, long, long, long time ago, long time ago. Very long,

196
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:28.590
long time ago before I met my wife. I mean,

197
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:31.230
before I even knew she existed long before she was even born.

198
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.540
And this girl asked, she was like, she wants, she was like hit me.

199
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.950
And it was like, I turned into like Woody Allen. I was like, I can't sorry.

200
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.060
I'm just it's too much for me. I just turned into a real geek. Yeah.
