00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>When you were in Thailand, did you see any lady boys? I did not know.</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.313
That was kind of.

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.340
<v 1>Yeah. Push it to the limit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Brody Stevens,</v>

4
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.590
a great light Brody Stevens, funniest, Instagram clip.

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.090
You said he pushed it to the limit in times.

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.170
Like I push it to the limit and that culture and I pushed it to the limb. Mr.

7
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.540
Little Aster was like, what do you mean? He's like, I push it to the limit.

8
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.991
It's like, well,

9
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:21.050
I should say I pushed and pushed to the limit in Thailand with the lady.

10
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.900
<v 0>I mean, by the way, Thailand fascinating, you know,</v>

11
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:30.890
you go to China and there's the three T's. You can't bring up what? Right.

12
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.320
Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiana, Tiananmen square. And then you think like,

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.770
as Americans, you think, Oh wow, there's this restriction.

14
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:42.860
There's this government influence. And by the way,

15
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.000
they have a rating scale of behavior for individuals.

16
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.140
There's facial recognition. It's like, it's stuff that freaks you out.

17
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.150
And then we went to Thailand and Thailand. There's a,

18
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.950
it's a royalty, right? It's a,

19
00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:02.390
it's a funeral system and there's billboards up of the King around.

20
00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:04.310
And you're like, what is that guy in the movie? And they're like, no,

21
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:08.630
that's the King. And they're like, can't talk about the King. And you're like,

22
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.110
we can't talk about the King. They're like, you can't talk about that.

23
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.410
Can't bring up King. And I you're like, well, that seems silly. Yeah.

24
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.030
And then you go to Singapore and you go, and they're like, you can't chew gum.

25
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.190
You know? Like it makes communist trying to appear like

26
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.870
rational adults. Yeah.

27
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.910
<v 1>You know what I mean? It's like, you can't catch.</v>

28
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.960
<v 0>Singapore. You can't chew gum. What's the reason, uh,</v>

29
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.000
I think it's filth. It's a clean city, right? It's a point city,

30
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.470
but you know, I mean, so was soul. So is, uh, Tokyo.

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.720
But, uh, and again, I was in Singapore two days. What do I know about Singapore?

32
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.350
Nothing. Yeah. But it's like, that's pretty weird. Yeah. I mean,

33
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.580
that's pretty strange. You can, you know, you can't treat gum prostitution.

34
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.760
There's some prostitutes bouncing around, you know, like with my kids, I'm like,

35
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.780
don't talk to that lady. You know what I mean? It's not like it's rampant,

36
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.170
but it's like Singapore. It's like Vegas where they're like, you know what?

37
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.480
Let's get rid of gum. Yeah.

38
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.630
<v 1>In Japan. Aren't you not allowed to talk on the train?</v>

39
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.120
<v 0>I dunno. It wasn't on the tray. I wasn't on the tray, Japanese, uh,</v>

40
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.200
culture. Very interesting. Like, um, you know, the,

41
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:25.010
the cabs they opened the door for you, you don't open the door.

42
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.200
They get right out and open. But no, no.

43
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:29.870
There's a lever on the inside where the door opens.

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.330
And then there's a lot of culture of like put the card down there.

45
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:40.040
Like essentially I don't want to touch you white beast kind of stuff.

46
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.600
Interesting. But it's fascinating. You know, Korea,

47
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.920
Japan, everyone's very dolled up, like dressed up.

48
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:53.780
Like you're like the bouncer and he looks great and it's

49
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:57.170
not like he's had a nightclub. You know what I mean? It's bouncers

50
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.210
fascinating because you've been everywhere. You've, you've kind of,

51
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.720
you think you've been like all over the, almost every place. And I mean,

52
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:08.980
I wish I wish I was in South America. I want to go to, I want to go to India.

53
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.030
I want to go to South America. You think of fans there? I don't probably not.

54
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.140
But, uh, fans and Taiwan, India,

55
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:21.130
the unifying language is English. But I think what I had heard is that,

56
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.210
you know, there's good comedians that are Indians,

57
00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:28.360
so they don't need know name one, but I don't know.

58
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.270
<v 1>No, but my</v>

59
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.680
son Manasseh, no.

60
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.210
<v 0>So there's, they don't. And,</v>

61
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:43.110
and some of it is the economy of these places, supposedly. And, uh,

62
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.550
like I wanted to go to the Philippines and, uh, um, it didn't work out,

63
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:51.510
but like supposedly the Philippines, like people can't like,

64
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.440
whereas in Singapore, I think the ticket was a hundred us dollars.

65
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.580
Whereas in like the Philippines, it's like 10.

66
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:03.900
And if you're trying to pay for a flight there, you know, that's a lot of money.

67
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.070
Holy. A hundred. So it's like, but it's, it's, you know,

68
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:11.670
international shows I performed in Athens. I said, hi to all your family.

69
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.800
And uh, but tonight email you tell me about it. Yeah. It was amazing.

70
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.320
And because most of the audience you go to,

71
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:23.430
you do these international shows and some of the audience is,

72
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.470
uh ex-pat. And some of it is say, uh, people that, you know,

73
00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:31.650
studied in America or studied in Canada or something like that.

74
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.520
But in an Athens, it was a lot of,

75
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.800
it was a lot of, uh,

76
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.630
Greeks that spoke English as a second language didn't necessarily,

77
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.520
uh, study in the U S I mean,

78
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:48.150
obviously the Greek and American community is very close. You know,

79
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.700
everyone has a relative there or here, or you're a Maine,

80
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.420
but it was pretty interesting. Like, it's like, that's definitely a place,

81
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.050
you know, for, you know, uh, Yonis and you know,

82
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.430
like you've have that character.

83
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.580
But I think you said like that character might not work in Greece,

84
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.910
Turkey. He can't even go over there.

85
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.220
So there's Turkish people that send him death threats. Well, no,

86
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:11.830
actually Greeks I've gotten Greek death threats from that character. Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.360
Cause they just, Greeks Greeks are very prideful. Yeah. He probably got that.

88
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.150
Yeah. And they just feel like the character makes Greeks look bad.

89
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.370
Cause I kinda, you know, th th th the characters,

90
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:22.350
all the foibles of Greek culture, right.

91
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.050
Wrapped up in one such like an international comedian,

92
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:26.250
like you've got fans all over the world,

93
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.350
who've ever shown up to a country or a city where like,

94
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.300
just majority of the audience didn't speak English.

95
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:33.870
And you just had a really tough time. Well, I mean, it's,

96
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.260
I think there's different, uh, different.

97
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:39.300
And I appreciate you saying that, but like,

98
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:44.100
I'm just doing it cause I like to travel, but like, it depends on the situation.

99
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.510
<v 1>Selling tickets. I mean, you were playing kick moves. Tickets, Jimmy, Jimmy,</v>

100
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.820
Gavin Jimmy G the kid does not have a day job. You dumb British man

101
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.160
sells tickets. It, I think.

102
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.020
<v 0>I think performing in the UK is weirder than performing in Copenhagen.</v>

103
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.213
Wow.

104
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.500
Because I think that in Copenhagen or, uh,

105
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.370
Athens,

106
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.180
people that are going to learn English have consumed American entertainment.

107
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.160
Whereas the UK, they have their own culture. Like I think like what works,

108
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.230
uh, you know, uh, you know, I mean, not to get too nerdy, but like,

109
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:26.000
I think the British love,

110
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.190
they love super intellectual and they love,

111
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.440
uh, American anger. Right? So they love bill burrow. They loved bill Hicks.

112
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.060
You know, they love Louis Black,

113
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.470
but like an observational guy like me, uh,

114
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:46.250
it's not as, uh, like they've got their own version of it. You know what I mean?

115
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.320
So I think, um, but other countries where they don't, yeah,

116
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.430
they don't, uh, do subtitles. So like Scandinavia, they don't,

117
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.400
they just put the American shows on, they don't do subtitles.

118
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:02.570
Whereas in France and Germany, they would dub them. There's 60 million people.

119
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:03.410
Why not? It.

120
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.270
<v 1>Might as well. Well, yeah, cause to, I mean, you know me,</v>

121
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.060
I've told you honestly, and anytime anybody asks, like, who's your career?

122
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:12.940
Who do you want your career to get to? And it's always you,

123
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:15.760
because I see like how you take your family everywhere.

124
00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:18.550
And like that experience. I, you know, cause I got a three-year-old daughter.

125
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:23.440
I'm always thinking about like that experience for your kids must be like nuts.

126
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.550
It's beautiful. It's like, I will, I would argue, like,

127
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:28.690
I know you said it was spring break,

128
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:31.960
but like taking your kids to those countries, even taking them out of school,

129
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.621
if you had to,

130
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:36.190
would be more educational and better for them as humans than learning algebra.

131
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.173
But nobody gives.

132
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.500
<v 0>I think so. I mean,</v>

133
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:42.640
I think that's why I also want to go because there's moments like in Thailand

134
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.700
where we're like driving through Thailand and I'm like,

135
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.200
I'd take my phones away and I'm like, look out the window. They're like, yeah.

136
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.470
And I'm like, yeah, this is, you know, you know, uh,

137
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.180
Newark is pretty nice compared to this, you know what I mean? It's like, uh,

138
00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.890
by the way, no criticism of Newark,

139
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.540
but the point is point it's like people,

140
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:07.960
you know, in some of these countries it's like, wow. Yeah,

141
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.850
it must be fascinating for your kids.

142
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:13.930
Like when they come to work with you and you go into a arena where the bucks

143
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:18.340
play, you're like, daddy's going to work. It's insane. And go back to school,

144
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.930
dad's truck routes. They, they, they have, you know,

145
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.390
they have no idea and then they cool. And then,

146
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.300
and then they're kind of like, you know, my 13 year old, son's like, you know,

147
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.380
who's really funny.

148
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.290
<v 1>I was going to say that kid is hilarious when you put them on Instagram.</v>

149
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:40.180
<v 0>He's really funny. Yeah. And so like, I have the, you know, um, but it's weird.</v>

150
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.190
Cause like my dad was like a small town banker, you know? It's like you guys,

151
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:49.960
you know, you know, like, uh, you know, there's nothing prepare you to be the,

152
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.660
a parent who's in the entertainment industry,

153
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:57.330
unless you're where your parents in that environment. So it's like, it's just,

154
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.840
it's weird. Yeah. You go into parent teacher conferences and they're like,

155
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.610
they're funny. And you're like, I want them to know.

156
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.960
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But that's like, that's like, you know, you mentioned like,</v>

157
00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:08.660
you know your boy on Instagram and your kids on Instagram. You know,

158
00:09:08.661 --> 00:09:11.060
when my daughter was first born, I put a picture of her on Instagram,

159
00:09:11.061 --> 00:09:12.890
on my mother was like, you can't do that.

160
00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:15.200
You can't put your children on Instagram. And then I was like,

161
00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:16.460
look at Jim Gaffigan's Instagram.

162
00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:19.400
I was just like your kid doing something funny with like sucking a noodle.

163
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.000
And she was like, Oh, it's all right. She loves it. She's like, it's all right.

164
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.800
<v 0>Wait, I think that like, I mean, judging from your daughter's personality,</v>

165
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:28.850
she probably loves it. Yeah.

166
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.410
<v 1>She loves it. And you know what? I don't,</v>

167
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.370
I don't just personally like me cause I only got one kid and then you don't have

168
00:09:34.371 --> 00:09:37.640
to pay her either. Exactly. I'm going to keep all that money. If she goes viral,

169
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.640
it's nice check. The kid moves tickets.

170
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:43.220
Your daughter gets like daughter moves tick yet.

171
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.720
But I got a group chat with my mom, my dad, my step-mom, uh,

172
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.230
my daughter's mother and my daughter's grandmother, her mother's side. And I,

173
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.660
I send a video to that group chat and they,

174
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.890
they all have to approve it before I post it because I don't want it anything to

175
00:09:57.891 --> 00:09:59.810
be like, Oh, what now? Everybody's like, okay,

176
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.680
this is okay to post that's like the definite legal departments.

177
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.970
And the only time, the only time it, you know, if somebody like,

178
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.680
if like my dad's like, I don't think so. I'm like,

179
00:10:09.681 --> 00:10:13.970
why don't you just go gamble my money back to the group chat,

180
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.103
Tony balls.

181
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.670
<v 0>There was something strange because like, there was like,</v>

182
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.050
