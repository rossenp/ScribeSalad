00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>Let's do scratch by rodeo. I wrote a love letter to my, to my partner, Shawn,</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:08.070
Terry, but I would like to confess that I'm also gay at the moment. Um,

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.370
Rhodes is all red and violence. All blow my life. Change what you gave me,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.160
your glow. You it to do it.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.360
Happy daddy way. Now I can tell you 100%. I'm definitely gay.

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.760
You're a good rapper. Oh, what else? Roses. Uh,

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.960
you go rap, bro. Ah, roses are red. Violets are blue.

8
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:37.420
Roses are red. Violets are blue roses,

9
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.220
all red. I um,

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.960
since you moved away, I wish I was dead and it's a,

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.430
it's another good rap song. Um, I love you so much.

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.980
Let's kiss on the lips. Absolutely hat. That's cash on their laps.

13
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.100
And then maybe one day I'll buy your tickets to see Chrissy hips.

14
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.670
I liked the way you rhymed everything. My poems don't them. I write my poems.

15
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.380
They're more old school like Scottish. Like I don't do the rhyming. I just.

16
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.190
I just go from the heart. I just talk from the heart. Let me talk to him.

17
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:14.780
To him. I've talked from the heart talking to heart. Uh,

18
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.250
did they have to my deal, my friend Sharjah, Patty, Patrick Mulroney,

19
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.130
a flat 14 friend of mine. You know, we've been in the same firehouse.

20
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.600
We've been doing fight fires.

21
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.190
We've been fighting fires together for a long time, long time.

22
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.830
We do a lot of overtime jobs, little part time jobs together on the side. Yeah.

23
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
Uh, I love the guy when we're playing flag football against the cops.

24
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.520
I like seeing him on the other line on it.

25
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.760
I'm decide knowing that the outside linebackers, a potty.

26
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.120
We're going to take down a couple of these cops. I'm like, yeah.

27
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.420
I like going to the Lake. See what him and not remembering it. Yeah.

28
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.700
I liked that. I liked that. I liked that.

29
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.440
I also liked that we share the same politics that also makes me feel warm.

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.850
It feels good to somebody.

31
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.960
I could just vent about the Democrats show buddy.

32
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:07.190
I tried it's okay. Yeah.

33
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:12.050
I can safely just call someone a democratic vegan and I ain't feel safe.

34
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200
Let's just call it. Just start calling these guys avocado. Yeah.

35
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.120
If I just call a a guy, a yeah, a bean burrito. A avocado.

36
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.120
It's nice that I can be around Patty. You feel safe? Yeah.

37
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.070
So it's a good place to also vent about people of certain ethnicities. Yeah.

38
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:32.330
It gives me a safe place for that. Roses are red violets. All roses are red.

39
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.780
Violets are blue. If Trump don't win again. Yeah.

40
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.671
Start off with it.

41
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:41.090
You find somebody that has the same level of enthusiasm for president Trump.

42
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.440
And so that's why I love Patty and that's why I miss Patty and we haven't been

43
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:47.180
hanging out. That's why you might vowel in time.

44
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.500
It's because you just another Republican firefighter and I just love hanging out

45
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:55.140
with you and drinking beer. I just wanted to say happy Valentine's day that Tim,

46
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.960
I just want to go to the salty dog and drink beer. I wore it. Yeah. I liked,

47
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.730
I liked not remembering things with you.
