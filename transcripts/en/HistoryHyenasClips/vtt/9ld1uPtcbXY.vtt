1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>When you do, like if me and Yonis, we're going to fight. Cause we're like, it.</v>

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:07.020
We got to get to a duel bro. The point of it, it's all.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.670
It's all about go Randall's Island,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.980
somebody at our doorstep in the modern day. Dull somebody else, world star.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.680
Yo, check out this little fact. Oh, sorry guy. I dual, you know,

6
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.880
it's just fan duel. You got,

7
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.240
I got Chris for 500. Yeah. Yannis was four 50.

8
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.480
I I think is a good bet. So with a dual,

9
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:37.890
what the whole point of it was man to man thing like Alexander Hamilton versus

10
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.220
Aaron Burr. You take whatever it is. Five patients or 10 paces, you know,

11
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:42.900
there's a referee. It's, it's illegal,

12
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:47.520
but there's like somebody there watching the point is just to man up and just

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.470
say that you faced the gun.

14
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:52.890
You're supposed to shoot to miss a gentleman's doulas to shoot to miss.

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.830
Really absolute. Apparently Aaron Burr wanted to kill Hamilton.

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.630
This is where the, yeah. In the, in the whole, in the musical,

17
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:02.160
they make it seem like he feels really guilty.

18
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.490
But I think in real life he did not give a fry. I think he was like,

19
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:06.780
I'm glad he was Hamilton mist. And Hamilton was a,

20
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.480
was a veteran of the continental army so he could have killed him.

21
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.540
But he thought it was gentlemen still. So he shot over his shoulder,

22
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.060
which is what you're supposed to do. And then Berg killed Hamilton.

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.860
So that what Aaron Berg wasn't necessarily Ehrenberg Oh yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

24
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.040
Ehrenberg he's like a Hamilton. Where are you from? Jesus. I wish he would've.

25
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.120
If I'd said I'm just kidding. I bought it.

26
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.170
I bought it. I bought up kidding around with Tangerine, hit it around.

27
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.240
Okay. I'm just kidding. I was

28
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.330
[inaudible] with the bat,

29
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.820
you know like when they baseball players put weights on the bat and then we just

30
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.540
[inaudible] it's all going to get edited out podcasts.

31
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.050
Are you giving your people more work?

32
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.530
Say it cause it's something good will happen after this.

33
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.040
We're just getting more, you know, it's funny though. Five minutes in four,

34
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.720
four guys who were really smart back then,

35
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.690
and those guys really enlightened the founding fathers, uh,

36
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.040
th the dual as a method to test your manhood is one of the dumbest

37
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.680
things. Yeah. It's like,

38
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:19.850
let's just put on stockings and Thanksgiving shoes and paced around in a field.

39
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:22.370
And we Hawk in New Jersey and then shoot and shoot at each other.

40
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.360
But to miss for some, with wigs on we do it. Just have a fistfight guy. Yeah.

41
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.080
You know, just have you just play a game of Dodge ball against each other. Yeah.

42
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.580
We just wrestle each other and see who comes first. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

43
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.910
You shoot alone. You shoot alone. You're back. Like I'm the man.

44
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.290
I'm the man in this situation. I came first. Yeah, we got,

45
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.620
we should do a history on duals because I'm very curious how they started Aaron.

46
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.340
Aaron Burr was supposedly, so he should, we killed Hamilton.

47
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.790
And then he also got in trouble. I think he got out of it, but for treason.

48
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.320
So it's like, you, you kill it. You kill a founding father.

49
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.090
Then you get in trouble for trees.

50
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.020
I think that his career just like fizzled out.

51
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.280
<v 1>Yeah. Well he was upset at, um, Aaron was upset with, uh,</v>

52
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.390
Hamilton for such a long time because he thought that, uh, Hamilton, who,

53
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.100
who was, uh, very famous,

54
00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:14.700
like writing all these essays about him was the reason why he was losing certain

55
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.570
elections. Yeah.

56
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.291
<v 0>Yeah. Because he didn't,</v>

57
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:20.040
he didn't Hamilton have influence in what is like considered now to be like the

58
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:21.930
post role. Really?

59
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.280
<v 1>He was writing all this stuff and then he's like, you cost me an election.</v>

60
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.590
He thought he was going to get a presidency and he did it.

61
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.800
And then he ended up being a VP.

62
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.720
<v 0>I guarantee you, he.</v>

63
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.030
<v 1>Came at him. He was like, yo, let's go for a duel.</v>

64
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.940
<v 0>Yeah. We talk a lot.</v>

65
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.310
Even now like this person, I guarantee you in real life,

66
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.280
we would all like Alexander Hamilton better than Ehrenberg. Cause even that,

67
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:50.880
like, you cost me the election. It's like, it's no shut the up.

68
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.240
No I didn't. It's like you look at typical.

69
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.080
You blaming all your problems on everybody else. It's your fault.

70
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.980
He was going to be infected in about 50 years. No minorities.

71
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.570
I told Aaron Burr to look in the mirror,

72
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.190
but the beer wasn't hasn't been invented yet.

73
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.100
They didn't have mirrors back then. I think you just have to look at a pond.

74
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.830
You just hired a guy who looked like what happened? Did they have beers around?

75
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.160
They definitely had heroes after the app, before they had guns. They, you know,

76
00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:19.740
what's funny is they did the dual and I think it was Weehawken,

77
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.640
which is where Joe Mackie used to live. He still lives there. Oh my God.

78
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.130
I just think it's funny that even back then, they were like, no,

79
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:30.060
you take this to Jersey. You don't do that. You don't do a fight in New York.

80
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:34.890
You take your garbage. You guys are going to do some dumb. Go to Jersey

81
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.670
spot of where the duel was. And we all can it's there.

82
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:41.190
Like we gotta go on a cute hunt there.

83
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.850
<v 1>And he was allowed to have duals in New York. That's what I heard. But, um.</v>

84
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.800
<v 0>No, it's illegal. What they did that dual was illegal,</v>

85
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.980
but some bulls were legal, New Jersey. And then they went to New Jersey.

86
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.190
<v 1>It was legal in New York. And then it took a day for him to die.</v>

87
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.850
Like Hamilton missed. He did it. He was a gentleman and he meant, okay.

88
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.720
<v 0>That's what he said. And he wouldn't have missed because he was a war hero.</v>

89
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.090
up and burn a shot to kill like a little that he is. And then blamed.

90
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.700
<v 1>It took a day for him to die. He went back to New York and he died like a daily.</v>

91
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.210
Okay.

92
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.680
<v 0>It must've sucked so much to be alive back then she just bleed out for a day</v>

93
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.590
until you die. But y'all, if that was your Chrissy,

94
00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:18.600
you probably would've done the same thing. Right? What do you mean? Like,

95
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.350
let's say you got shot in Houston where he got shot in Minnesota. You'd be like,

96
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.230
yeah. Yeah. You just, please get me on a plane. Back to JFK.

97
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.800
I don't care if I die on a runway at LaGuardia, just let me die.

98
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.490
I would start pulling fat reserves out of my butt to stay alive until I,

99
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.660
as soon as I got up to New York,

100
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.780
Aspace my heart would stop beating plain and simple.

101
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.180
The good news is the bad news is Chris is dead.

102
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:42.390
The good news is we got him out of the improv, which is all.

103
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:46.710
I want you to get buried next to a funny bone. Yeah. Oh God.

104
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.000
You have can imagine someone gives you a eulogy next to a strip mall. Yeah.

105
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.370
Sorry guys. We're serving. Cinnabons that's all there is around here. God,

106
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.610
it'd be, if I have a heart attack, if it's in a mall at a mall club, that's all.

107
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:05.210
I just don't want to happen. I don't want to die next to like a cheesecake.

108
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.220
Yeah. I don't, I don't want to,

109
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.670
I don't want them to be banging on the door of a LA Kinta. Yeah. Sam,

110
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.640
the show is 10 minutes ago. roped.

111
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.800
I just I'm in a closet with a belt around my neck.

112
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.550
