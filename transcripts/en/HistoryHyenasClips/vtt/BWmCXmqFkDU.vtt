<v 0>Julius Pope Julius, the first, no relation to orange Julius,</v>

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:06.900
the drink shop chose December 25th to be Christmas.

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:10.560
It is commonly believed that the church chose this date in an effort to adopt

4
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.910
and absorb the tradition of the pagan center. Nali, a festival, Santa Alia.

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:18.620
It sounds like something Sergio should coma dance. Yeah, here's the thing.

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.270
I mean, what are the chances now? I believe in God. I really do. Now.

7
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:26.660
You believe in God, you have the baby almost died. Now you believe in God.

8
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:29.240
I've had mold life and death experiences.

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.300
I took an old clown up in a old sausage out of fridge.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.610
I had my heart rate go down to 20. I, you know,

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.500
they had to give me an adrenaline. Would you?

12
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.470
If there's no in between either your heart rate's too low or too high. Yeah. I,

13
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.170
when you can't figure it out, I got shot with a gun.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.320
I've been electrocuted by lightning. Oh, you can take an electric bike,

15
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.390
like struck by lightning. I've been shot with a gun. Now I got COVID.

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.570
I was never really in danger of dying from COVID. But if they,

17
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.330
if I didn't go to the hospital, my sodium levels that could have got weird.

18
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.700
You could have got weird, but it couldn't go up, but it didn't happen,

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.770
but they are kind of brushes with death. And um, yeah. I mean, I'm not,

20
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.700
I don't know if this is true, but there's definitely something bigger. Sure.

21
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.820
And, and it may be an too. I mean,

22
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:13.880
if you look at the way animals eat each other and the way things are and that

23
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.910
there's fumes in the world, he may be an. Could be,

24
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.080
God could be an because why make fumes? Humes are unnecessary.

25
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.980
Can't be God and hygienists. It's one of the things, one of the other,

26
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.860
but my question to you is Jesus Christ.

27
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.780
What are the chances he just was not mentally ill. Yeah.

28
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.500
Cause, cause I think I thought I was Jesus for about a week college. Jesus,

29
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.350
there is a many people and I ride the line. Yeah.

30
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:42.950
You ride the line because the dead sea scrolls, which, you know,

31
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.180
became popular when they got found, I don't know, 30, 40 years ago. Um,

32
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.160
they kind of say that the Jesus Christ Jesus, who, who the Bible goes,

33
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:56.750
who council of Nicea has picked as the Jesus that we know that guy who's painted

34
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.490
on my back was tattooed on my back. That guy,

35
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.990
that guy, you and Bobby DeNiro and Cape fear. Yeah. So that guy,

36
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.220
he was one of,

37
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.530
there were upwards of 12 to 15 people in that hundred year time saying they were

38
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:16.700
the Messiah. So council of Nicea just picked one. Just picked once.

39
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.410
No doubt about it. There was a man named Jesus doing what he was doing.

40
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.730
Jesus. I love the way you were pronounced it. Jesus, Jesus.

41
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.160
You hear the way he's saying it. Jesus, Jesus, us Jesus. Because, but,

42
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:34.250
but there was not a Puerto Rican [inaudible] there was a many people. Yeah.

43
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.470
Because make no mistake, make no mistake.

44
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:39.920
I just got a house on Staten Island and there's going to be a lot of weddings in

45
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.820
my back yard. Oh yeah. It's got a nice low interest rate.

46
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:45.440
Shout out the scumbag mortgage

47
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.780
[inaudible] does not Chrissy. Now you've already got legal things,

48
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.700
but to nobody I'm saying they're good.

49
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.880
I'm saying the 2.5 minutes called him a scumbag. No, no, but I mean,

50
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:59.440
I don't mean scrub. I mean, I shouldn't have said scumbag. I meant sleazy.

51
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.850
I mean, whatever, you come out with a 2.5 interest rate. Something's illegal,

52
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.900
but I'm listening. Yeah.

53
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.680
And I'm it in for the low rate because it got the ten-year-old old mortgage.

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.150
If I could put your, if I could make an analogy for your mouth,

55
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.420
it would be the wild West. Yes. You're jelly the kid you're yeah.

56
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.740
You're you're you're your mouth. Is this bang. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

57
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.980
What is Yosemite? Sam? It's almost like you got three mouths. Yeah.

58
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.940
Like Neil Brendan's three mikes. It's three mikes. I got over here.

59
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.440
You got trouble over here. And you got drama over here. Three bikes.

60
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.140
I got three miles. You should do a special where? Here you go. Okay.

61
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:35.070
Now I'm going to lie.

62
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.620
Now I'm going to tell the truth. Okay. Now here,

63
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:43.890
I'm going to tell you about my anxiety. That's true. I'm twitching.

64
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.290
I'm twitching night. Terrors night terrors. Yeah, no,

65
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.820
we're going to go over here where I'm, it's a spin the wheel baby.

66
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.820
I'm back together. Well baby's mama. Yeah, back there. My baby mama.

67
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.830
More mouths to feed. What can you do?

68
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:59.550
I got duped into buying a house on Staten Island. It's Christy three mikes.

69
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.060
You mean, is there a chance he wasn't mentally ill. I mean, I could,

70
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.120
I thought I was Jesus Christ for a little while with Jesus Christ.

71
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.810
That's an issue. Did you really genuinely think that your finger get that high?

72
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:12.600
That you started to hallucinate for real? No. When I was in college though,

73
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:16.680
I went to, I think I had a little moment where I had like a little megalomania.

74
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.200
Right. And I thought like, Oh my Jesus, you know, stresses,

75
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.350
things like that, you know? Yeah. Also do you think he could be an alien?

76
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.620
Could Jesus be an alien? Why the hell? Not because I mean, the,

77
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.160
the Israeli said that the aliens are real and they have a contract with them.

78
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.120
Maybe the contract started around now. It's very possible because yeah.

79
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:39.030
One guy always comes out and says that. I mean,

80
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.860
there's no aliens here. I mean, if they will, no, we're in a contract with them.

81
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:48.300
That's what the Israeli defense contract. They sat down with their lawyers. Yes.

82
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.730
With their alien lawyers. That's what they say.

83
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.760
Because people say all types of things. That's the problem with the internet.

84
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.690
That's why I got blocked by Dave Rubin because at one point, uh, you know, uh,

85
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.330
one point in, uh, November, he goes, if,

86
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.500
can we at least admit that the pandemic's over? And I just lost it.

87
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.900
My brother and we cried. We cried. We cried.

88
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:10.500
It's been a lot of atoning going on. It's what it is. Cut to Yani. Atonement.

89
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.680
Cause I'm on Molly right now. Yeah. That's what it is. I'm on Molly.

90
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.880
Nature's Molly, right? Yeah. Yani is on drugs right now. I will.

91
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.610
I want to touch all you guys. Yeah. Do you want some CBD gummies?

92
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.780
We got five CBD. Shut up. Five CBD. Everything's alive. Everything's alive.

93
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.390
These cameras are alive or we'll touch them. I'll get an erection.

94
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.520
These cameras. Yeah. Cause remember we're cosmic pinball machines.

95
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.530
I got therapy in one minute. Yeah.

96
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:37.410
You got therapy woman because Joanne positive is finishing later.

97
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.430
Cause we're having so much fun.

98
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.800
Do or do you got babies to pick up and are there Jews on the windows?

99
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.150
There's Jews on the windows? Yeah. I met. I'll see how long I can stay.

100
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.010
I got it. Even though I put it an offer on a house,

101
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.680
I'm taking a look at another house on Staten Island.

102
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.040
I actually got five minutes. What are you doing for Christmas?

103
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.100
I'm salute and Kamala Harris aides. That's what I'm doing too. Yeah.

104
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.820
I mean, I can't see my mud on Christmas. I'm not why not? Well, no,

105
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.830
because I don't think we're doing small indoors. I think we're going to do.

106
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.380
And we're going to do Thanksgiving and I don't actually know.

107
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:08.540
I think I am doing, we are going to do Christmas. Cause I mean, yeah,

108
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.210
the truth is Ridgewood is just, doesn't give a about the virus.

109
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.770
And the thing is, it seems like you just can't get it. I don't know. I'm still,

110
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.700
I'm still really I'm proceeding with caution, but I know, I do not know.

111
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.290
I mean it, there was a few times where it was like, how didn't you get it? Yeah.

112
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:26.540
I don't know. It's almost like pimp doesn't get it either. No,

113
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:31.430
but pimp is always strapped. Yeah. I mean she me strapped him strapped. Yeah.

114
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.280
Like I said, pimp walks around looking like he's about to paint the ceiling.

115
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.940
Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you RA daddy. I don't know. Yeah.

116
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.520
I don't know where we were on election.

117
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.930
That you were screaming at them for them to take their masks off.

118
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.560
And you invited another person in here. So my wife has got,

119
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:47.210
what is Chrissy doing? And I'm going,

120
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.550
the kid doesn't feel unless there's danger in the air. It's what it is.

121
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
