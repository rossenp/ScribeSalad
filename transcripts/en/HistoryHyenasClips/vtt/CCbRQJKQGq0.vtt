00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 0>Yeah, we're going to start off just by M and M in it saying, you know what,</v>

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.240
we're coming from a place of ignorance.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.340
This episode is just as much about us enlightening ourselves as it is about

4
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.620
us entertaining you. So go easy on us. This episode is going to be great.

5
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:22.310
Talking about the wonderful Ru Paul, um, who I love so much. I mean, you know,

6
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:24.230
if you watch our morning show every day,

7
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:27.230
a weapon in the morning available@patrion.com slash Bay Ridge boys.

8
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:28.280
We have a segment called work,

9
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:31.340
that girl where a Yonis and I sing and dance to her favorite, uh,

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.280
to her famous song work. Yeah. And that's only part of it.

11
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:38.720
The real thing to remember is that segment is all about celebrating women and

12
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:42.830
those who identify as women and their accomplishments throughout history.

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.160
Because let me tell you something, you're coming on. This podcast, low energy,

14
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:49.880
she got two options right now at two options only. Okay. Bob says,

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.150
listen to me either. I'm going to come over there. I'm gonna start caressing.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.770
You're nuts, Zack. Okay.

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.900
Or I'm going to give you an Eskimo kiss on your belly button,

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.390
even though I know the word Eskimo is derogatory right now.

19
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.910
And I'm sorry about that. So, which is going to be, you want to get your nuts,

20
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.030
your nuts are tickled or your belly button kissed by an Eskimo. I'm going to,

21
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:07.940
I'm going to go for, I'm gonna go for neither. Is there a third option?

22
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.750
We're going all the way to San Francisco in spirit from one of the most,

23
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.280
I would say, V would you call him? Wow. He goes by him,

24
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.450
Ru Paul.

25
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.830
That's his pronoun as maybe the most influential drag queen of all time.

26
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.810
I would say. Yeah. Father's day during pride month. It's like, right. I mean,

27
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.480
can we get rid of, look if we're going to rip down George Washington,

28
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.040
can we also rip down at some of these patriarchal nuclear family

29
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.780
holidays? Yeah. I mean,

30
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.650
that's so 1987 or even

31
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:43.340
1777 to even call someone father or celebrate them.

32
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.930
What are we celebrating? Exactly? What are we celebrating a dad?

33
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
Yeah. You know what dads did? They created a patriarchy.

34
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.440
You know what that patriarchy did. Okay. It oppressed people.

35
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.210
So let's get rid of it. I want to send my kid to a school that teaches that kid.

36
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:02.210
How to hate America and hate the father who pays for that school.

37
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.810
Would you joke it to RuPaul is a guy. You mean what? I jerked the RuPaul again?

38
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.390
Yeah. It's already half cousin. I mean, I've been a lot since 84.

39
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.950
Got better snap when you read, Oh, there we go. Yes, that's through it. He said,

40
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.880
you can call me. He, you could call me. She, you could call me Ray,

41
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.130
just a Kathy Lee. I don't care.

42
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.000
Just as long as you call me car.

43
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.740
I liked the that because being gay,

44
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.860
fine. Here's the thing. If you're gay, you're lucky. You're liberated.

45
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:37.820
You're liberated from these straight limits.

46
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.210
love it. I mean, my hair's moving again. Yeah. Your hair's movie.

47
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.480
That's how you do your Chrissy chaos. Cousin's quarantine. It's

48
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.870
David's mama, the kid Ru Paul. She came to New York city and in the eighties,

49
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.270
in New York city, no, but she said she doesn't matter.

50
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.510
Rumor doesn't matter that she wouldn't get Ruby. Doesn't matter.

51
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.000
In the mid 1980s, Ruby left the South,

52
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.410
headed to New York city and became part of a new festival known as a wig stock.

53
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.320
Um, and then, uh, Ru came to New York, uh,

54
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.780
to New York and became that popular fixture in the nightclub because the

55
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:11.230
nightclubs in the eighties, must've been fun. Fun, fun. Your brother,

56
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:14.470
your $3 bill brother was probably bopping around in the 1980s nightclubs.

57
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.720
And you may have bumped into RuPaul. Seriously. He might've.

58
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.780
What I love about the gay community is how very gated it is.

59
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.780
There's so much in the spectrum. It's like when you're a straight guy,

60
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:24.970
it's kind of boring. We're just kind of shut guys. You know,

61
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.490
some of us read and some of us don't. I mean,

62
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.860
because the gay world is really a Vegas buffet and to the left turn to the

63
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:35.710
right to let's play it on the run.

64
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.190
<v 1>Work it girl,</v>

65
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.140
do your thing on the runway.

66
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.330
Sorry to the right shots.

67
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.210
<v 0>So fierce became such an Anthem that she just skyrocketed to success and</v>

68
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.180
Coke, pop culture, fame. She got a talk show on MTV.

69
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.550
She was interviewing big time. Celebrities. Ru Paul was here. She has arrived.

70
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.990
Yeah. Y'all yes. So she made her feature, film, debut and spike Lee's um,

71
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.990
Crooklyn, um, good movie spike Lee's Crooklyn. Um,

72
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.580
she had her talk show variety show on VH1 in 1996 and what went through 98.

73
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.590
But then she really popped, I mean, really popped for our new pants in 2009,

74
00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:32.430
with the debut of the long running reality TV competition, Ru Paul's drag race,

75
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.880
which I was a fan of. Yeah. Here's the thing about,

76
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.360
I tried to get in Ru Paul Ru RuPaul skyrocket in the nineties, making them sick.

77
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.090
She was on like the cover of magazines and stuff. She skyrocketed nineties.

78
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.310
Then there was this kind of like plateau period.

79
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.680
She put out a couple more albums. They didn't do as great.

80
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.410
Even though one of the songs hit the charts, she was making music. I mean,

81
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:52.500
she did like three albums. Girl gets saved and get play in America.

82
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.480
You can be anything you want to be.

83
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.100
Somebody just made her a musician and she's a musician in America. There it is.

84
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:00.840
Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yon.

85
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.820
His quote is we are all born naked and the rest is drag

86
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.820
baby. Very true. As soon as you put clothes on,

87
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:10.410
you're in drag wearing drag right now,

88
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.270
it may be a different kind of drag than what you're used to,

89
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:15.930
but we in drag Bobo, it's kind of like the modern form of what Shakespeare said.

90
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:19.650
The world's a stage and we're all just playing apart because we're not,

91
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:23.460
we're all just dressing up for each other. Who's what's the true us.

92
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.410
What's the true you the true, true. You you're pretty close to the true.

93
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.680
You I've say I'm pretty close to the true me. I think the true me,

94
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.810
I think the true me is a guy who is very comfortable with themselves.

95
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.440
I think, uh, getting turned on by men, but you know, sexually attracted to him.

96
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.460
I mean, you're turned on by men. You always fly by that.
