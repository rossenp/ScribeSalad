00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>I feel like this is a theory,</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.640
you guys probably like there's like people to tell you how you feel about

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.670
something for, they say, um, Hey, you'll like this. It's like,

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.803
we'll decide to have to,

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.040
but is that a lot of the people that didn't grow up?

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.460
A lot of the people that set the rules of New York ethnic

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.630
non-identification grew up subconsciously in their mind.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.490
They want everybody to be the same so that they can recreate the bland,

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.940
suburban strip mall that they grew up in. Right.

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.610
So they had subconsciously doing it too. They're like, no,

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.240
we want everybody the same because that's how we grew up.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.110
So that means that's good. Right. Instead of going, I left there for a reason.

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.930
<v 1>That's interesting. I never thought about it that way.</v>

14
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.660
They probably have no choice. Now you're saying it's like a subconscious thing.

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.210
Cause that's how, that's what they know. That's how they're conditioned.

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.770
<v 0>They think they're being,</v>

17
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.670
they actually being 10 times more racist than anyone could ever be by not

18
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:59.210
identifying peoples. You know what I'm I always used to say celebrate diversity.

19
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.970
Don't put it out. People are different, you know? And so there,

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.990
you know what they mean?

21
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.380
It's just so obvious to me that there's something off with it.

22
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.230
<v 1>Yeah. Park slope is European. All right. it.</v>

23
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.290
<v 0>My brothers. No I'm saying, I like that.</v>

24
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.200
I like how the kids in my puppy is European. I liked that.

25
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.920
<v 1>Yeah. That's top level. Yeah. Yeah, because that's.</v>

26
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.920
<v 0>My brother said a half the kids in the class, they're from France.</v>

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.920
They moved in and moved back after a year. They stay like all his,

28
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.850
his daughter's friends in like sixth grade. I mean with seven,

29
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.650
eight year old kids, first grade, whatever it is, um, very advanced six. And um,

30
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.370
yeah, they're all from like different countries. Spain, France. Hey,

31
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:38.204
what are we losing?

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.720
<v 1>No, it was just reading about the trade. I mean the guy's like, no,</v>

33
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.600
I was just reading. I was way too comfortable. You listen to that.

34
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.820
I'm in the middle of trying to describe my brother's poor kid.

35
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.860
Trying to go to school, a friend to leave after a year.

36
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.560
[inaudible] On Instagram have been sober for how many years now?

37
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.520
I don't talk about that. Oh, sorry. Yeah. I mean, yeah.

38
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.340
A long time, a long time does that have to do with it?

39
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.430
I don't know because you name it all the bars, but you don't drink. I know,

40
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:05.900
but this was back when I was like young.

41
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.850
<v 0>Oh, and your boss don't exist anymore. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.480
<v 1>I remember we went into that bar in Dublin that the cheese sandwiches.</v>

43
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.330
And you said to me, you said you were like, you were like, Hey, let's go.

44
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:15.560
And I was like, all right, we go. And then you're like,

45
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:16.790
if I would've stayed in there another five minutes,

46
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.990
I would have been dead in six months

47
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.470
because it was bringing back memories because you said it looked like a bar in

48
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:22.250
park slope.

49
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.820
<v 0>You know? It's so true. Yeah. Only time. I mean, I quit drink in</v>

50
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.070
1983. I was born in 84. Say there we go. Yeah. But I'm telling you,

51
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.520
I bought, attended when I first got to, I mean,

52
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
I've been in a hundred million bars. The only time I felt that that feeling,

53
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.070
it was almost genetics was in that bar with him. Remember in Dublin? Yeah.

54
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.280
We walked in and I was like, Oh, cause they cheese sandwiches,

55
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:50.630
just plain cheese sandwiches. There was a rug. Like everybody's hanging out.

56
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.590
And.

57
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.930
<v 1>Those Irish guys, they look like they had like IRA guys.</v>

58
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.940
They were just sitting down with, uh, you know, like the pork salt. Yeah.

59
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.850
And you two used to go there and drink their Bano.

60
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.460
<v 0>Cause they were Irish bars and parks up. There was some old,</v>

61
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.090
Irish was some Italian boys and then it was just kid bars.

62
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.200
And then it was hippie bars. And then it was like, [inaudible] bars, you know.

63
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.620
<v 1>As far as surf brunch like they do now. No, no, but salad bar. I remember that.</v>

64
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:17.520
I used to hit that side.

65
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.820
My PA we used to go eat dinner at Moonies and there was a salad bar,

66
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.550
but it's all gone now. What is the Lululemon store now? What is it now?

67
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.550
This is like a Italian pizza place. Now what counties is. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. See,

68
00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:31.200
I, I, I'm not familiar with that park slope at all yet. Well,

69
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.640
I wish I was park slate.

70
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.710
It's fascinating because of what concepts is so diverse around the time I

71
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:42.330
grew up, it must be at some point like in that like eighties or nineties,

72
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.810
it must've been like one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the world.

73
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.540
And even, and also socioeconomically diverse,

74
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.610
which is like unique because you go one block that way you were in a totally

75
00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:55.680
different socioeconomic brag. When I was growing up,

76
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:57.720
it was like sixth Avenue was the cutoff line. Right.

77
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.900
You went down to fifth and you were like, what are you doing?

78
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.330
<v 0>And now fifth is the hot, hot oppose hope. Now seventh Avenue is deserted.</v>

79
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.570
Yeah. There's nobody. Even on the weekends. There's nobody on the street.

80
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.230
Fifth Avenue, seventh Avenue was hopping and fifth Avenue is hopping. Yeah.

81
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.170
<v 1>It used to be the absolute reverse, like seventh Avenue was like,</v>

82
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.490
and then it changed because when I was a kid, like all my block, we had the,

83
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.660
we had the, um, McCormick's the horns. I mean, it was all retired.

84
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:29.010
I wish cops and uh, Gargano's Italians. I mean,

85
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.510
everyone was sitting out on lawn chairs, we just play stoop ball. And uh,

86
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.420
and yeah. And like my, and then like, and then like the,

87
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.350
I think they were like park slope was like the first gentrified neighborhood by.

88
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.380
<v 0>People who grew up by people by parents.</v>

89
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.340
<v 1>To grow up in New York.</v>

90
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:48.600
And like other areas did something well or were ultra liberal hippies and then

91
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:50.970
moved to park slope. And they were like the progress.

92
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.680
They were like the first like woke kids.

93
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.490
Like those parents were like the first like, Hey, try. You know? And then like,

94
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.370
so they were mixed in with sort of like the Irish, well, I was going to say,

95
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:00.960
but what about like the old school cops? Even,

96
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:04.770
they were like more liberal woke cops. I was young when they were kind of like,

97
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.120
that was towards the end of that. Right.

98
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.760
<v 0>And even everybody was more,</v>

99
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.620
not so much if you wasn't, it was just, everybody was so mixed in,

100
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.580
right. That it was like a lot of people, like all the Italian guys,

101
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:21.400
like Carol street and all those guys, they were like serious people out of that.

102
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.830
But they would talk to black and Puerto Rican. Like there was sort of a mix,

103
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.060
even though it was, you know,

104
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:30.270
things could happen and everybody would know exactly where they stood,

105
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.440
but it was still people conversed or people would play ball together.

106
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.800
It was just a very, there was a very fluid line. There was, you know,

107
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.920
avenues and houses live next door to each other. So it wasn't like a,

108
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.630
it wasn't a very segregated.

109
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.970
<v 1>Yeah, no, it wasn't segregated. You saw each other,</v>

110
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:48.390
you kind of intermingled on basketball courts on corn. People knew each other.

111
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.350
It was very diverse. You think you're like, you know, smart and well-spoken,

112
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:54.480
and well-read now because of park slope, both of you guys,

113
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.410
because in my neighborhood, in Ridgewood, I mean, Patty fly balls, the kid just,

114
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.230
you know, he doesn't, we don't think like that. No. I think he,

115
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.420
parks slope has a lot to do with it. It was so much at such an early age.

116
00:06:04.421 --> 00:06:07.600
And like, yeah, that was the people who moved to park slope that was in the air.

117
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:09.250
That was the energy. It was intellectual.

118
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.040
And it's kind of like progressive thing.

119
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.310
<v 0>There's the St. Patrick's day parade in park slope. You're right. It's the,</v>

120
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.880
it's the biggest maybe. Is there one in Queens as it still go on?

121
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.170
<v 1>Can we use that phrase? I remember it like my whole life,</v>

122
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.940
because it would come down prospect park West,

123
00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:27.970
and I grew up between eighth and the park and we'd all run up and watch it.

124
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:28.780
The bagpipe,

125
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.860
something about bagpipes makes you just want to kill English people.

126
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.070
It's just what it is. Feel it in your bow, like something about it,

127
00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:38.620
shakes your bones. And, uh,

128
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.090
it was the first one you did the short one, the long story short.

129
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.100
It was so good.

130
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:48.280
But I remember I was sitting in the front and like cherry lane theater. I was,

131
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.680
I was hoping I was like, he knows who. I think he knows who I am.

132
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:54.580
I think he's looking at me, but you probably wouldn't. It was, it was so good.

133
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.480
It was when you, you, it was like on Broadway or like, bro,

134
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.830
I went and saw it there live, and then we saw it again when it was, uh,

135
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.220
you know, on, was it on HBO after that? Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.340
But that was the first of this new thing that you started,

137
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:11.380
you found that you were like, this is, you were able to.

138
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.860
<v 0>What you guys are doing. It's the same thing.</v>

139
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.490
History people act like with toy history, we're talking about today.

140
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:21.100
It's history. It's the same thing. Right, right, right.

141
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.520
<v 1>Well, but even, but that's always been calling saw if you watch his HBO special,</v>

142
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.460
I'm the first one where he's wearing the pirates jacket and I have a mullet and

143
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.390
he saying, he's got a model. The kid was a kid was a skinny kid, skinny kid.

144
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.180
He said he got punched through back then. It's good. It was a good look at kids.

145
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.140
It's skinny kids, a little thing called cocaine. Um, and so, no, I'm kidding.

146
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.620
I'm just kidding. So, so, so it's like, uh, so,

147
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.040
but even his style that even on where he sat on the stage and got off and it

148
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:49.270
wasn't history, but it was that style is unique to Collin. You know what I mean?

149
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.180
No, but that was much tries to do it now. It's not funny.

150
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.190
What's that sitting in that Hannah Gatsby trucks do it. It's just everywhere.

151
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.360
Just calls her to net. Yeah. She's the next one. That's going to write a review,

152
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:02.920
a positive review about us too, by the way.

153
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.700
She'll never be haunted by Hannah Gatsby.

154
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.870
Just the truth is I could just say quarter by Hannah Gatsby and put a picture of

155
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.040
honest his face and it looks like enough, like kind of gasping. What were you?

156
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.280
What's your favorite ones? My favorite are. I love them all,

157
00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:18.580
but my favorite is New York story. And uh, and, and the,

158
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.270
the first month long story short. Yeah. I love the way it ends in the car.

159
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.310
It's like, you know, my fallback is how favorite. My New York story.

160
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.430
<v 0>One was to me that when I was heading an ambulance with a heart attack and I</v>

161
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:34.150
thought I was dying, I was losing breath. Uh, what do you call that?

162
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:36.910
Respirating? What do you call it? A cardiac arrest. When you, when you start,

163
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:40.210
your breathing starts getting lower and lower. What's a medical term. Um,

164
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.350
dying shallow breath. Uh, but then there's that respirate I dunno,

165
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.000
I was literally like this and I was like, at least I got New York story out.

166
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.240
Wow. Really? Wow. That's how much I love New York,

167
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.680
because the way we all grew, I mean, you know, New York,

168
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.270
what it meant and to be able to say, Hey, guess what? This is not crazy.

169
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:01.110
This is that racist.

170
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.070
<v 1>Oh, shallow breath is how we grew up. Yeah. Like that was so.</v>

171
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.560
<v 0>For some reason, that meant more to me than any of it. You know what I mean?</v>

172
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.460
Yeah.

173
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.490
So you really thought that when you were laying there and I wrote about that and

174
00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:12.410

175
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.540

<v 1>I can't handle it. No, no, no,</v>

178
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.980

179
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.050
<v 0>Zico. He's like, I'm the medical guy.</v>

180
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.020
He looked at me for the answer and I didn't have it yet. I'm going to get it.

181
00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:30.860
Yeah. You're going to get it.

182
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.240
<v 1>Which I could have done. No, but you know, check,</v>

183
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.290
check the tape. I said this up, nobody listened. You guys were talking about.

184
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:40.700
And then I just had to fact check it. And I was

185
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.720
[inaudible] Mike, you heard me say Despina before I busted out the phone,

186
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.970
but they were too busy talking about college,

187
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:52.040
heart attack to realize what a true genius I am.

188
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.990
<v 0>Wrap up for all of us. For loving New York. Yeah.</v>

189
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.630
And instead it's about Despina.

190
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.190
<v 1>Yeah. Christie, the speeding the kid. I mean,</v>

191
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:05.480
he was talking about like the thoughts about the special he shot on his he's on

192
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:10.040
his death bed and you're gone, like I'm on dating apps Googling because I'm.

193
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.170
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. He's on web MD. Yeah.</v>

194
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.100
<v 1>So let's get it. So Colin is, he's in the ambulance, he's dying.</v>

195
00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:20.300
And he thinks in New York story.

196
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.570
<v 0>You'll show because I was like the love, the beauty of like,</v>

197
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.500
you draw the magic and just that everything was, you know,

198
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.530
intertwined in that way. And it's gone now.

199
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.460
It's just this thing where there's so many rules and regulations to what's

200
00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:38.780
appropriate and it just, yeah, it's dead. And I knew it last year,

201
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:42.140
my friend was, was he he's he does mold inspections.

202
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.980
So he's out in Bedford-Stuyvesant and I get a call from his phone and it's a

203
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:48.770
lady in East, New York, actually East New York, Brownsville,

204
00:10:48.771 --> 00:10:53.660
East New York lady calls me up black lady. It's like, Hey, um, did you,

205
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.000
uh, this phone, I see this number on the phone.

206
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.840
Some guy left his phone and I'm like, Oh, that's my friend. You're right.

207
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:05.000
And she goes, yeah. I mean, is he, is, is he a white guy? I'm sorry,

208
00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:07.070
but there was a white guy here earlier. And I was like,

209
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.600
this lady from Brownsville going, I'm sorry. It was your white guy. I was like,

210
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.280
if she's worried about being politically correct. He was somebody who favor,

211
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.220
you got to find that phone in Brownsville. It's over.

212
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.370
<v 1>Good part. You think there's any positivity to it?</v>

213
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.920
Do you think it's like the world's a better place or people trying to do good.

214
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.880
It's all bad.

215
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.450
<v 0>Well, I mean, I don't see the good part. I mean, you know, I think that, uh,</v>

216
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.740
I think it's just phony. Well, it's just, there's something about it.

217
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:37.490
That's just when you're not able to describe certain things it's fake,

218
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:39.290
you know what I mean? Yeah. It's just,

219
00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:41.990
there's something about it that just rubs me, my gut,

220
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.600
my gut instinct is that it's wrong, you know?
