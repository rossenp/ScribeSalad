00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>Well, you know, about the history of Christmas. Do you know of any,</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.520
I know it's a relatively recent phenomenon. I mean,

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.290
the idea that you would celebrate a birthday is also very modern in

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.120
Christianity. Your,

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
your birthday was assigned to the Christian name that you

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:17.880
received.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.680
So there'd be the th th th the day of the Saint for after whom you're

8
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.850
named. And so I was Christian, but there's no Saint Neil. So I was actually.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.880
<v 1>No matter when you go there, you're going to Canada.</v>

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.480
<v 0>Uh, this, I don't think anybody knows this. My, uh,</v>

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.990
my baptismal certificate says Cornelius, because there's a Saint Cornelius,

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.830
Cornelius de Grasse Tyson in the baptismal certificate,

13
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.090
but I'm otherwise Neal in my birth certificate. So, so your,

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.160
your, your birth was celebrated on the day, uh, ascribed to that Saint.

15
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.930
Um, so the idea of giving birth giving presence for a birthday is a,

16
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.080
is a relatively new now Christmas. All right.

17
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.150
This was a brilliant maneuver by the Catholic church back

18
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:08.330
when all Christians were Catholic. And so what do you do?

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.350
You got all these pagans that running around, uh,

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.350
they're doing their pagan stuff, dancing naked around them.

21
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.180
<v 1>Bonfire, pagan stuff. That's exactly what I was going to do with that,</v>

22
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.650
with your masterclass. I mean,

23
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:28.130
the pagans partied a lot better than the Christians. So here's what happened.

24
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.790
<v 0>So one of the set celebrations, um,</v>

25
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.710
w took place a few days after the first day of winter.

26
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.540
Okay. So, uh, today we're around that time, we're on the first day of winter.

27
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.020
Well, what's happening. I don't know if you noticed, but as the winter,

28
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.140
as you approach winter, the sun,

29
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.750
the arc of the sun from sunrise to sunset gets lower and lower in the sky

30
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.530
as the days go by. That's when the sun and it's in the summer,

31
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:01.730
sun is very high in the mid day in the winter. It's very low. Shadows are long.

32
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.660
The ancients notice this as you approach December 21st,

33
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.070
the arc got lower and lower and lower. And your sun worshiping civilization.

34
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.910
This is some scary stuff. Okay. Because if this keeps going,

35
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.320
the sun will dip below the horizon and never come up again. That's scary.

36
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.120
So what do you, do you pray to your gods and this,

37
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:25.220
the movement of the sun slows down. It stops.

38
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.630
So STIs, stationary,

39
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.290
sun armistice, stationary arms. Okay.

40
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.210
But it's Latin soul is the sun. This stops. So the sun stops getting lower.

41
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.430
And then you begin to notice it come back up.

42
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.580
That happens a few days after December 21st,

43
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.780
that happens around December 25th celebrations abound.

44
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.700
Now you want everyone to be monotheistic? Not multi-feed not,

45
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.710
um, Polly polytheistic.

46
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.030
So what you do is you co-opt

47
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.420
preexisting celebrations, smart move, just weren't moving. Yeah. Tactical,

48
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.030
tactical, marketing, strategic, all of the above. So you say, well,

49
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.930
um, while the birth of Jesus, we think of as a very important event today,

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.460
nowhere near as important as Easter, Easter,

51
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:19.900
that's the cannon right there.

52
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.770
That Jesus dying on the cross for your sins.

53
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.480
The fact that he was born is kind of incidental. Everyone's born,

54
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.260
not really Jesus Christ yet. He didn't do his miracles. He's a, did a baby.

55
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.440
Right. All right. So, but it was still an unassigned holiday.

56
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.340
So let's put the birth of Jesus. There it's an unknown date, by the way,

57
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:43.060
they think it might've been sometime in the spring based on descriptions,

58
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.860
shepherd, shepherd, shepherds. But, uh, and when they make the pecorino cheese.

59
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.170
<v 1>Yeah. Surfing</v>

60
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.673
[inaudible] gospel of Luke.

61
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.010
<v 0>Um, so, uh,</v>

62
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.870
so th th do you assign that now you can port people over

63
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.960
from whatever was the previous celebration to a Christian celebration,

64
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.060
and that enabled it to take a firm hold and Santa Claus would come much

65
00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:15.894
later. Of course.

66
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.060
<v 1>Well, what Santa Claus started to come?</v>

67
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:20.730
It's actually like anything else that happens great in this country,

68
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:25.500
it came out of New York city, baby 18th century, late 18th century, Thomas Nast.

69
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:30.450
He was a, um, uh, uh, civil war, union propaganda artist. And he created,

70
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.150
um, the, the idea of the image image.

71
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.550
It was really a union soldier with toy that weren't toys. It was like, um,

72
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.820
what was it in his sack? It was a military military equipment.

73
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:43.680
And 10 to midnight thing was like,

74
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:46.110
Senate is running out of time to re-enlist soldiers.

75
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.320
It's it was a whole propaganda read this long ago, but I forgotten all about it.

76
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.920
[inaudible] if I remember that illustration is very textured and rich. Yeah.

77
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.420
It's like totally in, right. I mean, he looks like a, just a drunk Irish kid.

78
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.330
Yeah, he does. He's just drunk.

79
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:09.540
Irish kid name should be showing he Donald. Yeah.

80
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.730
<v 0>Their traditions and rituals, we think are deep and long ago, but no,</v>

81
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.980
somebody just invented them. Right. And,

82
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.480
and even the Christmas tree is a secular thing. It's just the, uh,

83
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.630
but it was attached to the Christmas holidays. And so now you've got,

84
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.210
so the plenty of Jewish people have Christmas trees, right? Oh, no.

85
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:29.490
I grew up in Brooklyn Jews, a lot of Jews, my,

86
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:31.740
all my Jewish friends at Christmas trees. So you're Jewish, Greek,

87
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.530
I'm all Greek. But my friends, you said you were fourth Turkish.

88
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.700
<v 1>We got at the beginning of 26%, 26%. Now that counts as a force.</v>

89
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.290
And that's what answer by the way.

90
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.010
<v 0>26 Days. No, no, you're not getting 26 that's they told me no,</v>

91
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.860
it's twenty-five twenty-five. Yeah, because you only,

92
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.550
you can only split by twos, right? So you're 50%. Twenty-five percent,

93
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.770
12 and a half percent, one eighth, one 16th. You're not getting 26% 25,

94
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.010
unless you are Greek so long ago.

95
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 1>That it's split into a hundred parts and you can divide it that closest.</v>

96
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.380
And you're one fourth grade I'm 100% African

97
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.190
[inaudible] exploded. St. Nick was actually Turkey before use for you, baby.

98
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.030
It's a Turkish kid.

99
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.960
Saint Nicholas was born in two 88 D and petard on the Amidah in modern day

100
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.110
Turkey. So what are you going to do now? Touch wood. Again,

we really hope you enjoy it.
