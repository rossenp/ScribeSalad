00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>He lives in her heart. He lives in Staten Island. I live in Staten Island.</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.080
He lives in a Midtown big Trump building. Yeah. He doesn't live there. No.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.130
Well, I think, I think they say he lives there and he lived somewhere else. I,

4
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:15.680
I, I could, I would, yeah, I would, uh, your phone for him.

5
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.900
I get your phone for the first time.

6
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:20.240
He's filled out a clause in the first time you're full out of the closet.

7
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:24.290
Conservative. Know what? Let me be honest with you. Honest with you. I was,

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.460
if you were to talk to me a week ago, I would say, yeah, guaranteed Trump 2020,

9
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:32.540
but I don't know. I went to this concert, the 1975 concert and I was around,

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.290
I was around a lot of liberals and they a very liberal band. And I was like,

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:38.480
I liked these guys' music. I liked this guy's message.

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.510
I was listened to what he said about climate change and then singing his songs

13
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:45.020
with great avant thunking, Berg, whatever his name is. Greg was like,

14
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.680
and I was like, you know, these people aren't as bad as I thought, you know,

15
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.500
it's like, I mean, they're annoying. And I'm like, all right, shut up.

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.510
But I feel like I could be sweating now to vote just because of how

17
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:59.180
nice they were left because they're nice people, but I probably don't.

18
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.240
I vote for no. What I like about your opinions? Do you have a staff?

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.920
You have a sound understanding of policy.

20
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.130
That's why I liked the way you low based on emotion.

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.760
You go right for policy and, and things that matter. Like the biggest,

22
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.690
the things that matter the most are what to you in politics in politics. Wow.

23
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.040
Guy. You're asking him a question.

24
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.820
That's that's a little over his head in politics. Um, here's what I'll say.

25
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.920
I'm a weird guy. It's like, I want, I believe 100%, uh,

26
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.810
in, um, in pro choice. I believe it's a woman's right to choose. Absolutely. Um,

27
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.690
I think religion should be 100% out of politics.

28
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:35.480
I don't think he should have any effect on anything. Um,

29
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.050
and I also just want the wall, so I don't know that it's just,

30
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.520
you cannot not the wall, but it's like,

31
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.310
you can't have people just walk in and out of here. Yeah. I understand that.

32
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:43.821
A mirror, what?

33
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:47.210
The wall and a catapult for the ones who get locked in here that you can put

34
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:47.630
them over.

35
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.740
I understand that America is just lines on a map that some guy made up. Yeah.

36
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.550
That guy's Jesus. He's just some guy.

37
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.150
That's a guy disrespectful. Yeah. Jesus. it. What are you?

38
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.880
What are you working for? Islam now? Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

39
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.670
We're going to have to cackle this whole episode that Jesus and his mother,

40
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.760
they made up, it was basically an arts and crafts project with married mother.

41
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.550
Jesus and Jesus made up America. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.510
Before you were playing around now you get serious. Yeah.

43
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:18.170
That's why you paid attention in history class. Cause you know? Yeah.

44
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.290
I don't know. So it's not that I want the actual wall, but it's like, you can't,

45
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.340
you just want the Chinese out. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that's basically what I,

46
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.200
what about the Japanese and the Koreans you follow up trying to

47
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.860
[inaudible] your fans know that everything on here is all that they do.

48
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.020
But once in a while, a new listeners freak out,

49
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.830
nobody's actually ever said one bad thing. It's a comedy podcast.

50
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.170
It's a character. I'm just kidding around joking.

51
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.530
Because I'm going to stuff is true though. Yeah. Somebody just stuffing

52
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.940
he's really gay. No, that is, that is true though. I don't want the wall,

53
00:02:58.941 --> 00:03:02.410
but I just, I just, you know, um, I'm all for tight immigrant. It's like,

54
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.170
I'm gonna, you know what? I don't want gray area kid. I don't want the wall.

55
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.870
I think that I don't want the walls, but I think it should be amazed.

56
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.480
I think they should have. Yeah. I think it should be a lot harder to do. Yeah.

57
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.140
You gotta be smart enough to get it here.
