00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>Anything to get inside Neil, the grass Tyson's head. Oh, Hey,</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.311
I'm going to take it.

3
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:08.820
I'm going to take an animal and pay 90 bucks and a strap up and put on my

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:10.260
seatbelt inside.

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.090
<v 1>Side of the head. It really, it really is.</v>

6
00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:16.040
You're going to see what I'm thinking when I'm thinking.

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.610
<v 0>I mean, that's yeah. That's to me, it's like, I,</v>

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.670
cause I always think about that with great thinkers. Like you it's like,

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.480
what do they sit and think about? Because it's like, I know like me, I'm like,

10
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.480
I just feel like there's just cartoon music playing in my head all the time.

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.690
I'm just an idiot. And I'm like hit by an anvil.

12
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.650
What about one of the greatest thinkers of our time? So that's something like,

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.380
even you explain it and I'm like, I was on the fence and I'm in there.

14
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.020
<v 1>Well, so here's it. Here's one of the sentences that I shared in the, in,</v>

15
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:48.620
in the, in the course it's one of the great challenges in life is

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.030
knowing enough about something to think you're right.

17
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.460
But knowing not enough about that same thing to know that you're wrong.

18
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.370
<v 0>Wow. I like that. I like that answer a lot.</v>

19
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.870
<v 1>Of people in that zone. Yeah. Who will take a flat earth or for example,</v>

20
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.120
they all know they're right.

21
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.350
That's because they don't know enough to know that they're wrong. Right.

22
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.420
And the people trapped in that sort of Eddy, it's a, uh,

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.040
it's a term, it's an intellectual turbulence where you think, you know,

24
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:23.120
what's going on and you don't.

25
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.920
So part of the challenge of the educator is getting them to understand why

26
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.320
they're not thinking it's right. And you can't just say, Oh, you're an idiot.

27
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:30.830
You don't know.

28
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.520
Cause then they'll dig their heels in stronger when we know this, right. If you,

29
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.880
if someone wants to fight you, you're going to fight back.

30
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.410
So it requires some art of persuasion. You say, well,

31
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:47.150
why do you think that? And have you considered this? And what about that?

32
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.120
And then they arrive at the right answers themselves.

33
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.170
And then they take ownership of their new knowledge. Otherwise I don't want,

34
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:57.740
I don't want anybody to say this is true because Tyson said, so right.

35
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.140
Then I failed as an educator. Right.

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.070
<v 0>Then you see it's more about cult the personality or not the truth.</v>

37
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.360
<v 1>Exactly. I had somebody who was sure, a full grown adult man. Sure.</v>

38
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:13.130
We never landed on the moon. And I said, okay, so this is here I go. Ready?

39
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.490
<v 0>Do you ever get frustrated? Just go. You're stupid.</v>

40
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.120
Stupid help you. But you're dumb. The human being.

41
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:23.954
And I'm sorry.

42
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.320
<v 1>When he said this, I said it is time. Okay. So,</v>

43
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.140
so we had a conversation and I said, you know, here's the Saturn five rocket.

44
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.880
You saw the rocket. Yeah. Do you know where the astronauts are doing?

45
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.620
Like the top inch of that rocket, everything else is fuel. Where.

46
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.660
<v 0>Do you think they will go on with all that fuel? You can.</v>

47
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.230
<v 1>Calculate how much fuel that is. It's enough to go into orbit, leave orbit,</v>

48
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.560
go to the moon, orbit the moon, come back to them and come back to earth.

49
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.330
It's that much fuel. Okay. So where do you think they were going to that?

50
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.180
<v 0>He out on amp</v>

51
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.110
go totally went old dime. You were going to,

52
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.650
gosh, where are you going to whole foods?

53
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.640
So optimal Ballantine ale, New York city rep.

54
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.220
<v 1>That's a big ad in Yankee stadium was a Ballantine was about that.</v>

55
00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:26.830
What's the three, the rings, uh, with the, um, um, uh, Michelob,

56
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.560
Michelob, Michelob. Anyhow. So, so, uh, so,

57
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.090
so I, so I try to work through some reasoning and you know what he said to me,

58
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.900
he said, and he know, if you tell me we landed on the moon,

59
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.130
then I'll believe it. And I said, no, that's not how this works. Right.

60
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.070
Because that's the culting of information, right? No,

61
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.370
it's not true because I said, so it's true because it's true.

62
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.050
And you need to understand why. Right.

63
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.620
And when you understand why I don't ever want you to reference back to me ever

64
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:59.580
again, you should be able to understand, take ownership of it. Right. Right.

65
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.870
And I know I've succeeded. If, once I've taught you what I've taught you,

66
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.040
you forgot that. I even, yeah.

67
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.970
<v 0>Sure. With you,</v>

68
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.490
I'm going to have me and my four year old daughter gonna watch her masterclass

69
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.370
change in my even way. Even my four year old daughters,

70
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.190
we're going to start thinking like Neil from right now, start them early.

71
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.710
She's four years old and we're going to do it enough.

72
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.500
We're starting talking science immediately. Now. Why do you tell,

73
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.340
what was she saying that to you? Stop reading your book.

74
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.530
Who was saying that to her? I know her mom always tells me he's like,

75
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:30.840
where is she? You know? I'm like our, daughter's eating a book. He's like, yeah,

76
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.500
look at you. That's what you're doing. Do you think there's a,

77
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.000
like an assault on objective reality? Now? What, what is going on?

78
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:39.810
How did this happen?

79
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.410
<v 1>Because people, I don't know who to blame. Uh,</v>

80
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.770
let me, let me be a little heretical. Let me first blame psychologist. Okay.

81
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.250
I'm not really want to blame them. I'm just doing that for, for the fun of it.

82
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:58.080
Okay. So what is the colleges? Psychologist will tell you your feelings matter.

83
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.020
Okay. They're important.

84
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.310
And now I feel like there is no global warming.

85
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.260
So all of a sudden your feelings are elevated to the level of fact, right?

86
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.780
And you vote. So you get to control the influence of your feelings on everybody.

87
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.730
And so I don't mean specifically emotion, happy or sad. It's just,

88
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.850
you want things to be a particular way. And, and,

89
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.000
and you feel like it should be,

90
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.040
it shouldn't be what the scientist is telling you.

91
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.990
The fact that that has given equal credence against objective truth is one of

92
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:36.480
the great tragedies of modern society.

93
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.890
And it's the beginning of the unraveling of an informed democracy. Okay.

94
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:44.190
So now let's pull psychologists out of that. Cause I just did that for fun.

95
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.080
I think the somewhere in the educational arc we're missing,

96
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.130
uh, in the science class, you don't just teach,

97
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:56.670
what is you need to teach you don't to teach what is known,

98
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.570
you teach what science is as an enterprise,

99
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.070
what it is and how and why it works. What does it mean to be skeptic?

100
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.460
What does it mean to understand information and trust that information,

101
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.910
this information relative to that information. All right.

102
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.810
And so that's missing in the school system. And so I don't,

103
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.000
if you think there was this flat, I'm not even going to blame you.

104
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.320
I'm going to say something happened in your school, in your, in your, uh,

105
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.700
in K through 12,

106
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.200
that needs to be changed so that we preempt this kind of thinking as we go

107
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.730
forward, by the way, in a free country,

108
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.360
you should bet with think what you want and say what you want.

109
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.660
But if you have power over others,

110
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.330
that's when objective reality matters because we all share the same objective

111
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:44.960
reality. Even if we don't share your personal truth.

112
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.880
<v 0>We really hope you enjoyed that episode. Whatever it was about,</v>

113
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:51.730
