1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>It was white. Yeah. Clarence King. Not to be confused with Sean King, who,</v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.810
by the way, when we get to the story, I believe that Shaun King,

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
Shaun Jeffrey King stole Clarence King's story. And that's why he named himself.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.840
Sean King, Clarence King. He named him after Sean K uh, Claire,

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.490
Shaun King named herself after Clarence King,

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.110
because King is not his family land.

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.080
<v 1>Why not? I mean, it's his real dad was, well, I don't know if it's his real dad.</v>

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.740
Probably the dad on his birth certificate is a white man named

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.900
Jeffrey K allegedly. No, no, no. That's what's on his birth certificate.

10
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.740
Who knows.

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.620
<v 0>Because he also said that he was a victim of a hate crime and there's no record</v>

12
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:37.130
of that.

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.370
<v 1>Yeah. There's no record of the hate crime. Absolutely zero. There, there,</v>

14
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:42.920
the police report, there is a police report of an incident,

15
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.140
but that police report lists him as white.

16
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.110
He says it was a fight between two students.

17
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.670
<v 0>Actually, Sean King should,</v>

18
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.110
at some point be brought up on federal charges for inciting Ray stuff.

19
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.040
And he actually, he actually is like a real like Devilfish criminal, Sean,

20
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.400
Sean King, because Rachel doll is all in Clarence King. It was kind of,

21
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.590
they didn't really mean to hurt anybody. They were just doing it.

22
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:06.200
We'll get into the story of Clarence King. They were just doing it for love.

23
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:10.670
And, but Sean King is actually exploiting people and causing harm.

24
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.790
So I want to see a world where Sean King gets brought up.

25
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.500
<v 1>It's interesting too, because Sean King has that story of, um,</v>

26
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.610
a hate crime where he said, uh, you know, he missed a year of school.

27
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:23.840
He had multiple back surgeries.

28
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.620
There's no record of any of that school or the hospital.

29
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:30.500
And interestingly enough, Rachel Dolezal. Well,

30
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:32.510
he says he had that hate crime happened to him.

31
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.960
And that's when he chose blackness. After that, cause he was like, all right,

32
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.440
that, that made me black or whatever, which is an interesting story.

33
00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:42.650
Rachel doll was also made up. She,

34
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.120
she was sending letters to herself like Jessie Smollett did Jessie smell that

35
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:49.510
was sending those hate crime letters to himself, to himself.

36
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.780
Rachel dozer did the same thing in a PO box was she only had the key of, uh,

37
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.340
but the letters would go into there or whatever that she was sending hate crime

38
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.000
letters to herself. And she'd like burned a cross on her own lawn or whatever.

39
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.380
So, but back then.

40
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.790
<v 0>Do you think you ever think about like a lot of this is just like</v>

41
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.330
entitlement, meaning like the, you know,

42
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.080
people feel entitled for like a lot of reasons. It's like you have to,

43
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.580
because we live in such a world where they're so opposite ends of the spectrum.

44
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.120
Either you need to be a superstar and feel entitled that way,

45
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:25.970
or you need to be a victim and feel entitled that way.

46
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:29.510
So I feel like if you can't live in the middle anymore and just being an

47
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.770
average, person's like average and especially American society is just not good.

48
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.520
So these people that feel insanely average, like a Sean King,

49
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:40.100
like a Rachel doll is all like Jessica crew. Cool.

50
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:43.160
We'll talk about all three of them. And maybe even like in a way Clarence King,

51
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.130
although we'll get into the Clarence King story, he did it for love.

52
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.870
But these people, because they can't feel just average and mediocre,

53
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.060
they have to pick an extreme and say,

54
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.040
I'm now going to be a victim of race stuff as like a sense of entitlement of to

55
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:01.450
say I deserve something too, because I can't just be mediocre.

56
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.280
Do you ever think of that?

57
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.950
<v 1>I do think of that. And I think it's tied to the American dream.</v>

58
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.100
I think it's tied to what America markets, right?

59
00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:11.970
Like you got to make something to check. You got to be some, we looked down on,

60
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.480
on the middle-class on average people in like other countries,

61
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.460
people feel okay with having a job.

62
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.480
Everyone here feels like they have to be a rapper or a celebrity or something.

63
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:24.360
It's just like those lives. Aren't great. But it's marketed.

64
00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:26.880
Like you have to be famous, even extremely.

65
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.130
<v 0>Family rich and wealthy and famous people. Most of their day is average.</v>

66
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.380
<v 1>Yeah. So no matter what, no matter which.</v>

67
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.370
<v 0>Way you escape, try to slice it. Whether you're a victim,</v>

68
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:39.930
you want to play the victim and the race card.

69
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:43.230
And I'm a victimized by everything. And you're on TV for a minute being like,

70
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.190
I'm the victim most of your day. Other than the little part you aren't TV,

71
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.690
you're average, same thing as Drake. Most of his day,

72
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.350
besides when he posts or does the concert at MSG leading up to that?

73
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:59.160
It's pretty average. He just wakes up in a hotel or his house has breakfast.

74
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:01.740
Like everybody else brushes his teeth does some other.

75
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.510
And then for two hours in the day, one, whatever, he does a big concert,

76
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.650
but most of Drake's time is just average. So everything,

77
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.860
even if you get to the pinnacle, LeBron James right now. Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.040
He has a playoff game tonight and he has practiced before.

79
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.570
But the rest of it is just average sitting around thinking of to do until he's

80
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:23.850
got time for the practice of the game. So we're all at.

81
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.570
<v 1>There's no question. LeBron James wakes up, right? He jerks off.</v>

82
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.330
Maybe he jerks off like a regular, like a hundred percent. He'll be like,

83
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.350
you know what, let me just rub one out.

84
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.090
<v 0>Yeah, look. Some, some Instagram models,</v>

85
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:35.100
probably DMS I'm under some fake accounts.

86
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.890
<v 1>Yeah. And then he goes downstairs. He has breakfast or whatever.</v>

87
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:40.650
And then he farts. I mean, LeBron James just farts. He takes a nap.

88
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.080
He talks to his kids, you know? So.

89
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.470
<v 0>You want what these, what people who look at, Oh, I want to be successful.</v>

90
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:47.760
I want to be celebrity. I want to be this.

91
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.780
What you really want is your they're all everybody's average. You can't,

92
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.140
you can't escape at being average and you can't escape suffering.

93
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.330
So I think as human beings more focused on how do I deal with being average and

94
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.350
accepted and how do I accept suffering? Because from Jeff Bezos,

95
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.380
being the richest man in the world to the homeless guy who eats his own,

96
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.700
they're both suffering.

97
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.150
It's just different forms of suffering happened for different reasons,

98
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.760
but you can't escape either one of them. And this even Bezos,

99
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.140
he's got all the money in the world,

100
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.130
but many parts of his day are just very average. So it's just like,

101
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.030
I don't know what people want this solution. That's why I'm kind of happy.

102
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.170
The Kardashians show,

103
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.870
even though I know it's already ripple effects and all that,

104
00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:30.120
and it's not like it just goes away, but I'm kind of happy.

105
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:33.300
It's had its time and now it's moving on because it's a little bit like

106
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.160
celebrating these extremes of you got to have this and the big and the big and

107
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:41.280
this and that. It's really like it with the,

108
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.070
our psyche so much because the truth is,

109
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.090
we're all mostly average and we're all going to suffer and you can't escape

110
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.710
either one of those and the people that do,

111
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.060
I think they go to an extreme either you become Donald Trump or you become Shaun

112
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.910
King. And either way, either I'm going to be noticed because I'm a victim,

113
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.090
I'm going, gonna be noticed. Cause I want to be president United States,

114
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:02.810
but it's all just trying to escape the fact that you're average and you're going

115
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.030
to stop. It all sounds familiar. So you would think like,

116
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.580
because when you know Sean ping, everybody of course knows he's white.

117
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:09.320
Even though he keeps saying he's black. It's like, we all know,

118
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.011
and the truth will come out.

119
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:13.490
Eventually just like Rachel Dole is all who that was like the big news.

120
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:14.990
And like, how could somebody do that?

121
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.960
How could someone pretend that they were black when they were really white?

122
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.360
And then you see this has been happening throughout history.

123
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:23.480
So we found the case all the way from the late 18 hundreds where he's doing it.

124
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.330
And you would have to think it's been happening for hundreds and hundreds of

125
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:27.130
years before that.

126
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.860
<v 1>And it's probably a lot of people who've done it, who we've never heard of.</v>

127
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.850
He got away with it his whole life. So he didn't do this until like,

128
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.950
this was like the last 13 years of his life.

129
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:38.170
Of course he didn't predict it could be the last 13.

130
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:41.140
But in those 13 years he lived a double life.

131
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.040
As James taught by a man named Clarence. Do we think James.

132
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.830
<v 0>How does a good black name? Is it a cute black name or bruits black?</v>

133
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.140
I think it's a good one. I mean, I was saying.

134
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.290
<v 1>You're going to go hard and you got like Darnell Rawlings always told me,</v>

135
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.200
go hard or go home. He sh go harder, go home.

136
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.630
I think he should've went blacker and called himself. Donna.

137
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.790
<v 0>Rawlings. Darnell rocks. Yeah. If I, if I literally, if I,</v>

138
00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:04.810
if I was sticking to this, if I had to do a black name,

139
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.130
I would probably go with a classic one, all New York jets player.

140
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.560
I would go with the brick show at the Stefano. That's what I would say.

141
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:14.320
I'm the brick short to stuff it up just to get back to Sean King for a second,

142
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:15.154
no matter which way.

143
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.700
<v 1>Slice it. Even if he had some really light skin, black ice,</v>

144
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.330
a real improbable story that his mom told him at nine years old.

145
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.660
This is the official story. Is his mom at nine years old, John Kang.

146
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:28.630
We're talking about the present day, Sean King, the civil, the activity.

147
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.170
<v 0>If they do is ancestry.com now, and see where's roots came from,</v>

148
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:34.480
they totally cut, but he won't do it. Of course he will.

149
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.270
<v 1>He was offered by some conserve, some black conservative.</v>

150
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:42.040
I think Larry elder offered him $250,000 to the charity of your

151
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:43.600
choice. If you took it, if you did that.

152
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.770
<v 0>It says DNA tests. Yeah. Cause if knows, he knows that it's going to come back,</v>

153
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:48.700
UK baby.

154
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.110
<v 1>His story is that, uh,</v>

155
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.030
his mom had an affair behind his dad's back and that's he was

156
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.510
this kid of that. And his mom told him at nine years old.

157
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.760
<v 0>And these are some other conveniently dead right now.</v>

158
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.850
That was mom's still alive. What does his mom say about that?

159
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.290
<v 1>She has. I don't know, but I don't know if she's alive. I know brother. Yeah.</v>

160
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.110
His brother died, but uh, tragically rest in peace.

161
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.540
His brother down to like leukemia or some cancer. Sorry. Yeah.

162
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.890
<v 0>But I just thought it was probably hard.</v>

163
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.380
Cause he was dealing with a lot of stress.

164
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.100
Try and keep his brother's dirty little secret.

165
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.290
So I think you killed your brother, Sean King. You piece of.

166
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.210
<v 1>The mom would tell a nine-year-old kid by the way. No, this isn't your real dad.</v>

167
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:27.580
Your real dad is some dude. I begged behind his back.

168
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.480
No cheese looks like my friend Mark Hurston,

169
00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:33.820
who I grew up with who was a French Jewish? No look, he looks like.

170
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.610
<v 0>He could be Puerto Rican for sure. It looks like to be Puerto Rican,</v>

171
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.040
mostly the haircut and the staff. It's mostly the haircuts.

172
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.660
<v 1>You have a stash like that too. When I was,</v>

173
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.560
when I was trying to look Puerto Rican. Yeah. So black. So when I grew up,

174
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:47.320
it was very cool. Hip hop culture was very cool.

175
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.720
<v 0>So Clarence King, Shaun King,</v>

176
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.670
it's interesting that both their last names are King.

177
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.290
I really genuinely in my heart believe Sean King knew about Clarence's King

178
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:59.100
story and got inspired by it. And even though you say it's birth certificate,

179
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.440
I just don't believe anything comes out of this kid's mouth.

180
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.850
So I think Sean King co-opted Clarence King story and it's just the new King.

181
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.590
So that's just what it is. And I believe much like Clarence King told his wife,

182
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.030
his black wife, you know,

183
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.560
who's who she knew him as James Todd on his actual death bed in 1901 while he

184
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:20.310
was dying of tuberculosis. He said, by the way, I'm not black.

185
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.110
I'm a white guy. I'm a white and I've left you a fortune.

186
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.760
I think Sean King on his deathbed will tell whoever his wife is at the

187
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:33.180
time that, Hey, by the way, I've been white this whole time.

188
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.460
