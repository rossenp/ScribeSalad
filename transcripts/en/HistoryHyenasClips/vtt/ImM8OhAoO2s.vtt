WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>Oh, speaking of LA. Yes. You had quite a tweet.</v>

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.920
<v 1>Jimmy Campbell. Yeah. What's now they're saying they're not going to air it,</v>

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.830
which I'm like, just it. Aaron. Aaron has a bomb.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.990
<v 0>I said to him afterwards, I'm sure it's in your head.</v>

5
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:16.700
You're your own worst critic. It's pretty good.

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.040
If Kim was going back to you being like, we're not airing this.

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.500
<v 1>Yeah. Well it's Jimmy Kim.</v>

8
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:24.530
I think it's like now tweet the thing is,

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.620
is like I tweeted that out and it's like, it's my most, you know,

10
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.740
Twitter lets you know, it's my most favorite ID, retweeted tweet ever.

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.550
So they're like, I'm like what? Like this is going to get my,

12
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.260
at least my fans to watch it. Like why not? You know? And uh,

13
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:41.000
and they're saying they're probably not, but yeah, here's what happened.

14
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.010
So when you do a late night set, David Laderman, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon,

15
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.120
you do it at their studio. Okay. And then you'll do it at the end of the show.

16
00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:53.900
So there have been a whole comedy show, guests and monologues and all that.

17
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.900
And then the producer will come out and say, and the warmup comic would say,

18
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.420
Hey, we got a guy he's going to do five minutes.

19
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.120
Like give them all your attention, give him all your energy, blah, blah, blah.

20
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.630
And then, you know, though Jimmy Kim or whomever, the hostess will say,

21
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.270
you know what? You'll see on TV. The audience will see and you know,

22
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:10.820
all the way from New York city, please welcome Chris and Stefano.

23
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.260
And then you do the set in the warm, the room is warm. This situation.

24
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.780
It wasn't that it was going to be on Jimmy Kimmel show,

25
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:18.890
which he does out of Los Angeles.

26
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:23.240
But the set is filmed from his comedy club in Las Vegas. Uh,

27
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.120
so that's so that's strike one, strike two.

28
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.740
They had a warmup comic due about two and a half minutes. Like not enough time.

29
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:33.440
And then his sister does comedy.

30
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.570
His sister is a comedian and really nice woman. I just didn't know. You know,

31
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.180
it's, it's a, it's a job to be a professional warmup.

32
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.100
Comic is like a specific job.

33
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.840
Usually the professional warmup comics or as good as standup as they are at

34
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.060
warming up a crowd because it's more than jokes.

35
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.120
You got to play games with them and throw a beach ball around and you know,

36
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:56.330
tickle people. It's a whole game that you play,

37
00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:59.270
but it works because the crowd's like in a great mood and then they just laugh

38
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.470
at the five minutes of jokes. So I go up, I go up there. The room is,

39
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.290
first of all, you know, the first warmup comic, it was just like, Hey,

40
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.130
like it was 300 people. That's just not conducive. Then the other comic goes up,

41
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:12.770
student jokes about honor and now or pushing yourself.

42
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.320
I don't know what the jokes are about their jokes about something.

43
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.320
I was kind of listening, not listening. I'm sure she's fine. But I just,

44
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.730
you know, you, you're not really paying attention,

45
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:21.890
but I do know nobody was laughing. That's what I know.

46
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.190
So I go out there and you can just tell the room. It's like one of those things,

47
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.630
when you walk out to a hot room,

48
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.950
they're clapping and the clapping doesn't stop until you get to like the

49
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:37.220
microphone or even kick, you have to be like stop at them.

50
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:40.280
Like I walk out and like I'm not even at the mic and they're just like done,

51
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.260
done. Just like, just my dad's like here for you though.

52
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.560
Or they're here tonight. They're there for a night of comedy.

53
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:51.290
I don't even think that they know that it's for late night.

54
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.020
I think that they think that they're just going to this comedy club,

55
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.210
they got free tickets. Cause it's a TV taping,

56
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:57.920
but I don't think they necessarily know.

57
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.420
I don't know how in-depth it was explained. So I go up first.

58
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.270
So I was one of four comics who was going to do their set by the time the fourth

59
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.150
comic one on the crowd was great. I heard that that comic smashed,

60
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.350
but I go up and it's like such a cold room, like,

61
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.380
and I was doing, and the reason why I felt confident, tweeting out,

62
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.640
like I bombed. And it's because I have so much stuff on the internet of my work.

63
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.440
I just on two podcasts before that,

64
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.230
the fighter and the kid and Theo Vaughn's this past weekend podcast,

65
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:27.340
which combined had already had like over 2 million views downloads. I'm like,

66
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.640
that's the real work in 2020, like the Kimmel shows. Doesn't just,

67
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.460
it doesn't get that many views, not his fault. It's just the,

68
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.810
what it is in America now.

69
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.980
So I already felt like I'm confident I did the work, the,

70
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.900
where I needed to shine. I, I did. Okay. And,

71
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:46.510
and so I go out there and the first joke that usually gets along of laughs just

72
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.790
kind of bombs. And I was just like, all boy,

73
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.860
I could feel that this is not going to go well,

74
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.840
then the second one gets a full zero, like a full zero.

75
00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:00.400
So I was like, wow, Zs. So then, so then the third one I was telling,

76
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.730
and then in the middle of it, I just stopped. And I was like, you guys suck.

77
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.170
I said that on late night television, I was like, you guys suck.

78
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.260
And then just looked around and then went right back into my junk

79
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.930
and then just continued to gradually get worse and told the last one,

80
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.100
because you have to do a five minute,

81
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:21.520
another thing you have to do your five minute approved set.

82
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.660
So if that was a normal comedy club, if I, if that wasn't a switch,

83
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.900
I would've just done crowd work, been made fun, went to, you know,

84
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.410
dirtier jokes or jokes that really wake people up. And you can't do that on the,

85
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.930
when you get you that five minutes set is vetted.

86
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.650
So I had to come out and very inorganically. You're like,

87
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:40.990
you know what America's problem is where like,

88
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.720
I wouldn't say that if I would come out and be like,

89
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:45.580
what the is wrong with everybody? You know,

90
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.820
like just start yelling about the virus, just start yelling.

91
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.090
And then I would do my set. Right. But I wasn't couldn't do that this time.

92
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.290
So I felt like my hands were tied.

93
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:57.700
So then the last joke I did was just about getting blow jobs,

94
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.900
which is not TV friendly or approved, but I was like, all right,

95
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.400
at least this is like my clothes that I closed in clubs that this will get a

96
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:04.240
laugh. And then that,

97
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.350
so even so even with my clothes are that I do in regular

98
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:15.270
comedy shows just to settle. And I just walked out and um,

99
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.420
and, and the producer and the producer was like, Oh, don't worry.

100
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.940
We'll pump laughs into it. And I said, if you're going to air that thing,

101
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.460
I need you to air it as the bomb. I was like,

102
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.230
cause I'm going to tweet out my experience. She was like, no, no, no,

103
00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:27.420
don't do that. That's not, that's sorry. I was like, the tweets got me.

104
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.890
I was like, I can't wait to get outta here and send this.

105
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.360
And then it was, and then I literally, I mean,

106
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:39.150
as soon as I got in the car to go to the airport, I,

107
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.100
it opened up Twitter and I just died and I just started throwing it.

108
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:47.850
And then I got so much support. So many comedians calling me like dying,

109
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:48.840
laughing, or sending you messages.

110
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:52.440
But cause there really isn't anything funnier, I think, to a comedian.

111
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.700
Then the two things that make comedians like gut laugh is when a,

112
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.160
a good comedian like really bombs, like what happened,

113
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.220
like really eats it and is trying to get out of it. And they can't,

114
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.540
it's so funny or fart

115
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.050
[inaudible] you can ask, you can ask like the most brilliant comedians,

116
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.860
nothing is funnier than a foreign. It's just like, it's just like a ripping,

117
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.820
a nice fart is like that thing that Barstool posted with a fart hits third year

118
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.840
that I must have, I was crying. My daughter was in a swimming class. Like my,

119
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.240
whereas parents you're supposed to be very vigilant because they're like, Hey,

120
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:28.850
listen, you know, we're not in the pool, but like as a parent,

121
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:31.580
keep an eye on your kid. And I literally am like crying,

122
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.750
laughing at that Fort hitting third gear. And my daughter's swimmies fell off.

123
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.340
And she was like, flapping like that. And I'm like, Oh. I was like crying.

124
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:40.851
And like, you know,

125
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:42.890
I bet the instructor thought I was crying cause I was nervous,

126
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:44.570
but I was laughing at the third gear fart.

127
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.270
<v 0>I feel like part of that though. You have you, uh,</v>

128
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.510
I don't think you ever want to blame the crowd, right? For like, you know,

129
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:55.510
you're a good comic. It's no, you kill with that material.

130
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.160
And now all of a sudden it's not working.

131
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.650
Maybe you didn't deliver it the same way. Maybe this, maybe that,

132
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.890
but the majority is like that crowd for that night for whatever reason is the

133
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:03.190
problem.

134
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.700
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think, listen, it's always,</v>

135
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.360
it's always the comedian's fault at times, but I know that's what.

136
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.660
<v 0>Say, cause like it's almost like, you know, that's part of the job or whatever,</v>

137
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.500
but you're.

138
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.550
<v 1>We're in the same jokes that kill every other time. The only thing,</v>

139
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.370
the only reason why I say it was my fault. I yeah,

140
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:25.840
those jokes deserve there were worked out crafted jokes that have done well in

141
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:28.420
the past. That's why they got approved to go on the show.

142
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.060
The reason why I'm saying it,

143
00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:34.810
it is still my fault is because all those things that I said, I I'm saying, Oh,

144
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:37.900
I couldn't do crowd. I could have done it. I actually could have done it.

145
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.060
And then just blown past the line and been like, Hey,

146
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.940
I got them to the place I needed to then do my five minutes.

147
00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.360
But because I kind of, you know, in a way, push it out.

148
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.350
I don't want it to push it out.

149
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:49.390
But like I want it to be like professional on the rules,

150
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:50.860
basically follow the rules where like, you know,

151
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:53.620
some more Renegade guys would be like, no, that.

152
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.150
I'm not going to allow myself to go on television. If it's not the crowd I want.

153
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.600
So they would have. So that's why I say like, it kind of is my fault.

154
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.100
It wasn't my fault though is yeah.

155
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:07.330
Like the way that's set up is just like not conducive to five minute.

156
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.090
Also stand up comedy on a late night show is not really what 2020 is

157
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:16.000
about. It's not like I can come on here and go on those podcasts.

158
00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:19.240
I mentioned and give you an hour to two hour version of myself.

159
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.640
That'll make somebody say, Oh, I want to buy tickets to go see this person.

160
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.050
As opposed to some shiny business card. Five-minute set where they're like, Hey,

161
00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:27.760
don't say your daughter's Puerto Rican. I'm like,

162
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:30.520
but she has a tattoo on her attendant. She's four. She is Puerto Rican.

163
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.800
You know what I mean? I'm like, so like why?

164
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.150
Like they're telling you that to be like, Oh,

165
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:35.980
we don't know if we don't know if we want you to,

166
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.810
we could do this stuff about your daughter, but you know,

167
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.850
just don't even mention her race. I'm like, she's proud.

168
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.880
Her mother is a proud Puerto Rican. Like what are you talking about?

169
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:46.180
You can't say that your daughter's Puerto Rican, Jimmy Kimmel was okay with it.

170
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:47.950
But other late night sets have, have said,

171
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.990
have they made the request they make you do?

172
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:52.510
Like when you see a comedian on late night,

173
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.560
you don't understand like the F they don't want to do that. Now.

174
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.990
That's not the real set.

175
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.570
Like don't judge ever judge a comedian on that because it's like,

176
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.500
they're making, they're putting you in this little box that people know that is

177
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.430
on the podcast. That's why like every time you got to say, come on, I'm like,

178
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:11.370
yes, because people buy tickets to my after I make appearances here.

179
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.600
Cause they're like, like, Oh, I, I,

180
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.220
at least I get an honest chance to prove myself five minute late. And I said,

181
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:17.610
you don't get.
