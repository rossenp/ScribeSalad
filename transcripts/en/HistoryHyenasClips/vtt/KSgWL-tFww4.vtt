1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>Um, yeah, you got the guns going. We all see them Chrissy say again,</v>

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.160
I saw you're flexing now in that, take that, check it out. No,

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.880
no know what happened. I got to try some pot, man. Dude, you're crushing it.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.830
I got to chill through the air conditioner and if maybe fled up,

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.920
but then I did look out, I look, tried to look at my tattoo, which looks like.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.920
What is, what does it say? There's a scripture. This one, this one's my name,

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.240
my neighborhood on my arm. It says established 1984. The was born stupid.

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.660
Then I have scripture on my arm. I got a cross on my back.

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.170
I look like I'm fighting in a Catholic crusade that doesn't exist yet.

10
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:39.710
He looks like Robert de Niro from Cape fear. Yeah, it's stupid. He's got,

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.660
he's got like scriptures all over.

12
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.880
You guys are really big on your neighborhoods. Yeah. We love the neighborhoods.

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.960
I moved out of it immediately. And what's funny is, is all it is,

14
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.950
is nothing but horrific stories about how it was and what happened.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.410
But like everybody, I respect that

16
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
of the dysfunction that you guys are, the, the Bay Ridge boys.

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.870
Now we're the favorite. Yeah. We made it even more local.

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.990
We got into show business to make, go even more local.

19
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.450
Like what can we think of the most obscure neighborhood?

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.700
How about Bay Ridge Brooklyn. There you go. Bill.

21
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:21.320
Did your friend who passed away? Did he pass away from COVID? No. No,

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.440
that sucks. It sucks to die during a pandemic, as something else.

23
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.580
That's not the disease. It's like dying on nine 11, but you weren't in the bill.

24
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:30.380
You got hit by a car. Yeah. Yeah. You don't,

25
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.340
you definitely don't get the big press release. Uh, no,

26
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:39.200
what it is is without getting totally into the deal. It's just when,

27
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.310
uh, you know, you start paying for your sins,

28
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.530
but yeah, I would suggest all of you guys, especially you Yannis,

29
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.410
I don't know. You just started sitting there sagging with that depressed.

30
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.740
Look on your face. You got a lot of weight, a lot of weight between your ears.

31
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.560
I would definitely go to a house. And uh, and between his lately,

32
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.220
I've gotten really fat recently bill. But, um,

33
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.760
I am envious that the fact that you guys got to be in show business,

34
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:09.230
stay where you're from. And um, you know,

35
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:10.970
still be able to go to the teams you want to see,

36
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:15.950
but that's also why new Yorkers are such meatheads is you guys never leave.

37
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.200
And your perspective of the world is like literally 20 blocks. Yeah.

38
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.820
It's just like, Oh, look at the skyline. Look at Phil. This is amazing.

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.350
And then when you go elsewhere, you act like you're not uncomfortable.

40
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.900
You act like it's just a piece of and you're above it.

41
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:37.100
But the reality is the second you guys get away from your favorite place to buy

42
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:41.300
your kicks and your pizza. You get horrifically uncomfortable.

43
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.460
Oh, I love going to LA. I appreciate the size. Now I roll around in California.

44
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:50.570
I go to the leftover here. We got a fire. That's on fire over there.

45
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.220
So that whole block Theo, Yonis fire over here,

46
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:57.080
those Mexicans right there,

47
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.990
they're working over there for than minimum wage over there.

48
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.420
Uh, there's water being piped in another state over there.

49
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.090
This place shouldn't be here. Well, none of us should be here.

50
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.240
We stole the country on us. I know. What about New York?

51
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.560
You can't do that in New York. I hang out with you in New York Yannis.

52
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:24.000
You're like over here, I got shot. This is where I saw a homeless guy. Take a.

53
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.760
And you want to talk about illegal aliens.

54
00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:29.880
You don't have any of those in New York. That's got out of there.

55
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:34.800
And that's why I'm living in New Hampshire now, and country away from you, man.

56
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.580
They're taking my country. You're not going to do it. I got myself a gun.

57
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:43.350
I'm a gun owner coming, get some, anything comes up there, Hill I'm shooting it.

58
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.090
So yes, you got such a diarrhea of the mouth.

59
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.500
When you buy a gun.

60
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:53.640
The last thing you do is go on the podcast and let people know that when they go

61
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.190
in there at your house, that they need to be strapped to

62
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.240
literally read your playbook. You dummy, but book bill, if you're depressed,

63
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:06.690
when you come to do your show in Connecticut, can you please meet up with us?

64
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.160
Because we are the cure for depression. take you on a ferry ride.

65
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.580
You will set sail with you. We'll take you to some museums. We'll prance around,

66
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.130
get some ice cream and get cute and drink some smoothies and put a

67
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:24.210
smile on that sound. I would do that in a second,

68
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.610
but Yannis, I know you after the smoothie and the sugar rush ends.

69
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.710
I know as, as Chris says, Yonnie long days comes in now,

70
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.090
but he keeps forgetting what he's saying. One of my favorite clips,

71
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.860
I saw your show, which I absolutely love. I think you guys are superstars, man.

72
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:47.100
People watching this, you got to check these guys out. Um,

73
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.530
I was watching this clip,

74
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.760
some guy talking about COVID and he was talking about the things,

75
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.260
bad things that were happening and Yannis was just stoking the fires guys like,

76
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.420
well, he knows gonna be hospital beds filled is going to be blah, blah, blah,

77
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.650
blah. And then Yon is just goes riding in the streets.

78
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.270
And the guys like riding in the streets. And I literally, I swiped past it.

79
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:14.040
It's like, I don't want to listen to this. Yeah. You know,

80
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.050
I hate that. I'm right. So much. I avoid, um, uh,

81
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.630
that train of thought because I know how I'm wired and I'm paranoid. And I,

82
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:24.750
I can't listen to that the same way.

83
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:28.680
Like I avoid a lot of discussions with parents

84
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.920
when they get into that hysteria. Like,

85
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.040
have you got your kid into a private school yet? You gotta do this.

86
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.740
Are they doing puzzles? If they're not doing puzzles, people are saying, blah,

87
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.050
blah, blah. I just, I just walk away. So yeah.

88
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.620
I on the ride, I'd get the smoothie. I'd give,

89
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.970
I'd give Chrissy to nod.

90
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:52.140
And then I would slowly just back away and I don't even give a what subway line

91
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:53.490
it was on and which way it was going.

92
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.490
I go down those stairs and I would get on it and then just get away from

93
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.170
you. Yeah. One of those things where it's like, yeah,

94
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.320
I feel like I'm trans today. What? Like, like,

95
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.880
am I a bad person? Now? If I'm like, Hey today I feel trans.

96
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:08.900
And that's what I want to go with.

97
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.520
But that tomorrow I don't are you shaming me by telling me, Hey, yesterday,

98
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:15.350
you want it to be transit today. You don't like,

99
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.130
I just feel like everything's a free for all now on what you can. And can't say,

100
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:20.930
it's like, yeah, you know what? Today would bill Burr.

101
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.130
I want it to go trans and that's I felt right. And maybe tomorrow I will.

102
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.330
No, no nobody's saying you can't go trans. I don't know.

103
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.620
I didn't know where that came from. Well, I'm gonna go cut my Dick off.

104
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.970
Stop with all the old country horse. You,

105
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:45.230
you are 100% of this country. You're out of this soil.

106
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.950
That that's, that's what you are. I am, I am.

107
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.060
I am searching for an identity and I can tell you right now,

108
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.950
you don't get that fatty in Greek food.

109
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.780
Can you argue that you are eating American poison? That is what you are eating.

110
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.150
Yeah. I got to get my tongue, man. You got, you got maybe a D cop going there.

111
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.940
Yeah. I'm in the stage

112
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.350
and I'm telling them it's going to get it's.

113
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.110
I could go one or two ways when the baby's born,

114
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.230
either something will kick in is genetic coding will kick in and say,

115
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:25.490
I got to lose the weight for this baby and do this or that. Or it's just,

116
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.150
he's going to be so exhausted. Especially those first couple of years that,

117
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:31.550
I mean, we get into a real, I mean,

118
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:35.840
I'm talking about a 400 pound situation where I'll just get a

119
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.890
slab bacon off his on the Patrion all day.

120
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.253
Yeah,

121
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.450
definitely has the potential to become a big boy. You see him?

122
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.560
He's a, he's one of those in-shape guys, but you can also see,

123
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.750
you can see the fatty within, I'm going to breakfast up on you now. Yeah.

124
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.660
I mean, as versus see how I eat,

125
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:03.250
he actually says he's actually cannot believe that I have not blown out fully,

126
00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:04.084
by the way I eat.

127
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.440
He's actually said that I sometimes put on displays that rival like Bobby Kelly

128
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:13.330
displays of eating. There you go. All right guys. Thank you so much.

129
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.150
