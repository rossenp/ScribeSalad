<v 0>By the way we got to get to a what the Florida segment we should do guys shapes</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.330
puppy from monster alligator, while smoking a cigar.

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.640
We got to just end it on this story because I'm in,

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:12.210
this is some Florida right here. I'm sure you guys have seen this, but I mean,

5
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.020
let's break this down. Here you go. This has to be Florida. If it's not Florida,

6
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.160
then it's still Florida.

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.010
<v 1>Charles spaniel and rested from the jaws of the alligator. It tastes,</v>

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.450
Oh my God. The puppy did so for a puncture to it's Billy,

9
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:34.850
but it's doing just fine. Oh my God, dude.

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.130
<v 2>The one thing they cut off, how do you get your fingers out at the end?</v>

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.310
<v 0>Yeah. What did he do? I mean, I don't, he couldn't,</v>

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.030
he might just be so old school that he got a finger bitten off.

13
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:48.050
It didn't even mention it.

14
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 2>Right. Is that, is that hardcore? Because if you've ever been bit by a puppy.</v>

15
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.160
<v 0>It, well, yeah, it doesn't hurt. Right?</v>

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 2>Does it? No, it does.</v>

17
00:00:56.301 --> 00:01:00.890
They have the sharpest little teeth similar to like a tiny alligator,

18
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.700
a baby alligator like that dude, they could lock your finger off clean.

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.800
<v 0>Do you think there's any chance in hell that that guy voted for Joe Biden?</v>

20
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.063

23
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.970

25
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.440
