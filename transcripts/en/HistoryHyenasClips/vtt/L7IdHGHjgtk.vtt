00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
<v 0>In America,</v>

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.650
who's got a Dick on his arm and he asked the doctors to put it there. Yeah.

3
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:07.320
It's what it is. He's got a Dick in his arm and apart,

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.620
apparently he's doing Japanese porn with it because they blurted it out.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
Why did he, why did he put the Dick on his arm? What's the point?

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.520
Because why the? Not it's 2020. Why wouldn't you? Yeah,

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.850
he suffered a horrific infection in his paradigm that turned his fingers.

8
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:28.530
Toes in manhood black. Yeah. So he decided when I saw my penis go black,

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:32.940
I was besides myself. It was in a horror film because when his penis went black,

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.310
did it grow? Yeah. I don't know.

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.180
That was a stupid penis joke about like guys have a big penises.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.750
I cannot believe it's racist that his penis turned black and then he cut it off.

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.690
That's racist. That is raised. But he dropped it. Yeah. I mean this kid, I mean,

14
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.040
this kid looks like a British kid.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.770
This kid looks like he's on the runway anyway. Yeah. It's what,

16
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.940
he's 45 years old. He's your age? This kid's 45. Yeah.

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.070
He's he he's. Yeah. He's not in good shape for 45. He's not Greek is what it is.

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.400
He's also wearing filings basement. Adidas.

19
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.500
You always see what you can tell that the, the,

20
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.290
the cheap version of the Adidas that they got,

21
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.040
the filings basement store let's work. I'm ready to work. I am ready as well.

22
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.383
Just a little delay.

23
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.860
<v 0>You better work on my West Elm stools.</v>

25
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.880
I don't have to Yass anymore. I get all of the gay out where we work.

26
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.570
It's what it is. So let's lead it off with good vibrations. Toni Braxton.

27
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.680
One of my favorite singers reveal secrets or a flawless skin is a vibrator.

28
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.310
And she holds device to her face and it says bizarre video.

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.290
But I say it's holds her facing awesome video. I mean, here she is. Wow.

30
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.280
Uh, Tony haven't seen Tony in a while. She also lost all her money.

31
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.400
Some members she had lost all her money. That was a big story.

32
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120
She gets made out of plastic too. If I'm going to be honest with you. Yeah.

33
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.520
I mean, if you want, I agree with you.

34
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.270
It looks like the girls had a few surgeries to really Botox down. Yeah.

35
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:21.320
Let's watch this video, but I do love Toni Braxton. Yeah. Oh, was mad enough.

36
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.650
Say you love me again. Hold on.

37
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.650
Hold on, hold on. Pause it for a second. I paused for a second.

38
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.890
I really want to see if me and you could try to sing good. You,

39
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.450
why don't you try one and then I'll try. I got some stuck in my throat. Okay.

40
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:43.310
I'll try. Uh, this is the best I can sing and break.

41
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.960
Say, you love me. Here

42
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.680
comes with the tears in your eyes. When you come into the net,

43
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.060
Hey, that's the best I can sing. I'm not lying. I wasn't doing that for,

44
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.860
yeah. Okay. This is what Tony said.

45
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.790
<v 2>Tingler is this tingles the muscles in my face and get them activated and</v>

46
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.620
working. I haven't used it or anything else other than my face. Okay. Just FYI.

47
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.990
I just take this and got the little ball here, which is perfect.

48
00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:21.450
Sometimes I put it in the freezer is really cold.

49
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.830
I just kind of rub it and it just activate all those muscles.

50
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.120
Get them together. We are working today. We are going to be [inaudible].

51
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.610
Let's see what Sam has for me.

52
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.240
I named all my wigs.

53
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.040
So that's the look and I would suggest long hair. I love a nice hoot.

54
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.330
I think it kind of modernizes everything up to the face and like the Pokemon,

55
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.010
just a little bit supersede one and oldest, Toni Braxton.
