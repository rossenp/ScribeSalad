00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.950
<v 0>It is the United States of America's birthday, July 4th,</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
H F O D last year for July 4th.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
I got completely underwater hammered. I was scuba diving, dude. I remember.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.760
<v 1>It. I remember you were bad. I remember, uh, Billy Berbee in there, uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.080
singing the national Anthem.

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.470
Then he sang the Canadian national Anthem and it was funny. Um,

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.660
and I had a short throat, like I always do.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.840
I had a sore throat and I had to get, uh, one of the guests at the barbecue.

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.260
Who's a nurse to look at my throat and call me and antibiotics. And I left.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.860
<v 0>Here's the thing about the 4th of July was with the squeak. There's no.</v>

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.140
<v 1>More American holiday than.</v>

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.130
<v 0>The 4th of July,</v>

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.930
because all we do are staples of American culture.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.580
First of all, we get the flag.

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.330
<v 2>Out strong. I mean, all glories flying everywhere, because.</v>

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.350
<v 1>Make no mistake,</v>

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.550
you do not forget that you were in the friendly confines of the United States of

18
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.570
America on July 4th.

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.500
<v 0>You do not know.</v>

20
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.970
You could even be somebody with dementia and you're going to go,

21
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:06.450
which country am I in? In? Oh yeah. America.

22
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.350
Cause there's reminders everywhere. It's just not for one second.

23
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:10.950
Are you going to think.

24
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.920
<v 1>You're in Canada? No chance. Cause, and you know,</v>

25
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.420
what's interesting about July 4th is it only became a federal holiday in 1941.

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.700
<v 0>I did that. That was just the beginning.</v>

27
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.980
<v 1>Of world war two. It was beginning of world war II.</v>

28
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.930
I mean the United States didn't come in. Oh yeah.

29
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:27.270
The United States had already come in. They'd come in in a,

30
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.150
for me to pill hopper. So yeah, I think, um.

31
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.730
<v 0>So it's kind of like Juneteenth, hasn't been a holiday,</v>

32
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:37.260
but it's going to be one at one point like 4th of July

33
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.390
became a holiday. Yeah. Like people.

34
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.690
<v 1>Didn't even get off for 4th of July before 1941. It was always celebrated.</v>

35
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.600
It was always celebrated, um, with festival, you know,

36
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.570
festivities and fireworks, all that stuff because I gotta be honest with you.

37
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.210
I mean, we live in New York city and we got a cutout mayor, mayor,

38
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.560
bill de Blasio. And it's like, I don't, I,

39
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.950
every day I've been hearing fireworks. Yeah. I mean, it's, it.

40
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.360
<v 0>Sounded like 4th of July has been here for a month with the civil unrest going</v>

41
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.100
on. But here's the deal.

42
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.050
The actual 4th of July is coming and here's a few rules that you need to know

43
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.670
about 4th of July one,

44
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.450
God have old glory flying got up to God.

45
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.820
Have Budweiser's on-call yeah.

46
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.320
You got to drink beer all day long to celebrate America. Number three,

47
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.760
God have hot dogs. Yep.

48
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.470
You gotta eat a combination of pig and sphincter in a tube all day

49
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.810
long because that's America. Number three.

50
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.430
Nobody who doesn't have an American passport is allowed at your barbecue.

51
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.920
<v 1>For those county. Y'all did two number threes.</v>

52
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.450
<v 0>It's what it is because I'm a $3 bill. It's what it is because me and you,</v>

53
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.620
if you put us together, what do we got? $6, $6.

54
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.940
<v 1>Which is enough to buy hotdogs.</v>

55
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.800
<v 0>We form one foot and we are two half men,</v>

56
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.580
two half.

57
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.080
<v 1>Men make no mistake. Uh,</v>

58
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.170
the show guy code and girl code is coming back tomorrow for one day episode

59
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:58.080
called quarantine code. And I'm sorry I was trying to do it. I don't want to do.

60
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.520
<v 0>It. It's going to be real funny to see that show come back.</v>

61
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:05.200
It's almost like it's almost like the reboot of Roseanne where

62
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.810
everyone just looks like their grandparents. Yeah.

63
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.850
<v 1>I'm just like, yeah, I don't want to be doing the guy,</v>

64
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.880
caught a girl coat to hide my. I'm 35 years old. I got a family.

65
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.800
I mean, it's too old. Why did we bring this thing back? Because I got to do it.

66
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.280
And I'm just so tired right now. And the thought of having to do it tomorrow is.

67
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.650
<v 0>Me off. It's like when they sick,</v>

68
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:27.280
when they brought back the same cash to Goodfellows for one more run in a

69
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.200
Scorsese movie, uh,

70
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.800
and they had to use CGI to make you guys look decent. And it's just.

71
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.110
<v 1>What it is. And the truffle pig's getting 10%, unfortunately.</v>

72
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.480
Cause he sent the email right before I can't them.

73
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.160
John Adams said that July 2nd,

74
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.320
he thought was the correct date to celebrate independence.

75
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.110
Cause that's when they really wrote the declaration of independence and talked

76
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:45.430
about it. But wasn't in Tala.

77
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.740
<v 0>Uh, I don't give a about John Adams.</v>

78
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:51.880
If I can't buy you at a six packs at the bodega. You're not my favorite Adams.

79
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.930
Yeah. I mean John Adams, he.

80
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.920
<v 1>Used to turn down July 4th, um, uh,</v>

81
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.160
events in protest because he thought now, why do you think it was on July 2nd?

82
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:03.640
Because on July 2nd is when they actually wrote the declaration of independence.

83
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.280
But July 4th is when they all signed it. Is that what it is?

84
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.920
<v 0>Oh, July 2nd.</v>

85
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.780
<v 1>The continental Congress voted in favor of the declaration of independence.</v>

86
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.400
But July 4th it wants to, why is it July 4th then? Does anybody know?

87
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.000
<v 0>Because the great type of barbecue. Oh, because.</v>

88
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.870
<v 1>July 4th, the continental Congress formally adopted declaration of independence,</v>

89
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:27.850
which had been written largely by Thomas Jefferson.

90
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.100
It's a slight bone and he's canceled. He's canceled.

91
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.480
<v 0>And here's another piece of advice for you on the 4th of July.</v>

92
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.730
If you're at a barbecue where you see a lot of white air force ones

93
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.300
and long white t-shirts make no mistake.

94
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.700
You're in a black barbecue. Yeah.

95
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.770
If you have the option for a side vegetable like asparagus making no

96
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.800
mistake, you're in a white barbecue. It's what.

97
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.390
<v 1>It is. And let me tell you something.</v>

98
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.250
If you're at a barbecue and they start playing the national

99
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:04.330
Anthem and everybody in that barbecue, including your disabled grandmother,

100
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:07.300
doesn't get down on one knee. You're a racist. You're.

101
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.430
<v 0>A racist and a communist. You're a.</v>

102
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.720
<v 1>Communist. You better get granny down on one knee. I don't care.</v>

103
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.110
She breaks her hip it's for the red, white and blue.

104
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.790
<v 0>Yeah. It's what.</v>

105
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.510
<v 1>It's what it is. July 4th. Let's cancel.</v>

106
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.650
<v 0>It. Let's cancel.</v>

107
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.960
<v 1>Cancel July 4th. Cause I mean,</v>

108
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.320
our people can't even celebrate July 4th because it's all racist white men that

109
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:29.050
made the holiday. So I'm celebrating Stalin's.

110
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.970
<v 0>Birthday on July 14th. Kinsey's cancel, cancel at head sold.</v>

111
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.740
It's cause we should just do a thing where we just read somewhat read somebody

112
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:43.270
and we just go let's cancel them. Let's cancel stuff. Let's cancel.

113
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.680
Cancel it. Let's camp. How do I cancel? I want to cancel myself.

114
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.180
Let's just cancel it.

115
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.070
Cancel John Adams canceled Nancy Reagan canceled,

116
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.490
canceled Alf. The TV show canceled. Yeah,

117
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.090
because it portrayed aliens weirdly canceled.

118
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.160
Why do you keep flexing your debts?

119
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.230
I've caught it throughout the whole episode because

120
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.000
why do you keep flexing your chest too much coffee? What are you doing?

121
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.720
Are you trying to grow your? Why are you so conscious of your?

122
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.880
I'm trying to straighten out my anteater tit,

123
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.130
because we've been sitting the whole time. About four times.

124
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.540
I see new flex in them. Why are you doing that? Why are you a strange bird?

125
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.620
I'm a strange bird. You're a $3 bell. It's.

126
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.130
<v 1>What it is. Cause I mean, what can you do? I mean,</v>

127
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:33.860
this it's socialism is taken off.
