WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.340
<v 0>Yeah. It's that podcast is great because like,</v>

2
00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:04.980
we can talk about history and that's uncomfortable,

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.260
but because it's in the frame of history, it's like what? I'm not,

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.440
I'm not like whole stuff with like, um, uh, you know,

5
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:13.440
when everybody's mad about Christopher Columbus ripped down the statutes,

6
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:15.810
he w you know, he did do bad, but really, I mean,

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.300
he didn't kill as many native Americans as smallpox.

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.110
That's the truth that people don't want to talk about.

9
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.130
It's like the disease killed everybody. The disease killed the native Americans,

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.640
not the white settlers. They, they definitely killed some people,

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.870
but so did India, they made a good, they made a good tactics. Yeah. Yeah, no,

12
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.850
they definitely did. The days was killing them. And then,

13
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.330
and then the white man was like this, come on, tag me in. I finished them off,

14
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.330
but it's like, people love Gandhi. You know,

15
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.390
people love Gandhi and I it's great, but he also did have 12 year old wives.

16
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:42.751
So it's like,

17
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.290
you can say what you want about history and you could blame everything you want

18
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.310
on whatever group you want.

19
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:49.800
But the truth is that you're not going to probably like the truth,

20
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.840
but it's the truth. And that makes people uncomfortable.

21
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:55.770
So that's the P R podcast. Number one, it's comedy first. It's all about comedy.

22
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.060
So we lead with comedy,

23
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.690
but then you going to learn stuff about history that you could like regurgitate

24
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:03.150
at parties to conduct, to look somewhat cool. Honestly, I.

25
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.310
<v 1>Get it out. Really,</v>

26
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.630
all you need to know is like two sentences worth of knowledge about everything.

27
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.500
That's it, that's it.

28
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.170
You're just 1% more knowledgeable about everybody else on thing, you know, like,

29
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.030
I feel like Joe Rogan makes a living off it. We're just like,

30
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.690
he's so informed enough about everything. It's like, I'll believe you.

31
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.410
<v 0>That's what it is. I mean, I automatically, you guys are smart now.</v>

32
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.011
You know what I mean? It's like,

33
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:26.850
they know a little bit more about history than me solid. Yeah.

34
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.980
I know a couple of like famous guy quotes, like famous generals.

35
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.550
Cause you just regurgitate those and just be like, success is not final.

36
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.340
Failure is not fatal. It's the courage to continue that counts.

37
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.870
Winston Churchill, that's it blow job. And then they you.

38
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.690
You have chlamydia. That's what, it doesn't matter.

39
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.110
<v 1>We're a comedy podcast that does history. Cause we both love history,</v>

40
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:52.730
but we're basically doing the episode with the Wikipedia page, which is again,

41
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.060
one fan called us Wikipedia. Yeah. That was, have you ever donated to Wikipedia?

42
00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.630
No.

43
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.540
<v 0>That's the funniest thing. I love that every year when they're like,</v>

44
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:05.300
can we have 30 cents? I'm like, get the outta here.

45
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.030
Wikipedia got me through college, got me through high school. I'm like,

46
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.700
do you want a dollar from me. You know,

47
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:13.040
I'm going to go do it right after this because I'm starting to feel really,

48
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.270
really, I mean, surely wildfires who actually donates.

49
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.170
<v 1>I mean, they must get it right. I.</v>

50
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.750
<v 0>Don't know no idea.</v>

51
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.270
<v 1>They got to make it. If they made it easier,</v>

52
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:25.730
I would donate the reason we don't donate. It's like I got to click.

53
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:28.100
I got to put my information like a demo Wikipedia. Yeah.

54
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.550
<v 0>Yeah. Just do it with the Apple pay. Boom, Apple page. I mean,</v>

55
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.570
I just pay for everything. I don't care. I just send it first time.

56
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:38.840
Probably like a month ago. I have no idea how much money in my bank account,

57
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.820
knowing how much money I spent over the last month. It's just like,

58
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.260
double-click, that's fine. Yeah. Just here,

59
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.040
scan my face and then take my money and yeah.

60
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.450
<v 1>That's what it is. The, uh, what's your favorite? Like, uh, history time period.</v>

61
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.160
<v 0>Mine. Mine personally is world war two. Like a nah, no. I mean, I like.</v>

62
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.090
I like world too, but it's the American revolution colonial colonial America,

63
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.730
1775 area to, or like 1799. I fought,

64
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.720
I fought with that. I really know a lot about that. And I love that.

65
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.080
I mean that part of history is wild. I mean, guys are in, you know,

66
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.800
tights and shoes and wigs fighting. Um, you know,

67
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.140
it's our first con you know, the British come in, George Washington, I beat.

68
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.780
It's why I'm wild times. Everybody's got fumes and full Bush.

69
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.430
Nobody has teeth hygiene. Isn't really a thing. It's one.

70
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.540
And the lives that we've been told about what the American dream is,

71
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:35.530
it's all based on marketing and it's not real. And the mighty British empire,

72
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:39.760
none of this stuff that we know is true. It's just nice to read it with

73
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.710
[inaudible]. I was reading this book 1776 by David McCullough.

74
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.780
And I just had a gun in my mouth.

75
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.630
I had a band that like they would use in my throat. I was like,

76
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.780
if I read one more line that I was told, I wouldn't let it fly.

77
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.050
That is the worst part about getting old is when you're like, wait,

78
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.710
everything I learned, I learned in middle school. It's just the lines.

79
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.750
Oh yeah. It's just, yeah. They just making it up to tell school kids about this.

80
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:06.490
And he's like, Oh, when you do the research, you're like, no,

81
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.390
net is not a thing at all. And it's always about like, like you never like the,

82
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.380
the crazy one to me was I was at a, a world war II Memorial thing, uh,

83
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.401
over the break as well.

84
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:17.860
And I was just looking at and it was like all about like evil,

85
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:21.820
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and killed like 8,000 troops or 4,000 troops,

86
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.330
whatever it was. And like, just like, like, like levels of like,

87
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.480
just like of a whole building sure. About all that, how bad it was.

88
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.630
And I was like, you guys didn't even mention the 200,000 weekend,

89
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.320
anyone in a minute even mentioned, like,

90
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.290
I feel like if we're going to go four floors worth of Pearl Harbor and be like,

91
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.010
and this is how we retaliated. Yeah. When you win the war,

92
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:44.440
you write the history and you write the thing. Yeah.

93
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.160
<v 1>I thought about that. Like, when you think about, you hear all those battles,</v>

94
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:51.480
like Alexander, the great, you know, conquering the world. And uh,

95
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.180
they say that he was like in the front leading his troops, you're going like,

96
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.080
what is he?

97
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.500
<v 0>Yeah. Yes. It really up the most valuable man. The King.</v>

98
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.250
<v 1>Yeah. Like nobody like gets injured in the front.</v>

99
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.010
Like the kids in the front are just walking to their desk.

100
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.120
<v 0>I think about that all the time.</v>

101
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:08.550
Every time it was like a mace massive fight scene in a movie.

102
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.700
And it's just like Braveheart or whatever.

103
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.940
Like he couldn't have possibly been in front of you just die in a second. No,

104
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:17.940
you survive in the backdoor. That's what I like about colonial Americas.

105
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.890
Cause like they, it's kind of a little true there with like, yeah,

106
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.220
George Washington didn't fight. He was at the battles, but way in the back,

107
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.150
like two miles away with the telescope, just be on a magnifying glass.

108
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:29.580
Just be like, yeah. Okay. Just move that guy over there.

109
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.390
He's the baddest in the whole world. But if you're just surrounded by chaos,

110
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.600
you're going to catch a stray knife in the back or a

111
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.750
[inaudible] nobody's limping back with.

112
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.730
<v 1>A sprained ankle. It's tough.</v>

113
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.050
<v 0>It's crazy though. Additions, I slipped in the mud. Would you rather fight.</v>

114
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.450
<v 1>Like the trenches, uh, world war one the colonial time? Or like, uh, like,</v>

115
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.740
like, Oh, like Braveheart time,

116
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.060
trenches of world war one specifically was brutes boots because I,

117
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.063
the agent orange.

118
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.660
<v 0>Well, no, well that,</v>

119
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:04.100
but also like the Doug entrenches where like you would die of like, um,

120
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.890
you know, dysentery guys would die. Like there's, um,

121
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.670
th there's a great documentary called, um, we shall grow old. I believe it is.

122
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.430
And it's colorized, right? Yeah. It's world war one. That's colorized. And then,

123
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.330
and then you FA uh, th the guys would die. A very common thing.

124
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.620
People would die. They would have,

125
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.750
they would be so weak and there was no bathrooms.

126
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.730
It was just like these latrines, these holes, they would,

127
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.670
and they would be rise to the top and they'd be going to the bathroom or puking

128
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:27.720
and lose energy and drown and sh and.

129
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.800
Cause they couldn't have the energy to get their head out.

130
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.720
Chaps was telling me about like, um, captain Marine who works here. Well,

131
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.060
she is like, he was talking about how they had like, meet like a world war,

132
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:41.980
one veterans, which obviously there aren't many left.

133
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.930
I don't think there's any left. How it gets done. Right.

134
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.980
I think too is we're winding down on the twos ones down on the twos. Yeah.

135
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.690
The one veterans would have,

136
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.750
like a lot of times they'd have one finger left because it was,

137
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.980
it would be like the pinky or something. Cause they would just, their, their,

138
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.510
their trigger finger would freeze and then just cut it off.

139
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.480
And then they start using this one as a trigger for one from the trenches the

140
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:05.530
next minute, next one. That's right. Yeah.

141
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.000
It's a pinky to do Coke. Yeah. You want to get some more energy.

142
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:12.310
So you don't drown in the block. That's the Nazis.

143
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:13.690
I know world war two is hacked,

144
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:16.690
but that's what the Nazi's secret weapon wants to pertain. It was crystal meth.

145
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.940
It was, it was modern day. Crystal meth. They would give the soldiers.

146
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.000
That's why a lot of Nazi soldiers when the war was over in the perfect 10

147
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:24.670
effects, because they last a while they would kind of come to and be like,

148
00:07:24.671 --> 00:07:26.590
what did we do? Why did we do that?

149
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.200
Because he was drugging them and making the super soldier,

150
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.500
like they couldn't be stopped. It was like truly zombie.

151
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.770
What do we do less than they are hung over your way down to 6 million Jews,

152
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:40.150
genocide damage and rough night. That really like,

153
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:42.150
whenever you have hangover anxiety, it's like, well,

154
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.890
you want it could've been worse. It happened to me. You want to get a bratwurst?

155
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.630
Can you imagine the fighting after the American revolution.

156
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.070
<v 1>During the colonial period?</v>

157
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:55.060
And like you see those kids come with those uniforms, like the red coats,

158
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.480
like stockings on. It's a good strategy though, because like,

159
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.850
you may hesitate to kill him. Cause you're like, those kids look cute.

160
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.930
<v 0>I don't want to ruin that. Take your shirt off first.</v>

161
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.900
Well put together something. I learned something interesting about that too.

162
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:09.850
Like just dramatic people in general, Germany,

163
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.770
people have always been business and I'm German,

164
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.520
50% answers.com German people have always been vicious.

165
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.760
The British army hired the Hessians they were called,

166
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.330
and those are German they're from Germany. And so they were just mercenaries.

167
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:25.510
They were hired to fight and kill Americans. That's what they had. No,

168
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.660
cause in the war, they didn't give a. They were paid to go fight.

169
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.670
So they came off the shores at the battle of Brooklyn.

170
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.650
It's the first time you saw them, they came off the shore,

171
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.760
right where we live in Bay Ridge and started killing American soldiers and then

172
00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:39.580
cutting their heads off and skinning their faces and wearing them as masks.

173
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.030
And the British soldiers were on their server. Like, Whoa, these guys do it.

174
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.560
We just wanted to kill them. And we're moving up. We're taking territory.

175
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.160
They're like happy Halloween. Yikes. Yeah. I, uh,

176
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.500
my high school was built on a hash in mass grave, so, Oh, there you go.

177
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:58.140
Pretty cool horses in too. There's that hash bloody Lake.

178
00:08:58.141 --> 00:08:59.650
The bloody Lake where it's like all,

179
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.180
because then the Patriots American Patriots started killing them and just

180
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:05.400
throwing them into this Lake. I forgot.

181
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:08.160
It's like upstate New York somewhere where it's like a hundred.

182
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.870
Hessians just at the bottom of the Lake.

183
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:12.270
They just let him just put rocks on them and let them go.

184
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.390
And they believe it's a haunted Lake, which I believe too. I believe he goes.

185
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.070
That's how I learned that. I learned that my high school was built on a hessian,

186
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.140
a mass grave because my hockey coach who lived on campus was watching,

187
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.270
um, a documentary or whatever about the 10,

188
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.080
most haunted places in Rhode Island and his house was number one.

189
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.480
He was like, what the? Oh yeah. England, if you live in new England,

190
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:36.931
it's haunted.

191
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:39.570
But that's where the that's where it was a revolutionary war was for new

192
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:43.020
England. Man. If you're talking about guys who skinned people's faces,

193
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:45.540
and then they died with, through, into the bottom of the Lake, that's haunting

194
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.140
fat in the headless horseman. You know,

195
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.850
that's a story of that's a hessian soldier. That's

196
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.280
[inaudible] baby.

197
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.510
<v 1>Yeah. I didn't know that.</v>

198
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.640
I didn't know about them before we started doing the podcast,

199
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.370
but they're interesting to learn about because they wouldn't have how brutal

200
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:02.121
they were. Like,

201
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:06.830
if you're in a war and people are talking about how brutal you are

202
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.170
when like everyone's killing everyone, you're like.

203
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.520
<v 0>Doing some bad, bad shape. Yeah. They were like next level violence.</v>

204
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.830
They were scared to fight. That's why just the presence.

205
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.920
If like there was a common thing in the revolutionary war when they would say

206
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.450
when they would. It's interesting too.

207
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.570
Cause like the biggest prize in the revolutionary war was New Jersey.

208
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.070
That's why they call it like the guard and state.

209
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.660
Cause it was like the garden of America. And now it's like,

210
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.480
that's the first thing I'd give up is New Jersey. I'm like, get the out of here.

211
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.390
Got good to me. They grow tomatoes, tomatoes and corn.

212
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.790
But it's just people from New York and Philly,

213
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.220
just depending on what side of New Jersey you're on. It's like they could,

214
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.950
if we got rid of New Jersey, people just moved back to Philly or New York.

215
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.813
That's what it is.

216
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.730
<v 1>It comes to Jersey from like outside of the New York or Philly area.</v>

217
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.090
They go on these two sides of people say water really weird.

218
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.310
<v 0>Really some.</v>

219
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.260
<v 1>Water and the other one's like, would you like some water?</v>

220
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.760
<v 0>But, but they would say like when the Hessians would come,</v>

221
00:10:55.761 --> 00:10:58.820
like the soldiers would put their guns down and run away because it was like,

222
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.450
cause if you really want to learn American history, like what the truth is,

223
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.120
then you have to read the other countries. That's what I do.

224
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:08.540
So the book that I read was about the British point of view or I've read stuff

225
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:11.630
on the Japanese, on world war two from the Japanese and Germans point of view.

226
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.420
So one, I haven't read a full book. I forget what it was from.

227
00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:18.110
But I was just like the passage about like the people walking out of like

228
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.860
Nagasaki. And it was just like their, like their skin, just like, Oh yeah,

229
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.830
that's brutal. We didn't have to do. I mean, we didn't have to do that,

230
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:26.270
but we did have to do that. Cause they cause,

231
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.380
cause if you were going to the problem, why the Japanese do not give up.

232
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.320
So you got to give him, those kids do not give up. They keep fighting.

233
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.220
So it was either the options were either kill 2 million,

234
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.910
roughly American troops to invade Tokyo that would kill everybody. That would,

235
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.781
we would win it.

236
00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:45.530
But you're going to cross a lot of allied troops or kill 300,000 of them with a

237
00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:47.810
bomb. So that's what I was all for.

238
00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:49.610
Just nipping that in the bud and wrapping that up.

239
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.690
But at least giving opportunities. And then the second one is the bigger,

240
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.160
like you didn't really have to do.

241
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.320
The second one was kind of like different bond. Like

242
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.660
the second one was the bigger issue. The first one people felt like,

243
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:08.470
well you're not giving up and you're the war is lost and he was running up the

244
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.680
split. Second one. I was like, come on guy, come on. 30,

245
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.300
run out. Yeah.

246
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.020
It's like in the UFC when the guy's knocked out and then there's that blow that

247
00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:23.100
goes on his unconscious space out Colton.

248
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.250
I have to run it in you to do all that. You know, we just,

249
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.950
we just put your whole country in the microwave. I mean, you know,

250
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.980
you want it to do it again.

251
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.250
You don't need to flip it over the other side of new it again, it's hot.

252
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:39.030
The hot pocket is done. It came back fast. Oh my God.

253
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.040
It came back with 40 years. I mean,

254
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.620
solid minutes from the Marshall plan that we helped them with. But you know,

255
00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:45.640
but for the most part, yeah, yeah.

256
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.480
They gave him baseball and they ran with it all. Yeah.
