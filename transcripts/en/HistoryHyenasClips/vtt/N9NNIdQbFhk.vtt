00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.680
<v 1>Crusades where let me tell you about buzz.</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.340
Let's just call it what it is. Like I said,

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.020
Christians versus Muslims is the greatest oldest sports rivalry in history.

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.490
And this was the championship.

6
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:22.520
It was a nine game series and the Muslims won eight to one.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.260
They won eight to one, but, but,

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.380
but I think when you cross over and get the other side,

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.270
I think that the Christians are gonna be you're welcome.

10
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:30.440
That's the victors you think?

11
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:34.280
So I think that Muslims have an unfair advantage because Allah is the only true

12
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:36.710
God that's like having should kill her. Well, the reason why I,

13
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.130
I mean the thing is with, even on I'm a celibate kid in Muslim heaven,

14
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:41.240
you can just bang out verges.

15
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.310
That's what I'm going to Muslim heaven and Christian heaven.

16
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:45.290
I don't know if you, I wasn't going to the gay part. I haven't,

17
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:46.310
I'm not going to bang anybody. Yeah.

18
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.510
I think ultimately that the Christians went up game one. Yeah.

19
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.470
So the first crusade,

20
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:55.850
there was nine different crusades and the first seven were really like,

21
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.400
kind of relevant. The last group. They didn't even make it.

22
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.800
They just got killed along the way. One of them, one crusade.

23
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:04.940
I forgot what it was, not that one, but that one of them was just Christian.

24
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.490
Christians went out to crusade and then just started to shading against each

25
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:07.940
other. I mean,

26
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.970
it's just turned into a civil war crusade before the Christians went out and

27
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.580
crusaded to the middle East and started,

28
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.280
they never had seen any other people that didn't look like them. They just,

29
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.790
they were living in France and Germany and England and not leaving their little

30
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:22.460
islands or their little huts. So they looked Barbera.

31
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.060
Like they truly looked barbaric with the middle East, what everybody was clean.

32
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.710
They had soaps, they took baths. They ate the right foods. They had science.

33
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.840
So really the crusades are real.

34
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.170
It was kind of the first kind of movement everywhere.

35
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.300
Europe got woke.

36
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.340
Europe wasn't woke at all before they met the Muslims. Yeah, well, no,

37
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:45.740
they were and they were with Rome and then they,

38
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:49.460
they dipped down when religion dipped up. We've talked about that a lot. Yeah.

39
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.650
And the Arab world is flourishing.

40
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.700
They also had conquered all the way up to Spain a little bit. Yup.

41
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.040
So they ran sprain. Yeah. They got up in there.

42
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.100
They got up there and they're like, who is this? Who is his crusades? Yeah.

43
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.850
And Europe got split. Europe was split because of this gives them a 10 54.

44
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.490
Holy Roman empire was split into the East and West.

45
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.230
And also the CA the Christian Church split between the Catholic and

46
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:16.550
the Eastern Russian and Greek Orthodox would it ended up becoming so as Eastern

47
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:20.600
Orthodox and the Catholic split was so, so Europe was steel.

48
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.910
There was stupid. And everybody in the crusades,

49
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:25.700
what it was all about was Jerusalem who was sent on another app who,

50
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.200
who Jerusalem was basically like, it was kind of like New York city now. I mean,

51
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:32.990
what's the most important city in the world, New York city. Right?

52
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.360
So Jerusalem was a very important city to these groups right now.

53
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.710
It was important to the Jewish.

54
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.470
It was important to the mozzies and it was important to the Chrissy's because no

55
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:42.710
matter what, if you believe or not, the kid, Jesus was the star of the kid.

56
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:46.790
Jesus sold tickets. That kid Jesus sold tickets.

57
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.770
