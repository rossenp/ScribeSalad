00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.740
<v 1>Crusades where let me tell you about buzz.</v>

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.370
Why let's just call it what it is. Like I said,

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.050
Christians versus Muslims is the greatest oldest sports rivalry in history.

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.520
And this was the championship.

6
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:23.750
It was a nine game series and the Muslims won eight to one eight to one. But,

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.410
but, but I think when you cross over and get the other side,

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.300
I think that the Christians are gonna be you're welcome.

9
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.470
That's the victors you think?

10
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:34.340
So I think that Muslims have an unfair advantage because Allah is the only true

11
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:37.300
God that's like having tequila. Well, the reason why I, I mean the,

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.160
the thing is with, even on I'm a celibate kid in Muslim heaven,

13
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:41.270
you can just bang out virgins.

14
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.340
That's what I'm going to Muslim heaven and Christian heaven.

15
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.350
I don't know if you, I wasn't going to the gay part. I heaven.

16
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.340
I'm not going to bang anybody. Yeah.

17
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.500
I think ultimately the Christians went up game one. Yeah. So the first crusade,

18
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:55.910
there was nine different crusades. Yeah. And the first seven were really like,

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.430
kind of relevant to last three. They didn't even make it.

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.830
They just got killed along the way. One of them, one crusade.

21
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.350
I forgot what it was. What's on that one,

22
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:04.970
but that one of them was just Christian.

23
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.520
The Christians went out to crusade and then just started to shading against each

24
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:07.970
other. I mean,

25
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.030
it's just turned into a civil war crusade before the Christians went out and

26
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:13.610
crusaded to the middle East and started,

27
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.310
they never had seen any other people that didn't look like them. They just,

28
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.850
they were living in France and Germany and England and not leaving their little

29
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:22.370
islands or their little huts. So they looked barbaric.

30
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.090
Like they truly looked barbaric with the middle East, what everybody was clean.

31
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.740
They had soaps, they took baths. They ate the right foods. They had science.

32
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.170
So really the crusades are really a bit,

33
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.580
it was kind of the first kind of movement ever where Europe got like

34
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.590
woke Europe. Wasn't woke at all before they met the Muslims. Yeah.

35
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.371
Well, no,

36
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:47.780
they were and they were with Rome and then they dip down when religion dipped

37
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:51.710
up. We've talked about that a lot. Yeah. And the Arab world is flourishing.

38
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.730
They also had conquered all the way up to Spain a little bit. Yup.

39
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.110
So they ran sprain. Yeah.

40
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.720
They got up in there and they got up there and they're like, who is this?

41
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.210
Who is his crusades? Yeah. And Europe got split.

42
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.880
Europe was split because of this gives them a 10 54.

43
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.520
Holy Roman empire was split into the East and West.

44
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.260
And also the CA the Christian Church split between the Catholic and

45
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:16.010
the Eastern Russian and Greek Orthodox what it ended up becoming.

46
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.600
So as Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic split was so, so Europe was sick,

47
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.940
stupid. There were stupid. And everybody in the crusades,

48
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.730
what it was all about was Jerusalem who was sent on another app who,

49
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.230
who Jerusalem was basically like, it was kind of like New York city now. I mean,

50
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.020
what's the most important city in the world, New York city. Right.

51
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.390
So Jerusalem was a very important city to these groups right now.

52
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.740
It was important to the Jewish.

53
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.500
It was important to the mozzies and is important to the Chrissy's because no

54
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:42.740
matter what, if you believe or not, the kid, Jesus was the star of the kid.

55
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:46.820
Jesus sold tickets. That kid Jesus sold tickets.

56
