00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.330
I'm not a hundred percent gay, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.960
That's what it is. So I could tell, I fall in love with men,

10
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.960
but I have sex with women. So you take that how you want.

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.200
Definitely liked girls, but it's like, if you're going to sit here and be like,

12
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.790
are you a straight guy? It's like, no, we say, Hey, Gabe.

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.170
<v 2>Like some people are gay. Some people are straight. Uh, Chris is 100% disturbed.</v>

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.090
who would I pay a million dollars to kiss on the lips? The answers, Tom Hardy,

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330
Tom Hardy, a little punk saris. I'll get right on his lips immediately. Yeah,

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.850
sure. I want to make out with Rosario, Dawson and other beautiful,

22
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.100
but it's like, Tom Hardy just looks like he smells good.

23
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.030
I've watched that piece of movie with Reese Witherspoon and Chris pine, I think.

24
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.500
Oh, a hundred times over both of them. Absolutely.

25
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.770
It wasn't ready for war or something like that. Something about war. Oh yeah.

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.740
And it's, it's a, it's a terrible movie, but it's a awesome movie.

27
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.970
Cause the guys are so hot, dude.

28
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:39.800
The only way I get like truly super hard is if I listen to like a really

29
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.680
intellectual man, like we did an episode on history.

30
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.860
He knows when the other grass, Tyson, I was rock hard.

31
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.700
Like it was hurting my boss and I went home and I immediately tried to have sex

32
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:52.100
with a woman wasn't available. So I just jerked off to,

33
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.840
you said you're just a gay man. Who's waiting for his dad to die,

34
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:58.160
to come out of the closet. I got

35
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.690
[inaudible] tricep from push it down the gap. When you're talking about that,

36
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.524
where it's like,

37
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.650
I've reached a stage in my like porn watching career where I'm like,

38
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.360
I'll throw a dude searching,

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.700
exclusively search male porn sites. We did, we did research.

40
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.960
We did a neuroscience research on our podcast and it said that guys who watch

41
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.710
transport him, who liked that it's it's, it's actually,

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.150
it's not gay at all because what we're most attracted to as men is big and big

43
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.140
tips. So we get everyone's. Person's got a huge Dick and big. That's what

44
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.970
mine. That's all hat. That's old news. porn is way straighter than regular,

45
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.360
more boobs and and. This is just an extra Dick.

46
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.150
If I'm having sex with someone who's trans.

47
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.550
<v 3>And she's pre-op. And uh, I just.</v>

48
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.980
<v 2>In your mind to making that gay, if you're doing a doggy style,</v>

49
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.740
you just pretend like your Dick was so big. It popped through the other side.

50
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.250
<v 0>You know, that's what it is. That's all it is.</v>

51
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.770
[inaudible] you got a decent sized stick. You have about seven inches.

52
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:05.770
You said right now? No, no.

53
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.560
<v 3>I'm I'm six and a six.</v>

55
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.690
five, and three quarters. But with air max on my Dick,

56
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.830
the six air max take you like another inch. I'm about,

57
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.070
I would say I'm about seven inches, eight with warts

58
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.340
because you got a seven inch piece. That's a pretty decent seven inches.

59
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.360
Not a woman has never told me, but she's had a problem with my Dick.

60
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.450
But that's different than seven inches. No one's ever said to me either,

61
00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.820
but I don't have a 77 inch piece. I got pictures of it on my phone.

62
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:45.180
I can pull it right out. Let's check book. I can pull up my, I mean,

<v 2>Up, let me just tell you the type of disturbed Chris kid.</v>

72
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.920
Chris is before I really knew him. Like we kinda knew each other. Like we,

73
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:25.680
he sent me a pic of Dick before.

74
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.730
<v 0>Like we had a full conversation. If I could trust you or not. Yeah. Wow.</v>

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.560
Show to the camera. That's illegally. Show it to the camera. Go ahead. Yeah.

76
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.150
go.com/kfc. That's a Coke can in his pants. What it is, fellas.

77
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.000
That's a zucchini that looks eggplant. It looks like,

78
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.490
I think you're underselling yourself. Yeah. That's full.

79
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.860
That's full. What the hell are you also grabbing your balls at the bottom?

80
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.550
There's the hall. I'll do that exact picture. I grabbed the ball. I don't know,

81
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:57.360
but I'm, I'm definitely on full board. Cause I listened to an Obama speech.

82
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.760
Real smart. Yo D and the D stands for

83
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.490

84
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.010
Cracking these jokes and. You got it. Big.

85
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.000
You just go in there and you have a good time. I'll be honest.

86
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:17.370
That's borderline inconvenient. I don't know if I'd want that.

87
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.220
I remember in high school, I had this kid who was on the hockey.

88
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.790
<v 1>Team. Like, I mean, he had like a Pringle can and I was like, dude,</v>

89
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:27.510
what the is that? Like, that makes no sense. And he was like, yeah,

90
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:32.040
like this hot chicken in our school. I tried to her in the jacuzzi this weekend.

91
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:34.440
And just like, she was like, no. And I was like, I.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.380
<v 0>Was like, I'm done. Well, you run it. You must run it. Who's the jacuzzi.</v>

93
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.340
You going to get meningitis 17 year olds

94
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.920
who haven't heard of STDs and stuff like idiots. I used to.

95
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.510
<v 3>Work in college. I used to work at a health club and they had hot pool and like,</v>

96
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.250
uh, and gay guys, actually,

97
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:57.740
they have ways that they communicate and some of it would be like leaving

98
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.450
or something like that to let them know like that another gay guys there,

99
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.470
it was weird side.

100
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.740
<v 0>My manager comes around. Like I would take a pebble and put it there.</v>

101
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:10.700
And it's clean. You say.

102
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.920
<v 3>You mean? Yeah.</v>

103
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.600
<v 0>They made me like, they're keys now. No, it's like actual.</v>

104
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.670
He could've lied to me. He could have been gauging me. And he's a wild,

105
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.940
wild community. You know about bug chasing. No. Do tell,

106
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.260
let me tell you about bug chase. This is going to be, and it's a pit.

107
00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:31.600
It's a movie about his own life. He's I'm Chrissy, the bug chase.

108
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.390
It's it's it's when a guy has sex, unprotected, bareback,

109
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.010
raw DZ sex with another guy who he knows has HIV

110
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.480
has the bug. And then they get off by chasing the HIV bug.

111
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.580
Whether they get it or not, they don't care.

112
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:50.950
It's about coming about the thrill of the bug.

113
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.470
Why that's like the most dangerous game humans,

114
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.260
what they do. Yeah. That's what they do.
