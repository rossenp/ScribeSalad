1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>All right. So back to indigenous people's day or the first peoples day. Um,</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.880
so, so basically it's, there's a show.

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.820
It says in history that we learned about it to grow and move up by native

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:15.840
American activists and art, native Americans are all activists. I mean.

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.620
<v 1>Well, no, I don't think they are left with much of an option,</v>

6
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.350
but to fight for the tiny that we gave them.

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.910
<v 0>That's like, I love how, like,</v>

8
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:26.210
when people were yelling about the Cleveland Indians and the Washington

9
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:31.010
Redskins, it's like that wasn't native Americans. They don't give a. Like, no,

10
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:31.970
but that was all bunch of.

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.980
<v 1>Finally became when, when enough white people were upset.</v>

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.480
<v 0>About mascots.</v>

13
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.500
<v 1>Native Americans were like, Oh, well, if this is the thing,</v>

14
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:46.040
that's going to bring attention to all the up you've done.

15
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.770
<v 0>Yes. It should have been named the Washington Karen's.</v>

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.740
<v 1>Dude. I would have loved. Could you imagine.</v>

17
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.410
<v 0>In their helmets just had a little blonde hair.</v>

18
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.890
<v 1>Just the Nancy. It's just the Nancy grace haircut on the side logo.</v>

19
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.010
Oh dude, that would be great. And their fight song is called.

20
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:04.760
Can I speak to your manager? Can I speak to your

21
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660
[inaudible] we're back with the Patriots down 14 to seven are the Karen's

22
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:14.570
Karen's driving the ball duty.

23
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.980
It's native Americans were like, Oh cool. Yeah, you guys don't like that.

24
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:23.450
They call it the Indians. We never had a chance to voice our opinion.

25
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.100
It was the best buy. And you're like,

26
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.550
did you know that that actually plot of land bullet belong to the legato?

27
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.290
You know? Like they were like, wow.

28
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.930
<v 0>That's pretty up wind hundreds.</v>

29
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.990
<v 1>Of years ago. And they're like, no, a hundred years ago.</v>

30
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.130
<v 0>Yeah. Your grandmother's are don't get me started.</v>

31
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.100
<v 1>Yeah, because I dated one. I grew up.</v>

32
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.860
<v 0>He would scrape it. He would flip me around on his horse.</v>

33
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.580
<v 1>I dated, never calls you back. That was his name.</v>

34
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.370
Marie, sorry, Mary Lou. I just felt like we didn't really hit it off.

35
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.770
The son told the coyote to not call. You got, gotta get out of,

36
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.790
not call him. I went to the river for a message,

37
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.820
but realized that the snake had taken my love for you.

38
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.190
What does that mean? Runs with storms, having sex with your sister.

39
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.300
It means I'm carnival over it just gotta be like.

40
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.260
<v 0>I can get out of anything by just blaming it on the elements.</v>

41
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.283
Just listen to them.

42
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.200
<v 1>To the soul of the, of the world and you can blame it anything.</v>

43
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.130
Why don't you show up and you go, Oh, I just felt like the wind, the, uh,

44
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.100
the soul of the wind told me to go home and take it.

45
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.960
<v 0>Now, anytime I'm about to break up with a girl,</v>

46
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:39.290
I just start doing meditation and yoga just so I can be like one with my spirits

47
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.790
to like blame it on that. Yeah.

48
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.770
<v 1>I'm just really doing a lot of.</v>

49
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.700
<v 0>Inner work. Not you. It's my chakras say that it's not right.</v>

50
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.740
And do you respect that now?

51
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.900
<v 1>Any native American blood,</v>

52
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.980
you can tell them that an Eagle came and saw you and brought the spirit of the

53
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:59.090
wind and I am destined for other,

54
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.500
But it's, it's so up because when you love Colorado and stuff, like,

55
00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:11.580
it's kind of what you're saying. You have to learn the up parts.

56
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.710
What we're talking about, like with the,

57
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.700
with the native Americans and all that kind of is it's they gave them land.

58
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.850
Dude. I didn't think about this until recently. In fact it was,

59
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.570
I think what made me think of it was the last time I was on history hyenas when

60
00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:29.370
I was in fifth grade in Aurora, shout out mission, Viejo elementary school,

61
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.100
Roadrunners, dude, getting it done.

62
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.010
<v 0>You should be able, it's just sounds like a good burrito. It is.</v>

63
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.500
I'd like to mission van burrito with extra guac.

64
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.150
Could you do a mission Viejo with no beans?

65
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.550
<v 1>That's good. That's pretty good. And you go,</v>

66
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.530
you guys do case that fresco on that or are you a Chihuahua cheese?

67
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.410
Um, but they, uh,

68
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.130
in fifth grade they took us to a

69
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.390
reservation. Wow. To see how life is on the reservation.

70
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.330
And there's just other ten-year-old kids there that are like.

71
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.680
<v 0>Hey, yeah.</v>

72
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.530
I remember being that live in your neighborhood that you would never meet. No,

73
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.060
but I'm saying like, they're not even in my neighborhood.

74
00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:08.880
We went to their reservation, dude. We went to Eastern.

75
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.520
<v 1>Colorado. Also. They do,</v>

76
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:15.150
they don't put them in like Inglewood or Littleton.

77
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.380
They put them in like four East, like Sterling, like it out.

78
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.640
And you go out there and it's like dirty, dusty. Cause it's not,

79
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:25.410
it's not by any good land. Right.

80
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.850
And you're just this 10 year old kid looking at another 10 year old kid.

81
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.230
And he's like, Hey, you know,

82
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.620
like I remember they would like come up and see us and we'd be like, Hey,

83
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:35.454
you know.

84
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 0>We were ships to them. Oh, a Toyota child. Oh,</v>

85
00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:42.600
yellow school bus. It's not real.

86
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.380
But I always remember the craziest thing you ever get with an arrow. I'm like,

87
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.460
Oh God, come on of us. Came back without hair. We've got scalped.

88
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.530
<v 1>Remember getting on the bus and being like, yo,</v>

89
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.110
this is a field trip for us.

90
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.580
And we're going home. Yeah. They just live here.

91
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.840
<v 0>Kind of went to like a zoo for humans. Exactly what I was thinking.</v>

92
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.240
You want to watch them feed

93
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.120
[inaudible]. Yeah. But that's what looking at eats the

94
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.953
 chicken fingers with his tools are made from mammoth bones. But.

95
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.610
<v 1>With the Bureau of Indian affairs did, is they came in and they were like, eh,</v>

96
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:21.480
they don't want this.

97
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.710
<v 0>Right. You're still, they have some statutes I believe up in, in Germany have,</v>

98
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.860
uh, some Nazi stuff is still up there just as a reminder, the kids be like, Hey,

99
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.260
that's not a part of our, we don't like that part of our history.

100
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.150
<v 1>I'm pretty sure that if you're German,</v>

101
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:36.600
you're aware of what went down in the thirties and forties.

102
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.610
<v 0>Yeah. We did that. Where that you didn't know,</v>

103
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.850
but that feels like a more real like, Oh man, that's so weird.

104
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:48.480
So grandpa was like a bad guy. Yeah. Pretty bad. But

105
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.040
Germany, Japan, South.

106
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.800
<v 1>South Africa, they do this thing where they acknowledge they do.</v>

107
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.750
America seems special in the fact that we're just like, now what? Like slavery.

108
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.480
And you're like, come on. Yeah. We still bring that up. And you're like,

109
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.290
I don't know, native Americans, we put them on reservations. And we're like,

110
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.470
I mean, we're really going to change it from Columbus day. I like home bus.

111
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.420
We can't call on Columbus. And you're like, I don't know.

112
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.390
Maybe get them fresh drinking water. And then we can call it Columbus day.

113
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.550
How about we get them some decent?

114
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.850
How about we just kind of help them out a little and then we can call it white

115
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.770
dude with pink Dick day, we could get all nuts. We can get nuts if we want to.

116
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.480
But the F th that's the only like woke part of me is like,

117
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:35.210
why don't we help out the people that are still going through this.

118
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.220
<v 0>Put a part of our tax money to help them out. And that's what it should be.</v>

119
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:40.210
But I guess it's just not.

120
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.760
<v 1>Um, I heard like the woke his out of someone that's in their sixties where I was</v>

121
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:47.200
like, that's crazy.

122
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:52.090
I haven't heard that a Republican or Republican woman was

123
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:56.590
like, yeah, I Patriot. Yeah. She's a true Patriot. But I would,

124
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.150
I would guess I'm not for sure, but I know she voted for Trump in 2016.

125
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.490
Think maybe she'd vote for Trump in 2020. She was like, she smokes weed.

126
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.290
We were smoking weed and. And she was like, yeah, I think, um, I think,

127
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.400
uh, blacks and native Americans should be able to get the license to sell legal

128
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.360
weed. Like,

129
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:20.470
I think that's what we should do is like give them the licensing to sell,

130
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:22.600
to open dispensaries and stuff. And you're like,

131
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.390
that's woke is because you know what?

132
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.640
<v 0>That would go a long way.</v>

133
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:31.270
Because I do know when I went to Yanis and I went to Germany, artistry,

134
00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:35.530
tour guy told us the reason why Jews have been able to assimilate back into

135
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:38.410
German society and culture. Of course, there's always, anti-Semitism,

136
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.400
there's hate and racism anywhere you go against every group,

137
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.260
somebody doesn't like somebody for some reason.

138
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.860
<v 1>Falling into, uh, problems that have no effect on you.</v>

139
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.010
Your boy went through a big phase of eating edibles and reading up on the

140
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:54.670
Sudanese civil war. And that, uh, that'll rock ya.

141
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.980
<v 0>It's like, it's horrible. But it's like,</v>

142
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.130
there's horrible things happening all day. Every day. There's so many people,

143
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.880
it's just, the numbers are what they are. But they said all the jerk, not all.

144
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.630
One of the things that German government did is like in the 1950s,

145
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.290
they gave Jewish citizens money, like a little bit of money. They were like,

146
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.210
we know this, isn't going to solve the problems,

147
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.800
but here's some money kind of like reparations to just be like, we aren't sorry.

148
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:19.900
The new German government like wants you here.

149
00:08:19.901 --> 00:08:22.180
And like made it very easy for them to get businesses.

150
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:24.940
And it was like apologetic, as opposed to being like, Hey,

151
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:26.290
that didn't happen the way you thought it.

152
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.860
<v 1>But that's what you run into with American, with, especially with,</v>

153
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:32.690
with American thought in the light, the way our, this,

154
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:36.520
the way we work is if you were to give, uh,

155
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.050
blacks and native Americans rights to own, dispensary's immediately,
