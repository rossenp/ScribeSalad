00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 1>It's going on, everybody. Yas,</v>

2
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.740
this is the gayest podcast in the universe because it's pride month.

3
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:10.820
So let's get the gout.

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.060
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.240
<v 2>Happy, pride everybody. I'm Chrissy in the closet. Um,</v>

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.230
but I'm out of the closet today. Um, I just got, I went, um,

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.690
on a website and I just bought a shirt. I'm going to post a picture of it.

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.420
It's it's a shirt that says finished him and it's two guys blown each other.

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.840
It's just what it is. Listen, today is going to be a good episode.

10
00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:33.740
It's gay pride. It's it's June. Um, you really feel it here in the West village.

11
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:36.410
You feel it right in your, in the West village. Um,

12
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.920
and so we're going to talk about Michael Angelo who make no mistake was a gay

13
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.740
kid that loved to paint. And he listen,

14
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.320
Michael Michelangelo was a kid beautiful painter,

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.130
but make no mistake that kid behind closed doors was doing a little bit of

16
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.160
spinning the wheel. He spun the wheel a few times.

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.380
<v 1>In-between his muddy, cheat commission sculptures that can pick a few eggplants.</v>

18
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.740
<v 2>Because the truth of the situation is, and I know it's an unpopular opinion,</v>

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.660
but if you're a man and there's nothing wrong with this,

20
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:05.240
but if you're a man and you're a hairdresser or you're an artist,

21
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.820
or you're a nurse, you're just a gay guy. You just,

22
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.070
you just got a little bit of gay in you and that's okay.

23
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.700
I was a pediatric physical therapist and they said the women,

24
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:18.590
it's mostly a female, uh, job oriented job. And the women, when they first, uh,

25
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:20.450
when I first got to they're like, you have to be gay. And I was like,

26
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:23.330
I'm not gay, but now 10 years later, guess what they were, right?

27
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.040
<v 1>Yeah. Cause they predicted the future. You just couldn't see it at the time.</v>

28
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.090
Cause you had pushed it down. Yeah. I pushed it down. But now make no mistake,

29
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.400
pulling it up because your buys are.

30
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.510
<v 2>I'm by buzzer and my father's diabetes is getting uncontrollable.</v>

31
00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:37.520
So he's getting close and the Gates common out.

32
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.900
It's creeped out every time every, every, every time my dad's sugar goes up,

33
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.160
I get a little bit closer to sucking a.

34
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.080
<v 1>What it is just going to come up.</v>

35
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.120
But I've noticed that like the tries used to be strong.

36
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.090
Cause you were pushing it down. Yeah. But now that you're pulling it out,

37
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.260
you're letting the gay up.

38
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.290
Your buys are starting to show a little bit cosmic numbers by yeah.

39
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.153
Pun intended. Yeah.

40
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.700
<v 2>Hi intended one day. Make no mistake. I'm going to pull one right into my mouth.</v>

41
00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.603
Yeah.

42
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.350
<v 1>Because out we need an animator please. Whoever you are out there,</v>

43
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:07.190
we know we got a few photos. I need you to make the cartoon where Chris is.

44
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.820
Uvula is getting hit by a Dick and it looks like a speed bag. It's what it is.

45
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.530
Especially since you throw hands, we need.

46
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.630
<v 2>It. It's raining out. It's a beautiful day in [inaudible].</v>

47
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.280
<v 1>Should we just do this whole podcast and stereotypical gay voice in honor of the</v>

48
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:21.350
LGBTQ community?

49
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.300
<v 2>Well, the thing is yes. I want to say yes,</v>

50
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:26.210
but it's 2019 and there are a lot of straight men,

51
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.560
straight white men that have wives and children that talk like this very proudly

52
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.311
father's day on Sunday.

53
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:33.980
Happy father's day to all the fathers out there and shout out Smith, tell water,

54
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.530
shout outs to tell water department happy father's day to anybody.

55
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:39.230
Who's got a Dick or it's just everyone, you know, whether you have it,

56
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.620
we're born with it. He got a postop happy father's day. Yeah. Um,

57
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.290
so one of the,

58
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.850
one of the dads on the thread that we have that we communicate

59
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.050
with was like, Oh, you know, donuts. Um, I know it's donuts with dad,

60
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.350
but don't you think it's a little, we shouldn't be giving our kids.

61
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.970
We shouldn't be promoting donuts and Cody make it something else.

62
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.130
Could we make it like a fruit? And I said a second, this is the moment I know.

63
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:10.000
And I'm certain of that. Crystal clear, Chris, he turns into steel pipe.

64
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.840
Chrissy here at here comes yet. And I said, look, guy,

65
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.810
I said thing is if you're a freak of a kid, right?

66
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.750
Cause you're a freak. Make no mistake. You're a freak.

67
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.650
If you're riding that on a public forum to the school,

68
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.390
you're a freakazoid. Okay. You're in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Okay.

69
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.400
He's making you not feel comfy one feet. Yeah. He's making me not feel comfy.

70
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.200
Wumpy okay. This is in Portland, Oregon.

71
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.000
We're going to make that a t-shirt Mike, write it down comfy.

72
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.020
He's got to be sharp, comfy feet and spin the wheel.

73
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.370
The thing is your kid. I know that sugar is bad. I know it's the enemy.

74
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.590
I listen. I know that sugar and white men are the enemy.

75
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.200
I know those are the biggest problems that we have in the United States are

76
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.580
sugar and straight white men. I,

77
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.200
I I'm aware if you don't think Michelangelo painted his a little bit, but yeah.

78
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.370
I mean, here's the thing. I mean, it was different being gay back then though.

79
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.980
Yeah. He had one, uh,

80
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.870
it's disputed whether it was a lover or not. Nobody knows. But uh,

81
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.830
his name was uh, Tomasa [inaudible].

82
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.770
<v 3>1833.</v>

83
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.480
He wrote to Michelangelo saying I flee from evil deeds and wished to flee

84
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:21.570
them for, I cannot make love with anyone, but you okay?

85
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.750
<v 2>That's positive. Yeah. Kid want to bang out a little bit. He's a gay kid.</v>

86
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.260
He's a gay kid. He said he wants to make love with anyone. But this kid Thomas.

87
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:30.750
Exactly. So this is one of the sun. It's that? His nephew,

88
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:34.140
when he published his son, he changed. He made her all these pumps,

89
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.980
his subject female. But it's that line right there. Cause it's not a fact.

90
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.460
Nobody knows for sure if he was gay, but look right. He liked to sculpt.

91
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.300
He liked to sculp man. And they looked hot. They looked hot. He had no wife.

92
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:48.210
He had no kids. And he always hung out with this kid for decades.

93
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:52.350
This kid was actually at his funeral. He was by his side the whole time.

94
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.230
And um, this was the kid he loved. So he was also,

95
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.560
and he also went with his full first name, which according to my father,

96
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:01.650
Tony Dak, Fred Flintstone. If you go with your full first name, Michael Angelo,

97
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.110
Steven, you know Jonathan, it means you're a gay kid.

98
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.890
If he would've went in his mic, it's a different thing. But it's a pretty,

99
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.460
a foolproof theory. Three things like, yeah. If like any guy in that,

100
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.550
like if you introduce yourself as Steven, he'd be like, you would,

101
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.690
this guy sucks. Yeah. I'm trying to think of Mateo.

102
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.730
It's all what you shorten it you'd be like Matt,

103
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.510
if it's four letters or Underlink, if it's John or Joe or something like that,

104
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.180
then it's no problem. But if you're over a few letters, like you Yonis,

105
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:28.620
he's like cultural. He doesn't know what to make of it, but you know? Yeah.

106
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.770
Like if, if, if, if Mike Marsh was Michael mush, he'd be like, yeah,

107
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.460
what's easy gay guy. He said what? The guy, most young probably is gay kid.

108
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.010
His name's Michael. Yeah. So your father,

109
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:40.920
probably everyone has the one Greek friend that called the Greek. Right?

110
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.290
Cause I had a friend Demetrius the Greek, the Greek. Yeah. Yeah.

111
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.400
He would just call them D the Greek DataGrid I posted a picture of myself in

112
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:54.870
front of a, uh, a thing, a thing I saw on Friday,

113
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:58.430
down in the West village that said, mom, mom, I'm gay. And I told him,

114
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.070
I posted a picture of me in front of it. Yeah.

115
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.380
And I got all these messages from gay people being like,

116
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.240
thank you for being an ally. I think if you're being an ally,

117
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.830
it's like the fact that people want to hurt gay people.

118
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.170
It's just beyond my comprehension. Why you would want there's what,

119
00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:16.610
what do gay people do it, they control the population. fantastic.

120
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.140
<v 1>Yeah. It's a Gretta. Great. Yeah. Thank you for your service.</v>

121
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.930
<v 2>Absolutely. Thank you. Because you know, some of these kids, like I'd rather,</v>

122
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.750
I'd rather have gay guys running around than some of these,

123
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.120
some of these children that, you know,

124
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.070
are just a little annoying and not at the beach.

125
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.830
<v 1>Yeah. I just, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I beach goers. Yeah.</v>

126
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.420
<v 4>Yeah, yeah. You don't send these kids washing off.</v>

127
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.643
Here's the thing.

128
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.550
<v 1>Wait, shuts yet. Here's the thing. We also can't act like, listen,</v>

129
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.200
if you go to a neighborhood and you see a lesbian couple walking around and it's

130
00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:53.770
a dangerous neighborhood by a house in the neighborhood that that neighbor is

131
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:57.370
about to get cute. Lesbians are like the Marines of gentrification.

132
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.030
They're in the first tough lesbians, like park slope.

133
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:03.820
We started seeing lesbians walk around and uh,

134
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.230
that's when you supposed to buy a house,

135
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.100
cause that neighborhood's gonna flip gay people make, look nice. Right?

136
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.600
<v 2>Our gay peers. I mean Matteo lane, the creativity, the vision that,</v>

137
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.090
that the talent of that kid has off the charts, Tim Dylan,

138
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.430
a totally different kind of gay. He's like a straight gay guy,

139
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.220
just straight gay guy, but still his mind,

140
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:24.430
the way it works like to lose gay people is to lose like the most creative

141
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:25.264
people we have.

142
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.690
<v 1>So Tim Dillon is his kind of guy who wants to the out of Mateo a hundred</v>

143
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.570
percent. Right. But he never can. He never.

144
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.710
<v 2>Now if Tim Dillon. Yeah. If, if Rogen,</v>

145
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.200
if one day decides to step away from Tim Dylan's career,

146
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.090
Tim Dillon is going to be like, this could make it Michelangelo [inaudible]

147
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.600
He was born in caprese. And then Kim was an artist,

148
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.560
mother died or the mother died or the mother, he had the father situation,

149
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:49.080
the mother, the mother died early shoot,

150
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:52.150
which I think she drank herself to death. Yeah. Um, and uh,

151
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.210
and then he would go on to create the, the biggest thing is the Sistine chapel.

152
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.760
He was raised by a well, let's be, let's be honest.

153
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:00.660
A lot of my friends think it's a 16th chapel chapel.

154
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.170
So I think there's 15 other ones. So that's, there's no,

155
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.550
there's no mistake. The 16 chapel pie, Patty fly balls,

156
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.270
Debo warm my boys like that. They think that it's 1500 ones and he did the 16.

157
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.000
<v 1>Eight questions. You're going to, then you go into six to eight while we'll.</v>

158
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.610
<v 2>Meet me in deep will be going back to 12th and 13th. We're going to go off to,</v>

159
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.590
we're going to go into water. We want to see them in order.

160
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.310
So we're going to start at one. These guys starting at 16, the idiot.

161
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.630
He thought painting was gay Michelangelo guy. He really thought it was.

162
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.860
<v 1>And uh, he, he hated when people referred to him as a painter.</v>

163
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.840
That's why he reluctantly painted the Sistine chapel. It was a,

164
00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:38.080
he,

165
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.470
I think he did sculptures for like 12 Pope's or whatever the hell it was a lot

166
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:45.970
of Pope's. But he, one of the Pope's asked him to, to carve his,

167
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.700
um, mausoleum, his tube. Yeah.

168
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.130
<v 2>Well his most famous work is St. Peter's Basilica.</v>

169
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.350
<v 1>I signed that. I think he was an architect behind that, which is crazy. Yeah.</v>

170
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.070
I don't think he actually.

171
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.360
<v 2>Built it. He was a Renaissance man though.</v>

172
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:01.520
Didn't he also have an original version of a plane in like the 16 hundreds that

173
00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:02.670
was Leonardo da Vinci.

174
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.580
<v 1>Close enough. Yeah. They lived at the same time when she was a little older,</v>

175
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.310
they actually didn't like each other. They were rivals.

176
00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:13.760
They were really competitive with each other. Yeah. Yeah. But, um, um,

177
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.020
he did do with, uh, the piano, which is gorgeous. I've seen it in person.

178
00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:22.640
I've been to Florence. Um, obviously the David and everyone says, well,

179
00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:24.500
the David's got really big hands.

180
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.030
And the reason was because the David was initially supposed to be like

181
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.870
high up over the city. And they wanted the, the, they wanted, uh,

182
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.270
the [inaudible] family and all the politicians at that time,

183
00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:39.410
the palace people wanted a bunch of big biblical characters all around the city,

184
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.590
but they realized how hard it was to lift David up.

185
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.320
So they just canceled all the rest of them in and just do the David.

186
00:09:45.321 --> 00:09:48.530
And because it was so beautiful and the detail was so great,

187
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.040
they decided to have it lower so people could see all the details of right now.

188
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.460
So it's in Florence, they're just in Florence, just in Florence, in the museum.

189
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.400
So it's behind, you know, you can't even see it. It's so the, the,

190
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.670
the mob of people that go to see it, but it's really big. And there it is.

191
00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:03.650
And he's got a tiny piece, but you know what?

192
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.820
Mediterranean kids were grown big head till he does have a big head, but they,

193
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:11.030
they made him Michelangelo made those proportions,

194
00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:12.140
the big head and the big hands,

195
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.310
because this sculpture was initially meant to be a pie.

196
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:17.240
You're supposed to be looking.

197
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.250
<v 2>Up at it. Yeah. But.</v>

198
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.380
<v 1>If, but it's piece, those stayed small.</v>

199
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.170
<v 2>Peace States won and he gave him pubes. So the kid had fumes. Yeah.</v>

200
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.350
<v 1>They couldn't, they couldn't manscape back then everybody had phones. Yeah.</v>

201
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.900
<v 2>And he had big camp. Me who knows me, big hands, you know,</v>

202
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.100
but maybe that could be maybe one of them a bit cans. Maybe that's his fantasy.

203
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.020
<v 1>Yeah. And maybe he was a grower, you know,</v>

204
00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:37.970
maybe one of the first put the piece in the mouth.

205
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.860
It felt like you were doing a little bit of picking a blanket,

206
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:40.694
but then it grew up.

207
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.820
<v 2>She would question me as you're looking at this statue. Darn, absolutely.</v>

208
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.590
The book scroll down. Yeah, we got it.

209
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.290
There's only one thing with Yani the feet, but look at the feet.

210
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.690
What do you think it looks to be? Can we zoom in on the feet?

211
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.900
Because that's the only thing that that's Yani is only thing is you got to have,

212
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.790
you can't have jacked up feet. He's not going to go down there.

213
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.470
I'm not going to crack you open and clean you out.

214
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.380
What do you think of the feet? Do they do a nice job on the feet? Let's see.

215
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.100
<v 1>Kids got nice feet. He's got long toes doll.</v>

216
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.960
<v 2>So if I could press a button and make David come to light,</v>

217
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.980
if you put that foot right in your mouth.

218
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.580
<v 1>My mouth, cause would you bag him out? Would you crack open and clean up?</v>

219
00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:14.540
David I'd spin the wheel with David. He was obviously a gifted,

220
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:17.000
talented guy to be able to do this stuff. Like my friend,

221
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.790
Jesse [inaudible] can do sculpt and paint. You're just born.

222
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:23.630
I could not paint you a Smurf. I can't draw you a Smurf. Everything.

223
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:25.970
I draw looks like a stick figure. This,

224
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.180
he carved that out of marble with a chisel.

225
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.660
He took a block of marble and made that look like that.

226
00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:37.400
Like how do you even begin to comprehend how to do that is

227
00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:41.150
unbelievable. But anyway, the [inaudible] family was a,

228
00:11:41.151 --> 00:11:43.850
they were bankers and they were like the most powerful family.

229
00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:45.830
This was during the Renaissance in Florence,

230
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.840
they controlled Florence and they commissioned him early on the DC family.

231
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:54.400
Like he started working for the DDGs, like 17. Then he started working.

232
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:59.290
I became famous, uh, the piano. It was like his first big, um,

233
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.090
sculpture. And it made him absolutely famous. The piano. There it is. That is,

234
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.730
um, and I think the piano, I think it, it means pity right in English. Does it,

235
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.270
you know? And it's the Virgin, Mary who you're,

236
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.060
you shouldn't be making your cross right now. Yeah.

237
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.160
It's a Virgin Mary and there's a dead Jesus. It's brutal, but it's an absolute,

238
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:21.310
beautiful, beautiful sculpture. And from there he got famous.

239
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.410
Then he was asked to, uh, create the tomb for the, for the, for the Pope. Um,

240
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:30.700
he went to Rome, um, and, and painted the Sistine chapel reluctantly,

241
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.870
because he didn't want to be a painter. And plus,

242
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.480
nobody wanted to do that job because you have to lay on your back and do it.

243
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.980
Right. It's wild.

244
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.520
The way he painted that is wild on his back on this huge scaffolding.

245
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.250
<v 2>And it's not like it's not a key at helpers.</v>

246
00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:44.910
He painted every detail of painted that himself. Yeah. You can't,

247
00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:47.970
if you're a painter, you can't own a paint company. You have to do it.

248
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:49.340
You're the one that has the art to do it.

249
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.330
<v 1>Crazy. Dude, the piano, he, he, he did the piano, that sculpture, which is,</v>

250
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.260
I think a six feet by six feet block of marble.

251
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.350
He did that in a year, which is crazy.

252
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.810
<v 2>And I think he did that in his early twenties.</v>

253
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.850
Have you ever seen this stuff when you've been here?

254
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.190
<v 1>I've seen it. I've seen the piano. I haven't seen the David,</v>

255
00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:12.270
but I have seen the piano in Florence. It's all in Florence and go to his Moses.

256
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:12.990
Right.

257
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.330
<v 2>Okay. So some of his work is in Florence. Some is in Rome.</v>

258
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.450
Have you seen the vintage area? You've been there.

259
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.350
<v 5>Been there a couple of times. He's like one of my favorite artists. He's yeah.</v>

260
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.390
<v 1>Yeah. Cause you're not going to ever date a girl.</v>

261
00:13:24.391 --> 00:13:29.370
Who's been seeing the PR PR who's who's seen any of Michelangelo's

262
00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:30.660
work in person. That's just not your.

263
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.000
<v 2>Demo on what it is. You haven't been down the Jersey shore.</v>

264
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.400
If you go to any museum and you see like how the Greeks did it, you know,

265
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.110
in their statutes and how beautiful they are. And then,

266
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.460
and then you walk to the Italian room.

267
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.920
You just like you forget about the degree. Key Greeks even existed.

268
00:13:43.921 --> 00:13:45.210
That doesn't happen. No, it does.

269
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:49.830
Because th th th th the detail that the Italians have is un-fucking-believable.

270
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:52.650
And not only can they do it on a big scale, but they could do it.

271
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.520
Somebody statutes are microscopic, and these kids are cutting them up. You know?

272
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.470
Not only can they do a good sculpture.

273
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.750
<v 1>They can also throw it out. Some good concrete in your backyard.</v>

274
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.840
<v 2>You know it right down. We need a pool built and you need it. You need some,</v>

275
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.540
you need some marble or you need some masonry done. Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.870
Call Sally Goossens. Cause I guarantee you,

277
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.900
there's not a place in the world where the water doesn't move as,

278
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.090
it doesn't flow as smooth as it does in Smithtown. Smithtown.

279
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.970
Smithfield got good water. Good boy. Shouts. Shentel water department.

280
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:24.000
Does anyone need another water? I'd like to have another water,

281
00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:25.020
but I also gotta pee, but.

282
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.700
<v 5>Okay.</v>

283
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.590
<v 1>Okay. Wild about Italian kids, especially back then,</v>

284
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.300
they do have long wild names because Michael Angelo's full name is Michael

285
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:41.200
Angelo de Ludovico [inaudible].

286
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.880
Wow.

287
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.870
<v 2>Wow. But Greeks have long wild names still. Yeah, but we don't, you know,</v>

288
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.550
the difference between Greeks is our, our names are long.

289
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.400
These guys have a lot of last names. I understand what you mean. Like,

290
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:51.980
what's your guy's name again? Who made the suit?

291
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.860
<v 1>The Giovanni blush Yani. Jean brownie. Russia.</v>

292
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.860
This guy's Michelangelo says Michelangelo de

293
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.640
[inaudible] [inaudible] yeah. That's his full name?

294
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.530
It's a full kid was born at 1475. I was born in 1975 and two cute kids. Wow.

295
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.420
300 years apart. Yeah. We're cute. Kids cuss. You look cute in 300,

296
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.460
500 years. Yeah. Look. Um, so Michael Angelo,

297
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.430
in closing in Nicole, he was a kid who loved to paint and spin the wheel.

298
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.040
He liked to spin the wheel. He was a gay kid. He was a gay kid today.

299
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.310
He'd be the most featured guests on Ellen. Yeah. I mean, look,

300
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.820
you got to just allow gay people to be gay people. They're just,

301
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.850
everyone's doing their own thing. And it's just like, mind your own mind.

302
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.660
Don't business. Let these people have fun.

303
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:42.560
Let these people live their life and do the right thing. You know, let them,

304
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:46.020
whatever they be happy. They're great parents. They're great artists.

305
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.410
And even if they're not into any of that, they're just great people.

306
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:50.420
Let them do what they want to do behind closed doors.

307
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.210
They're not getting into heaven. So either way, either way. Yeah.

308
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.620
Where's your machine, please. Zach, are you listening to our podcast?

309
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.360
He said believes it. Yeah. Kidding. Christ. Seriously. Shout out all my,

310
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.160
all my gay friends, you know,

311
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.710
only ones I can think of off the top of my head and tail lane, Tim Dylan,

312
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.810
Mike mush. And, uh,

313
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.310
so the thing about Michelangelo is his lover was so much younger than him.

314
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:16.940
This guy, he was this nobleman, uh, and that's all he had.

315
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:20.060
There's there's there's no, everything else is sort of a mystery.

316
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:24.110
There's no kind of recorded history on who exactly he was banging out,

317
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.300
but he definitely based on his writings,

318
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.120
which is all we know his letters to this kid.

319
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.540
He was obsessed with this young kid. Must've been a piece.

320
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:36.470
The kid must have been a piece on a nice little piece. And, uh, and yeah, man.

321
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:39.800
So support the gays. Happy pride. That was Michelangelo. Thank you guys.
