00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>They get workman's comp wasn't me. That was patching.</v>

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.120
[inaudible] Patrick,

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.920
Patrick Mo Rooney and Sean Terry they're a, well, we met,

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.010
they're just they're New York firefighters firefighters. You know,

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.700
they may or may not be based off guys that from my hometown, right.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.850
Basically what happens is, is, is, is when you go deep into Brooklyn,

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.330
when you meet a guy like Patrick Mulrooney and Sean, Terry, what? Just,

8
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.610
things are a little bit more clear. It's an easier life.

9
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.250
And what I mean by that is when you go in there, first of all, it's,

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.970
it's very Republican and you just understand things like you understand the lies

11
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.010
from the media. You understand that? Yes, of course.

12
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:38.790
Climate change was from the Chinese 100%. It's like,

13
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
tell me it's 80 degrees out. Why is it cold today? Why is it,

14
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.240
why did I call today?

15
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.090
And I'll tell you why it's because the Chinese makes it hard and the Jews

16
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:48.924
control it.

17
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.570
it's just going to bury me this thing I heard of the Jews control it.

18
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.690
We're fine. We can edit it out. Did we come out too hard?

19
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.300
I think he came out swinging too much. Yeah. Okay. All right.

20
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.060
Let's show me on the back. Yeah. Let's scale it back. Um,

21
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.010
how did you get into comedy? Should we just do the whole,

22
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.980
should we do scoot a hole, a pocket issue on Terry and Patty Murray.

23
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.470
We can't do it. Let's just go like that show. Where are you from?

24
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.790
Are you from Los Angeles? How many? There's a, that's a real town. Sure. Yeah.

25
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.180
The whole place is on fire. Cause Jesus don't like that place. Yeah,

26
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.750
because yeah. Yeah, you vote to the left. Your place goes on fire.

27
00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.740
And that's what God says. That's what it is. Well, who's Sean. Who's Patrick.

28
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:31.880
That's the problem, Patrick Melrose obviously. Now switch now.

29
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.030
Let's see what it sounds like when you I'm sure Terry. Hi, I'm Patrick.

30
00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:38.900
Mulrooney I'm in the closet. [inaudible] yeah, no.

31
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.090
I'm it's way to impress my friends, but deep down,

32
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.180
how many of those tough guys are actually gay, but won't come out. Uh,

33
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:46.610
most of them, right? Yeah. I mean, I got a friend who's like,

34
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.730
he's a classic firefighter. I mean, he comes with me on trips.

35
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:52.640
He'll ask me three weeks before what he's supposed to wear. What should I wear?

36
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.030
Send me pictures of his jeans and his shoes does this match. I'm like guy,

37
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:57.170
if your friends ever knew,

38
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.270
if your firefighters ever knew that you were sending me these pictures,

39
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.333
maybe they're all wouldn't want to be.

40
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.470
They wouldn't want you to be behind them in a fire. You know what I mean?

41
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:05.060
Get the hose. But they're all doing that.

42
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.480
They're in that house alone all the time. Think about that. What are they doing?

43
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.780
Watching TV the whole time. Yeah. It's like, what are you? My girlfriend?

44
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.150
You don't think they kiss each other at night a little bit before they go have a

45
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:18.080
good firefight before they get on the truck. You have a good firefighter. Yeah,

46
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.620
because it is often like that, but it's a soft tap could live in the firefight.

47
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.670
So it's not gainless you've got a perfectly manicured beard. Why, why?

48
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.130
I want to feel it from the inside. It's nothing wrong with that.

49
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.960
Nothing wrong with that. What do you mean you,

50
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.870
you guys are both perfectly manicured manners. No, no, no.

51
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.580
That's like a nice beer dude while I'm trying, you know,

52
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.720
I knew Gingy when he came to New York, I have to do this kind of, yeah.

53
00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:40.780
I have to look like this. You know where he's from? Chicago, Chicago,

54
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.980
Chicago, Illinois. It's the same kind of guy.

55
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.140
We got those guys in Chicago as well. But their Mo you know,

56
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:51.320
their whole thing is all about homos. They don't like homos. Yeah. I don't know.

57
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.910
Moses. They call them Mose. They're just not my kind of guys. Oh, I bet.

58
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:59.410
They're nice guys. I don't want them anywhere near me. You know, I, they're not,

59
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.440
