00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>Um, how about this? This is interesting fighting news,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.610
but it's it's it's this news just broke and, uh,

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:07.740
it's good that we got Sergio Chacone, uh,

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.870
ex X-Box yo Jake Paul is going to fight Connor McGregor.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.160
Is that that's that that can be signed, sealed. They're ready to go yet.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.570
Pimpy says yes.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.150
He's in talks with them. I don't know if that's, you know what,

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.610
that probably will go down. One thing that people have to realize now,

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
if you're like a boxing purists or martial art purist, listen,

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
this is the future of fighting right now. It's going to definitely,

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.650
uh, have its own lane and continue to go on this way.

12
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:47.130
There's too much money involved and there's too many people tuning in.

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.110
So I wouldn't be surprised if that fight goes on and you know what it be as

14
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:55.050
attending as hell. These guys are both show men. Uh,

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.190
and it'd be fun to watch just as we've witnessed this past weekend.

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
I personally didn't like to see Nate Robinson gets stretched out like that.

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.190
I felt bad for him. He signed the paper. He knew what he was in for,

18
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.620
or maybe he didn't know where he was at four. Do you think,

19
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.870
do you think with all your boxing experience,

20
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:17.130
you could win in a fight against Nate Robinson, Nate Robinson, aquaponic Wolf,

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.570
Jake, Paul, Paul Young man. And he's like,

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.010
he's fell. He fell in love with the sport. Yeah. And he's only 23 years old yet.

23
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:30.000
Like he can actually be a for real boxer. Yeah. I mean, you know, listen,

24
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.500
I could, I could apply. I could probably, uh, do my thing for, you know,

25
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.100
a few rounds, but his conditioning man, he's 21 years old. He might,

26
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.790
he might now let me, let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. Obviously,

27
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.020
you know, boxing inside and out.

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.070
If Jake Paul was to fight an actual professional boxer,

29
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.950
would he get like his head like ripped off?

30
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.300
Like I think, I think he, uh,

31
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.980
would lose against most pro boxers.

32
00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.670
Uh,

33
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.650
but any athletes such as Nate Robinson or any other youth?

34
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.840
Super. I think he got smashed something about his balance and his, uh,

35
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.810
his athleticism. It's very surprising to me.

36
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:16.290
He's a big guy who started boxing just two years ago. It's pretty impressive.

37
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.700
The way he moves. So you think,

38
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:22.680
you think he could actually beat some professional boxes right now? You know,

39
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.030
it depends what level of, you know,

40
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.730
anyone can be a professional boxer for people don't know that. Like,

41
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.550
why don't you put your money up, then son do it for your family.

42
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.370
You're breaking up. I can't hear you. I said, put your money up.

43
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:35.750
Why don't you do it for your family? You know,

44
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:38.550
you're the only dude I've ever met in my life that the Santa hat is tight on his

45
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:42.060
head. Yo Matt point, the KKK in the hat like that,

46
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.510
somebody in the chat said, Sergeant likes the most dirt bag ELLs.

47
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.590
I got cocaine right here and less than the rim.
