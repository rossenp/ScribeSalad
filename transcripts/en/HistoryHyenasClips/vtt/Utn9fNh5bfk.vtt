1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>They just know how much it enhances after you nap. Right?</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.610
How much more you can retain it all comes down to who is funding the research,

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.170
so, Oh, sure. Right. All the sugar industry was saying, it's not that bad.

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:15.570
And it's like, if the pillow industry is telling you take naps,

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.540
unless it's my pillow, which I'll buy it. Cause it's America.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.440
It's like sleeping on a big pillow. Yeah.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.940
You think the pillow industry is rarely campaign.

8
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:28.520
Like we gotta sell it more pillows. What's going on. Those artist, Bob.

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.030
Hey, we got to get some pro pillow studies out there. I'm like

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.830
speaking of marketing though, you mentioned that, that MyPillow,

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.450
did we mention this? The, my pillow that, you know, I even know the name,

12
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.060
my pillow. Have you ever put your head on my pillow? No.

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.400
It's like a cinderblock. It's like it's, it's so uncomfortable.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.600
It's it's hilarious. But you know, it's like that. I'm an American guy.

15
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.350
We made them hear this episode of history. Hyena is brought to you by my pillow.

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.000
Hello? Yeah. We have our worst thing. You gotta try it.

17
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.700
It's the sponsor of today's episode.

18
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.130
It's actually like the example for why everything went overseas.

19
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.010
When you buy it, you're going, like, I get it. Same thing with Casper mattress.

20
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.830
Everyone buys a Casper. It's like, those are good. Oh, are they? Oh yeah,

21
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.850
because then they also might sponsor.

22
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.120
Can I just say that guy looks like he's never held anything in his life?

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.820
Like it's the most awkward, like mannequin hands. Like this is comfort and the,

24
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:26.360
your hand it's very tasty. When you lie on it.

25
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.250
Good for you. My pillow can be yours as well.

26
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.940
My pillow is good for a while. Good for life. My pillow.

27
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.550
He looks like he he's an American kid. Oh yeah. You've never seen him.

28
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.160
Have you seen those infomercials? No. You've never seen them. [inaudible]

29
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.160
LA it's probably different infomercials. I mean now my pillows everywhere, man.

30
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.290
Yeah. It's like hipster commercials. Hey, uh, do you have a pillow of the past?

31
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.480
Check on my pillow. No, my pillows are everywhere, man. Yeah.

32
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.120
Let him see it. Fox.

33
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.370
You're saying that was my pillows. I love the sky. How much fill in there?

34
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.420
Keep your neck always just the definition of a guy. Just pause it for a second.

35
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:18.140
Yeah. I guarantee you that this guy doesn't make those pillows.

36
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.420
I guarantee you some huge company. That's like,

37
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:24.950
let's find the most normal American guy who you would meet at like a bar in the

38
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:28.850
middle of Wisconsin and just Rooney pillows. I mean, he's just like,

39
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.610
he doesn't even know what he's talking about. He's like,

40
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.410
do you have problems with your vertebrae? Okay. Then, uh, then slap, uh,

41
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.790
this three times lie on it on a Tuesday and you'll figure it out by Friday.

42
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.123
Yeah.

43
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.840
He also sort of shop the shop from where I want to shop.

44
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.250
They're all shopping. So all we need to get us the right, the right size.

45
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.510
Every pillow has a color quarter tag Greenland, Jean corded.

46
00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:05.230
By the way, he sounds Amies hammer colors. Four pillars. So.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.350
<v 1>It's also for stomach sleeping. True. That's true.</v>

50
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.120
<v 0>And it's white, white women.</v>

51
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.850

Yeah. That's perfect. Yellow like that child. Stomach sleeper. Yeah.

54
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.760
That's the last thing he wants your child chokes on its vomit.

55
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.240
<v 1>Uh, uh, every, every woman, no matter what.</v>

56
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.160
<v 0>Huh? I've never seen this as popular as like the sham one.</v>

57
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.960
How can you guys not see the MyPillow?

58
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.540
I haven't seen it cause they're not watching. Cause they're watching.

59
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.320
Like they're not watching TV at night. Like when they're drunk eat at like,

60
00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:54.300
we watch TV is hard to avoid for a little while. It was every channel.

61
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.330
<v 1>It's everywhere. It's also for a smaller man. I would say.</v>

62
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.140
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, he's making it up as he's going along.</v>

63
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.140
This one's a dwarf pillow over here.

64
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.413
<v 1>Smaller guys.</v>

65
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.690
<v 0>This one is for your crotch over here.</v>

66
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:16.710
When you're alone in the middle of the night and you don't have another woman in

67
00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:19.110
your bed, you put it between your legs and here we go.

68
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.100
And there's an extra pillow over here. There's one over here is when you're a,

69
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:25.080
you don't have that much money and you're splitting a hotel room.

70
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.060
What your buddy? But you don't want to feel like a homosexual.

71
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:31.380
She put this one between the other guy. It's a good wall. It's a straight wall.

72
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.330
He's just making it up as this talk.

73
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.000
And now I think he dropped out of a heart attack right now. He's still alive.

74
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.183
Oh, Billy Mays. Okay.

75
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.130
<v 1>Yeah. It's almost all guys up to us. Maybe six.</v>

76
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.560
<v 0>Pillows for almost all guys.</v>

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.160
<v 1>Almost all the way up to an XL shooters.</v>

78
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.230
And it's also for larger women.

79
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.320
<v 0>Can you pause it for a second? Scott Jesus on his chest.</v>

80
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.820
Have you ever walked into a hotel and seen a pillow and been like that?

81
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.800
One's not my size. Never extra large guys. Never. Yeah.

82
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.710
That one. Yeah. That pillow over there. That's so I could call front desk, like,

83
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:08.370
I'm sorry. You don't have the right size pillow for me. I'm a medium sized guy.

84
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:11.010
You got extra large guys. Every guy,

85
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.320
when they go to a hotel it's near this need to call down and go.

86
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:16.110
You gave me lady, bill, you gave me a lady pillow. I mean,

00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:20.270
this guy couldn't be more full of, but he's is that a little Jesus Christ Jesus.

88
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.690
This is straight out of central casting. Now here's the thing about this pillow.

89
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.140
You will fall asleep for three days and rise. Three days later,

90
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.520
you'll get the best sleep of your life. We call this one, the Jesus,

91

I made this.

93
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.720
<v 1>That's just sleeps on her side.</v>

94
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:42.120
That is broader shoulders because you need more height for your size,

95
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.430
your back for your stomach.

96
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.160
<v 0>Willdabeast of a woman and you weigh 400 pounds.</v>

97
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.890
This pillows for you and all your back issues. Now, if you want to kill someone,

98
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.590
this one's really going to hold over. Someone's failing to kill.

99
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.813
Yonis was father.

100
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.660
<v 1>The, uh, the blue level is for one person. And that's the guy,</v>

101
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.040
a guy that with over six foot one, a guy that's real broad stocking shoulders.

102
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.720
<v 0>Cakes. Wait a minute. This is not for you.</v>

103
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.600
I'm trying to remember how we went from Edison. Yeah.

104
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.850
Very true inventions.

105
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.190
<v 1>Please do not buy this one because it's not going to go flat.</v>

106
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.370
So none of my pillows do, they're going to stay. What you get is what it is.

107
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.730
Yeah.

108
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.000
So don't buy up thinking it's going to be like a conventional pillow that goes

109
00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:39.640
flat. It's going to be the same on day one. As it is on yours,

110
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.653
you are so full of.

111
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.070
<v 0>All pillows go down when you put your head on up. Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.580
<v 1>And that red pillow is for one person and one person only me.</v>

113
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.970
It's it's a guy that is a huge shoulders.

114
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.810
Only sleeps on his side. He's the height. Oh, that's what it is.

115
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.600
His size sleeping to take the pressure off. Yeah.

116
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.350
<v 0>Yeah. Imagine your boy.</v>

117
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.140
And this is your life to be this guy. Oh my God.

118
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.750
Imagine like you look back at your life. You already death pick. I was like,

119
00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:11.840
I was, I that's what I got, I was about pillows was the, my guy.

120
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.640
I was the MyPillow guy, but a bear me with my pillow. Wow.

121
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.630
<v 1>There it is. Who you are. So this pill is only for one person. That's a large.</v>

122
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.280
<v 0>I couldn't find headphones. So I'm kind of just out. Sorry. I've been looking.</v>

123
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.930
<v 1>Another thing too with this all go with these colors.</v>

124
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.640
All go for the same for last size pillows. Yeah. That works exactly the same.

125
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.320
You've got your finished sloppy in your yellow, white, green, blue,

126
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.540
and then the red and I can't.

127
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.040
<v 0>He paused for a second. He's got four pillows on that table.</v>

128
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.210
I cannot tell the difference between any of those pillows. No, like this.

129
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.110
If I went to his demonstration, I would be like, dude, I don't see a difference.

130
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:53.500
They all are the same pillow he could have. Those could be for the same pillows.

131
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.350
And he's saying, Oh, this one's woman pillow. This one's a man.

132
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.010
Love them up and down on the table. Yeah. He all four of them. Yeah.

133
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.620
<v 1>I am thinking they're going to grow flat at night.</v>

134
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.310
This is what my pillow is all about. It's going to stay where you put it in.

135
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:10.150
It's going to hold. They're like actively having a stroke. So important.

136
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.270
There's commercials to what I just said on the video here. Uh,

137
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:16.030
we do have the 69 60 day money-back guarantee,

138
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.780
but you're not going to want to re ever return this pillow. If you get fitted,

139
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:22.840
right. Obviously if you bought this blue pillow,

140
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.150
that's why I returned at venture neck or the outweigh.

141
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.450
You're not going to like it this way. Fitting is so important.

142
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.320
And if you follow what I just told you, it's going to be an amazing sleep.

143
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.320
<v 0>So you got to watch that drunk instructional video to make sure you get your</v>

144
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:38.530
pillow. Right? We'll get that. Yeah. I mean, look,

145
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.410
Nate park artsy did a MyPillow reveal. Third one down.
