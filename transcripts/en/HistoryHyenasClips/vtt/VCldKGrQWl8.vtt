00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>Philadelphia is a strange city. That's a strange city. Ah, their, um,</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.620
their like famous snack or meal, right.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a Philly cheese steak, right? That's not cheese. That's liquid,

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.720
powdered sugar. Yeah. With the yellow food coloring. Yeah.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.700
That's not steak. Now. That is, I don't know what that is. Steak.

6
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.270
Those are from me and Chad. Yeah.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.980
It's basically fake steak and fake cheese on a hero bread. Yeah.

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.810
Okay. And then as their statue, they have Rocky. That's a fake boxer.

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.520
Yeah. And then they got a mayor that says the word Negro this way,

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.990
cue it up. Mike Marsh.

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.270
<v 1>I found out as the police chief, that the black in any area in,</v>

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580
particularly in Philadelphia, wants to know more than I want.

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.860
He wants to be secure in his home.

14
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:54.620
He wants to be able to walk the streets and safety.

15
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.980
He wants to be able to have his children educated without them being shot or

16
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:59.090
stabbed in school.

17
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.350
And I thought that the black community was against me.

18
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:07.790
I would have not run from there. Of course. Uh, uh,

19
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.540
about 600,000 Negroes live on [inaudible].

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.740
<v 0>[Inaudible] right there. Negroes.</v>

21
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.900
I've never heard Negro pronounced that way.

22
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.680
I've never heard Negro with an N because that was the mayor of Philadelphia.

23
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:29.270
He pronounced it Negroes. He was literally,

24
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.250
he stopped himself mid word because he was a millisecond away from

25
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.320
letting one fly. Yeah. Cause I mean, Philadelphia is a wild town.

26
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.030
I mean, because he's being interviewed on public television,

27
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:48.740
he almost said the N word. Yeah. I mean, he kinda S it was, you know, that,

28
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.950
you know, that meme where that baby runs into the room and then goes woo.

29
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.780
And runs back. He kind of started the word and went, Ooh, get it that way.

30
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.310
Holy. ISIS. Have you ever heard it pronounced nig? Rose?

31
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.150
Can we play it one more time? Let's just hear it one more time.

32
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.740
There was no camera tricks. That, that was him. That was 600,000.

33
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.573
<v 1>Negroes living.</v>

34
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.070
<v 0>I mean, Frankie. Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.290
What do you think his PR team did when they,

36
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.090
he said he thinks one of them passed out.

37
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.310
He obviously did not have a PR team for care or his PR rep you

38
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.630
know, whose PR rep was cool.

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.980
His PR rep was a guy named Vinny from the neighborhood. He said, listen,

40
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:33.290
when you make what you talk about the blacks, make sure,

41
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.270
make sure you say the word and you say it this way. Yeah. His,

42
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:39.620
his PR guy was a guy named Paulie, publicity

43
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.680
bullied for busy from South Philly,

44
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.870
Pauline published in a year from South Philly.

45
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.690
And now you just go up there and you know, just don't say the N word,

46
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:55.370
but you could come close Elisha. He goes,

47
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.970
listen, just don't say it full. But you know, let the people know who you,

48
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.130
where are you from? His wife is going

49
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.370
to make you a couple of state comes when you came here. You came here

50
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.610
because let's be crystal clear about something

51
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.180
their 30 year ma Mrs. Rizzo,

52
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.860
unfortunately disciplined the few times she had a few black eyes for the

53
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.310
pictures. There was just a time or two.

54
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.740
There was just a time or two where Mr. And Mrs. Rachel showed up to an event.

55
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.050
And unfortunately Mrs. Michelle had to bring her friend Lucile to do her makeup

56
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.660
pitch just because she had a black attitude. Cause she was disciplined.

57
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.880
It's just what it is.

58
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.840
That's what happens if you put a little too much garlic in the sauce for Frank

59
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.200
risk.
