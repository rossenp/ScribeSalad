00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>So Joe Rogan, uh, um, uh, uh, the Joe Rogan show was canceled.</v>

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:06.210
All shows canceled this week.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.820
You were supposed to have Kanye West on because Joe Rogan's producer,

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.750
Jamie got COVID hope you're doing well. Uh, Jamie.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.190
Probably at a Tim Dillon show. Probably at a Tim Dillon show,

6
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.400
but here's the ready for little conspiracy cuties meets weapon in the morning.

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.450
I don't believe for a second that Jamie even got COVID okay.

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.240
He could've maybe gotten COVID because look, he's got a lot of money now.

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.160
They're in Texas. He was probably a nerdy kid growing up.

10
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.150
He doesn't know how to deal with women,

11
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.060
so he might be out trying to get pushed just because, you know,

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.721
it's just all new.

13
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.720
And I understand that it's the same reason why Louie jerked off in a plant.

14
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.270
It's just, you know, when you don't grow up as a teenager,

15
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.270
no one had to talk to girls and all of a sudden they come at ya. It's tough.

16
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.790
So that could be one explanation. But the second thing,

17
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.840
which I think is a more true thing,

18
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.360
I don't think Jamie has COVID I don't think anybody has called,

19
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.600
but I think Spotify put pressure on Rogan to make something up,

20
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.960
to cancel all the shows because they know if they interviewed Kanye on Friday

21
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:55.380
and they give a good interview, that's going to sway boats away from Biden.

22
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.830
Of course it will because Biden, nobody wants to vote for that guy. So,

23
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.200
so it's going to sway votes and they'll go to Connie,

24
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.970
which would of course put Trump in the presidency.

25
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:07.620
So I think the conspiracy here is that Spotify and all those places put

26
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:09.720
pressure on Rogan and it's election meddling.

27
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:13.560
And they do not want Rogan because Rogan could very easily just get another

28
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:17.190
producer for a week or zoom, uh, Kanye, Western,

29
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.000
and get the thing up on Friday to cancel them all. It's got Democrat,

30
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.020
written all over it to me. And it's simply because they know, for fact,

31
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.260
a lot of people are scared because a lot of people went Epstein's Island.

32
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.800
A lot of people on that travel log, jump onto pedophile do what's right?

33
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.634
No bumper.

34
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.470
Wow.

35
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.140
That's my Freddy's Abe is Patty Bo roadie by Dave short diary.

36
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.820
We're a couple of firefighters who read the New York post and died.

37
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.990
It is what it is. Yeah. It's a little thing called Lauder faulted.

38
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.570
It's what it is. Cause now what do you think of that?

39
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:56.250
Is that a little on the notes?

40
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.420
I think that's what you call a little of the nose. I mean, you nailed it.

41
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:02.250
My mind was blown the whole time,

42
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.600
because the thing about me and you is we're figuring out everything. Yeah.

43
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.770
It's just what it is. Unfortunately, we're figuring it out. I mean,

44
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.660
what can you do homeless pick.

45
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.180
You're going to have to click that and we're going to post it.
