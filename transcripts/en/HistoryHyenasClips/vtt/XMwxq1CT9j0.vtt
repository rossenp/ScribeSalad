00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.580
<v 0>[Inaudible] appetite. He had appetite like Chris.</v>

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.850
<v 1>Just let me interject. What stopped in September 16,</v>

3
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:16.670
20 small ship called the Mayflower left Plymouth,

4
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:21.200
England carrying 102 passengers at an assortment of religious separatists,

5
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:24.410
seeking a new home from where they could freely practice their faith in other

6
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.090
individuals, Lord, by promise of prosperity and land ownership in the new world.

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.500
Let me, let me just.

8
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 2>Add that, that, and it was a bad thing. Um, we wish.</v>

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.420
<v 1>It didn't happen back then. It was an infringement.</v>

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.220
<v 2>Encroachment on cultures and we're putting we're retroactively putting those</v>

11
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.054
ships.

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.270
<v 1>On. Yeah. I noticed the hole that hole. I know.</v>

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.930
<v 2>That section from your history book, remove it.</v>

14
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.330
<v 3>I know this. I love the unnoticed is the greatest thing. Let me just say,</v>

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.840
when people talk about Thanksgiving,

16
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.940
it was like the way Americans have been taught that Thanksgiving,

17
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:06.860
that this just like these manifests that it's like my in my day they would

18
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:09.110
teach us no, it was evil.

19
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.230
The Puritans people acting like they teach you in school,

20
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.660
anything but negative stuff since 1965, they don't

21
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.360
take this imaginary world of the fifties has existed this whole time.

22
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.820
It has not in a few select school districts.

23
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.320
<v 2>What you're basically saying is the Russians infiltrated our school system even</v>

24
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:27.710
earlier.

25
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.660
<v 3>Than we thought, duh. Exactly. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.720
<v 2>They were teaching the anti-American propaganda way back. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.970
<v 1>It's like, I love how people are this Thanksgiving. All right.</v>

28
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.910
White people and Columbus, all that.

29
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:41.870
It's like the disease smallpox killed more people than anybody. Small,

30
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:43.850
positive white people was smallpox.

31
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.310
It was another thing the Chinese created in their lab.

32
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.230
In reality,

33
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.550
the people who are the most woke and mad are such few numbers.

34
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.800
They just have the loudest voices. But they really,

35
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.000
if you just don't do what they say and you just keep going, nothing changes,

36
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.400
nothing changes because they're small. It's a small.

37
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.880
<v 2>Group. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think actually people are realizing it and like,</v>

38
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.110
it's like, it's people are gone. Like nobody cares. Nobody cares.

39
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.660
But you know what I got from reading your book really? Like,

40
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:17.680
it's a funny book obviously. Cause you wrote it. But what it.

41
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.360
<v 1>Made me realize we really are not the United.</v>

42
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.300
<v 2>People of America. We are the United States of America.</v>

43
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.580
Every state is kind of like its own thing.

44
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.440
But I didn't know that about Delaware, that it was so shady that corporations,

45
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.190
she gets, everyone sets up their corporation.

46
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.310
<v 1>Because there's no tax. Oh, I lo and behold where's our president from,</v>

47
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.340
I know Hillary lock a rock, but it is.

48
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.490
<v 3>True. When you think about Delaware that he is from like Delaware,</v>

49
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.970
that's just an agreement everybody's made that somebody's going to be their

50
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:49.670
corrupt state and they're like, we'll do it. you. Yeah.

51
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.320
It's like this hypocritical thing. And I met Chris Walken and I go, my family,

52
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:58.670
I know, you know, you probably heard this, but I was in LA in 1989. And I go,

53
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.510
I just want to tell you, you know, my family, you know, they,

54
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.900
we should go to your bakery. It's the best bakery. And he goes, yeah, I go,

55
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.660
your family's bakery is legendary. He goes, that was a long time ago.

56
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.890
So which state do you think.

57
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.430
<v 2>From the book encapsulates America the most,</v>

58
00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:19.920
you mentioned Florida as a contender.

59
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.500
<v 3>Yeah. I mean, Florida's our, you know, our shadow self, you know, I would say,</v>

60
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.491
you know,

61
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:31.200
I mean Pennsylvania because it's got the Philly type cities and the

62
00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:34.950
Pittsburgh type cities. So it's east coast and mid. Yeah.

63
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.360
And it's got like the urban it's like, it's like Trump.

64
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:42.960
And you know, I would say by, you know what I mean? It's just,

65
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.520
it's a compilation of everything,

66
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.930
basketball and football and all those little side cities, you know what I mean?

67
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:52.410
Everything like Scranton and then Eastern, like it's all the,

68
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.100
it's all the success at barely of America. And it also made.

69
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.010
<v 2>The history. They still got Amish and Mennonites in there.</v>

70
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.260
<v 3>Original settlers, still a constant juncture in there. Philadelphia,</v>

71
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.600
Pennsylvania should be a lot more interesting than, yeah.

72
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.220
Do you think of the founding fathers.

73
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.040
<v 2>Yet came back and saw Philadelphia? They would go, we shouldn't have done this.</v>

74
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.620
Jesus Christ. What happened here was Washington gets a battery to the wakeup.

75
00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:18.780
Yes. Take them straight to an Eagles game and see, look,

76
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.880
look at what freedom gave

77
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.800
CRO or anti the electoral college. What's your opinion. Should we lose.

78
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.370
<v 1>It, scrap it or should we continue to let Republicans win election? But.</v>

79
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.690
<v 3>People talk about the electoral college. I mean, you know, first of all,</v>

80
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.900
is that like all the volts go, it's not like, you know,

81
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.740
Montana has the same amount of electoral votes. It's New York.

82
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.560
They're acting like this. I mean, it really wasn't a bit, by the way,

83
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.550
Connecticut is responsible for that. Anyway, I didn't take the fall, but I mean,

84
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.400
people liked it like that happened. Like as if they get the same,

85
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.920
that proportionally is probably pretty close.

86
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.140
So I don't know what the big conflict is with that because all ultimately it's

87
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.930
the representative democracy is a Republic, right? So it was not,

88
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.930
it was totally, if you want a total, I always say,

89
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.710
if you want a full democracy wheel, pure democracy is mob rule. That's what.

90
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.850
<v 2>It is. And that's why they made it a Republic. Cause they were scared of them.</v>

91
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.140
Yeah. And.

92
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.980
<v 3>If you really wanted, if you didn't have, uh,</v>

93
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.420
if you just lifted a popular vote, slavery would probably never have gotten it.

94
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.740
Wouldn't have got rid of slavery in 1865,

95
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.790
but these are the kinds of things that go on. I stole it from a friend of mine,

96
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:30.020
but he's not a comedian. So that's about it. No.

97
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.930
<v 1>You don't, you don't have to credit them if it's that community. Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.680
<v 3>But I mean, but it's all, these are all good points. Like, so it's like,</v>

99
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:39.930
there was a reason representative democracy exists,

100
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.750
even though it turns out to be distorted, like everything else, but it comes to.

101
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
<v 1>The story. Right, right. Who's the person you always wanted to the most,</v>

102
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.140
the person, the person you disagree with. Yeah.

103
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.410
I mean the best hand you I've ever got was a girl went to St. Savior's.

104
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.710
It was in prospect park on a rock and we had different philosophies and

105
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.920
religions that I enjoyed every of it. Yeah.

106
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 3>Full disclosure. My sister went to say savior.</v>

107
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.933
<v 0>She's older.</v>

108
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.170
[inaudible].
