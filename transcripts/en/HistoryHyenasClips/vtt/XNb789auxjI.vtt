You and live all your podcasts. I don't know if you guys saw it, but there was,

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.610
I finally saw a, that show. Saturday night live, finally getting good.

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.010
They finally hired a kid who knows what he's talking about. Shane Gillis.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.640
That's a funny kid right there. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.540
I'm going to watch the show it because the kid shake Gill is a funny kid.

7
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.410
He know he's saying things that people really need to. Yeah. I beat a kid,

8
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.000
obviously works over at the firehouse.

9
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.820
Shane killers is going to see a firefight and get some skit work. Yeah.

10
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.370
It gets picked and some skip work I did. And then it's nice.

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.310
It's nice to see the kids coming out of the woodwork. Um, you know,

12
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.880
supporting him who just, you know, who want their names to go viral in articles?

13
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.810
Shout out Louis Gomez.

14
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.430
<v 1>Yeah. Um, right now we're, uh,</v>

15
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.490
we want to say hello to all the hyena fans who have been listening and who have

16
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:45.290
been making more hyenas, spreading the word.

17
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.310
We also want to say hello to whatever internet blogger may be tuning in right

18
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:53.300
now after me and Chrissy got hired for something. Yes. Hi. How are you?

19
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.600
How's your day. We know you're sitting there in your little apartment. Okay.

20
00:00:56.601 --> 00:01:00.800
You got three roommates right now and you're definitely eating Sabra hummus with

21
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.390
carrots as you're perusing these, um, podcasts for slurs.

22
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.410
Now.

23
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.380
<v 0>Save you a little time. You're not going to have to search too far.</v>

24
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.160
Just keep listening to this podcast because they are a come man. Yeah,

25
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.630
they're coming. And it's just, it doesn't change. I think it's inevitable. It's,

26
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.320
it's just, what's going to happen. Okay. So yeah. Listen,

27
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.980
here's the truth to the situation. Okay. I,

28
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.420
if you guys don't know Shane Gillis, friend of the show, great comedian,

29
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.320
happy to see him get SNL. Thank, uh, you know, he's a really funny kid.

30
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.450
He said some, uh,

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.280
slurs about Asians on a podcast two years ago. Some FF, Seth Simon,

32
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:42.620
I believe his name was, there was a few of them. Yeah. These kids,

33
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.410
they dug through the, the, they dug through the trash to find the stuff.

34
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.080
It's whatever. Yeah. You can't say those words,

35
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.230
but it's also like it's a podcast. He's a comedian, whatever, whatever.

36
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.210
I don't think for a second, not for a second.

37
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.660
That Lorne Michaels and the people in SNL did not know that that was already out

38
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.660
hired the other first Asian higher bone yang also congrats him.

39
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.480
I've never met him, but heard good things about the kid who congrats to him,

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.230
that they didn't all know that this was going to happen and create a controversy

41
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.700
and a stir to get eyes and ears and get people writing about the upcoming season

42
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.610
of SNL. I think that the machine of SNL,

43
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.950
they know how to any press is good press.

44
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.160
So you can't convince me that they didn't already know this was out. Yeah.

45
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.650
Lauren's a screwed in kid. He's going to get in this kid who we hired,

46
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:27.650
Seth Simon. He probably hired this kid. And he's just an FF.

47
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:29.030
That's yelling about. But it's like,

48
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.460
he's probably getting money from the SNL machine.

49
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.860
<v 1>Melissa [inaudible] she also got in trouble for.</v>

50
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.420
<v 0>Villas and Yardi. What did she say? She said something.</v>

51
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.550
And she got in trouble when she got out. She's a Latino woman.

52
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.850
She's a Latina woman. It's like, yeah. What was it? Mike sensitive tweets.

53
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.320
<v 1>Like racial jokes and tweets. Yeah, nothing. Trevor Noah had a few as well.</v>

54
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:49.850
He's a black kid from South Africa.

55
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.770
<v 0>Yeah. It's just, nobody cares. The bottom line is nobody. It's all.</v>

56
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.910
It's all part of the story. Genuinely. Nobody cares.

57
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:57.890
Nothing's going to happen to Shane. He's not going to get booed.

58
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:01.450
He's very funny. So I would expect him to do exceptionally well on the show.

59
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.120
But the bottom line is, is the truth is nobody cares.

60
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.730
I was at the wicked monk yesterday in Bay Ridge talking to some,

61
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.040
I was talking to some girls some, and you're also.

62
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.230
<v 1>Wicked. Monk is a place where a lot of scholars.</v>

63
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.720
<v 0>Frequent. I mean, it's like a real Harvard bar. It's a Harvard bar.</v>

64
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.120
And I was talking to a couple of girls and they started talking about the Louis

65
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.980
CK thing. And their consensus opinion was if,

66
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.450
if a guy's jerking off on the phone, you hang up.

67
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.890
And if a guy's jerking off in front of you and you,

68
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.910
and he's not blocking the door,

69
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.180
then you roll out a window and you throw them out a window and you just leave.

70
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.370
Because most of it's all, it's all.

71
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.770
We're living in such as soon as all this stuff came out with Shane and this,

72
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.940
I was like, you know,

73
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.780
you guys are getting involved outside and started staring down Chinese because

74
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:45.220
it's like, Oh, tweet, thank you, Zach. Yeah. Tweet a few support shamans. Like,

75
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:48.940
yeah, I do support Shane. The Twitter. It's all. If you tweet something out,

76
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.330
it's all. It's like, you're just feeding this thing. That's not real. Yeah.

77
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.660
<v 1>They also took it out of context.</v>

78
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.860
And also it's obviously not really about the morality, because if it was,

79
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.220
and they would have had this story come out before he got hired for Chanel.

80
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:06.870
Like if you're a pro, first of all, if you're a professional, if you,

81
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:10.860
if you cover comedy professionally, you're, you're basically,

82
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:12.990
that's the open mic scene for journalists.

83
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.970
<v 0>Yeah. You're a loser. You're an open mic.</v>

84
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.140
<v 1>Journalist. Okay. Um, but if you're covering comedy,</v>

85
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.700
aren't you supposed to be doing field research?

86
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.730
Aren't you supposed to be writing these articles before? There's a big hire.

87
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.900
Why did you wait for him to get hired at SNL in order for this to come out?

88
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.660
And another thing is, listen, listen,

89
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:34.350
jokes exist in context, right? Okay.

90
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.320
Imagine context, good or bad jokes.

91
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.650
<v 0>By the way, Mike's wiping off the laptop screen.</v>

92
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:43.980
So you know what happened on that laptop screen early this morning,

93
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:45.630
late last night, when a kid has to wipe it off,

94
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.790
he shot some of his glue on from there.

95
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.770
And the kid was gluing on the laptop screen. What it is, what it is. Yeah.

96
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.540
He got some Slack, whatever you say,

97
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.900
is that what you call your toothpaste these days? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

98
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.310
Cause your Turkey would have Slurpee.

99
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.920
Turkey would have Slurpee. Turkey would have slept together for my fitness fans.

100
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.220
It's do some burpees getting sloppy or your burpee would have slept.

101
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.370
We would love to have some of our plus size fans send us turkeys would have

102
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.210
slurp. It just dude Turkey would have slept. Show us your fat gobbled.

103
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:22.950
Chin would have slept. Chris. We're just New York kids were just funny.

104
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.880
We're just funny, screwed in kids. And I got to pee again. I haven't STD. Yeah.

105
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.960
And I did the impossible burger. Yannis may go D cut. I may go down.

106
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.640
I'm a little lightheaded, made an Apple.

107
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.350
You may have to move your seat behind Yani.

108
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.650
You may have to lay down and be the nets because I know you had a few of those

109
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:42.000
cupcakes at Sergio's birthday party. It's what it is, what it is. And I like to,

110
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.540
the vacate was a snowballs and ring bakes. Yeah. It wasn't truly,

111
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.840
that's hilarious. Did he do any cocaine in his own bathroom?

112
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.150
Not that he let us know, but were there any pieces?

113
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.470
Cause Puerto Ricans have pieces in their family with a couple of pieces. Uh,

114
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.340
none of that were there. Did you on anybody? Yeah.

115
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 1>But not on purpose. I love Mike emoji. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.970
He's a good kid. And he gets it unlike.

117
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.040
<v 2>Does it get it Zack?</v>

118
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.510
<v 1>Yeah. So jokes exist in context. Good or bad jokes. Right?</v>

119
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.610
That's where they live. In context.

120
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.540
You can consider contexts like water and jokes are like fish. Right? Okay.

121
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.310
Keep the fish in the water. Right. You can't take a joke out of context.

122
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.910
You ever like talk to somebody and they try to tell you something funny that

123
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:31.150
someone else said, and then it doesn't work and they go, ah,

124
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.120
you had to be there. Yeah. You had to be there basically means

125
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.050
the jokes out of context. You weren't there.

126
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.880
That's what a professional comedian is. Jokes exist in context on the podcast.

127
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.940
In that moment, when you try to retell it, it's not a joke anymore.

128
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.380
It's a statement. So just leave comedians alone. You're an open mic.

129
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.000
Journalist, stay the away. I understand you've created a job for yourself.

130
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.180
Cause all the important jobs are taken right in about important stuff.

131
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.490
But we are just clowns and you are acting like the snitch

132
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.240
in the front of the class. Do you understand? You're not going to stop us.

133
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.890
The people don't care.

134
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.460
There's enough for you because there's not a lot of real jobs out there and you

135
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:16.570
don't want to work a real job. So there's enough for you to retweet and like,

136
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:18.610
and comment on each other's posts.

137
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.820
And that's why you think there's a scene out there that cares about this.

138
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.680
No body.

139
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.930
<v 2>Yeah. Nobody cares. This is America.</v>

140
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.970
People can say what they want.

141
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.220
And the heartbeat of a free nation is uncensored comedy.

142
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.470
Do you know what I'm playing right now? What are you playing?

143
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.920
The German national ant. That's not what I thought it was. Yeah. Cause,

144
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.400
cause you're saying you're making some German points right now. No, I'm not.

145
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.640
You just kamikaze. If you would a German national Anthem, I don't want it.

146
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.970
I wanted you to play the stars and stripes charming.
