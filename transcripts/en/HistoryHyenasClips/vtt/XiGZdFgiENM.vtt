00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>Hey, if you haven't already got it. Get yourself a copy of answer the internet,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.790
the card game it's available right now. And the link in the bio,

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.610
or you can get a Barstool, sports, Walmart, Amazon,

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:12.360
or Spencer gifts play along with us. Let's get into it. I'll be honest. Pappas.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.570
I'm Chris DiStefano and we are the history hyenas podcast.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.150
We're here to answer the internet again.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.273
<v 1>Again.</v>

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.410
<v 0>So Yani pops,</v>

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.210
would you rather shoot webs like Spiderman or have claws,

10
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.930
like Wolverine, both come out of your deck. I'd like to shoot webs.

11
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.020
You like to shoot. Why do I have claws coming out of my deck? I got chlamydia.

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.390
I guess you could call me Chrissy. Wolverine. Cause I got a drip,

13
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.890
but I like to shoot webs. You can just walk around and give dudes, facials

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.940
them. Just shoot and rope. Yeah. I like how we always shift around.

15
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:58.430
Like we're like listening to the national Anthem game.

16
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.570
We're about ready to get on the and go guy, athletes. We're going into play.

17
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:05.540
Women's volleyball. Okay. If you were murdered,

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.630
would you be the most light if you were merging

19
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.370
[inaudible] too close together yet? I can't see.

20
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:17.660
I can't see if you were murdered, who would be the most likely suspect?

21
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:18.650
My baby's mom,

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.790
if I was murdered, the most likely suspect would be me. I hate my life.

23
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:27.800
I'm going to kill myself. What it is.

24
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.540
You can turn any movie into a porno with the same cast from the

25
00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:35.510
movie. Which movie are you picking? Wreck-It Ralph.

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.280
I am definitely going with OB.

27
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.580
Stella's got her groove back. That would be,

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.390
you don't even have to ch I jerked off to it and it wasn't even a porno.

29
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:51.140
It wasn't even. Yeah, I got it. I took off to a lot. The movie true lies.

30
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.420
When Jamie Lee Curtis is dancing around with Arnold Schwarzenegger,

31
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.770
I would jerk off to that a lot.

32
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:57.200
And it's weird that I jerk off to that because she looks exactly like one of my

33
00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:58.670
aunts. No, I was saying it was worth it.

34
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.060
It was weird because you can't see Arnold Schwartzenegger he's in black.

35
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.130
So that's weird if you,

36
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:08.480
if you could make your girlfriend's breasts as large as you wanted,

37
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.150
but yours would be the same size. How big would you go?

38
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.780
If I could make her breasts as big as I wanted,

39
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.800
but yours have to be the same size. I'll go for hers.

40
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.270
All you got right now. I think we're at the same size right now.

41
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:26.330
I'm just going to say you push it on seeds, right? How you know,

42
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:29.540
I'm not in shape because my point away from each other,

43
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.510
they look like they're in a fight with each other.

44
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.250
My look like they're not talking to each other. I need to lose some weight.

45
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:36.950
You want your to go? North, South doors are going East, West side.

46
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:40.490
Now you want it. You want mine to be like this. You want the airplane guy?

47
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:43.670
Who's doing traffic to go down. And for me, I don't care. What size?

48
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:45.350
My girlfriends, one weird tan.

49
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.930
I got one weird temp and I don't care what size my girlfriend's breast her.

50
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.400
Cause I'm into guys. Would you rather be the president,

51
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.020
the Pope or whoever is in charge of North Korea? You know what? The president,

52
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.370
the Pope in North Korea,

53
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.090
I'm going to go the Pope because I think he could get away with more.

54
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.450
I mean that whole church has been molesting kids for centuries and they're doing

55
00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:10.200
better than ever. If one person molested someone here at Barstool,

56
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.670
there be no more Barstool.

57
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.060
I would say the pulp or whoever leads North Korea now.

58
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.560
Cause it's disrespectful to even think I have the talent or the capability or

59
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:22.260
the wherewithal to be the president because we got the best president we'll ever

60
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:26.450
have in our life. Right now track 2020. I respect fricking that ding Jong

61
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.800
[inaudible]. I mean, he, he looks at,

62
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.840
he walks around like Asian Cartman and like, he's like,

63
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.720
nobody's challenging him. Like, can you, like, if you were in Korea,

64
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:38.370
would you be like, I'm not listening to this guy anymore.

65
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.640
He's five foot six and he's fat. Yeah. He's fat.

66
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:44.940
And I left all my friends in Brooklyn when they see Kim knew and they just think

67
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:47.760
it's Ken Jong. They think it's the same guy because they're dumb kids.

68
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.620
And we want to watch you read that one. Okay.

69
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.590
Would you watch a porn with the hottest girl from high school?

70
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.450
If the dude in it was your dad? What? Yeah,

71
00:03:57.451 --> 00:03:59.220
because the truth in this situation is like,

72
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:01.620
see my dad's piece more than I care for.

73
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:04.290
We used to make me take showers with them and the kids got a slinky Dick.

74
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.620
He's got a little piece. I've already seen his bare penis.

75
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:10.650
So for me it doesn't matter. Yeah. We actually talk about that a lot.

76
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:15.210
Like our dads both have micro penises. My dad's piece looks like chewing gum.

77
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.840
Cotton. Yeah. Yeah. No. My dad would want to see him in a porno.

78
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.420
Now my dad's piece, I would describe it as an Annie.

79
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.450
Would you rather be magic Johnson with AIDS or a regular dude with

80
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.530
no brainer. I'm going to magic Johnson with AIDS. They're curing AIDS.

81
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:33.300
I don't give a crap. I'm more scared of bedbugs.

82
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.830
I can't believe I still don't have it. You're a lucky kid. Yeah.

83
00:04:37.831 --> 00:04:42.390
I'm a lucky cat, but yeah. Okay, good. What movie most recently made?

84
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.910
I can't even think of a movie. I even watched of podcast. Yeah.

85
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.730
I don't even listen to movies. You know what a girl's got to eat.

86
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.050
It makes you cry from feeling good. One movie most recently made me cry.

87
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.700
Pocahontas. I watched Pocahontas with my daughter and it's just, it's up.

88
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:04.050
When they kill a brother. If you had to eat one human body part,

89
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.260
what would it be? Guy's penis next, next, next.

90
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.540
And I'm keto. So I would say if you have to eat one human body part,

91
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:16.410
what would it be? Ida ID to somebodies nipples. I'm going penis.

92
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:19.140
Just to make it funny. If you got to eat a body part,

93
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.270
you want to be able to giggle about it and be like, what'd you see?

94
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:25.080
I'm like I ate a guy's Dick. It has, it takes the bite off of what you just did.

95
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.780
Yeah. Yeah. I need a placenta. People need publicizes.

96
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.760
That's great thinking right there. Yeah.

97
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.010
Is eating out a stripper at a bachelor party,

98
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:34.140
something to brag about or is it just disgusting

99
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.900
to eating at a shipper at a bachelor party? Something to brag about? Yeah. Yeah,

100
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.620
yeah. You'd have to strip her. Yeah. I went to, why would it be disgusting?

101
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.570
What kind of gay guy wrote this is this, this card got in there from a grinder.

102
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.200
This is like, this is this one slipped in. This is what we call a raisin.

103
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.830
What we mean by that is, is when you're a guy you have sex with so many women,

104
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.680
inevitably, a couple of guys are going to slip it on.

105
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:00.860
We call those rates like you don't notice two razors in a wrote meal.

106
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.910
You don't notice a gay guy's car. But the only thing with this,

107
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.880
if you're eating out a stripper at a bachelor party,

108
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.220
you're not going to be able to do it for long.

109
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.880
And you can get like two licks in before you get hemmed up by some black dude.

110
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.380
Who's there to say, don't touch the girl.

111
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.350
I'm going to get your hands off the strippers. I'm going to say it's disgusting.

112
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.580
Cause vaginas are ULI.

113
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.730
Would you rather have your girl be able to see or hear everything you do when

114
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:26.600
she's not around?

115
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.810
So do you want to grow to see it or hear it when she's not around?

116
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.240
I'd rather her hear it. You'd rather her hear.

117
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.500
I don't want her to see what's going on. Cause not a good scene. Yeah.

118
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.910
Cause what I do is I get completely naked.

119
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.600
I tucked back and I walk around listening to wild horses.

120
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.770
This kid used to um, yeah, he used to wear his mother's are pantyhose.

121
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.130
It's not a good luck. It's not a good luck. Yeah. It's not a good look.

122
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.000
What I walk around in full Maurissa outfit and I just jerk off to myself in the

123
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:54.920
mirror. I would rather, yeah,

124
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.870
I definitely rather her just I'd rather her hear it because I'm all

125
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:04.370
I do is lie. I just CWL Chrissy white lies and I'm just tell lies all the time.

126
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:06.890
So if she heard it, I could at least get out of it. Cause if she saw it,

127
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.640
she would call the police. Want to read the last one? Sure. Okay.

128
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.160
Would you kill baby Hitler?

129
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.570
If it had to be in a very gruesome way while I'm 40% German.

130
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:22.250
So I plead the fifth when you kill baby Hitler,

131
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.460
if it had to be in a very gruesome way, do I know he's Hitler,

132
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.760
Adolf, Hitler as a baby. Yeah.

133
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.020
I'm kicking that little off of a high bridge and just ratchet him.

134
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.400
[inaudible] I'm actually no, you got to give him the Jews.

135
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.380
I give Hitler to Jews. Give Hitler. I'd be like,

136
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:44.270
I'd wait for like one of their holidays or whatever.

137
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.540
And I'd show up at that shack that they build outside their houses, like knock,

138
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:50.150
knock, and got a little present for baby Hill.

139
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.640
Or they'd be like who's baby Hillary. I'm like, trust me.

140
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.590
You're going to want to kill this place. Me.

141
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:57.650
This is the best Hanukkah gift you've ever gotten. They're going to go. No,

142
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.500
we don't kill people. That's very bad to don't want the only one.

143
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.780
How do I know I'm not going to kill a baby member and be like, listen,

144
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.370
the guy I'm from the future. Things get bad. Here's kill this baby.

145
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.630
Here's what he's going to do with it and say,

146
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.470
we're going to make them tota fix and I'm going to go. No, trust me,

147
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.550
this guy's going to be doing some bad stuff to you. People killed this baby.

148
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.950
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
