00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>So, so we're talking about how we can't, you know, there's nothing to do.</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.920
So our birthday this year, cause today is Wednesday. It's 26.

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.690
My actual birthday yesterday was Janice's birthday. And we're just like,

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.020
this is what we do now. The birthday is kind of just to be with you, the fans,

5
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.900
because everything else is fricking closed every year.

6
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.720
We just have a birthday episode because our birthdays are so close together.

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.560
This is our combined 40th birthday. Right. Um,

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.050
what are we going to do for it this year? During the pandemic,

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:30.780
we got to figure something out. What do you want to do? Um,

10
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.150
you want to have a baby Q and a,

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.270
we'll just call it a baby queue because you know, baby, we will do a baby.

12
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.570
We could do that. Or, um, you want to hang out with, um,

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.190
vetted TIAs parade in central park and talk about social justice issues.

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.410
We could do that. Yeah, we could do that. Why don't we just,

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.580
or we could just carry stuff, carry briefcases of equipment with pinky here.

16
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.240
We can do that. Yeah. Well, why or why don't we just celebrate Kamala Harris?

17
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.710
You know, I, I didn't realize how selfish we were being.

18
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.060
This is a historic time for this country. We're an Indian,

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.660
African American or whatever her father she's after made Hampshire make it,

20
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:10.800
but that makes her an African-American. Yeah. Whatever her dad's.

21
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.490
Her dad is Indian and her mom is Jamaica. Our dad is Jamaica. Her mom is Indian.

22
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.150
So therefore she is the first African-American vice presidential candidate.

23
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.540
That's just the country limit. I'm not, I'm just saying what it is.

24
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.640
It is what it is. But, um, we are,

25
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.720
we being selfish by celebrating our birthdays on such a historic occasion where

26
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.910
really this episode should be about,

27
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:34.680
should we give our birthdays to black people? Yeah. Yeah. I forgot the kid.

28
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.970
Trevor Wallace was on the Gramercy theater show and he sold out two shows and

29
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:42.480
it's just, yeah, he just, Trevor Wallace just looks like me if I got Corona,

30
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.790
because look, look at, look at the, what we did though.

31
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.490
And that was the first time we worked with Becky. That's what it is.

32
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.060
There's Zach ISIS. Remember Zach ISIS members, Zach. I mean,

33
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:54.510
we've come a long way. I mean, look at that crowd. It's unbelievable.

34
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.390
And I think that I shouldn't have been wearing that sweater was too small.

35
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.760
<v 1>For me, but who cares? Creekstone?</v>

36
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.360
<v 0>It doesn't matter. Lookout jacked. I was there.</v>

37
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.140
I was working out then there was gyms open.

38
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.130
I was a real strong kid at that moment. Yeah. I mean, I was a kid that like,

39
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.550
if you had a snap and right, you can put me down, but if I got ahold of ya,

40
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.990
yeah, I'm definitely gonna bite.

41
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.470
It's good to just bite if I get close to bite and I don't know why I decided to

42
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:19.290
wear shoes that night, but I wanted to be a grownup. I had a,

43
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:22.170
my show is like almost dead when this happened. I remember the show was,

44
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.920
I remember the show was at midnight and I almost passed out because it was too,

45
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.660
I was too sleepy and that girl comes to every show. Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean,

46
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.340
yeah.

47
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.980
<v 1>Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.</v>
