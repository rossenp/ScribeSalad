WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>He's back in smiles. He's just, well, the thing is Johnny says,</v>

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.000
yeah, I can get away with things because, uh, they call me Chrissy charms.

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.480
Cause I can charm, but charms going away though. If my CalPERS,

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.600
Glen getting smaller and my charms going away, I think my CalPERS gland,

5
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.210
he tends to go with the bed. My charm lives in my CalPERS, Glen,

6
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:19.430
and they're shrinking. So it's just what it is.

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.520
How did they find that they had to do, um,

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.540
they go in through the front camera up your D dude. No, no, no.

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.050
So what happened was, is I had got a girl who was on birth control, pregnant,

10
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.350
and then that's like almost impossible. Well,

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.330
not if you've got a hyperactive calipers

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.320
came, we Blitzkrieg that.

13
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.230
No CAS wait, sorry. So, um,

14
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.040
so they couldn't believe that I got this girl pregnant and blah, blah, blah,

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.980
blah. So they did tests on you. The doctor's like just throw a test. So I,

16
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.910
I go in, uh, to donate sperm and they're like, do you want prostate?

17
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.280
Or do you want to, do you want, do you want to or do you,

18
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.880
a nurse can come in and do give you a prostate exam? I was like, no.

19
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.820
And then did they really say that, you know,

20
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:07.400
that's the option a nurse can do it without you having to do anything.

21
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.550
They go in and they touch your prostate or massage. It's not. Yeah.

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.910
It's just comes out. I don't even believe that it's a real it's it's science.

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.480
Yeah. So they do that or that's the address or you could drop off. Yeah.

24
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.630
They had magazines. So you could jerk off, he jerked off. You're like,

25
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:25.490
bring me a bucket. Yeah. Just fun. A mag bang. Yeah. So,

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.880
so this episode is just becoming about Chrissy's com yeah.

27
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.340
I think this is the most minutes we've done about your, yeah.

28
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.500
We're going to talk about JFK's assassination. Well,

29
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:37.370
that guy left come anywhere anyway. Yeah. Talking about your tonsils, your,

30
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.110
your prostate exam,

31
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:43.460
and your kids want to know that's what they want to dig into.

32
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:48.150
Magic bullets. [inaudible]

33
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.050
yeah. Um, so, um, so,

34
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:57.020
so then I get my sperm looked at and the doctors say that it's like four or five

35
00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:00.860
times the amount of normal sperm. So they're like the million dollar man. Yeah.

36
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.500
They, at first they thought that I was born. They didn't,

37
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.830
they wanted to verify that I was born in Queens and I wasn't adopted from Russia

38
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.980
because they thought I was potentially born in a Trenoble radiation zone,

39
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.390
which is wild. Um, that would explain some stuff. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

40
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.260
Cause that's a common side effect over there. Yeah.

41
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:17.300
Well they have all the locations.

42
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.760
They have all types of mutations that wasn't an HBO series. I didn't say. Yeah.

43
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.640
He left that part out. It's got bags out. Some dogs just leave the shots at him.

44
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.890
So, so they said, um, they said, uh, you know,

45
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:32.900
they want it to like look further because they're like, you know,

46
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:36.200
it could be just like an abnormality or it could have like a tumor or something

47
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:39.980
like that. So they just did like an MRI and they looked and they saw like,

48
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.070
how big the CalPERS Glenn? Wasn't like, Oh, this is the problem. Like,

49
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:47.210
you're fine. It's just like, you know, just a seven, just shoot out these ropes.

50
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.850
Yeah. Did you ever see that? Do you ever see those guys,

51
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.220
those people that suffer from that orgasm, uh,

52
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.050
disease where they just cry all the time? Yeah.

53
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.420
Like you'll be talking to me like, yeah. But so does even shoot? No,

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.310
it's just, it's just organic. Yeah. It'd be like rounding. I mean,

55
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.020
I was going to say you ever jerk out four times in one day,

56
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:08.460
but obviously not with no, no, no I don't.

57
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.730
But sometimes when you get the flu in like sixth grade and you're like,

58
00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:14.310
I'm just gonna beat this thing to hell. The fourth time hurts.

59
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.560
It hurts everything. It's a burn genital arousal disorder. Yeah.

60
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.010
So they get like a Rouse from walking and like anything touches it. They just,

61
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.430
they just coming hard wind. And it's actually like, it hurts.

62
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:29.040
It's like a problem. It's like very painful. He came,

63
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.640
he came blood in the beginning of the year, uh, two years ago. Yeah.

64
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.190
This calendar year. What are we talking about? [inaudible]

65
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.680
started off in some blood speed out how much? Just a little bit.

66
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:42.660
And then enough to notice enough to, yeah.

67
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.120
That all you need is a little to be like, what's up walk.

68
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.170
How scared were you though in that moment? Scary drive cancer everywhere.

69
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.100
We wrote a whole Bay Ridge boys up episode because I was,

70
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.060
it was based off kid came. His glue was a bloody. I had to go to a,

71
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.641
you go get your, you get,

72
00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:03.450
get the finger in the butt to see if the prostate is okay.

73
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.480
And apparently it's okay. Apparently. What did the doctor say to you?

74
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:10.260
To the pro? He goes, sorry. Uh, he goes, sorry, kid or whatever.

75
00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:13.560
It was like, he, when he goes in like, cause you just,

76
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:18.010
like you bent over the gay guys are real, man, man. They just like do that.

77
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.070
Like it's an uncomfortable feeling.

78
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.550
Like you gotta be in the men to want something in your. Yeah.

79
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.520
Cause he was just in there and he saw, I just kind of was like,

80
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.880
I was just dealing just winsome a little bit. He was just like, sorry, kid,

81
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.880
what you do knuckle? Or like first knuckle, they go two fingers in there. Right?

82
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.270
Like, well it depends what kind of hands, if you have a white,

83
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.220
if you have a wide center to finger, poke it right in the butt.

84
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.500
I guess they go one index finger over like,

85
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:46.260
they're trying to press the elevator button, but you didn't come. Huh?

86
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.640
You didn't come. Not this time. But this was the third prostate exam.

87
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:54.900
I've had three, two. Yeah. They just touch the bladder right there.

88
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.000
Or they just touch the prostate and then shoot your glue out.

89
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.700
And that little thing under the bladder, I believe is the CalPERS, Glen.

90
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:02.610
And that's where my thing is just huge. That's why just shoot glue out of,

91
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.630
he's got like an Andre, the giant. We are really in this word. We're in there.

92
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.860
Yeah.

93
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.870
I mean I love how they put a glove on the car car to request.

94
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.560
Yeah. I'll tell you the glove with his wedding ring on. I tell you this.

95
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.163
Yeah.

96
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.860
We'll be talking about JFK's assassination and we just have a picture of the

97
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.000
record. It's what happens on this podcast? This podcast is hyena.

98
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.290
It'll all make its way around. Well, eventually, you know what? I,

99
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.260
my mom looked like JFK's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, Onassis.

100
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:40.620
She looks like her people would today stop in the street. No, they, my mom,

101
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.530
when she was young, she used to say that people would stop her in the street.

102
00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:46.710
My father verified this and they thought she was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

103
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.100
And we call her Jackie O like Jackie. Oh yeah. My mom looks just like her.

104
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.980
She does a little bit. No,

105
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.940
this woman saw her husband's face get blown off. Yeah.

106
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.050
I think she tried to put it back together too. If you watch the video,

107
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.183
like then she really,

108
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.570
she gathers his skull and it's like trying to like put it back on his head.

109
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.220
I did Opie and Anthony with the, um, I think his name was Clint black.

110
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.450
And he wrote a book.

111
00:06:13.451 --> 00:06:15.910
He was the secret service agent that when you watch the video,

112
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:19.360
he jumps in the back of your car. Was he the one that got shot?

113
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.970
He didn't get shot. He didn't get shot. I forgot the guy who got shot.

114
00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:23.740
But anyway, w we did a whole three hour interview.

115
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:26.050
I was just the other guest on Opie and Anthony, when they did this.

116
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:28.930
And he was saying that when he jumped in the back, like, you know,

117
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:31.180
you have to take, it's a whole procedure. He he's like,

118
00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:34.360
you have to take him to the hospital and tell the American people that we tried

119
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:37.810
everything Kenny. So when he, he was pretty much decapitated, dead,

120
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:41.050
like eyes in the back. Like he was dead. Like he said, the first shot,

121
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.040
like by the time or the second shot, like he was, there was no saving him.

122
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.710
It was pointless. Take him to the hospital. Yeah. He said it was just like,

123
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.060
it was all. And he said,

124
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.950
he believes this guy believes that being there, how quick everything happened.

125
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:57.520
He said he doesn't think for a second at Lee Harvey Oswald killed him. Well,

126
00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:01.390
that's what these races, these boys solve it today. You guys, you guys told us,

127
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:04.510
you have the answer. What happened? I know what happened.

128
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.350
Let we can get back to the rest shot. Let's get back to relax after that. Um,

129
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.270
I'm probably going to disappear into this episode with each other's fingers and

130
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:17.560
all our asphalts yet. Let's do it. Let's check each other's prostate.

131
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:20.740
I just learned about this little magic button in the backseat. Absolutely. Yeah.

132
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:23.320
Well, you're going to really learn about it tonight after the pot. Yeah.

133
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.470
We're going to take some perfect 10 and put on pretty woman and you're going to

134
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:28.390
get cracked in my love. What's going to happen.
