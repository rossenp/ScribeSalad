00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>So who cared. So if I come to you right now, let's go back. You're the,</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.480
your mortgage broker in long Island. I meet you in a diner,

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:07.710
which is you call your office.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.600
<v 1>Period. Diner. Freeport. Absolutely phenomenal. Yeah. You got to make it real.</v>

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.750
So see period diner and Freeport on Barry Crow.

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.350
<v 0>Yeah. You say, meet me at the office and you, I hear you. Hey.</v>

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.230
<v 1>That will spill hot coffee. Anybody was taking a look at you and go. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.360
<v 0>Yeah. And when you tell me to meet you at your office,</v>

9
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.290
I hear the clang of a payphone when you hang up. And so I meet your office.

10
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.750
I come in, I say, Hey, how you doing? Nice to meet you, Mr. Dylan,

11
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.230
me and my wife just got married. Um, you know, I'm a comedian.

12
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.410
I saved up about 80 K um, uh, you know,

13
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.010
she wants to live and we're having a baby who wants to launch. You got pop.

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.903
I'm very glad.

15
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.480
<v 1>I get alone. Not only can you get along, but let me, let me tell you some. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.270
How much that 80 K are you prepared to spend on the property?

17
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.570
<v 0>I don't know. Uh, Mr. Dylan, you know,</v>

18
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.920
I'm pretty conservative guy saved every single dollar from my mortgage.

19
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.980
How much you prepared us banked. Um, hold on. Let me go into Marissa.

20
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.320
<v 1>No, no, no, no. Of that 80,000. How much would you like to spend?</v>

21
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.550
Are you willing to spend all of that?

22
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.700
<v 0>I'm willing to spend more to spend about 60 or 70 of it.</v>

23
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.790
<v 1>Guess how much of that is? You're going to have to spend how much, nothing.</v>

24
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.170
What? Nothing.

25
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.050
You're not going to spend anything because let me explain something to you.

26
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.410
Sit down. The wife is lovely. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yeah,

27
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.840
here's the thing. Could we, could I get pancakes while I'm here?

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.860
You can get anything. The bricks and sticks of your house.

29
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.930
Appreciate the frame, the land, they appreciate value.

30
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.080
You know what your money does in your house for you, Mr. Papas,

31
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.060
it does absolutely nothing.

32
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.360
You know what the wealthiest people do with real estate, Mr. Papas,

33
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.050
a lot of them finance it. Why? Because your mortgage is your only tax.

34
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:39.750
Write off.

35
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.510
It is the only write-off is your only weapon against the

36
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:45.344
federal government.

37
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.610
The larger the loan you take the better it is for you financially.

38
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.580
And you take that $80,000 and he, and I'm not wrong by the way,

39
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.220
let me put lime a little and you put it in tax exempt,

40
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.740
securities like Roth IRAs. Mr. Papas,

41
00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:00.830
you maximize the amount of,

42
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.000
of tax exempt retirement accounts that you put your money in with that

43
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:09.950
$80,000. You make it work for you. You do not sink it into a house.

44
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.030
Yes or yes.

45
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.250
So the reality is this we're taking the biggest loan possible.

46
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.410
Mr. Papas will set you free.

47
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.630
Now sign this piece of paper for Christ. And at that point,

48
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:30.950
you and your wife were crying and then we signed papers and you do. You go down,

49
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.950
how do you get the loan from the bank? They're giving them away.

50
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.010
We're talking about now, we're back in the day. Back in the day, I said, Kelly,

51
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.890
we got one at Kelly. I said,

52
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:45.380
Mr. Papas and his wife Brittany's from long Island.

53
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.470
They want to go buy a piece of marble. Honk is,

54
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.930
Kelly, ice got Coke running down in Melbourne. From last night,

55
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.200
she's got a double tall non-fat latte from Starbucks.

56
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.200
Non-fat she's not getting anyone. And she melts it down. And she says, let me,

57
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.180
she makes all the paperwork look like it should look. And the, my little bank,

58
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.050
which was called Franklin first or new world mortgage or the mortgage zone,

59
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.430
or if the funding hot or whatever it is, we send our paper to a,

60
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.870
even bigger. And as similarly, bank,

61
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.340
like a long beach mortgage, or a new century mortgage or an Argent,

62
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.450
and those banks were doing backdoor deals with JP Morgan city group.

63
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.450
So those banks were underwriting the paper to the,

64
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.780
to the middle grade banks that were lending money to the dirt bed,

65
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.550
brokerage operating out of a van. Places that I work. Okay.

66
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.720
So when this all, they were playing a game of hot potato, that's an orgy. Yeah.

67
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.600
So when, so when everything goes wrong, you pass it around,

68
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.270
pass the basket around. And then by the time you sign your mortgage,

69
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.210
by the time you get your first bill, cause the other benefit Mr. Papas,

70
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:55.270
you don't pay for two months, right? For two months, you don't pay.

71
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.310
<v 0>But are you sure I'm going to be able to afford this mortgage by standup comedy</v>

72
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:00.600
career is up and down.

73
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.740
<v 1>Mr. Papas, I have watched your stuff. I think you're a genius. Thank you.</v>

74
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.030
And I think you're absolute genius. And I will tell you this right now.

75
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.180
All you have to worry about right now is,

76
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.130
is what are you going to do?

77
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.100
<v 0>I'm just a little worried. I'm not past the seller. Am I going to have a future?</v>

78
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.160
<v 1>What if you're going to have a seller in the home that we put you in?</v>

79
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.430
All you have to worry about as a pop is what are you going to do with those two

80
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:26.400
free months? Cause we're rolling it into the mortgage. You've got 60 days.

81
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.090
I would take a little vacation with this lovely lady. Are you serious too?

82
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.320
I was concerned. I even had enough for the mortgage before this two free months.

83
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 0>What? Yeah, that's what you're saying. Free.</v>

84
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:38.550
Am I going to have to pay at some point for this.

85
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.800
<v 1>Rolling into the mortgage, which again,</v>

86
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:44.970
we talked about it just increases your tax deduction. If you could, Mr. Papas,

87
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:46.500
you take a loan every day, honey,

88
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.180
I have read that you would take a loan because the federal government is coming

89
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:52.590
to take your hard earned money.

90
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.030
I am telling you your ability to fight them is contingent on how big this

91
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.540
mortgage is. Take all your credit card debt or your car loans, everything,

92
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:03.630
student loans, roll it into this refinance.

93
00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:07.350
It let's take a hundred thousand dollars, 200,000. Let's do it.

94
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.980
Let's make it big and let's do it once. Do it, right?

95
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.650
That's a great line. That's a line.

96
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:16.980
One of our guys had let's do it once and do a ride.

97
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.480
And then he called them back eight months later and they'd go, you said,

98
00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:23.340
we've got to do it once and do it right? He goes,

99
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:27.960
let's do it twice and do it better. But that's what we need.

100
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:30.150
That's the only way that economies get like you guys can laugh at that.

101
00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:34.860
That's the only way the economy is going to get on a bubble bath to sell things

102
00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:35.694
to others.

103
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.600
<v 0>Everything you explained, none of that is criminal at all. It's just, wow,</v>

104
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.030
you wouldn't go so far as to say that. Yeah.

105
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.390
<v 1>No, none of it was criminal. I didn't really do the criminal.</v>

106
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.860
The criminal was really, um, and it was just some, a. It's not cause a morality.

107
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.680
The criminal really was well, we did a little criminal stuff to lie in the peat.

108
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.250
The people that was all my cousin,

109
00:05:56.251 --> 00:06:00.200
my cousin owns a car dealership on Northern Boulevard is going to say that I've

110
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.150
worked there for the last six years.

111
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.440
<v 0>Right. Look the other way and go, let's approve them for the mortgage the way.</v>

112
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.130
Okay.

113
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.920
<v 1>That's w that's kind of soft fraud because the bank was not,</v>

114
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:12.790
it wasn't fake documents. It was literally, they were accepting, uh,

115
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.713
honor system.

116
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.410
<v 0>Let me ask you this question is crazy. How did this orgy get started?</v>

117
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:20.800
Is my first question. My second question is when did you know it was over?

118
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.280
And my third question is, can you compare it to stand-up comedy three questions?

119
00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:26.370
When I, when the origin got started after.

120
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.430
<v 1>Well, it started to two places. It started with the community reinvestment act,</v>

121
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.410
uh, under the Clinton administration.

122
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.910
A lot of things that ended up being very bad, start with good positive things.

123
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:39.040
And like basically people were saying to.

124
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.950
<v 0>Like communism, like communism, right? You gotta start expanding.</v>

125
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.640
<v 1>In minority communities. And, uh, low-income communities,</v>

126
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.330
you got to expand opportunities to credit. People need to be, uh,

127
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.790
able to finance things, get into the American system.

128
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.080
They don't have that opportunity.

129
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:56.260
They're denied by banks all the time that we need to stop that.

130
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.880
So community reinvestment act planted the seeds in the heads of wall street,

131
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.100
people and financial, uh,

132
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.000
industry executives that they needed to come up with products that allowed them

133
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:11.020
to land to traditionally riskier borrowers, borrowers,

134
00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:15.730
that might've had less income, less credit, less, less, you know, uh, whatever.

135
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.440
Um, um, and so what then happened was after nine 11,

136
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.080
the economy was in a recession and Alan Greenspan, you know, they cut rates,

137
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.700
fed cut rates. Uh, and then, then the party started where it was like,

138
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.200
now it was like, Hey, get, get in let's kick, start the economy.

139
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.000
We got to get some houses going on. And then it was a, uh, real estate boom,

140
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.400
a construction, boom. Um,

141
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.170
all of these exotic financial products that allowed you to pay one or 2% like a

142
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:50.770
credit card payment that's on the way. Sure.

143
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:54.250
Some version of that will be on the way on those financial products within

144
00:07:54.251 --> 00:07:57.490
bundled up and sold, uh, to, uh,

145
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.090
investment funds and then people. And this is we're so interconnected.

146
00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:05.320
What really everything was like people's pensions were tied into these funds

147
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.490
that were wrapped up with very toxic assets, which was the term,

148
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.230
which was bad mortgages,

149
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.980
mortgages given to people that had no ability to repay them. Uh,

150
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.860
and that's the mortgage backed security, which was invented by a guy named blue,

151
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.500
rainy, airy, uh, who's profiled in the big, short,

152
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:25.240
that was when they decided that mortgages should be traded and sold between

153
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:29.170
banks and investment, uh, institutions like stocks,

154
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.680
your bank used to hold your mortgage. So early on,

155
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:36.190
you would go to a mortgage bank and you would have the bank I'm in so many

156
00:08:36.191 --> 00:08:39.550
scenes in old movies or guy arguing with the banker. It's been rough this month.

157
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.340
It's the banker that gave him the mortgage. He knew the guy.

158
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.670
It was a very localized thing. I know him, I know his farm.

159
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:48.430
I've been to his farm. I know what he brings in. Um,

160
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.560
and then everything got very global where like,

161
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.320
I would give you mortgage and sell it to Ghana.

162
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.440
So then y'all would sell it to pimp. And the pimp would sell to shell.

163
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.830
Chase would sell your chase would sell your mortgage to Fannie Mae, correct?

164
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.510
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSEs government sponsored entities,

165
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.940
meaning they're not technically government controlled,

166
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:05.930
but they're government sponsored.

167
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.500
Meaning the government Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are essentially why we have,

168
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.940
um, you know, some stability in the, in the mortgage market,

169
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.060
meaning that they back the loans,

170
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.560
they not explicitly, but they,

171
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:23.960
they ensure that these loans are good

172
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.330
and they protect banks who issue these loans and

173
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:33.290
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are well, you know,

174
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:35.180
one of the reasons we have a 30 year mortgage,

175
00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:38.630
do you have a stability over 30 years as a financial instrument?

176
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.660
That's kind of unheard of, and it's not common everywhere in the world.

177
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.020
It's very uncommon. I mean, a lot of places there's only 10 year notes,

178
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.850
a 30 year fixed note is, is, is, is a financial product that you work in.

179
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.950
This is what, like, the libertarians is tough.

180
00:09:51.951 --> 00:09:54.770
And they start talking about like, Oh, the gov government,

181
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.010
the government's always been involved in everything. Yeah.

182
00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:58.730
The government's allowed all of this to happen.

183
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.800
So this idea that like you can uncouple from the government, uh, is,

184
00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:06.320
is just not realistic. It might've been, it ma I'll give them this.

185
00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:10.580
It might've been better to not have the government do all of these things. Sure.

186
00:10:10.581 --> 00:10:11.960
Academically great.

187
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.460
But the reality is even just looking at the mortgage market to redo and the real

188
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:17.120
great book.

189
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.010
If anyone has an interest in this is written by Bethany McClean,

190
00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:23.630
and it's called all the devils are here.

191
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.470
And it's about a it's from a great Shakespeare play. All the devils are here.

192
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:31.100
I should say, Bethany McClean also wrote one of the most influential articles.

193
00:10:31.101 --> 00:10:34.040
She's a reporter, a reporter for fortune. And she wrote a,

194
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.070
one of the most influential articles that's ever been written in finance.

195
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.080
And it was called how does Enron make its money?

196
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.630
And it was the first article that kind of pierced the facade of the Enron.

197
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.591
That book,

198
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:49.550
all the devils are here is about what the mortgage crisis depends on who you

199
00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:54.440
blame more. Here's what it is there is it, was it more predatory lenders?

200
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.220
And Joan Rivers said on an episode of Louie? No. When you're lucky. Yeah. No.

201
00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:01.280
When you're lucky, there's this idea, uh, of,

202
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.090
of our economies built on this model of perpetual growth, right?

203
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.160
Everything's gotta be bigger and bigger and bigger.

204
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.430
The house has got to be bigger. The pool's gotta be deeper.

205
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.530
The yard has got to be bigger. The debt is going to be bigger.

206
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.230
You got to know when to hand, you gotta know, you gotta know when to cash.

207
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.790
It's the disease of more, right? The disease of more and it's,

208
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:23.480
and it was those wall street guys weren't poor before they started slinging

209
00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:28.190
these things. They weren't poor, but they got, you know, in the last 10 or 15,

210
00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:29.024
20 years,

211
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.980
people in that line of work have gotten astronomically, wealthy,

212
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.150
a level of wealthy that most people don't understand. I'm talking about.

213
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.920
Many of them are earning a billion dollars in a calendar year or

214
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.090
over a hundred million dollars in a calendar year, right?

215
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.450
Not 30 million, not a million a month, not 2 million a month,

216
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:53.060
not 5 million a month. We're talking in cases, 20,

217
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.510
$30 million a month.

218
00:11:55.511 --> 00:12:00.040
The guys at the top of those institutions they've become so

219
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.620
like dislocated from the city. There is a real,

220
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.260
like, you know, problem with that type of money.

221
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.571
<v 0>This level,</v>

222
00:12:12.571 --> 00:12:17.490
it was the disease of more on the side of those who were getting the loans.

223
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.260
And on the side of people who were.

224
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.090
<v 1>Correct, right. It's all across the board. It's the American dream.</v>

225
00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:26.910
And I knew it was over when I was in a diner in the same diner.

226
00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:29.820
I said to the waiter, I sat, um, Hey, I, you know,

227
00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:32.940
my order at the diner is always mozzarella sticks. Also.

228
00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:36.010
I'd like a grilled cheese with Turkey. Cause I'm, I'm turning over a new lane.

229
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.310
<v 0>Then I asked the waitress, where's the closest Carvel.</v>

230
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.280
<v 1>Grilled cheese with Turkey tomato. I'm turning over a new leaf.</v>

231
00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:44.100
I didn't say bacon. It's in Turkey. Now let me ask you a question.

232
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.770
If bacon goes in a sandwich with the Turkey,

233
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.710
Khosla, French fries, slightly cooked, but

234
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.360
don't burn them. Don't give me the,

235
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.470
don't give me the excuse that people are paying attention to there. So,

236
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.810
and uh, so I said, ah, I said to the waiter, he goes, what are you gonna do?

237
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:09.630
I said, I do mortgages. He goes, what a coincidence? I do mortgages.

238
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.730
And then the guy that was handing me, my mozzarella sticks,

239
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:15.180
took out a card from his top pocket and put it on the diner table.

240
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.550
And that's kind of the way I felt, you know,

241
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.860
about a year or year and a half ago in comedy.

242
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:21.870
When everyone you knew was that Matt was a comedian.

243
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.330
A problem is when everybody like, it's the secret's out. It's like, you know,

244
00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:28.800
you ever go to a good restaurant.

245
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.100
<v 0>So that's when you knew it was over when everyone was getting yeah.</v>

246
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.920
<v 1>When it got saturated, oversaturate food example,</v>

247
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.910
which I don't talk to about food, a lot, a rush, you go to a good restaurant.

248
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.803
It's great.

249
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.830
Then you cruise by it on a Saturday night and it's jammed and you go,

250
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:45.930
I hope in a year from now,

251
00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:47.700
we don't end up coming back and going this place socks.

252
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:50.580
But a lot of times that happens a lot of times when it,

253
00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:53.700
when it's the secret place and they're on the come up, they're on the rise.

254
00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:54.534
Everything's great.

255
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.270
But when it explodes and everybody's in and everybody's got their hand in the

256
00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:00.330
trough, then all of a sudden people start making stupid decisions.

257
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.140
They start making bad decisions and the people should making decisions that are

258
00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:07.440
nowhere near the actual decisions, which is why communism,

259
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:12.390
all these isms don't work is because people are making decisions from 30,000

260
00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:17.310
feet about disciplines. They have no idea about how they actually work, right?

261
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.110
So when the government just goes, Hey, find a way to lend to low income people.

262
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.970
And wall street goes, we got it.

263
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.880
The government has no idea what's about to happen. Right?

264
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.950
And then the ones that kind of have an inkling,

265
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:32.490
just keep their mouth shut because things are good Bush because 70% of Americans

266
00:14:32.491 --> 00:14:33.324
own homes,

267
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.660
Trump has done nothing but extend what Obama did, which was extended,

268
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.510
but pushed head,

269
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.350
which is essentially just tell people to put it all on a credit card.

270
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.520
That's just the whole thing. The economy is just on a card.

271
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.740
We'll think about it later. I mean, we owe, what is it? 20 trillion as China.

272
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.070
You don't, it's the number. Now. You can't even say the number anymore.

273
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.280
They got us to think of a new word in English language.

274
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.270
Describe the amount the economy is just on the card. It's an onlay way.

275
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:07.040
It's like w you know, interest rates, what happens when that culminates,

276
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.000
where does that end as all things? And what happens? How do we reconcile?

277
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.250
The inflation is where it ultimately leads to the devaluing of the dollar.

278
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.870
The dollar not being the world's reserve currency are our debt rating getting

279
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:25.070
trashed. We're not a good debtor anymore. So that means we're losing. Yeah.

280
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.200
AAA bond rating and all that. Yeah. That's where it leads.

281
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.840
And then it just leads to what you're talking about.

282
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:33.330
There is the actual rotting of the infrastructure of the Amtrak crack.

283
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.910
That's inability to service our debt. Our inability to,

284
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.990
you know,

285
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.040
basically print the kind of money that we've been printing to keep everybody off

286
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:44.780
the streets, which hasn't worked.

287
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.650
This is when you become a bad earner in the mafia, and then you get whacked.

288
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.060
You can become a blood earner.

289
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.080
Now we got somebody in the mafia.

290
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.290
Movies starts looking at a picture of you from the good times with sadness in

291
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.540
the past. You know, they take a picture.

292
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:02.850
They look at you when you guys all went to like a Ruba and you went, yeah,

293
00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:06.620
that was fun. He used, that's where we're getting to has got a lot of debts.

294
00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:10.190
Now we don't know how to really get them out. I, I think business is common.

295
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:13.400
It could be weed. It could be prostitution. I think you've got to legalize weed,

296
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:14.540
legalized prostitution.

297
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.860
They want to Biden or Trump's new administration whores you're in weed is in,

298
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.590
we do not have a choice. You don't have a choice.

299
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.660
<v 0>We really hope you enjoyed that episode. Whatever it was about.</v>
