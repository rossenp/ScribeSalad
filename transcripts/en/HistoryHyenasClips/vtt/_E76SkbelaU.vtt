00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.320
<v 0>Matt Matt about Pearl Harbor. What? Yeah. Nah, I'll never choose you.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.790
They're still the enemy. I'm still an active part of the Japanese army.

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.050
Not my grandfather. I swear to God,

4
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:10.440
my grandfather fought in world war II and he wouldn't eat sushi to the day he

5
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:12.720
died. He would say that to him. He wouldn't, he wouldn't need it. You know what?

6
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.670
I'm tired of. That's just why I think it's stupid.

7
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.830
<v 1>Americans go. It was a sneak attack. They were angry about it, right.</v>

8
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.440
<v 0>That's war. But what is emperor.</v>

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.170
<v 1>Call Roosevelt and go huddle. You know, it's me, how's the family,</v>

10
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.170
by the way, when I talk it tomorrow morning, you know what I mean?

11
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.220
He wouldn't do that. You know what? That's a good point.

12
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.590
That's a really good point. Yes. Strategic. No,

13
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.320
they're sleeping in Pearl Harbor and they don't know what coming. Yeah. Now.

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.110
Yeah.

15
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.470
<v 0>You know what I mean? Yeah. Listen, babe. It was a sick attack, but it's like,</v>

16
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.870
I get, I get, one of them had to do what they had to do.

17
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.730
I get where the Japanese had to do what they had to do.

18
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:49.730
We were not treating them fairly treating them like second class citizens since

19
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:53.210
world war one. And then they came and then we stopped paying for their oil.

20
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.470
We stopped the oil. We said,

21
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.500
we're not giving you any more oil to take over China. So they said, listen,

22
00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:02.090
babe, the only way, the only way to try to blow your trip. Oh,

23
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:04.430
the Pacific feet out of the ocean. It didn't work.

24
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.390
And then the whole country got put in the microwave. What's going to happen,

25
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.840
you know, but I'm not. But what I'm saying is he messing with the boys?

26
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.180
That's what happened. That's what the boys, you woke up the boys. Yeah.

27
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.430
It's a situation. It's unfortunate that that happened.

28
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.360
But I do not blame the Japanese for doing what they did. And I also, you know,

29
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.630
war is disgusting. It's ugly and it sucks, but it's not going win.

30
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.500
<v 1>Anyway. But I, you know, but do you think it's, is it probably open for debate,</v>

31
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.130
but do you think that nuclear bombs was a little too much?

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.233
<v 0>I think the second</v>

33
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.020
[inaudible] I'll say this. I think the second one was a lot to see.

34
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:42.740
You didn't have to do the second one. And the first one is debatable. I don't,

35
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.230
I wouldn't have chose to use it, but,

36
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.370
but the other thing about the other options from the,

37
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.690
from the allies point of view, they said,

38
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.000
we're going to lose a million soldiers if we invade Tokyo.

39
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.080
So all we can just drop some nuclear juice on these people and see what happens.

40
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.360
And I don't, I don't think it was right. I don't think it was right.

41
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.000
What the United States did. I do not. Don't call it juice, but don't call it

42
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.960
[inaudible] it sounded a little bit more friendly juice here.

43
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.380
I know they kept saying they kept, well, listen, you know, Truman,

44
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.780
Truman kept saying, he kept saying that Japan, he said,

45
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:14.600
just give up your country sauce, give up. And the Japanese pride said,

46
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.580
we're not going to do it. We're not going to do it. We're not going to do it.

47
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.200
So he said, you're giving us no choice.

48
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.210
Either you give up by today and we're not,

49
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.660
and or you're going to be a bento box. And then that's what happened.

50
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.820
You know what I mean? And, and I, and I know that that's what the. Shut the up.

51
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.550
Yeah. Everyone's going to be a little traumatized. I don't mean, and I, and I'm,

52
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.850
I'm saying it's wrong. I know it's wrong, but it's like, you know, it's war,

53
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:39.680
you got to give up, you got George Washington,

54
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.430
my fascinate with George Washington, one of the best books ever at 1776,

55
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:44.510
about the start of our country.

56
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.320
They said the best thing about George Washington is what his number one quality

57
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:52.280
was, is he was able to see things as they were not as he wishes they were.

58
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.180
So he was very good at re withdrawing. And he would say,

59
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.380
when other generals would say, no,

60
00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:59.560
we have to attack them for the pride of our country. Say, no, no, no, no.

61
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.470
We're going to get smacked by these red coat cuties.

62
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.440
If we take one more step further. So you'd say we will withdraw.

63
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.210
And then he constantly did that and played that game.

64
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.120
And then we went to independence where the Japanese were saying, I want to,

65
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.000
I want to see things, as I wish though, I think we can beat them. And it's like,

66
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.210
babe, babe, you can't with the United States of America.

67
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.820
We got the boys and were charged up. Cause you did a sneak attack.

68
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.743
It sneaky Fox.

69
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.720
<v 1>The problem also is, is that they idolized emperor area too, as a sun. God.</v>

70
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.430
Right? And so when the people like Hitler, right? When people swallow that pill.

71
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.790
Yeah. And many times, you know, you guys know I'm a Trump supporter, right.

72
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.683
So don't worry.

73
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.380
<v 0>You're going to get away with, you're going to get away with it.</v>

74
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.140
Cause you got the right look. But if you're speaking our language right now.

75
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.290
Yeah. I think he's just making good choice after good choice and a cut.

76
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.500
Hollywood wants to say something different. They can say mansion right now.

77
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.330
And then it's what it is. Yeah. I was kidding. Oh yeah.

78
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.890
That was about set kit. Co-sign that? Yeah. It was just cause your brother,

79
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.300
your brother worked for the Obama. Miss Minnesota.

80
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.510
He read a little Wikipedia before I got tighter. I know him.
