00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Uh, Donald told me a funny story recently about Chappelle on the road with</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.583
Chappelle. He said,

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.750
he said they got a hotel wrong because not all the hotels got a

4
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:14.100
hotel to take a. When you're Dave Chappelle, you got to take a on the road,

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.370
just get a hotel room and go take a in there. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.480
You don't want to in the lobby. And I get it. I mean, if I was Dave, yeah.

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.360
Somebody sees you bothers you. Why you shouldn't. So I just like,

8
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.910
they pulled over for a second. He took a. Then he took a,

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.860
took a shower and came out like, yeah, bro. If Donna was here,

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.890
he would go off on me. So he just, it just in case it comes in the future.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.870
I took a booboo on the tour bus and go, boop,

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.280
boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.610
You're not Muslim. Talk about it. Yeah. So it was a whole thing.

14
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:50.570
It became a whole thing.

15
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.320
It's definitely a no-no on tour buses and it was a situation. Definitely.

16
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.710
Everybody was, it was so funny though. The whole, I mean,

17
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:02.180
you can't on the floor boss, babe. Let's say Donald Rollins was juicing.

18
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.690
This guy in Syracuse, New York was taking out a Jew.

19
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.010
He went and bought a juicer and was juicing all the leftover veggies from the

20
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.710
green room that he had in the fridge. And he was making these Jas,

21
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.620
putting them in jars. It's like, yeah, let's do this goose,

22
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.480
chugging them decent right there. That made you want to. Ooh,

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.710
two, three o'clock in the morning.

24
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.360
Cause we left direct to a Rochester after that and things had to happen.

25
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.410
You know, what am I going to do?

26
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:30.680
I'm going to ask Dave Chappelle's tour bus to stop. So I can go for me.

27
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.620
I just in my head. Cause you're going in the holiday Inn lobby.

28
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.130
You're not getting your own rooms. I mean, yeah, I'm shut up.

29
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.240
I'm going to be dancing somewhere. I was just like, Oh, it's fine.

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.850
He's going to empty the tank. And that's what they do.

31
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:47.330
And everything will be fine. Just forget about it. And uh,

32
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100
that's not what happened. I never thought about that.

33
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.900
It was a feign according to where you,

34
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.040
but that's the way you could really quantify it. Like when you're doing good,

35
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:59.030
like he's at a level where he gets a hotel room. Yeah. I mean,

36
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:01.640
you could do that now you can price line a room for like 50,

37
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:05.810
$60 and still comfortable in there. Yeah, you could. Yeah. You could do it.

38
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.660
Yeah. You could. He's not like pullover four seasons only. Right.

39
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.360
You know what I mean? It wasn't really that expensive,

40
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.140
but you princess though Prince has gone like yeah,

41
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.600
I got to take a and they're like, there's a holiday and he's going, yeah,

42
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.300
my in the holiday Inn, Dave Chappelle, chits and holiday, bring me,

43
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.410
it. Highest five-star hotel you can find.

44
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.100
And then he probably gets the suite in the five-star hotel. in there. Yeah.

45
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.800
That was walks out. That was a fun tour though. That was a fun.

46
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.830
That was a fun leg of that tour. It was. So it was the first time.
