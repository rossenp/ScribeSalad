00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 0>You can hear it in her voice. I think this woman goes wrong. By the way,</v>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.010
she meets a guy to motel.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.300
<v 1>I got 11. I stopped making you bag it up.</v>

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.600
<v 0>She got rod dog on the Ramada off the side of route 17.</v>

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.850
I think there's a Sonic down the street that she went to bananas.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.180
I think 11 and a half inches inside the body though is passed where AIDS will

7
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:22.850
get you. Anyway. Think he just hit your stomach acid. At that point,

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.330
you've gone. You've gone full abyss. Yeah, you're gone.

9
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.410
You're shooting it right into the pancreas. I'm not,

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.620
I'm not a medical professional. He will definitely not damage you.

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.490
You will not give you AIDS. You will have terrible reflux. Age is more middle.

12
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.860
That's like, no, this Dick will give you GERD

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.190
Because I couldn't attend.

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.860
And we weren't there for the marriage of our own hardcore

15
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.780
hardcore. He went straight, hardcore. We went straight. He went legit.

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.970
He went legit. Dude. Does she know about your past life?

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.470
What'd you have to do with all the gammas.

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.360
<v 1>I told you I'm straight. Now.</v>

19
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.170
I thought we was going to see Frankie Valli this weekend.

20
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.560
You remember when I met you? When I was played as secretary at a move

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.480
[inaudible].

22
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.900
<v 0>Do Oh, he's found his power.</v>

23
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.770
Cory's learned how to open doors.

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.590
<v 1>Corey. I think that Sammy Davis Jr is really talented. A what?</v>

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.020
Why don't you take me to ratios?

26
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.640
Why is it always that girl I met you with that office?

27
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.070
<v 0>All your, all your grandmas, all your office whores your office, porn slots.</v>

28
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.360
Um, big congratulations to Cory. We did.

29
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.260
We did a little something for you here at the bonfire that we always do.

30
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.760
You know what we do? Trans stripper welcome Prairie.

31
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.820
Very progressive. I hope that tripod sturdy.

32
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.360
Cause this thing is coming out flap. I'm going to tell you. We went bought.

33
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.020
We checked bottom first. Oh yeah. And it's heavy. We go bottom top.

34
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.810
So maybe like to go top bottom. I mean thick like a four Loco,

35
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.140
but one that's been half drank, like I say, nights crooked juice. Cory.

36
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.010
Congratulations on your nuptials. We got you. The honorary. Of course,

37
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.210
Jacob loves to take his bike route over to Mrs. Fields.

38
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.810
You can't get married without having a giant cookie Cory and then in, uh,

39
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.290
in Jewish writing on the Mrs. Fields, giant cookie, it says,

40
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:28.910
of course congrats.

41
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:33.500
Congrats hard Cory on finding your main Joe that's right?

42
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.130
Yeah. Your main deal, dude. If you started a band,

43
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.110
she would play drums, keyboard plays,

44
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.060
keyboard sort of and sing awkwardly.

45
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.203
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

46
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.740
<v 0>Corey, you got to break off the first piece. Come on or else it's bad.</v>

47
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.600
Jewish luck. It is we'll break. The first piece of the notch.

48
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.870
We'll look at that piece. Hardcore read, then get two pieces and then cross,

49
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.430
arms and smash it in your own face.

50
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.820
<v 1>[Inaudible] they got mad.</v>

51
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.410
<v 0>I know what you're thinking is at a tiny little groom on top of the cookie,</v>

52
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:26.160
but that was Jacob. Jacob wore a tuxedo to work.

53
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.870
That was Jacob Kerrigan is Jacob. Jacob, sit on topic. Now, Paula,

54
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.290
Paula ripcord. I don't think a love like that could be real

55
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.940
cookie for Greg fields. You sassy.

56
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.240
It's good for a little bit that you do hit a wall with it.

57
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.170
It's the first bite you the best first bite is fixed cigarettes.

58
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.150
The first poll is good. Everything else is everything's going to buy cigarettes,

59
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.320
even though you guys just know that you guys know there's no way.

60
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.250
I mean the crust is the.

61
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.860
Did you ever think you were going to be widely quoted Jacob like regularly

62
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:05.910
quoted? I would say you are the most quoted person on the bonfire, dude.

63
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.280
I swear to God for sure. For sure. For sure.

64
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.050
100% I and surprisingly whose came into second place real

65
00:04:16.051 --> 00:04:20.340
quick has been the old horny lady. She caught fire.

66
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.270
I instantly.

67
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.900
<v 1>I love, I love me.</v>

68
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.053
[inaudible].

69
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.920
<v 0>I think we've watched it once a day. Oh, I watched it at home now.</v>

70
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.140
That's not because my new TV, I can push a button and go kiss my, YouTube.

71
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.910
And it comes on. Are you sure?

72
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.720
Are you sure you wouldn't use his face as toilet paper? I just left the day.

73
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:48.660
Go in. Yeah, we got to talk to Joseph.

74
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.920
Just wouldn't even use your faces toilet paper. That's a great drop. Yeah,

75
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.560
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

76
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.590
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

77
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.810
Jacob, you are definitely the most people y'all shout at my shows constantly.

78
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.860
<v 0>Caught me. It still made me laugh when we were doing that,</v>

80
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:18.150
getting off the elevator and the father, Steve, which is what's his name?

81
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.300
The preacher from across the street. Father, Dave father, Dave go.

82
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:23.520
You're going to hell father. Dave goes, well, that sounds fun.

83
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:26.280
You're the one going to hell. You're the one father. Steve that's my father.

84
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.160
You're the one that said Jesus Christ in front of him. So,

85
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.550
so he loves Jesus Christ. That's the way you said it. Why not?

86
00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:35.850
Not the way you say, how did I say it so bad? You could smell the Jewish way.

87
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:39.810
You said it. What did I say? You went like this. Jesus Christ.

88
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.500
That's not how we talk about the son of God. Why you went like this wrong.

89
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.990
The way I said it, you go, Jesus Christ. I know he is.

90
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.470
I was given like a Jesus Christ, right? Like a nod. No, yes I was no,

91
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.130
because I was talking about something sinful. Then he went, Jesus Christ.

92
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.080
I was trying to get into your heart. No, that's not true. Yes. I was casting.

93
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.130
That's why I was aggressive. I was casting Jesus into the way. Jesus Christ.

94
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.580
<v 1>[Inaudible] you go? Jesus Christ. His father, his father stayed back.</v>

95
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.533
I've got this one.

96
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.283
[inaudible] pastor here.

97
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.660
<v 0>Now it is taking the Lord's name and date his.</v>

98
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.520
Now shout not take the name of the Lord, thy God in vain. So there you go, Jay.

99
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.103
<v 1>Me.</v>

100
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.940
<v 0>Thank you. It was in vain. What did I say? Jesus Christ.</v>

101
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.800
Because I think I was talking about a hot wouldn't that mean?

102
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.000
Like I was talking about a hot gay God in vain. Be like me going like Amish,

103
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.840
hotter than God. Yeah, you go dude. God's abs suck. Yeah, dude.

104
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.190
I have a much better body than God. A clack he's God, no one even sees him.

105
00:06:57.191 --> 00:07:00.280
Why wouldn't you be fat? Oh dude. I, if I was super in shape,

106
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.560
I would do that in the mirror. As I was posing,

107
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.350
talking about taking the Lord's name in vain. God.

108
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.010
<v 1>God this body.</v>

109
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.830
<v 0>I must be. I must be a little devil because God damned this body.</v>

110
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.810
I'm sitting with these abs.

111
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.890
<v 1>He's like gluttony, lust, pride,</v>

112
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.470
slough, Josie,

113
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.740
Chelsea. There it is.

114
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.870
<v 0>Sorry. I named my body veins. Sorry. Um, when I get super vascular,</v>

115
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:41.704
I get super.

116
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.810
<v 1>Tried to go commit the seven deadlies. Yeah,</v>

117
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:48.820
I got to go hang and bang and commit some sands.

118
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.810
[inaudible] bust out some sets in the gym.

119
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.520
<v 0>Get my Dick sucked while I curl.</v>

120
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.610
Is girl more important that there's a guy in the world who wants to do curls

121
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:12.250
while he gets his Dick sucked into me. You're looking at himself for real,

122
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.810
is that there's a girl who was into blowing a guy while he lifts weights in the

123
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:20.680
mirror. That girl needs to know that she makes my penis move in my jeans

124
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.950
when I was younger. Me and my girlfriend from right after high school.

125
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.480
Yeah. Swapped with a couple. I've told the story on here before I think.

126
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.960
And Whoa,

127
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.360
how are you doing such progressive at like 18 her friend.

128
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.210
It was very, we were, I kind of take that back because me and my buddy,

129
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.670
I was like, I'd uh, I was probably like a 19. I mean,

130
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.920
that's a pretty crazy situation.

131
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:52.570
So undeniably a wacky situation and college kid was a friend she worked with,

132
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.370
it was really, it was more of my girlfriend.

133
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.560
She was young when we got together that I think she wanted to experience

134
00:08:58.561 --> 00:08:58.930
something else.

135
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.050
That point she's probably getting that edge more because weirdly enough,

136
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:02.280
it was kind of brought to me.

137
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.500
She came with the couple in mind that her friend was a girl boyfriend who

138
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:11.850
was great because he's definitely like, he's older than us.

139
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.160
And he was definitely influencing her.

140
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.090
<v 2>That's funny that you could watch the vein run to him.</v>

141
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.190
He's just rubbing his chest. And he goes, yeah.

142
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.290
What are Jason and Ellison up to?

143
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.330
<v 0>It's really actually really funny. So we go, I go, yeah.</v>

144
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.090
She showed me the girl. And I'm like, yeah, she's really cute. I was like,

145
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.043
I'll that chick.

146
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.060
<v 2>Sure. Guys signing off on that.</v>

147
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.550
The cell is all the woman because the guys are just like, Hey, this girl,

148
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.800
you go. Yeah, what's up. But that's awesome. It's just funny.

149
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.970
<v 0>No, like what? I didn't know then it's funny. Cause we went to meet him.</v>

150
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:47.030
I hadn't been out on CD mode. Not far from my place,

151
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:51.260
but like just a CD motel next to a highway. Think there was a, he had a,

152
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.960
a van with all the trimmings, like the carpet.

153
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.630
<v 2>It was one of those things. He showed us on the side.</v>

154
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.530
<v 0>He was a, I mean now, but you know, yeah, no, but yeah.</v>

155
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.170
And he, um.

156
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.300
<v 2>He goes, how are you doing? But it was just great.</v>

157
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.980
But girlfriend tells me you're hot to try. Yeah. Well my buddy,

158
00:10:09.981 --> 00:10:13.550
Ricky runs this motel. He was all, he was smaller than me.

159
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.760
And he was like a prematurely balding guy, for sure. He was probably going to.

160
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.190
<v 0>Mid to late twenties. And we were definitely like 19 the best. And uh,</v>

161
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.670
and my chick may have been like 17 or something. You know what I mean?

162
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.380
So like we, uh, we go into this plate and the guy is so funny.

163
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.240
Cause the girl seems she was very all bad at two and into it, his chick. Yeah.

164
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.720
And I'm not even processing that. He's going to my chick. I'm like, sure.

165
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.580
I guess like whatever, I'm gonna get the out of the chicks.

166
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.340
<v 2>You were so focused on the other girl that you're like,</v>

167
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:46.070
you didn't even think of the payment. You're like, Hey, what am I? Yeah,

168
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.053
that's fine. Whatever. Yeah.

169
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.060
<v 0>Cause I'm like, when he, those situations too,</v>

170
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.700
like it's got sort of a dweeb and I wasn't like a cool kid growing up.

171
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.980
<v 2>But I was like, dude, your girl is a, it's a test of, uh,</v>

172
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.320
whatever. It was comfortable with something with her.

173
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.650
<v 0>Like I knew how she looked at me. You know what I mean?</v>

174
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.260
She was like ready to somebody else or even ask up. Yeah.

175
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.260
I just know like the way she viewed right into to never like a lack of

176
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:11.210
confidence in that. So I was like kind of whatever.

177
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.970
And then even when I saw his Dick, ultimately in his story, I was like, yeah,

178
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.090
that's fine. Whatever. But his chicken him where like, you know,

179
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:21.320
doing like that, we do this, this is great. And, and the guy was giving such the

180
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.220
rap, like the dramatic rap that's put in the vibe of like how we read our thing.

181
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:31.730
And it was like, cool, chill, couple looking, the whatever. It's the same thing.

182
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:34.430
Like when people in that world talk like that. Yeah.

183
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.980
And it's funny cause I can't separate. I can't be that.

184
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.070
It's always got to be to me with an air of like kind of silly.

185
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.410
<v 2>W I don't think silly,</v>

186
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.910
I think grounded in reality because a lot of actions, not the sillies bag yet,

187
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:47.750
but grounded in reality,

188
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.240
better way to put it grounded in reality where you're kind of like,

189
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.130
we all know what this, what the score is because someone doesn't know the score.

190
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.570
<v 0>And they go, you know, essentially</v>

191
00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.920
what the dude is laying all that on us.

192
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.990
Something about the touch of a hand, but he's doing that.

193
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:08.220
And let me tell you what I'm doing, what I'm doing. He be skeezy for

194
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.980
[inaudible] Hey, sure. He goes,

195
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.550
you know what I love the most is probably just the energy

196
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.230
transferred, the swirl. But buddy,

197
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:24.430
this guy was laying that rap out. And what's funny is like, you know,

198
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.350
my girlfriend's looking at him. Like you teach a girl,

199
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.100
he's giving like a college lecture, like, you know, her blank face.

200
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.840
And I'm laughing because I, I get what he's doing. And I'm also just going.

201
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.250
I'm like, yeah, dude, I'll your chick, man. It's like, you stop, stop talking,

202
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:44.170
man. You made the sale sale is in your office. Let's do the here's, my chick,

203
00:12:44.171 --> 00:12:48.370
whatever. And we started with our own chicks and then it was like,

204
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.790
I don't even remember. Oh, that was the funniest thing. My chick,

205
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.170
I think I'm not saying this for any masculinity purposes.

206
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.750
I think she came on me and her were great.

207
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.380
But I only say that because she didn't, she didn't, well,

208
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.150
it seemed like she did. And then, uh, in my memory it was because she on a dime,

209
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.840
like went from like, almost like, like,

210
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.740
I don't want to know if I want to like do this anymore. Really? And, uh,

211
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.820
she got diving board scared. Well, yeah, I think she came right. But I was not.

212
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.090
<v 1>Was like, this guy.</v>

213
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.800
<v 0>But by the way, this is so funny because if I would have come,</v>

214
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:28.860
I probably would have, you wouldn't want to go to video games immediately.

215
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.110
You want to get out of that situation right away. I'd be like,

216
00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:32.820
is that all the world? How CD it is?

217
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.770
Are we in a place that is silver Knight in or something it's like coming women

218
00:13:37.771 --> 00:13:40.530
don't understand coming from men is like pulling a bag off your head.

219
00:13:40.531 --> 00:13:41.364
And you're like, wow.

220
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.630
<v 1>[Inaudible] 45 minutes from my house.</v>

221
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.120
I said yes, to a Celine Dion concert.

222
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:06.060
We got matching tattoos. You go, yeah. Yeah. I'm about to it up. Oh my God.

223
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.890
I flew to Cincinnati.

224
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.880
<v 0>Buddy, but I didn't, I didn't come. So when she goes, she goes,</v>

225
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:16.470
I don't know if I want to do this anymore. And I went, uh, I mean, we're here.

226
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.890
I mean, like she ended up doing that.

227
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:24.300
Here's what's funny was you gave her what you gave Christine at the

228
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.620
drive-through and burger King. We go, how many times have you got a burger?

229
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.030
<v 1>How many times are you.</v>

230
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.200
<v 0>Going to be at the dodgy, dodgy roadside motels?</v>

231
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.760
It's going to be a parking lot in three months.

232
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.500
You're going to level this place with these two Oh, deed in it. I mean,

233
00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:43.230
we're here now. And while they're alive, let's get down.

234
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.950
So their hearts are pumping. My hard. Let's rock and roll.

235
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.040
What's funny is now you're talking about a teenager versus this guy,

236
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.120
whatever he is, he's older than me and just more. Yeah, sure.

237
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.510
We can run a car comfortable. And he was like a significantly thinner,

238
00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:59.360
like in better shape guy too. So like, uh, but again, do you think he.

239
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.590
<v 2>I'd you up similarly to how you eyed him up?</v>

240
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.570
<v 0>I think he probably wanted to my chair.</v>

241
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.530
I think he wants to any of his girlfriends friends.

242
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.770
<v 2>Oh, what a skis. He's not really the reality he was doing.</v>

243
00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:17.380
He was doing the character. That's why I don't have a problem with it.

244
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.980
<v 0>The action as much as like the, the weird, like, you know, that's like,</v>

245
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.960
we're all just spirits floating in it. Like, it was kinda like, you know,

246
00:15:25.961 --> 00:15:27.820
I want to see my GEs on other faces. Yeah.

247
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.530
<v 2>Yeah. I just can't understand why two bags of cells.</v>

248
00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.364
Can't slam

249
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.540
someone about changing sweat with a person,

250
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:42.320
which I think makes the world a better place on a horse. No,

251
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.830
Amanda kind of want to the description of that.

252
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.241
<v 0>That's the problem,</v>

253
00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:48.430
I think is the people that get too involved with it like that.

254
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.330
The description of it, like the lifestyle. Yes. The description of it.

255
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:55.720
Like that makes it to like a, a regular person. No,

256
00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:59.650
but where it's like this identity of what you are, do you know what I'm saying?

257
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:01.660
Like, and the way you think it's more,

258
00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:04.300
it's more intimate than it should be that situation.

259
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.250
<v 2>Versus like, you also have just kind of like.</v>

260
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.080
<v 0>We want to different people. And then it's like, these are different people.</v>

261
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.080
We would get them. I understand the concept of that.

262
00:16:11.081 --> 00:16:15.490
More than like the one being that self.

263
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.420
<v 2>More self-righteous in like a corny.</v>

264
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.640
When people talk like real corn,

265
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.180
it's as corny as when someone's like something about sharing.

266
00:16:25.181 --> 00:16:28.810
People just makes me want to be closer to other people as opposed to like,

267
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.580
yo dude, your girlfriend's hot as. Can we find you at like tradesies okay.

268
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.460
Do you remember? Do you remember pawns? Tracy's what's funny churches and swim.

269
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.670
I don't know. Double down on one for a little bit. I'm weird. Let's go.

270
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.900
<v 0>Christina. On one of the cruise ships, a guy came up, he was like, well,</v>

271
00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:49.450
look checking with everybody on board. Are you guys in the lifestyle?

272
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.100
And you're like, I mean, I probably done things that you'll say sure,

273
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:58.750
but like whatever this gathering is, no, we did actually try to go view it.

274
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.620
Like it was like a public thing. So it wasn't like they were gonna start there.

275
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.590
It was like a mixer thing. Right? Like swingers in the boat.

276
00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:06.850
We tried to watch them like the above.

277
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.470
<v 2>Yeah. He smoked right into it,</v>

278
00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:11.320
but it looked like it was like nobody was doing it.

279
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.050
<v 0>It was like, there's people like milling around. No, like even interactions,</v>

280
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.950
a lot of chest rubbing.

281
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.680
<v 3>I think a lot of people in that world though, it's like being in the lifestyle.</v>

282
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.950
It's like, it's almost like the thing about them as much as like,

283
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.600
you guys are comics. It's like,

284
00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:26.170
that's kind of like the thing that that's their community. I don't know.

285
00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.520
I think people, I think people.

286
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.670
<v 2>That kind of that like, are that it's their identity.</v>

287
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.190
They remind me of people that are too much into coffee.

288
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.050
You're kinda like Jay Lou, as much as the next guy,

289
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.220
I love a cup of Joe first thing in the morning, just like, like the beach.

290
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.360
I'm not going to wear a silk shirt. Cause of it. TJ.

291
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.160
<v 0>Looks like a guy who would be at lifestyle parties. Yeah. Well it's this Puerto.</v>

292
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.060
<v 2>Rican shirts look like there was no concert shirt.</v>

293
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.650
Only that even the concentrate is fine. It's a lifestyle party guy right there.

294
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.140
This is Janine. Yes. She is younger than me. He's only three years though.

295
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.810
13 years. Right?

296
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.390
There's a thing where he leads them in with their hands over their head and

297
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:10.980
spins him around. He goes,

298
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:14.790
this is Bambi is only three years younger than me.

299
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.710
Times this tasty tree Bambi.

300
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.723
She's like,

301
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.810
You may recognize her from some low level stepmother porn. He goes,

302
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.210
we can do M F FM. We can do, we can do that. My, my, my,

303
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:36.810
my math, we can do whatever you want. We brought some toys, inbox, brand new.

304
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.760
<v 1>I'm not.</v>

305
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.620
<v 2>Going to sell you a whole bunch of boiled stuff.</v>

306
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.550
It was the doodle that pushed me over. Guys. We're not boiling these things.

307
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.720
These are fresh out of the bag, tattoo needles. I'm wiping it down,

308
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.630
giving it, these are biodegradable, but still flush one at a time.

309
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.160
Okay. I get Ruby sanitary.

310
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:11.600

372
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:49.170
We finally did it on stage at the village underground where you half in the bag

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:49.830

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:54.180

375
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.150
the two guys before me, Greg comics. Great. Oh, you know,

376
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.590
I'm sure friends of the show, but they just,

377
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.780
if people were kind of eating it because you know,

378
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.570
it was somber in there and it was like nine 11. It was getting late.

379
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.820
So I just came out. I was like, I'm just going to go in.

380
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.270
And Liz had offered me hummus in the back of the room and I was just like, nah,

381
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.710
today that's the enemy's food tonight.

382
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.540
And then I just went on stage and said that and it got a laugh. And I was like,

383
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.510
okay, I can have license now to just tell this story.

384
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.480
Like I'm sitting on my stoop in Brooklyn and it's great.

385
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.120
<v 2>You know, the great thing about the underground.</v>

386
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.880
They have that unbelievable camera where you can just take a clip.

387
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:31.350
So Chris took a clip, put it up as an scream, go watch HGTV. It's hilarious.

388
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.650
I watched, you're taking a dump and you close my. At least eight times

389
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.830
you break off the stream. You go.

390
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.390
<v 0>Chris, anybody in the lifestyle ever ask you to bang their wife while you watch?</v>

391
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:42.841

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.180
it was one of those things where at one point they were all in the pool together

444
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.910
and uh, I didn't know what to do. Cause they were both drunk,

445
00:26:39.911 --> 00:26:42.700

Me and Dan went a full-blown car ride home. We weren't a full-blown.

452
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.030
We said we were bond firing live in the back seat.

453
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:07.130
Trying to make the pretty girl laugh. We were both just being two dancing apes.

454
00:27:07.131 --> 00:27:08.600
So Chris can go back and just her stuff.

You think that cigarette button I can fall downstairs and it doesn't hurt.

461
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.290
I can take a punch. I can take Dan's hardest. Punch, punch.

462
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:37.700
Can't hurt me it off. Then punch my belly. I don't care. I go home. I go, I go,

463
00:27:37.701 --> 00:27:42.020
pretty lady. Watch her jump off the roof. I landed.

464
00:27:42.021 --> 00:27:46.070
I could have been snoring in the back. He was still getting late. I dunno,

465
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:49.820
watching these two idiots and were like, yeah, you want to see?

466
00:27:49.821 --> 00:27:52.700
I can snap faster than you. I can step so much faster than you. Yeah,

467
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.050
the do we were saying that you're in the back.

468
00:27:54.051 --> 00:27:58.280
Like these are my two Dick head friends. This is dummy and dummy. She goes,

469
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.970
I mean, panties off to mile markers. They got Chris is like

470
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.560
[inaudible]. Oh, it looks, I got to go downstairs.

471
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.570
<v 4>I'm just kidding. I got my nose. Yeah.</v>

472
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.650
<v 2>It was my thumb. Whoa. It's off. Anyways. I grew up in Colorado.</v>

473
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.510
<v 0>Are you from that? Name's pretty cool. Is that of an origin story?</v>

474
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.130
<v 2>Yeah. Do you watch eczema? Like what the. Yeah, dude.</v>

475
00:28:25.131 --> 00:28:28.580
That was funny. Watching Chris, as we talked about previous on the show,

476
00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:29.480
when we got back from Vegas,

477
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.500
Chris walking into the four Korean girls where he had the four drinks,

478
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.380
we were talking about how you did the, you can't enter a pool without me.

479
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.150
<v 0>No. He says the thing. When you,</v>

480
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.980
when you have people's attention before you're close enough to really talk and

481
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.140
you got to like do a thing. And I was trying to get still detection.

482
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.430
I think I was the only one looking at you,

483
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.730
but you had four drinks walking over to these girls just to, to perfect,

484
00:28:49.731 --> 00:28:52.580
like hot Asian girls on like rafts with their asses up.

485
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.710
And you came over and you were just making the noise. You were like.

486
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.191
<v 2>There's that things.</v>

487
00:28:58.191 --> 00:29:00.020
You have to do something while you're coming into the group.

488
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.290
And we started doing it and we were all doing it like a half hour ago there. Ah.

489
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:14.780
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

490
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.600
<v 2>Did those girls care about you leaving with the French girl? No.</v>

491
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.230
<v 4>Because they wanted the Asian girl flew to New York last week.</v>

492
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.540
Anyway. So she goes, I respect your honor.

493
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.910
Little told me the truth. You're going to get. Well,

494
00:29:31.911 --> 00:29:33.380
they were all leaving that night. Right? They were.

495
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.540
<v 2>Leaving. I didn't have a lot of.</v>

496
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.670
<v 0>Talking to chicks and my shirt off.</v>

497
00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:42.040
Isn't my biggest game down there on the list. He knows me. I was doing.

498
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.700
<v 2>A little shot.</v>

499
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.180
I was always doing a shark float up to the latest where it was his neck out of

500
00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:47.550
the water. You know what I was going.

501
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.830
<v 0>Because my shirt on is right behind home surgery.</v>

502
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.900
<v 4>Verse eight, Paul versus he got in the pool with a Yankee hat on and his chain.</v>

503
00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.230
I was like, you're such a cool Jean, Shane and cigar.

504
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.500
<v 2>It definitely hung out on the side of the pool where he could put both of his</v>

505
00:30:04.501 --> 00:30:07.890
arms up. So you could show off your dad chest. And he goes, he the aid.

506
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.100
<v 0>As if annoys gods the shape of muscular chest. Yeah.</v>

507
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:16.380
<v 2>He goes, I pick up a four year old, at least three times a day. $8. Yeah.</v>

508
00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.720
It was impressive. It was also funny watching all the comics,

509
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.520
because Chrissy D brought in all the hot girls.

510
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.100
<v 0>W Dan jumped in that pool really for the group, I would say did a,</v>

511
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.380
did a solid for the group of like, cause they, we had some, uh,

512
00:30:28.381 --> 00:30:31.710
there's coyotes in the group. Yeah. You had the roses, uh.

513
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.180
<v 2>His hyena laugh from the pool where she goes, who's that? I go,</v>

514
00:30:36.181 --> 00:30:38.190
just stay down and they just don't bring up.

515
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.830
Don't bring up mod rock or anything in the late eighties.

516
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.430
<v 0>Like do your girls a heavy tinted friend and,</v>

517
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.180
and very early in the game just goes like, ah, that's so crazy.

518
00:30:51.181 --> 00:30:52.950
Where's your boyfriend is your boyfriend. You that TV show.

519
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.590
It was like something that had nothing to do with anything.

520
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.210
<v 2>We all knew that the smoking hot one was go with you.</v>

521
00:30:57.211 --> 00:31:00.180
So then everyone else was starting to smell around the big one that was.

522
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.330
<v 0>I actually observed. This was what was fun about it. I just called the anthro.</v>

523
00:31:03.331 --> 00:31:04.260
I observed this from like.

524
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.650
<v 2>Outside the circle. Yes. And so I just came in brazen and I was like,</v>

525
00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:08.370
what's your boy.

526
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.680
<v 4>I tech. Cause I was unsure to like bring these girls.</v>

527
00:31:10.681 --> 00:31:13.650
Cause I had the groups of girls and we're all at the pool and we were there.

528
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:18.270
So it was like, I texted Dan at 2:05 PM and I said,

529
00:31:18.271 --> 00:31:21.060
should I invite chicks to the pool? Or you think it's just not cool?

530
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.950
And he at two Oh six, he writes capsule like, yes, you should please. God. Yes.

531
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.720
<v 1>Oh, sorry. I wasn't keeping you left.</v>

532
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.690
[inaudible] going to do. And he was like, wait, Dan,

533
00:31:36.691 --> 00:31:39.530
I want to say what's so funny about the line, whatever the, whatever the line.

534
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.410
<v 0>You said about it was just like, if it was a thing that made sense,</v>

535
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.990
it made no sense. You were like, exactly. She goes a bunch,

536
00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:49.980
a bunch of comedians. And you were like your boyfriend,

537
00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:52.350
like comedy made no sense.

538
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.040
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. And she was in the pool and Jay's right.</v>

539
00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:58.800
Like we were sitting there and she's like, yeah,

540
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.260
she's ever going to go to like a lazy river is going to be a girls' day.

541
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:03.390
And I was like, you're hanging out with a bunch of comedians,

542
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.540
bunch of goofballs in my rise. Your boyfriend worried about that.

543
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.130
<v 1>Yeah. Thinking about all that. She was like, she goes, it's fine. It.</v>

544
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.810
<v 2>Doesn't really care. You saw the circle go.</v>

545
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.510
<v 1>Everyone, relax. They're almost like owl. I walked over to Dan and I go.</v>

546
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.320
<v 0>You can do that grenade out there for the group. And then just cut the land.</v>

547
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.260
There's no way to stop someone when you're seeing them do it.

548
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.130
And when I see the Rosa, the time-lapse photography of the clock,

549
00:32:29.131 --> 00:32:32.700
changing times of the rows of going in and I watched them do this,

550
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.060
my whole friendship with him when he lived with me, especially it's like, joke,

551
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.030
can we leave? I'm going to leave in like an hour. And then in an hour he's like,

552
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.990
Oh, just give me another half hour. I'm always like, no,

553
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:45.500
you don't understand saving that saving the time. As much as it's like, no,

554
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:47.300
you don't understand that I'm falling in love.

555
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.420
We know everything about each other. Everything is the same.

556
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.340
And then you're like, she's got a boyfriend, dude.

557
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:54.430
I think he's like even coming out at some point later or something.

558
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.000
I just think mother. He did that ad in Vegas.

559
00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:04.010
That girl was with her for, I mean, that was a good hour of genuine time.

560
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.110
And he was like, you liked that beat. I love that.

561
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.370
[inaudible] I loved how he was explaining. He was like, yeah, I'm on keto now.

562
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:18.020
But he still has. Don't say that yet. You just started a week ago.

563
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.970
Don't say results

564
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.820
on KIDO. Must've just sit down.

565
00:33:25.821 --> 00:33:28.970
And his towel wrapped around his waist and sitting on that thing. I was like,

566
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.550
if I was sitting in that thing tank top,

567
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:34.790
at least I'll never forget my t-shirt on. Right. When I got out of the pool,

568
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.440
of course on the side in my t-shirt I would leave it on the side of the pool.

569
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:43.930
If I didn't think it would get wet, that'd be way worse. Yeah. Oh yeah.

570
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.450
But when I told him what I did tell him, I go, yeah, dude, I found out Jay goes,

571
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:48.940
soda, ripped it open in the pool.

572
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.170
He rip that bandaid off in the pool and he's like,

573
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.570
he put it so much time until it. Yeah. It,

574
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.030
he was even talking to the girl that I was with. But like,

575
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:59.570
we were already like sexting for like weeks. He was like,

576
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:01.990
what's up with that chick? And I just showed pictures on my phone.

577
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.300
I was like that. And then he was like, Oh, that's cool. Oh,

578
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.300
she really loves zap.

579
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:14.110
<v 6>Funny fashion. It wouldn't be funny to just start gaffers.</v>

580
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:20.290
It's a union break right now. Uh, we look like this is transpo

581
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.163
pipe fitters that we have,

582
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.020
but maybe you stopped. We can unload your stuff.

583
00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.480
You guys look like our friends that call us gay for having a radio show.

584
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.670
We could do talk

585
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.380
[inaudible] was work on the renown. Jerry OSHA

586
00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.770
on bonfire. We went deep on Jerry. Oh,

587
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.200
that's how I think it's in every room like this. We went to go check.

588
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.430
We went to go pick a hot sheet on the

589
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.660
[inaudible]. It's like someone picking up. You're like, Oh,

590
00:35:13.661 --> 00:35:15.040
I know that girl. She's a real horror.

591
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.070
And then she goes over in French kiss is your best friend.

592
00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.123
[inaudible] nothing wrong with that.

593
00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.930
I've been trying to get into his shoulders and sliders.

kid from stand by me the minute you it.

596
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.340
It makes you look like you're probably walking out of frame.

597
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.490
You massage man of questionable sexuality. Absolutely.

598
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.550
Uh,

599
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.130
the only thing worse than you're recognized for being a fee is when you think

600
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:49.500
you are. And he doesn't know he was right there at solving the reflection.

601
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:53.100
He already took two pictures. So take that Jay

I'm sorry. It shows fine, but it's just a show. I

605
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.970
just stop the conversation. What's that? What's called Giamatti.

606
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:19.020
Like just a regular guy.

607
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.500
[inaudible] it was pants with both legs at the same time. I don't know.
