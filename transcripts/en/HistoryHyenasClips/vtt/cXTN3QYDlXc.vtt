00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.130
<v 1>We wait for humans to get to this planet.</v>

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.720
They can't go through an alien side door. They can't will it into existence.

3
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.380
You gotta go. You gotta swim through Femara to get here.

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.200
That's the only way you got to get in because when you're born,

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.110
I don't care how clean you are when you're born.

6
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.570
You have few tubes bad,

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.090
and it was normal for a woman not to return to society until six weeks after the

8
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:29.331
baby.

9
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:32.030
So she would usually miss her own baby shower because after you gave birth for

10
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.240
six weeks, you will not come outside because you were thought to beat, uh,

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.300
dirty, both physically and morally. And I agree,

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.910
you know what it is about history. Generally,

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.610
people were stupid,

14
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:47.920
stupid and mean stupid and mean they were meaning Bubbies. I mean,

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.050
history is full of knees. I mean, bulbs slow down a little bit.

16
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.710
Some of the dumbest things I've heard, like even with gender, with gender stuff,

17
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.240
can you go to that? You have the gender. Here we go.

18
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.610
Look at this until fairly recently,

19
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:03.050
people believe that a baby's gender was determined at birth. Like just add,

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.760
match the dancers coming down, the birth canal.

21
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.000
It just gave you a Dick or a push. Like you just, just throw one in there.

22
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.953
So as you,

23
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.290
and then many theories have existed regarding as to how to control the baby sex.

24
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:16.760
So women would be encouraged to stay in bed for the weeks, leading up to birth,

25
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:21.200
to improve their odds of having a boy, which is just, I mean, that's nuts to me,

26
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.360
but that's what I want. That's interesting. It's like,

27
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.040
so I always think about that because the top scientists and doctors of the day

28
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:32.510
back then with all their, with all, they had thought that this was true.

29
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.990
They also thought the earth was flat. They also thought the sun,

30
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.390
the earth was sending the universe and the sun revolved around us.

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.560
And it's like, I wonder what we think now that 200 years. And I'll be like,

32
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.950
remember when they thought that like how stupid they were and like,

33
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:48.350
so what are we? I always try to think like, what are we doing now?

34
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:52.100
That's stupid. Probably thinking that Biden's going to win the election.

35
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.080
I agree. Yeah. You're putting people on notice. And honestly,

36
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.550
I'm not too sure.

37
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.490
After looking back to the Bible and reading certain things and looking back at

38
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.750
certain paintings, I'm not sure if Mary's should have actually been named Karen,

39
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.550
Karen, you're a new day notice. It's very interesting to me, Mary and Joseph,

40
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:14.600
how the three wise men whom only one what's black, so not,

41
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.580
not very culturally diverse. One was black,

42
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.880
white and accept their gift first before the other team members of the white

43
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:20.391
patriarchy.

44
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.270
And I just want to know where that was coming from because I was thinking about

45
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:23.721
this the other day,

46
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:27.260
it's like working out and getting in shape is the gayest thing we do because

47
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:28.370
we're really only doing it.

48
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.410
So other guys think we're good looking because women don't care at all.

49
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.040
Women couldn't care at all.

50
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.800
If you have a little bit of what you can't be 400 pounds,

51
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:38.660
but if you've got like a little bit of a gut,

52
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.450
but you have a good look at face and you work hard, it's like, that's fine.

53
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:44.990
But a guy will be like, Oh, look at your. But like girls don't care. Like, yeah,

54
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:47.300
it's just the guy when royalty gave birth,

55
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.480
it was like a public event till I know it was a public event. Look, they said,

56
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.770
um, when, uh, Marie Antoinette let them eat cake famous. He said in 1788,

57
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.604
when she gave birth,

58
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.880
200 people were in attendance because now would be a good time with the world

59
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:02.020
being shut down for you want to sell some tickets for your childbirth?

60
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.220
Absolutely. And because make no mistake, she's getting the bottom of the tank.

61
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.970
What your glue? Because you're 55 years old. So she's getting the glue.

62
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:13.150
That's just at the very bottom. So make them stick. The only,

63
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.960
the thing that I'm believing in the most and hanging my hat on the most is the

64
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:20.770
power of Mrs. Papa's is uterus is going to make that baby great.

65
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.160
Cause make no mistake. You gave her the bottom of the Baldridge. I mean, for me,

66
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:26.070
going to a baby shower back in the day would have been hard.

67
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.540
Cause I don't think they invented gift cards yet because I'm just a kid.

68
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.770
I just get you a gift card or a gift card type of guy, because I'm GFC,

69
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.930
giftcard, Chrissy guys used to do. But you know,

70
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.510
that's a very guy present to give gift cards.

71
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.750
Guys used to give his presence before gift cards. I don't know.

72
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.470
I honestly have no lack of cigarettes or something. Like I literally man,

73
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.260
like I would like for like a nice, nice, nice occasion.

74
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.050
Like I'll buy my mother a thousand dollars gift card. Like I don't care.

75
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.910
I just don't try to actively dismantle the patriarchy stop using patriarchal

76
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:58.540
terms from the past. Yeah. Let's think of new stuff. Oh, the other words,

77
00:03:58.541 --> 00:03:59.710
a new word that got canceled today.

78
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.870
What was the new word that we saw that got canceled? Oh hilarious.

79
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.990
You can't say hilarious anymore. Hilarious. Toxic, hilarious. Toxic.

80
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.560
We're going to change our name to history. Her story. We're unnoticed. Yeah.
