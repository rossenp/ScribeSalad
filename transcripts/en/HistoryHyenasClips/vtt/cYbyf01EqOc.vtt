WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>So back then we were collecting, they were doing the crimes,</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.870
they got sent to jail because you could only convict the guy who did the crime,

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.930
even though I sent the guy to go see a guy in a different way.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.370
It's even different way. Yeah. Yeah. That's how we benefit. It's funny too.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.550
And also in the fear city, a documentary, I remember, um,

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.570
John was talking about something about how, when Rico, when it came on the news,

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.510
and then they, they saw that like, you know, the, this guy was convicted,

8
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.390
that guy was convicted or Castellano got convicted. He's like, you know,

9
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:28.650
we were trying to figure it out. Like,

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.840
we're a couple of Harvard graduates told me, you remember what? He said?

11
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.940
That he was like, everybody, all of a sudden, he said, all these,

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.280
all these wives guys, they went to Harvard all the time.

13
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.030
And they're telling me about this or that. I was like, that was funny too. Yeah.

14
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.610
I mean, you can just picture him going, like he talking to smuggle. I got like,

15
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.250
you know, I know you went to Harvard and all that. You went to Harvard,

16
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.790
but I mean, let's be honest if you like sucking too. Right.

17
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.090
And it's what I mean, that comes with the pack. Would you picking up a buck?

18
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.670
What is the podcast? Can we get you on any lights, podcasts,

19
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.330
and promoted a little bit here? Why not? We're going to have to do something.

20
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.380
We gotta do something. You know what? Let's, whatever his podcast name is,

21
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:04.070
let's reach out to him and say, you should change the name of the podcast.

22
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.980
Do come see me in a different way. Oh, Johnny light and gene Borello.

23
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.910
This is the guy, Jean Borello. If you look at the Vlad TV,

24
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.320
go Vlad, TV, uh, put in John, [inaudible] the pocket,

25
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.230
the bolt these guys were on. And I guess we're doing a podcast together.

26
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.380
I bet you, the podcast is fascinating. The Johnny and gene show,

27
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.220
because can we listen? Can we, can we just at least hear it?

28
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.880
We don't get to see her at a couple of minutes of it or,

29
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.000
or can you just want to see we not how funny if he turned it on,

30
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.320
he was talking about if he was talking about dining room funkshway I'm in,

31
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.100
he's like, Hey, what's up? This is John. Welcome back. The name of the podcast.

32
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.060
Studios, concrete pot. I mean, the kid is still Jack. He will hurt you. Okay,

33
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.130
wait a second. He'll crush. This kid. Who's this Democrat.

34
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.370
What the is going on here? We got to get on this guy's podcast.

35
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.210
<v 1>Did he say, Hey, I got a job for you. How did he hear?</v>

36
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.600
<v 0>This guy, this guy will hurt you or hurt you bad.</v>

37
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.750
<v 0>I mean, these guys always talk about truck loads.</v>

39
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.470
Eight a day, a day in the life of a guy who was a soldier for the mafia.

40
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.710
At some point during the day he's tall. He's going to say the word truckload,

41
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.341
truckload, dude,

42
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:23.000
the guys in the mafia ever just have to dip into a Rite aid to get some clarity

43
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.260
and take their blood pressure. Do you think these guys ever were like,

44
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.840
you know what? I know we got a job. We got to cut this guy up. But my,

45
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.720
my I'm sneezing, my sciences are crazy right now.

46
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.620
So can we just stop and get a little clarity and decongestant and maybe just no

47
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:39.050
decongestant cause the ticket just to raise my blood pressure.

48
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.690
That was the funny thing. When they, when, uh, you know,

49
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:44.240
I was listening to this other documentary where they said they were,

50
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.260
they would tap the social club of John Gotti and others before or whatever.

51
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.140
And he said, you think mobsters conversations are real interesting,

52
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.180
but a lot of the time it's it's so it's even more boring because they

53
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.800
know it or suspect they're being tapped. So the guys would talk spaghetti,

54
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.180
endlessly. The mafia started in 1920s.

55
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.560
That's when it really kicked off.

56
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.270
That's what really kicked off in the United States. I mean,

57
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.400
it was going on in Sicily for awhile. I,

58
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.980
and I think it's still relatively prevalent in Sicily.

59
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.920
I think just in the United States, you don't really get if we go,

60
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.530
can you go up a little bit? You're kind of like, yeah,

61
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.310
they're just kinda like imitation Greeks, but kinda like not the real deal.

62
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.480
You know what I mean? Like they just, we, we like, we sh we should have,

63
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.330
we shouldn't have, we did,

64
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.680
which was create logic and reason mathematics because the Italians just took all

65
00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:33.720
that and just started Robin. They just.

66
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.530
They just know a way to just kind of catch a break. I know there was a, um,

67
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.020
I forgot what it was, but now a lot of people have done it.

68
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:40.651
There was a restaurant,

69
00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:44.580
I think in little Italy that there was like a squid shortage with calamari fresh

70
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:49.380
calamari, which is a tragedy in the Italian tragedy. Calamari,

71
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.640
there was a stew at the great calamari shortage of 97. Yeah. The calamine,

72
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.210
when they ran out of one of the, one of the mafia,

73
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.120
footsoldiers found out a way because the price has gone up in, in, in,

74
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:02.280
in squared for whatever reason that he just was like,

75
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.660
he started putting pig anus and making it look like calamari and throw drones a

76
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:09.240
rumor. No, that's real throwing that in red sauce. And then that,

77
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:12.930
so now a lot of times when you go to like a not classy Italian place,

78
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.690
they'll have calamari imitation. Calamari is pig,

79
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.600
and some mafia footsoldiers guy there found out how to do that.

80
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.600
That's an example of an Italian guy. That's an Italian,

81
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.490
you got a good sense of humor. Now,

82
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.080
ex example of Italian guy screwed in and make a calamari in a different way.

83
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.590
Yeah. And then you have very smart businessmen. There was the, um,

84
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:34.580
the man Michael franchisee, who was also in fierce city, documented,

85
00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:37.530
also did a Vlad TV interview. Very, very famous guy.

86
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.600
He was like the businessman of this,

87
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:43.860
all I believe it's Michael franchisee was making something like $5 million a

88
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:47.190
month doing just business deals. And you watch him and you're like,

89
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.630
you and you listen to him. And you're like, this guy is so beyond intelligent,

90
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.410
but he'll also come out you in a different way. If, if you know, yeah,

91
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.270
here it is. Fear. Fear city is one.

92
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.540
I personally thought it's one of the best things Netflix has put out in all of

93
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:02.880
quarantine. It's great. And if you want,

94
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.110
I feel down the Sicilian mafia into one sentence,

95
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:10.380
it's basically that they say, Hey, we're here to do business.

96
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.880
We are going to do it this way.

97
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.570
And if you don't abide by what we want and how we want to do it,

98
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.460
we will see you in a different way.

99
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.760
I think anything in real estate waste management,

100
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.510
the docs in New York or New Jersey, it's all still to this day.

101
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:26.850
Somehow mafia owned somewhere.

102
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.020
Donald Trump is mov it's mafia money. That's right.

103
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.040
He didn't get those buildings from his dad. That's mafia stuff that put those.

104
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.940
There was an era where if you were doing any building in New York,

105
00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:42.480
you had to deal with concrete companies and unions and work.

106
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.130
And yet they were all in that. Um, and then, and the mafia got broken up. The,

107
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.980
the, the star of the show who really broke up mafia,

108
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.220
who had their tentacles in all these legitimate businesses.

109
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.430
And they were extorting everybody. Like you said, like with the trash guy,

110
00:05:56.431 --> 00:06:00.140
what he's doing is he's eliminating the competition. What they basically,

111
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.590
the mafia is like, that is what the mafia is,

112
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:07.280
is we'll come see you in a different way. Do business with us, give us money.

113
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.420
You can't really boil down the mafia better than that sentence will come soon.

114
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.060
A different club scene, a different way. That's the name of, so,

115
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.560
and that's going to make that a t-shirt too.

116
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:18.290
We're going to come shooting it there for them, seen a different way.

117
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.350
And then you go guess who's going to come see us in a different way for using

118
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.980
his saying and your money. Yeah.

119
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.790
We really hope you enjoyed that episode. Whatever it was about.
