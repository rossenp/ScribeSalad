00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>I haven't watched baseball. I can't get, I haven't gotten into this.</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.430
I couldn't even the Island is, I'm a big Island, just fan.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.820
They're going to probably go to the standard. The NHL has been great.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.770
I just can't for me, man. I don't know why it's just not having the fans there.

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:17.010
Everything seems like pre-season, everything seems like exhibition.

6
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:21.090
And I realized that I played sports my whole life and I it's one of those things

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.810
I'm like, do I not love sports? Cause if I can't watch it without the fans, why,

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.610
why was I even watching it to begin with?

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.940
I think I used to just do it because it's what my dad would make me do.

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.240
And now he moved to Florida and has he's on dialysis. So who knows?

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.480
He's he's unconscious half the time, but he's got a little watch it.

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.590
He's got a little bit of your money.

13
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.830
So he's got some money to play around with my dad's got some juice on the games.

14
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.020
Yeah. It's what it is. Did that guy, uh, did he force you to play sports?

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.540
He did that that's the, that was the thing.

16
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:50.360
Like my mother would always say when I was a kid, she was like, you know, Tony,

17
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.480
that he doesn't want to play. And then he'd be like, you know, my dad was like,

18
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.370
no, he does want to play it. I'm like, I really don't want to play it.

19
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:58.250
He's like, you're going to play. And then I would just play, you know,

20
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.670
basketball and baseball. And I remember once, I mean, like there was no,

21
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.340
I remember one time I got hit by a pitch. We were playing baseball.

22
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:07.220
I got hit by a pitch. It was like 11 years old. I was crying and home played.

23
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:10.940
I just want someone to comfort me and my dad just, you know, coaching the game,

24
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.390
walks out and he's like rubbing my back. You know? He's like,

25
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.930
you got to stop crying. You're embarrassing me. I'm like my back hurts.

26
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.090
I don't want to play the game. He's like, are you really going to be this,

27
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.540
the name on the back of your Jersey? You're embarrassing me. He was like,

28
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:24.470
I can not wait.

29
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.740
I cannot wait to get home because I'm going to beat the out of you.

30
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.800
And then I was just, you know, they never happened, but I was just, yeah,

31
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.750
I think for so much of my life, I just played sports because my dad,

32
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.130
you know, would just make it,

33
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.210
I don't like division two scoring record Korean.

34
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.780
I'm running score in my college and I never wanted to play the game,

35
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:48.590
but I would just still shoot a thousand jump shots every day, just play,

36
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.390
you know, baseball, basketball.

37
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.990
It was just because I wanted my dad to be proud of me. And uh, you know,

38
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.150
I guess at the end he kind of was,

39
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.280
did you look back after your playing career and be like, what the hell was that?

40
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:05.600
Or was it while you were doing it? Um, like the last six months,

41
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:08.600
did you realize, like I got to stop doing this cause this wasn't my dream.

42
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.640
I think that it's just,

43
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:14.900
we were talking about before about like addictions and stuff like that.

44
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.150
I think that it's just all I've done.

45
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:20.480
My whole life is just change addictions that I've had,

46
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:23.690
like first it was basketball and sports because my dad was like,

47
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:25.700
this is what you want to do. And I was like, I want my dad to love me.

48
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.650
I want my dad to be proud of me. I'm addicted to that.

49
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.130
Cause he left and my family was divorced and I'm like, dad,

50
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.640
this will make dad proud. A thousand jumps shots and then boom, basketball,

51
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:37.400
accolades, accolades, accolades. And then it stops and I'm like, Oh,

52
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.460
I don't want to play anymore. So then it turned to, uh,

53
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.520
getting my mother's love. Cause my mother would say,

54
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.500
I remember my mother said to me once when I was 21, she was like, you know,

55
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.320
I feel like you do everything for your father and you won't do anything for me.

56
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:48.711
She's like,

57
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:52.250
I feel like you're such a smart kid and you've never applied yourself

58
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:54.020
academically. And that's all I ever wanted. And,

59
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.730
and all you ever did was prove stuff to your dad.

60
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.050
So then I got into graduate school and got a doctorate degree and got a

61
00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:02.110
doctorate in physical therapy because I swear to God, I did it from my mother.

62
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.480
Just, just like putting my head down and doing it, doing it, doing it.

63
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.540
And then I'm doing physical therapy for a year and I said, this.

64
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.700
I don't want to do this. I want to do some for me.

65
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.130
And then I went to the golf and comedy club, open mic,

66
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.140
and then I've just been doing this ever since.

67
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.330
So I think I've just changing addictions.

68
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.140
And then eventually this'll probably Peter out and I don't know what I'll do

69
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:25.000
after this needs to do is now put pressure on you to become the greatest

70
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.110
cohost in the short time of podcasting history. Then you'll,

71
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.090
you'll you'll achieve that too. We really hope you.
