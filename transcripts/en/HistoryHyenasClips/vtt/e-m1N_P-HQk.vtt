00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 0>I was actually texting with bill when I was, uh, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:05.220
I was going through my recent problems. You know what,

3
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:09.860
when they were coming blood, no gun in the mouth. No, when he was,

4
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:11.450
he started spewing blood a little trouble, you know,

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.480
they call me Yani nuts on the show because they feel like, Oh,

6
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:16.100
I gotta put nets before. Cause I keep almost passing out. Yes, yes.

7
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.410
We'll have those nets out. November 9th grandma's seat there.

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.930
We'll put the nuts out emoji behind me in case I fall my set. Yeah. He'll beat.

9
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:26.930
Yeah. So I told pillows. I passed, you know, and comedy connection.

10
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.080
I canceled my whole weekend. I got off stage. I was doing call your wife.

11
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.490
And I was still struggling with this when I was doing a Mohican son at a comics

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.590
and I spoke to bill and it was just so nice to speak to somebody older and like,

13
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:42.980
you know, anytime he goes to these line. Yeah. I'm not lying.

14
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.800
I don't know what that is. It means you're older.

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.780
Wiser been there ahead in the career. Let's go further. Let's be clear.

16
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.110
Kip moves tickets. barely showing up bananas.

17
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.820
Yeah, I I've. I sold it out once. It hadn't been, uh, since I put down the wig,

18
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:03.050
I haven't been asked back.

19
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.830
I got asked to give money back to cops in San Francisco. That's how bad I did.

20
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.700
Oh, I got sent home. I got sent home, uh,

21
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.080
punchline Sacramento. I just gave bill come on. And

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.680
they're really impressed with my new house. I'm like, yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.690
Sunday it happening. We're going to wait to sit in your home.

24
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.170
How would you like to get on a plane right after your show? I got one of those.

25
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.700
I got demoted from headliner down to feature act. The first time I, uh,

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.700
headlined at the Trop and Vegas

27
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.790
on the check was seeing, I flew her out to see me my big headline. Oh yeah.

28
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.760
Oh yeah. But this is early on, right? Like in your,

29
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.440
where you're still in your twenties. But at that point, um, no, I was about 30.

30
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:49.070
I think when that happened, I was definitely, that was 30.

31
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.320
Whenever I feel they hit to the chest that felt like in your thirties, twenties,

32
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:56.060
you can shake them, but you'll get young running back.

33
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:58.550
You still got young legs and your thirties, that's when they start slinging.

34
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.270
Like when the lions go after that one, Buffalo, that's slowing them down.

35
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.460
That's kind of what was going on there.

36
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.260
Me and Angelo tried to do a theater with more recent Panos in Philadelphia and

37
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.610
we sold about 50 tickets and like a place that fits 700. I was there,

38
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.580
I did that. So they moved us to the bar area. Wow.

39
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.920
So we did the show at the bar area,

40
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:23.060
which I'm glad I would rather have done that than do it in the theater.

41
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.320
So they made the right move, but it hurt. It hurt stunk. It's yeah.

42
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.660
I feel like I'm going to SAC, uh,

43
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.660
Sacramento punchline this weekend and tickets are low,

44
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.110
but it's one of those things where it's like tough ticket. It's a tough,

45
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.480
and it's just like, you know what I, this is where, you know,

46
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.050
I'll work on my stuff. I'll just try to kill every hour and that's,

47
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.350
and just promote as much as I can. I mean, what can I do? You know,

48
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:47.090
make sure you have a car. Yeah.

49
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.570
I didn't have a car and I was trying to save money and I just was at the comedy

50
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:53.870
condo and there was a McDonald's right near it. It was one of those dirty,

51
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.950
McDonald's nothing worse than a dirty McDonald's and just people, uh,

52
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.610
using out there. So I was just, yeah, it was a what's third. So I actually,

53
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.100
I don't think I was that upset when they sent me home. Probably I did it.

54
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.960
I did a tour, uh, uh, you know, this is back during the, uh,

55
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.550
when Dane blew up on MySpace and all of a sudden people saw the power of social

56
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.150
media. Um, then all these agents, it was so.

57
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.250
They started trying like, well,

58
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:25.330
you got 3000 and he's got 15,000 and you got 4,000.

59
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.260
We put you all together, you know, you're going to sell out an 800 seat theater.

60
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.710
And it just didn't. It was just like, it's just like, it's like,

61
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.920
you're a country singer, you're doing death metal and you juggle,

62
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.090
like they didn't have like a through line. Right, right.

63
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:45.070
So they tried to put me Geraldo and a young Mike Birbiglia

64
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:48.190
together. And I, I should have known it was a bad idea.

65
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.410
Cause we were trying to think of a name for the tour.

66
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.260
We couldn't remember Geraldo rest his soul. He goes,

67
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.880
how about two men and a baby? And I was like, that could work. And we could,

68
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.670
we could do the poster and we actually should have done that.

69
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.440
But I forget what it was. Uh,

70
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.430
I forget what we ended up even calling it. And it just,

71
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:11.320
it just didn't work because Greg and I were similar enough

72
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.320
that we sorta had the same little fan base. Right.

73
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.070
And then Mike was way over there and it just, it just was not, you know,

74
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.460
there's gotta be a through line to the show other than this three guys talking

75
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.750
into a mic. So yeah. Yeah.

76
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.850
That's funny that they were just trying to combine your,

77
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.330
they're trying to add your numbers together. Oh yeah, no, don't do anything.

78
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.140
Don't don't build the act. Don't don't go that route. Let's get the money now,

79
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.040
burn them out and then ride the next horse. Shoot these in the head.
