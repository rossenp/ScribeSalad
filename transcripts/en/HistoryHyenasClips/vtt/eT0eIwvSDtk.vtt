1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>Well, that's also something where, uh, you know, before,</v>

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:04.710
when I've been on the show, we were talking about, uh,

3
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:07.380
the heart of everything that is about red cloud in the,

4
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:09.960
in the Western SU is the name of the book.

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.110
Maybe the book is the heart of everything that is, I wasn't getting super meta

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.760
the heart of everything. That is, is a great book about this, uh,

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.300
Sue from the Lakota nation, his chief red cloud,

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.350
and something that I love about those books is that they're like, Hey, listen,

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.400
native Americans did up. Right? Like they would gang rape.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.670
It would smash babies into rocks and. But it's like,

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.930
cause everybody was a piece of at that time. Yes, everybody was,

12
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:39.270
everyone was doing up. And he didn't like even the.

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.750
<v 1>Where you're like, well, what are the farms? They're cheap.</v>

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.860
They're gonna win something.

15
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.660
<v 0>You know, something where you're like, this is crazy. You're.</v>

16
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.171
<v 1>Doing it. It's like,</v>

17
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:49.730
you can't deny like things like slavery and beating your wife and all that.

18
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.160
All these things are bad things. But guess what?

19
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.630
African-American Africans were selling other Africans into slavery. It's just,

20
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.790
it's either somebody else does it. Or you do it to your own.

21
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:03.350
That's just how the human brain works. And like Gandhi had 12 year old wife.

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.300
<v 0>Yeah. I'm trying to tell you when anyone, when anyone tries to tell me, like,</v>

23
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.600
if I was all like, yo, I loved sincerely Louis C K. Like,

24
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.520
I love that new special. And people are like, you watch that. I'm like, yeah.

25
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.160
Do you listen to the Beatles? Cool. John Lennon beat the out of his wife. Yeah.

26
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.200
Like, are we going to play this game? Yeah.

27
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.190
I don't believe in domestic violence. I think Louie did a up thing,

28
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.970
but I think you're worse. You're supporting a monster, a monster, but it's like,

29
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.170
you're going to, you're going to be able to.

30
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 1>Can cancel everybody, dude. It's like, what do you want me to tell you at that?</v>

31
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:37.730
That's why I'm like, I go by the person I'm caring about the race, religion,

32
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:40.520
creed. It's like people make mistakes. Not everybody's all.

33
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.060
If anybody's appears to be a hundred percent perfect, stay.

34
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.160
<v 0>Away from them, man. Do not.</v>

35
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.980
<v 1>Go near the people who appear to be perfect because they're sinister.</v>

36
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.190
<v 0>One of the biggest life lessons you can have is never,</v>

37
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.120
never trust a man that doesn't have a shadow. I never trust someone.

38
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.850
That's not like I did this up. Because then you're like, what are you?

39
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:02.600
And then you find out that they have children, bones buried in their backyard,

40
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.820
dude, because it's like even Elvis was a pedophile Elvis Merrill,

41
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.900
Elvis married Priscilla when he was 24 and she was 14.

42
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.980
Wow. Look that up. That is, that is on record.

43
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.660
<v 1>So I'd love to see all these people that are like,</v>

44
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.620
I got to Graceland every year and you're like, cool. He was.

45
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.590
<v 0>Kids in that house. You know,</v>

46
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.260
they wouldn't call it Epstein land in your own.

47
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.280
<v 1>Whoa. It's just like, he also stole black music.</v>

48
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.500
The guy took black music and everyone's like, this is how you do it.

49
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.373
I know dude, people.

50
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.280
<v 0>There it is. There's him with his child bride. Oh,</v>

51
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.300
you ever have a Wolf? That's the fruit of the dork or hole.

52
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.060
Well, come on buddy. Here's the juice box. Come on Priscilla. Was she 14?

53
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.510
Or am I wrong? What she was? So that just outlook 14, you know,

54
00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:57.410
they grew them different back then. I loved it because you.

55
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.970
<v 1>Were dying in war when you were 17. Yeah. So it's like,</v>

56
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.660
but that's the thing like times just change and now times are changing so quick

57
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.160
and we have to adapt to things so quick.

58
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.850
That's something you did last week was legal. And now you do it. It's like,

59
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.010
if you, you could get canceled, you can lose your whole career.

60
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.080
Your freedom because of it. It's scary.

61
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.720
<v 0>I've said this before, but just to wrap up like the whole canceling thing,</v>

62
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.510
especially being a comedian that we are like,

63
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.920
we're just trying to be funny all the time.

64
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:26.220
And we're not necessarily thinking about how this could look retroactively,

65
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.430
but I think, um, you gotta look at it as a comedian.

66
00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:33.150
It's like we're smokers and you might get cancer. Cancer's getting canceled.

67
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.270
It's like, sometimes you can find it. Sometimes it kills you, you know?

68
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:38.850
But it's like, we're out here ripping buts. And it's like, yeah.

69
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.390
<v 1>One of us, we're all we all my catcher who knows my aunt.</v>

70
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.590
Colleen's listening to his episode. Like I liked that dance. God, really?

71
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:50.370
This guy gets it, honey. Get me another new pilot.

72
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.250
