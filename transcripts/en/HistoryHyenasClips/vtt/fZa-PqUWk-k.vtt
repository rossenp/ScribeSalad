WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>And then we got a quick squeak of the week clip because this is coming from Jake</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.120
Paul, um, who wants to fight Connor McGregor and called that his wife.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.900
It'd be nice to see Jake Paul get his head peeled.

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.750
It'd be nice to just see him get his head knocked off by Connor McGregor,

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:14.190
because I understand, you know,

6
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.550
what you gotta do when he's very rich and famous and the kids got success beyond

7
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.130
success. I mean, that's his crab, you know, Timmy D knows him.

8
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:23.310
I'm sure he's a great guy, but I mean, you know, when you do stuff like this,

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.990
it just makes the people be like, okay,

10
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.570
I hope Connor comes out and knocked your head off. Even if he is a nice guy.

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.030
Yeah. And, um, also,

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.540
also, um, uh, yeah, it's um, you know,

13
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.750
he knocked out Nate Robinson, who's like a retired basketball player.

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.380
Who's not a real boxer. Right. So yeah, it would, you know,

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.790
I understand that America entertainment's become a little bit of a freak show,

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.860
so this would be nice.

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.620
It would be a nice thing to just kind of put an end to it. Right? Like

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.590
Connor McGregor was like, really hurt him.

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
Cause that's what would happen in that is like Connor McGregor would really hurt

20
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:02.520
him. You think he might do it? Connor McGregor? Is it possible you think? No.

21
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.640
No. I mean, it's like w w w what'd you got to gain out of it. I mean,

22
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.670
there's money there, but there's money there. If he fights a real person,

23
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.520
it kind of degrades the sport a little bit. I mean, you know,

24
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.820
but the good thing about Dana white and UFC is like all the guys that have

25
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.760
wanted to do it, like boxers, Dana, White's going like, yeah, come on,

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.300
try it out. Because the truth is MMA fighters are the real fighters.

27
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.210
They're the guides like, uh,

28
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.820
whether it's a great boxer and boxing's a great sport,

29
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:31.050
but at the end of the day, fights always, you always get your hands on somebody.

30
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:34.170
And that's why the greatest fighters are always wrestlers. I mean, look,

31
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:36.630
it could be BS, maybe the greatest of all time, you know,

32
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.240
Brazilian jujitsu and wrestling is always going to win out.

33
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.380
So Connor McGregor is gonna get his paws on his kid and he's gonna, he's gonna,

34
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:46.530
what would he say? He's gonna pound his head off the pavement, you know,

35
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.130
off the gun. But this would be, he's doing specifically a boxing match.

36
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:54.990
He wants to do with Conor McGregor, not UFC. Oh, well then you, I mean,

37
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.824
you know,

38
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.810
Connor McGregor probably did the best against the best boxer ever. I mean,

39
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:04.650
Connor McGregor, he's a celebrity make no mistake, but the kid can fight.

40
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.580
And when he lost to Khabib, he was on a two year hiatus and he was drinking.

41
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.390
So any, any one around. So, I mean,

42
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.020
Connor McGregor can fight for real. Like there's no question. He's legit.

43
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.620
Let's listen as Jake, Paul clamp. I mean, yeah. Let's listen to it. I mean,

44
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.023
John is YouTube.

45
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.830
<v 1>What the is up? You Irish. Good morning. Connor McGregor.</v>

46
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.960
I know you're probably beating up old dudes in a bar right now,

47
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.360
or maybe you're jacking off because you're sick of your wife. I mean,

48
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:32.000
she's a four counter. You could do a lot better, but happy Monday,

49
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.030
my team sent you a $50 million offer this morning,

50
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.580
$50 million cash proof of funds.

51
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.360
The biggest fight offer you've ever been offered, but you're scared to fight me.

52
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.370
Connor you're duck me cause you don't want to lose to a utuber your all-in-one

53
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.810
one is a boxer. I'm two and O is a boxer.

54
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.020
I just came off the eighth biggest pay-per-view event in history.

55
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.400
But you want to fight Dustin prober who has less followers on Instagram than my

56
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.730
dog. That's a fact. And Dana white, you're a.

57
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.970
You ugly bald.

58
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.910
You said there's 0% chance of this fight happening,

59
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.620
but there's 0% chance of you getting some Connor. You're scared. Dana.

60
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.510
You're scared. Sign the contract. You idiots. Jesus Christ.

61
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.153
Irish.

62
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.560
<v 0>No, he wants to fight him. I guess, MMA. He wants to fight him MMA then. Right?</v>

63
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.490
Well, I kinda, I I'm, I'm happy that Dana white and it's kind of like,

64
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.190
it's no comparison really, but it's kind of like, you know,

65
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:31.890
I understand money is money, but Dana white and UFC don't need the money.

66
00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:32.850
It's kind of like when, you know,

67
00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:35.490
if a comedy club or theater would turn around and say,

68
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.170
I'm not just going to put somebody to do stand up unless they actually do stand

69
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:43.260
up. You know, like that's what I think, Dana Weitzman. He's like,

70
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:45.510
I'm not just going to do this to do this. Like I don't,

71
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:47.400
we don't need your money. We don't, you're not a real fighter.

72
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.330
And I really didn't like the part where he talked about his wife, man, you know,

73
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.130
but I know Connor McGregor has talked about other people's religions and stuff

74
00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:58.800
like that. So Conor McGregor's crossed the line a little bit as well,

75
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.150
but that's just stuff to people off. There's no basis in that wrong. It's just,

76
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.620
it comes off wrong. It just comes off. Like you don't talk about the guy's wife.

77
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.250
I mean, I mean, how desk, I mean, what have we become, man?

78
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.010
Like what have we become? Like that's just below the belt. I mean, you know,

79
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:15.390
I guess it's entertainment, but you know,

80
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.820
I guess nobody gives a what we have to say because we don't,

81
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.330
we're not fighting Nate Robinson. Bob is here we go. By the way,

82
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:26.130
