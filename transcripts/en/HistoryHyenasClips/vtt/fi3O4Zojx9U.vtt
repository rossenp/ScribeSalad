00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.930
<v 0>Now, since everything is nurtured, then this is an accent.</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.370
Like D you would look the way you look because that's genetic. Yeah, of course.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.400
You wouldn't have the Catholic tattoos because that's an old world.

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.240
You're going to be more of a Buddhist slash tower. If I do get a tattoo,

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.000
it's going to be like a little Chinese symbol or it's going to be like a ladder.

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.840
Yeah. That goes to like eternity and towards my heart. But make no mistake.

7
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.810
We're all kind of the same. It's that, that you grew up in Richwood.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.150
You're Ridgewood kid. That's why you say unfortunately,

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.420
but if you were from San Francisco, you'd be like, hi, you'd get on stage.

10
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.410
You go. Hi guys.

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.090
My name is Chrissy D back in I'm from a Montessori school in the middle of San

12
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.910
Francisco. Let's talk about this golden gate bridge for a second.

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.040
<v 1>It's crazy. Isn't the golden gate bridge. Amazing.</v>

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.760
<v 0>I hate when people come into a door and they say, hi, sir. It's like</v>

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.670
[inaudible]. Yeah. And

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 listen, let me tell you something. Yeah. It tells you in any big city here's gas pipe, 

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.670
Chrissy day. Yeah. If you're an N you always call gas pipe, but it's his steel 

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.503
pipe.

19
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.120
<v 0>If you're in any big city. Okay. Especially New York.</v>

21
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.610
I know we got fans from all over the world. Um, and when,

22
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:10.340
I mean all over the world, I mean, you know, the tri-state area, you know,

23
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.540
mainly just the five borrows, but, um, yeah. We're like the jerky boys. Yeah.

24
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.100
We got some British fans. We've got Australian fans. We got fans, fans, world,

25
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:25.850
all over the world, the United States of America. If you're in any big city,

26
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.790
the truth is there's so many people in this city.

27
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.930
I don't need you to be over polite in a store. I don't need you to come.

28
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.810
And like, can I help you with anything? And you're framing everything on King.

29
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.160
And he ran it. Just shut the up. If I need something, I'll find the cause.

30
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:44.900
Guess what? I wouldn't be able to survive 34 years in New York city.

31
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.740
If I didn't know if I didn't know where to go to get what I want.

32
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:53.690
I don't need you in a 10 by 10 foot store to tell me where the coffee

33
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:57.020
is. I know where the coffee is, because guess what? The science is coffee.

34
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.570
And that was steel pipe. Chris.

35
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.500
<v 1>Yeah. It's just.</v>

36
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.630
<v 0>Just the hypocrisy of people being nice.</v>

37
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.820
Like when you call someone and Verizon and like anything,

38
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.830
is there anything else I can help you with any it's like,

39
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.380
I was just on the phone with you for three and a half hours. Yeah.

40
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.110
Don't you think if there was something else I would've told you,

41
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.150
stop just being a robot and let's be real. You. Call me. Okay. I'm good.

42
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.950
You asked me for help. I'm gonna help you.

43
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.210
I'm not going to suck your Dick to try to. You know, it's like, shut up lady.

44
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.060
Just let me move around the store, please. And you know,

45
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:37.860
when anybody's sneaker stores calling [inaudible]

46
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.860
, it's like, you know what? I was going to buy something. But now the fact that you just invaded my personal space, I'm either going to not get anything. I'm going to steal something. That's what it is. Steel pipe, 

47
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.693
Chrissy.

48
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.900
<v 1>Oh, dang.</v>

49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.790
<v 0>When you go into a sneaker store and they like,</v>

50
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.540
kind of hover over your shoulder, that's the worst. That's my least favorite.

51
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.510
So he's some Indian dude,

52
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.500
because a lot of those stores are owned by Indian guys. Just say, buddy,

53
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.810
you need anything, buddy? I'm like, come on, man. Just let me do it.

54
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.010
You don't need to sell me on anything. I just hate the phoniness of everything.

55
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.450
I really hate it all. it. I hate it all. We can't.

56
00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:13.590
That's why you can't have power. We cannot do it. No,

57
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.570
I don't want, listen. I know I get rageful, but I can step back with it.

58
00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:21.990
And I'm pretty much a nice kid and I am deep down a very gay kid,

59
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.660
so I don't want to hurt anything. And I want to just, you know,

60
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.390
I want to paint and I, cause to be honest with you,

61
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.760
I just want to live in an empire where it's okay for me to,

62
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:33.570
for guys to swing around. And I could just grab a few socket if I want to. If I,

63
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:35.460
you know, whatever I want to do, want to put a finger on the button,

64
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.100
it just doesn't matter. And there's no judgment. I can just suck a Dick.

65
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.400
That's the empire I want. And I, you know what I mean?

66
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:43.920
I just want to eat sweets and listen to Whitney. That's just what I want to do.

67
00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:45.510
And also play basketball. I want, you know,

68
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.840
I do like that and talk about state capitals. That's all I want to do.

69
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.310
But the truth of the matter is make no mistake, make no mistake,

70
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:55.620
hashtag MNM, mega tech.

71
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.650
If I was given absolute power,

72
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.880
I would 100% lose it quickly and burn the empire down.

73
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.360
But out of kindness and goodness, because I would just, you know,

74
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:10.140
somebody would be able to manipulate me and tell me that, you know,

75
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:11.160
and this I should,

76
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.690
I should go alone to this other far away nation because you know,

77
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.990
they have Nutella there and they have, you know, um, um,

78
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.740
all different kinds of Puerto Rican men and women that I would think are hot and

79
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:25.620
they play Whitney Houston on repeat black and white cook is set up.

80
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.780
Every everybody's are made of black and white cookies.

81
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.320
You could chew off other people's nails, chew off other people. Yeah,

82
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.300
you can text. Do whatever you want that.

83
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.150
Just give you new thumbs every time your thumbs fall off from texting too much.

84
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.300
You can just do that. You're allowed to text and drive and do whatever you want.

85
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.780
And I would go alone. You would say the only, the only catches though,

86
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.450
you can't bring your personal bodyguard. You have to come alone.

87
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.880
And then as soon as I stepped foot off my country,

88
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.370
I would be beheaded and lose power. That's me.

89
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:55.230
So I would lose it either way now. Yonis, AKA,

90
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.420
Freddie Fetter, cheese, AKA the robo cheese, AKA, um, Katie Lang,

91
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.730
before you continue, can I just say something real quick? Yeah.

92
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.110
You got a strong jawline. Yeah. I would look at you. I'm like, yo,

93
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:09.390
you look like the cartoon American dad. Yeah,

94
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.360
but you got a strong jawline because then I got,

95
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.090
like mom, like the mom from Bobby's. No, when you got a jaw line like that,

96
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.510
but I got supersedes all the other jello you got going on. Yeah.

97
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.190
But make them steak. I do got mashed potato,

98
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.530
but I am distracted by a strong Christopher Reeves. Superman, American dad.

99
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.570
jawline. Yeah. No, that's me with absolute power.

100
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.650
Yanas Papas with absolute power. Make no mistake.

101
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.710
I know is at a very deep, personal level.

102
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.220
And listen to me when I tell you this,

103
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.240
he is inherently evil, an evil, and the only reason.

104
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.530
And he has a mean streak and the only reason he doesn't kill

105
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.460
Bighead and drink the blood of anybody that crosses him.

106
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.750
It's because his fear of imprisonment and, and, and,

107
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.020
and the only reason why he's scared of going to prison is then because he can't

108
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:04.430
read router's news sources,

109
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.610
but that's the only reason he's scared is because then he can't read blogs and

110
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.060
he can't. I think they, I love it. You called it ruder is like,

111
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.960
like it's the plumbing company, right? Or routers Reuters, Reuters.

112
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.520
Sometimes you trip over your own trash. Yeah. So,

113
00:06:18.521 --> 00:06:22.210
because he doesn't have access to the New York times and different articles and

114
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:26.380
different, um, kind of funkshway sites, he would not want to go to prison.

115
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.840
And that's the only reason why that's the only thing that would be if you told

116
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:29.550
him that, that I can,

117
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.430
you can get the New York times and you can watch CNN on repeat,

118
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:37.240
and he can jerk off to all Wolf blitzers and Anderson Cooper's, you know,

119
00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:40.870
magical points that they make. And you know, Megan Kelly, and he can,

120
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.040
if you told him that he could rub his transplants to all those liberal sites,

121
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.530
he would do it. And he would go to, and he would have no fear.

122
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:51.220
So it's a good thing that he's not allowed to watch and read those liberal sites

123
00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:55.600
in prison or else he would go. But if we gave you honest power, no matter,

124
00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.250
he would start to concoct things up in his head and he would start to,

125
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.350
if you cross him, you would be beheaded,

126
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.010
but you wouldn't even know BB headed quickly. You would be beheaded slowly,

127
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.880
depending on who you are,

128
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:10.000
you would take a piece of your service vertebrae one by one,

129
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.540
you have seven cervical vertebrae in your head that connect your head to your

130
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:18.340
neck. He would cut one out day by day. That's a good idea. Just keep you alive.

131
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.010
What he would also do is because make no mistake.

132
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.390
What he Yonis has Yonis feels that, um,

133
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.300
16 year old girls are fair play, so

134
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.110
helper, whatever. He says something so wild. He's trying to send me to prison.
