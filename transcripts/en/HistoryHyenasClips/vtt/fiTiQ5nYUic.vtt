00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>It's New York dead or no, no, it's, it's cyclical. It's going to come back new.</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.280
York's the greatest city in the world.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.010
There's a lot of things that make it great. Uh,

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.800
it's always been a city that's kind of reinvented. There's a lot of new blood.

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.910
This will be a very hard rough period. That'll push it to the brink of collapse.

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.960
The real estate prices will drop new people will come in and in three or four

7
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.321
years,

8
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.200
you'll have a bunch of young kids that come in that don't want to hear about

9
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.820
Donald Trump. They don't wanna hear about COVID.

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.970
They're gonna start doing goofy comedy and playing guitars and wearing funny

11
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:29.340
hats. And then they're, they're all going to be millionaires.

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.720
And that's just what it is.

13
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.540
And then they're gonna open up grilled cheese shops and coffee houses,

14
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:35.460
and it's just going to be like cyclical.

15
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:37.800
And you're just going to get sick of it. But for the time being,

16
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.630
you're in a desert for the time being,

17
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.470
I'm living two hours from Los Angeles in an undisclosed location,

18
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.130
the desert and, uh, and it's beautiful. I enjoy, uh, Palm Springs. Uh,

19
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.480
it is, uh, 117 degrees. It kind keeps, uh,

20
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.270
diluting down. It keeps saying it out. Yeah.

21
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.640
<v 1>We were talking. You were saying,</v>

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.660
the place you want to live right now is a place that otherwise would be

23
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.570
unconducive for humanity to reside. Yeah.

24
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.080
<v 0>I live on the surface of Mars essentially. I mean, it's red rocks all around me.</v>

25
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:08.600
The desert's hot. I have a big lizard that lives in my house.

26
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.550
<v 1>There's nothing even burned down over there.</v>

27
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.580
<v 0>Now. There's nothing in those statutes.</v>

28
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.360
<v 1>To work against. Whoever's going to protest like Chris is safe too,</v>

29
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.710
because Guido's in their natural habitat are part of nature and they will keep

30
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:24.380
the protests out of Bay Ridge. You're not getting into my house because I got,

31
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:26.450
I got Guido's everywhere on the perimeter and Bay Ridge.

32
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.890
And then I got a crazy Puerto Rican.

33
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.250
That'll put your air conditioner out the window. If you even come close to me,

34
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:34.790
if you're a woman trying to protest, right. That's what it is. That's you know,

35
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.320
it's nice. It's nice to have that.

36
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.160
It's nice to have just a nice girl around you. That'll just cut you.

37
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.840
That'll just cut a. I like that. We really hope you enjoyed that episode.

38
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:45.860

39
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:48.710
