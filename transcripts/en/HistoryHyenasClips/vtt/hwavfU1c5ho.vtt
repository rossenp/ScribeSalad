00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>But it was the craziest thing ever seen my, so when, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
my kid's mom, her father died like suddenly, so my kids' grandpa died suddenly.

3
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:09.780
Right. Really horrible thing.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.060
We go to this funeral home on fourth Avenue in Brooklyn,

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.920
and it's this old school, like Italian guy. So like my kid's mom, she asked me,

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.190
she was like, look like, can you please negotiate? Like with the funeral guy,

7
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:21.800
like she was sitting right there. And I was like, yeah, whatever, you know,

8
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:25.880
whatever you need. Cause she saw us. Yeah. The cost and this guy like so well,

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.030
you know, he's like, uh, all right. I, you know, I, sorry for your guys' loss.

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.690
He goes, listen, he goes, um, you know what what's,

11
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:35.060
what was the man who passed away? What was his political affiliation?

12
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.340
I swear to God. And I'm like, I don't know if that, you know, whatever,

13
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.410
but he was a huge Donald Trump. So, so I, so my kid's,

14
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:49.100
mom's looking at me and I'm like, you know, and then until I say, you know what,

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.710
he, he voted for Trump and he goes out, man,

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.460
that man out there voted for Donald Trump. And I said, yeah. And he goes,

17
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:57.620
listen to me. He goes, here's what we're going to do. He goes,

18
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:02.570
the cost of the funeral is 4,000. He goes right now it's 2000. I swear to God.

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.010
I swear to God. He goes, he goes, listen. He goes, here's what I want to do.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.280
Because as he died, because Trump's November of 2016,

21
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.670
this guy died January of 2017. So there weren't a lot of big Trump. Got it.

22
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.860
She's like, here's what we're going to do. He goes, we want to put,

23
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.870
I want to put, uh, uh, make America great again,

24
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:20.180
Donald Trump wreath in the casket, that's on our funeral home.

25
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.220
And my kid's mom was like, no, please don't do that. He goes,

26
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:27.200
let me put a make America great again, hat you just kept going.

27
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.480
And then she kept saying, no, she kept saying, no, dude,

28
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:32.450
when we put him in the ground, he had a make America great again,

29
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:36.920
pin on his suit. And then he starts going. He goes, yeah. He goes,

30
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.380
thank God. He goes, some people got sense. He goes,

31
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:42.560
it's unfortunate that we just have to lose a guy who voted for the right guy.

32
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.500
He goes, I had a family in here yesterday. He goes, and I'm talking to him.

33
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.230
And it's funny that he's even mentioning this while people are grieving.

34
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.530
He goes not talking to them. He goes and they just buried whoever.

35
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
That's what he said goes, they just buried whoever. And he goes,

36
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:57.860
and I asked him, who do you vote for? Or they told me, I voted for Hillary.

37
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.330
And I said, give me one good reason. Give me one good reason.

38
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:06.050
I think was not something that Anderson Cooper said. He goes,

39
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.800
give me one buck a good reason why you would vote for Hillary and why.

40
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.930
And tell me one thing that Trump hasn't done that hasn't been fantastic for

41
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:17.900
this country. Just one thing, not. Real facts.

42
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.960
Just tell me one thing Trump's done wrong in these last two months. And he said,

43
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:24.260
I told them if they could tell me what Trump did wrong,

44
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.320
I'd give them the funeral half off. And he goes, guess what?

45
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.370
They paid full price.

46
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.320
And then he just, you know,

47
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.380
and then we just buried this guy and he was just there the whole time he was

48
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:38.510
offering everybody coffee. He's like this. He was telling me he was like,

49
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:43.280
he voted for Trump. He won, he got the, um, I think her father,

50
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.140
her father did fight in the army or didn't I think he

51
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.550
did, but there was like a problem. But anyway, he still had like the full, like,

52
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.320
you know, medal of honor, you know, saxophone, American flag thing.

53
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:58.970
And I already know, and he just did that.

54
00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:01.900
I don't even know if like legally he was allowed to do that, but he just did it.

55
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.700
Cause he bought it for Trump. He was like,

56
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.610
it's an American hero one way or another. And then he goes,

57
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.650
anybody ever dies in your family? You come to Nate.
