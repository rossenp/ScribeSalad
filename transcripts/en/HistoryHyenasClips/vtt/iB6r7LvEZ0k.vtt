00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v 0>It's interesting.</v>

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.660
It's it's feels like one of those things where even just two white guys talking

3
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:07.920
about this in 2020, like we need to be in a bunker. We need to be protected.

4
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:11.130
We can't even say what we're saying. I'm just going to give them a problem.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.640
I'm going to give him my Jerry Springer, Yani long day thought of the day,

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.530
you gotta stop judging people on their person and

7
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.400
revering or hating people based on ad hominem attacks.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.540
Listen to what they say. Cherry pick what you like, create your own thing.

9
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.390
Whether they be liberal or conservative and fix it, baby,

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.780
because life is a farmer's market and you can't just leave what cookies I will

11
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:36.300
say. I will say one thing about you is even though you have one eye,

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:39.330
you always do see two sides. I see two sides with my one.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.700
I had a meeting with the producers and we say, you know what?

14
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:45.270
Because you're the Dennis Rodman of this podcast. Whatever's going,

15
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:49.290
we just got to go with the flow bed. If you shut. If you come in with naked,

16
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
we play, we do the podcast, whatever you do, we do. We don't ask questions.

17
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.850
We don't judge. If you come in with a guy and you say, this is my husband,

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.120
we go, that's his husband today guy, because if we looked at your DMS,

19
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:04.800
would you say you are the most equal opportunity DMR? Cause I,

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.053
because you're,

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.500
your DMS proves how much of a lover of all races you are.

22
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.060
I'm a lover of all races.

23
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:16.410
You will see my DMS on telling you it will not discriminate against color,

24
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.770
creed, or religion at all. As long as you got a big Dick, you're getting a deed.

25
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.600
He'll take whatever. Cause your Dick is like the statue of Liberty.

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.720
I'm going to call your Dick Ellis Island. Give me your tired, your hungry,

27
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:32.400
whatever. Cause it's what it is because you everybody. everybody cuts my hair,

28
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:34.740
carts a Nazi. My a black Panther.

29
