00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.720
<v 0>[Inaudible] now you're.</v>

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.770
<v 1>Back on the east coast.</v>

3
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:13.880
Ready to do what's right tomorrow on election day and put it in the vault.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.560
I can't bro. I got the felonies. You forget I'm I'm not.

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.290
<v 2>Voting. I'm not voting. I'm hoping. I think it's time for a dictator.</v>

6
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.170
Enough enough for letting the Russians meddle in our elections.

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.440
<v 1>It's time for us to have a dictator. So the Russians can't do that anymore.</v>

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.300
I'm ready to move on from democracy. Jesus Christ.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.060
She'd given it up to the commies already. Those were the days.

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.150
<v 2>Where your parents or your uncle or whatever, just took you to the movie.</v>

11
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:40.310
They were going. I remember my parents back then.

12
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.770
They took me to see like movies, like Jagen edge.

13
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.060
<v 1>And then I wouldn't sleep for like two, three weeks.</v>

14
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.380
It would just drag you wherever they were going. My grandfather give a.

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.460
No that ain't going to my grandfather in the, in the, in the nineties,

16
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:54.920
mid nineties, me and my cousin,

17
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.110
he would watch us during the day while our moms worked,

18
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.280
he took us to green acres mall out in Nassau county,

19
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:04.640
took us green acres mall. He took us to see don't be mad as to south central,

20
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.920
while drinking and juice in the hood and fell asleep.

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.650
And then he took us to see the movie clueless. That's what we would see.

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.640
And we saw each movie like five times in the summer, but I mean, don't be mad,

23
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.160
south central, a tricky juice in the hood. It's just, I mean, it's sex drugs.

24
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.220
And this guy would just be sleeping. Cause he didn't take his diabetes medicine.

25
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.520
And that's just what it was. And that was like being a kid. That was great.

26
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.450
Now it's like, if you did that, my grandpa would be in jail. It's, it sucks.

27
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.680
It's crazy. It's crazy. How, when I go up north,

28
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.730
I live in south Jersey when I drive north. So I gotta pee.

29
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.920
I can't put my Dick on the side of the road and I know you gotta take it for

30
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.030
pain. You gotta register as a sex offender. I know that.

31
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.100
Yeah, you got a ticket for pain and he had a registered as a sex offender.

32
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.140
So now I got to pull over three times. Every time I pick up the peanuts,

33
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.660
the last four years I lived there,

34
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.340
it wasn't until I came back to shoot the prequels for Sopranos,

35
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.560
I was here for three weeks and I really enjoyed what was happening in my life.

36
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.550
There was no that, that, uh,

37
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.810
that feeling of, I can't this not degenerate,

38
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:18.440
but that that's just not even needed. It's like, uh,

39
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.670
I don't, I don't even know what to call it. It bleeds on to you.

40
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.870
And when you're away from it, you feel it, the desperation,

41
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.310
when you're away from LA, you go, wow,

42
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.140
I've not bumped into desperate people. Well, there's an honesty here.

43
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:40.130
Like in New York, you meet a waiter. The guys are waiting,

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.880
you meet a contractor, the guy's a contractor in LA nine times out of 10,

45
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:48.350
you meet somebody that whatever job they're doing is just to buy time until they

46
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.960
become a famous movie star, whatever they want.

47
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:55.010
So everybody's sitting in their own for a long time. We're in New York.

48
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:58.310
I feel like, at least there's a sense here where it's like, Hey,

49
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.790
you are who you are. And you kind of just got to accept that. It's like,

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.130
if you're not going to make the movies, Katie, it's like,

51
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:06.700
you gotta find a way to pay the bills to rent. And too high here where LA,

52
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.790
I think they can live on this dream a little bit longer.

53
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:13.030
And also I feel like LA, it's just, it's a lot of times at the city of,

54
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.690
you know,

55
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.670
who's the most cutthroat person in your class moves out to LA to try to become

56
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:19.810
a movie star director.

57
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:24.340
And the city is full of just cutthroat people that have no roots there where New

58
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.270
York is like, you know,

59
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.930
my family's been here for over a hundred years and nobody thinks about leaving.

60
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.800
You know, even me,

61
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:33.610
I only go to LA for a few weeks and come back because I want to just try to make

62
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.970
my career and my opportunities here. I don't want to leave, you know? Um,

63
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.610
but LA it's like, you kind of just go there temporarily,

64
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:43.000
try to make it big and then come back. But that's why I think somebody like you,

65
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.550
you did what you want to do on your own terms.

66
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.000
And now you're back and you can make just as much money have just as much fame

67
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.050
as these guys in the movies,

68
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:53.470
by doing from home in New York and New Jersey and being with your daughter every

69
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.060
day, it's a beautiful life. It's uh, listen, I,

70
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.190
I'm not saying I drank the Kool-Aid, but the first three, four years,

71
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:06.180
I listened to what they were saying to me, you know, do this on stage.

72
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.150
And then one day I'm like, what am I a monkey?

73
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.190
I didn't come here to play to that song. I'm doing this my way.

74
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.210
And I changed my standup. You know,

75
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:22.080
if you talk to Rogan and he'll say that I was struggling for a long time and one

76
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:26.400
day it just hit me. It was about two, 2001 where I was like,

77
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.080
these, the Montreal comedy festival.

78
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.880
You know, them off. You're doing stand up to be funny,

79
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.530
not the, you know, I had people coming up to me going, you know,

80
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.980
you got to change your material. It's gotta be about your family.

81
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:48.510
They have to see your sick time. What sick time are you talking about?

82
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.340
I'm so sick. Tom's I'm doing dirty comedy. Nothing bothers me.

83
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:57.570
When somebody calls me a celebrity that I'd rather, you call me a fat speck.

84
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.170
You're in the right place. Don't call me a celebrity. I'm not a celebrity.

85
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:08.370
I'm a dirty comic. Who lucky died. Yeah. This,

86
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.920
every time you eat hummus, ISIS gets a dollar.

87
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.040
Just make an ice is stronger. By the way,

88
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.320
ISIS has been very quiet during the pandemic. Yeah, because,

89
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:23.780
because of the news cycle, they,

90
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.090
they're not the ISIS doesn't sell tickets right now. Only COVID sells tickets.

91
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.970
But once COVID is over, once that's over, you got ice.

92
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.500
This is going to be next up to sell the tickets.

93
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.390
I love to be a reoccurring guest on your show. And every time we come on,

94
00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:41.130
you teach me about a little bit of history. A little bit, just a little bit.

95
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.020
Tell me why Jeremy's did this. Why the Nazis did that?

96
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.610
Why the poll logs did this? Why your Chinese built all railroads?

97
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.110
I want you to teach me every time. And I promise to be a reoccurring guest.

98
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.850
If you have a lesson for me,

99
00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:00.350
every time it's getting old and I'm kind of forgetting,

100
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.070
and you guys are young guys, you got them passed the torch onto you.

101
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.540
So every time uncle Joey comes on, you give me a little history lesson.

102
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.270
That's how it is. It's about Abe Lincoln, jerking off,

103
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.860
or the emancipation proclamation, whatever Betsy, Ross,

104
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.700
you know, whatever, whatever your rush, she makes a nice flag.

105
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:22.550
That lady we would love to have you. She does.

106
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.890
Betsy Russ made the Fetzer Brunswick tonight and speak in a better,

107
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.980
I'll be in Philadelphia. And I've ever 19 to the 21st you Fox. Yeah.

108
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.110
[inaudible].
