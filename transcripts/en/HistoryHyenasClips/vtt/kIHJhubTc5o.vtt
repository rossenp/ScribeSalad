00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.250
<v 0>Christopher Paul Anthony at the Stefano. Could you get it more Italian,</v>

2
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.760
do you think? Or no. No. Uh, well, Paul,

3
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.870
my dad wanted to change my middle name from Paul because he found out that, um,

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.310
in 1984,

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.960
the number one name amongst gay men who are coming out of the closet was Paul in

6
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:24.560
the year I was born and my mother, like you you're setting them up for gay life

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.140
growing up. It was, um, yeah, it was like pre gentrification.

8
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.020
So it was kind of like where all like people now,

9
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:35.180
like in Ridgewood Bushwick area where I'm from, like,

10
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:38.840
I remember it was like a very famous pizzeria there now called Roberta's it's

11
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:42.710
famous to like the hipsters and um, in like 1997,

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.610
like that's where me and my friends, our first dead body, like we saw dead body,

13
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:51.320
like chalk old school chocked out, like dead drug overdose, like absolute,

14
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.400
like the neighborhood Bushwick was on fire for the nineties. Like,

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.850
it didn't matter if you were black, Spanish, white, Chinese, your parents,

16
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:00.830
you would never go past flushing Avenue.

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.960
And that's now where like all the gluten-free Arteezy and my mom still owns the

18
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.270
same house. I grew up in my whole life and it's like a dilapidated,

19
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:11.180
like not a nice house at all. It's like barely livable,

20
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:14.600
but she can get like millions of dollars for it because these hipsters just want

21
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.580
to live by the train. And we're like, yeah, face.

22
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.060
If you want to pay $10,000 for this one room rat hole, do it.

23
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:21.680
We'll take your money. Like a Hasidic Jewish guy.

24
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.220
The other day came and offered her like 1.5 million in cash. And she was like,

25
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:27.710
you don't know where they get their money from. I was like,

26
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.850
that's how I first got on shows. When I first started comedy,

27
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:35.210
like doing open mics, like handing out flyers for comedy clubs or bringer shows.

28
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.570
But a lot of times like comedians who have went on to do great things. Now,

29
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:40.850
when they were at a lower level, they would be like, Hey,

30
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.830
I heard you like a physical therapist, which to them,

31
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.840
they think that's like a doctor, nobody has health insurance. They were like,

32
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.280
can you look at my Dick? Like,

33
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.210
I've looked down the urethra's of so many comedians who have done so many great

34
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.580
things now it's true. Cause they're so nervous about STDs.

35
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.380
And I would tell them like, Hey, I'm not legally licensed to look at a penis.

36
00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:01.370
Like I can give you back massages or leg massage. But like, they're like, yeah,

37
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.680
but you got a doctorate degree. It's like, good enough. Like I just,

38
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.890
you gotta tell me and I'd be like, listen, I'm not qualified to tell you,

39
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:09.320
but it is herpes. I would almost say guarantee,

40
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.660
but really gay all boys Catholic schools get really, really gay.

41
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.180
As a matter of fact, my junior year of my high school,

42
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.500
I went to artificial malign high school.

43
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.410
They announced that they were going to let girls in the next year and we staged

44
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.380
a walkout. We were like, you will not let it here. We walked out. We stayed.

45
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.280
It's like a protest in the year, 2000. And be like, if you let women in here,

46
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:35.960
we're not coming in. That's how gay it got. Uh, no, the women came and we were.

47
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.340
You know, we were like, this, this is our thing, you know, like we're skies.

48
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.760
And so, but it got it got gay. And then, and then, and then, yeah, I mean,

49
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.820
but like, I think every Catholic like has that story where they're like,

50
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:50.900
you know, you know, with a priest, like in the back of the church,

51
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.250
he tells you to go up and get a certain kind of robe, blackout, um,

52
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.920
sex in public. Uh [inaudible] no,

53
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.180
no, I never, I never had sex. I've never had sex in public. I,

54
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.180
the craziest place I had sex is at a funeral and the bed in the back. Yeah.

55
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.550
Like in a bathroom, but yeah, we had texted, I had sex in a funeral.

56
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.890
A friend's father had died. So like, I it's,

57
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.460
we had been friends like all from the same neighborhood and you know,

58
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.470
she was just like, I'm so horny. I was like.

59
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.300
<v 1>Winky dank. Me too. Yeah.</v>
