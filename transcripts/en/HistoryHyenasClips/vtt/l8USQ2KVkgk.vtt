00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>Look at, look at how he looked.</v>

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.290
Let's pull up a young pick of Joe Rogan when he was in the hay heyday. I mean,

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.190
the kid was an absolute bonafide piece. Wow.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.050
Now he looks like he's got a fighter's face.

5
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.900
Like he looks like he's been a couple of years. He's got some scar tissue,

6
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:17.040
but when he was young he had hair. I mean, the kid had nice hair. Yeah.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.700
He had a nice, yeah. And now he's got to shape that, but he's got this,

8
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.990
it looks good in the shaved head.

9
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:24.590
And obviously you've got the biggest podcast in the world. Um, and, uh,

10
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.380
and yet no, but the kid listen, Joe Rogan is, I mean,

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.100
listen as successful as he is and as great as everything is, I mean,

12
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:32.030
we all got demons. I mean,

13
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.670
the kid sleeps in a sleep deprivation tank every night. I mean,

14
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.960
the kids sleep upside down like a bat. He hunts his own food. He,

15
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.210
yeah, he sleeps in a, in a, in some cryonics chamber. I mean, yeah,

16
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.570
he does DMT everyday. I mean, we're all running from something I have to beans.

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.520
And because here's an interesting thing about Rogan.

18
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.780
Once you think a lot of people know,

19
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:55.520
but then don't realize what happened in 2005 Rogan accused Carlos [inaudible] of

20
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.100
jokes, chilling, which he was. And then the 2007,

21
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:01.730
he confronted men on stage at the comedy store. And now,

22
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.970
now you associate Joe Rogan with the comedy store and it's like, he made it,

23
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:07.520
he built it and he did, but in 2007,

24
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.140
the comedy store employees sided with Carlos [inaudible] and Rogan got dropped

25
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.740
by his talent agent in Gersh. His man, I think his manager stayed with them,

26
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.330
but he got banned from the comedy store. And from 2007 to 2013,

27
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.690
wasn't allowed in the comedy store for six freaking years.

28
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:28.520
And in that timeframe, he made Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan experience JRE.

29
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.230
And the first time he came back in 2013 was to support Arusha fierce first

30
00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:33.740
special. So it's just like,

31
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700
you got to understand one thing that Joe Joe Rogan

32
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.820
is the COO is like, you know, we know this,

33
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.470
but maybe the public doesn't know is like the Johnny Carson of our time.

34
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.450
Like how you heard of Jerry Seinfeld and Ray Romano and all these committee drew

35
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:52.730
Carey because they broke on the Johnny Carson show.

36
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.480
That's what Joe Rogan was for Archie fear and Tom cigar and Burke Chrysler and

37
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:00.350
Theo Von. They broke on the Joe Rogan show. So they went on, were amazing,

38
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:04.550
funny, talented. And then boom, you hear about them, Tim Dylan, Dylan,

39
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.460
Andrew Schultz. I mean, all these guys work hard and have amazing things.

40
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.941
But funny,

41
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:11.960
the thing that got them to Rogan was there things that we're doing before

42
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.370
talented and work ethic and all that,

43
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.750
but then the major platform to give them the success they have much like Carson

44
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.840
is, is, is, uh, is Joe Rogan. So it's, uh,

45
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.370
we just like many things in our career with Mr. Boda, get that's what it is.

46
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.210
That's and that's why it's extremely important for us as comedians to have

47
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.300
someone like Joe Rogan, because like Jada's mentioned,

48
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:35.330
the gatekeepers are used to be people who were gatekeepers to get you into this

49
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:37.880
festival, get you on this TV network and do this. And they could,

50
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.030
they held your career in their hands, but they weren't comedians.

51
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.210
Joe Rogan now being a gatekeeper who is a comedian.

52
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.960
And it's kind of like real recognizes real if you're talented and you're good.

53
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:50.660
And he respects you, he gives you an opportunity by just saying,

54
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.120
come on my show. And then, you know, you listen to the episodes,

55
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:56.450
especially with comedians, he lets the comedians talk and showcase their skills.

56
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:59.500
He doesn't try to get the last word and, or he knows what it is.

57
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.160
He's become the platform in his own way. So he's very, you know,

58
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.920
we're all appreciative that even if you know, we never, honestly,

59
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.100
I never been on a show. We hope to someday, but even that we have it, it's like,

60
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.510
it's just amazing to see, to know that there's, if, if, if a network,

61
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.850
a TV network or somebody wants to say,

62
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.160
nobody can cancel you or take your career away.

63
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.020
As long as you got Joe Rogan and his show.

64
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.330
<v 1>Behind you. Yeah. I mean,</v>

65
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.660
his career has been interesting because he didn't at the beginning,

66
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.080
supposedly he didn't even want to, he didn't see himself becoming a comedian.

67
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.750
He saw, he thought he was going to become like a kickboxing.

68
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.390
<v 0>Instructor. He stopped fighting.</v>

69
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.130
<v 1>Um, around age 21 or whatever dropped out of college. Um,</v>

70
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.960
he saw his big inspiration was he saw Richard Pryor

71
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.180
special and he was blown away by how funny he was.

72
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.070
And that's what made him want to become a comedian. He started comedy in 1988.

73
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.430
Yeah. 1980 around for a long time. I mean, yeah.

74
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.970
<v 0>And the kid moves tickets, but I mean, when you look at him now, he's still,</v>

75
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.820
they're both handsome, but they're two different types of handsome. Yeah.

76
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.610
One is like a little more pretty boyish.

77
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.670
And this is the kid who just looks like he will,

78
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.830
he will go outside and kill the bear. That's in your lawn either way.

79
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:15.460
He's going to get softly kissed on his lips will get softer kissing his butt

80
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.610
cheeks if we ever get on that show, because if he gets too agro with us,

81
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:19.810
we will deescalate him.

82
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.330
Deescalate 10 allows puppet Sergeant knuckles with sharp,

83
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.300
and I will jerk off Joe Rogan live on the show and his producer,

84
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:26.620
Jamie toolkit jumped off.

85
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.870
