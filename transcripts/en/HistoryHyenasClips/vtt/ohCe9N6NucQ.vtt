<v 0>The more recent story is Jessica Cruz who? This funniest one.</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.820
This is the funniest one. I mean, if we're going to measure them on funny. Yeah.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.930
Rachel dozer was the funniest. Yeah. But now Jessica Kruger,

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.930
if they went out on the road, Jessica Kruger would headline and Rachel dogs,

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.930
I would feature Jessica crew weld. Well, if they went on the road, yeah.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.970
Jessica crew headline, Rachel dolls, all featured,

7
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.590
but the Oprah would be Jessica Cruz.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.180
Alter-ego Jessica [inaudible] Jessica LA boom,

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.690
by boom, by Lana. So Jessica Kruger,

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.290
who's a white woman born and raised in Kansas city,

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.650
Jewish white woman from the suburbs of Kansas city. Yeah.

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.330
She took on the alter ego of Jessica [inaudible] Lana and

13
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:47.250
posed as a African Afro Caribbean woman and actually

14
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.210
used it to get jobs and was a tenured professor at George Washington university

15
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.750
for like 15 years, teaching studies,

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.670
African-American studies and complaining about how white people are ruining

17
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:04.440
this country. When she in fact was a white woman ruining this country.

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.320
I mean, it's really great. Can we play a little clip,

19
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.190
please play that clip talking at the city council because on the zoom meeting.

20
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.780
Yeah. I mean, now is this so, so, uh, psychopathy to use she's associate path.

21
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.040
It's how can you just lock plate side? It's being it's psychopath.

22
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.100
It's being a sociopath. It's it's uh, you know,

23
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.000
not being able to be okay with the conditions of your life.

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.110
It's wanting to be a victim. It's entitlement. It's insecurity. Here we go.

25
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.080
Here we go. You think this is more Risa Rodriguez. Y'all be honest.

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.033
His comedy videos.

27
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.350
<v 1>Yeah. I'm just up on Barletta. I'm here in the Barrio is Thailand. Uh,</v>

28
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.750
you probably know this neighborhood cause those are kinda Melissa.

29
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440
<v 0>I just wanted to make sure the viewer, the listener understands right now,</v>

30
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:50.000
our fans are saying that this is a white woman from Kansas city who has not yet

31
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.940
come out publicly and said, she is in fact, the Whiteman from Kansas city.

32
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.320
She's still playing this charade and she's still playing this race card,

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.520
which I genuinely believe at this point because of the things that are happening

34
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.280
in our country, she needs to be brought up on federal charges.

35
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.910
There needs to be a charge. You cannot do this. Now I disagree.

36
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.960
She got away with this for like three, four bucks, 13 years.

37
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.460
She made a whole career out of it.

38
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:15.860
She's a professor at George Washington university,

39
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.490
very prestigious university with a very prestigious job. She's been able to,

40
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.640
if there should be a rule, if you get away with it for 10 years,

41
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.110
you've passed the test. You, you, you you've achieved something. Fair enough.

42
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.770
And you become black. Fair enough. Get your car where they say, you know what?

43
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.190
Good on you. You fooled us for 10 years. You win. Fair enough yet.

44
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:34.881
It's almost like, yeah.

45
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:37.850
If you're like cheating on your wife for like 10 years and you don't get caught,

46
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:39.560
you have another family after the 10th year. It's like,

47
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:42.350
you have to just now everybody's just gotta be okay with it.

48
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.390
There's nothing anybody can do. I want,

49
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.190
there's gotta be a statute of limitations on how long you can be canceled.

50
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.470
If you can. If you got away with something for 10, 20 years,

51
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.070
you can't cancel somebody. You have to tip your hat to them. Tip your hand.

52
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.450
If you say good job,

53
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.010
Jessica [inaudible], we should have to her Jessica boom ball era

54
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.843
, which is the funniest name. You think she was just sitting there going like in her brain.

55
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.990
Do you think she talks like that to herself in her brain or her brain sounds

56
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.390
more and more like, yeah. Cause she's a Jewish girl.

57
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.360
She's like a Jewish girl from long Island from Kansas city.

58
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.900
So do her thoughts sound like this or in her own head?

59
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.430
Does she change it and say, listen,

60
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.570
these white here are not yielding their time to me.

61
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.530
Cause they gentrified my neighborhood and I'm just [inaudible] and I won't have

62
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.440
any time for these white devils coming in my neighborhood.

63
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.500
Cause I'm an unrepentant childhood hood dot fat.

64
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.030
That's how she does a hundred percent, hundred percent. Your thoughts?

65
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.600
Sound like this. Hi. Hi Christie. What are we going to do today?

66
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.160
We're going to wake up this morning.

67
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.470
We're going to get ourselves to black and white. Cause we've been good,

68
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.560
but we're going to be a little naughty because we can reward ourselves for

69
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.680
working out with Anthony. God did Anthony look at this morning?

70
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.713
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.420
<v 0>Is that how you're that's it. But then they come out like I'm Kristy. I'm a guy,</v>

72
00:03:57.421 --> 00:03:59.790
but in your brain. Yeah. What is your,

73
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.720
what is the voice in your head sound like when I wake up truly, when I wake up,

74
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.760
when am I eyes open? And when I'm in bed,

75
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.450
I'm waking up my body and brain wakes up. I think I'm a woman.

76
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.160
It's not till my feet hit the floor.

77
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.520
And do I hear the creaks of the floor and realize how much weight uncaring do I

78
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.480
remember? I'm a man. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because when the feet hit the floor,

79
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.640
they're shaped like a high heel. Yeah.

80
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.030
So you're still a woman until you stand up and you carry all that weight. Yeah.

81
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.060
And then I just see my penis and then one day I just, you have body dysmorphia.

82
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:30.180
When you look in the, uh, what is that? Gender dysphoria, gender? This morphine.

83
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.220
It must be weird to have the soul of a woman and then see a very ma you have a

84
00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:38.970
man. We had, I know it's tough. Your head looks like it's a helmet.

85
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.620
It was almost like if I, my face and I put on a helmet, right? Like it's like,

86
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:46.380
you have a natural helmet. You've got a big protruding male brow.

87
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.880
You look like a real guy's guy. And then you come out and you're just your soul.

88
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.270
It's like, yeah,

89
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.380
you're a man. You w you walk, you present as a man,

90
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.550
but your soul is 100% Whitney Houston. He used to baby. I come, I love it.

91
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:07.260
I'm alive. Yeah. No, I it's just what it is. Yeah. I, I am.

92
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.600
I'm not a hundred percent, but I would say 70% sure that if I make it to 50,

93
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:17.320
the last 50, I will, I will try to go as a woman. Now, if it's to feel,

94
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.100
if you bend out Jessica [inaudible] right.

95
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.400
And you found out she was Jessica Krug,

96
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.800
would you get less attracted to her? Less attractive, more attracted? Yeah. Her,

97
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.810
Jessica LA Bloomberg. And I went to no strings. I mean,

98
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:35.580
she's going to get the construction book. She's going to get one off the face.

99
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.450
Now, if you want to know what the construction put me into, just like a picture,

100
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.980
somebody who's just been painting all day, what their boot looks like. Yeah.

101
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.420
It's a lot of white stuff all over it. All right. So let's, let's let's see,

102
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:48.270
are those boomers, she kind of looked like a piece as well. My nails,

103
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:51.150
she looks like a Pittsburgh dozer also was kind of like a piece,

104
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:55.350
but here she is here. She just looks like a fat. You don't like lesbian. Yeah.

105
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.250
So here's, here's Jessica Love Bumble. It be the reader.

106
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.080
<v 1>Who used to be the speaker, your city council.</v>

107
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.260
So my neighborhood to developers and gentrifiers.

108
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.090
So I got a couple of things to say.

109
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:08.600
And when y'all come on and tell me my time stops, outta here.

110
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.920
It's been seven hours.

111
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.490
Not only did I have to listen to these cops and not just the cops,

112
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.910
but to be honest, the council members you pose on,

113
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.300
like you opposing them for your soundbites, for your social media,

114
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:22.850
for your via election campaigns. out of here.

115
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:26.630
You've been supporting the cops in the pandemic when the MTA was strapped and

116
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:29.360
you supported putting more cops on the MTA, outta here.

117
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:31.970
We know where you're coming from. And we know what these little,

118
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.270
I also want to call out all these four hours.

119
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.610
<v 0>You know, a lot of it is you can get away with this amount of in that world,</v>

120
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.390
because let's just be honest. Most of that world is. I mean,

121
00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:49.660
you go to study like here's where you're taking a class on jet,

122
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.190
whatever it's all or math and science and history. What happened?

123
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.200
It's what it is. This whole like activist version of academics. It's all.

124
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.910
You could come in and say anything.

125
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.440
It's like this whole field or culture of,

126
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.970
of, of liberal arts through the lens of like

127
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.490
victimization comes with a certain amount of. Because humans are,

128
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.690
no matter what color they are. And they're also great,

129
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.950
no matter what color they are.

130
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.020
So this is actually more racist than anyone who's walking down the

131
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:29.530
street, who's going. You know what? We got to get rid of this shirt, neck, neck,

132
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.830
or whatever the they're saying, because you know what I mean?

133
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.970
At least that person, you know who they are and you know, okay,

134
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.680
they're small minded. Whereas this is an actual vulture.

135
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:44.530
She's like a leech. She's saying I'm against gentrification.

136
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.960
She is the gentrifier Boca.

137
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.620
But why to Jessica crew Krug Krugie lumberman air.

138
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.670
Why did she come out and say she got outed by a, I was going to say,

139
00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:56.500
so it's not like it was on her own accord.

140
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:58.780
Like she had this existential crisis inside of her.

141
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.030
Something was about to go down. And she said, let me,

142
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.110
let me M and M she came clean and she M and M that Reggie eight mile debt by

143
00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:07.510
coming out to try to get ahead of it and just admit everything.

144
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.650
Cause it was about to come out.

145
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.360
She had been found out she was a Jewish woman from the suburbs of Kansas city.

146
00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:15.910
Went to private school. She's been estranged from her family.

147
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:19.240
She even skipped her own mother's funeral because she felt like that would

148
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:23.050
expose her because her mother's white brothers, white she's white.

149
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.460
So it was a Latin student, an Afro Caribbean,

150
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:31.810
Latin student who started to question her when they started to actually talk

151
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:36.480
about this prominent, um, Hispanic writer who, uh,

152
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.480
he, uh, this Cuban, uh, Afro Cuban writer,

153
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.270
or she didn't know who they knew, who, uh,

154
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.430
a member of history in these fields or whatever.

155
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.970
And it turned out that they found out, in retrospect, he was lying.

156
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.340
He wasn't Afro-Cuban.

157
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.710
So he was lied to pass in this world of like, Hey, what's up? You know,

158
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.210
we're trying to the white devils. Wow. So a student uncover this dude.

159
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.750
It was about to uncover mint. And she came clean in media. What actually,

160
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.940
can we read the stuff like, well, yeah, that's what happened.

161
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.640
So the student was about to catch her. So she came out, she said,

162
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:10.380
I'm not a culture vulture. I'm a culture leach.

163
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.380
I'm from a great part of my adult life. I've been living a lie.

164
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.730
She's been lying. And the best thing is, is like, she goes hard.

165
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.600
She attacks white people. Constantly. One of her neighbors was a white woman.

166
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.970
Always said like, this is the problem with y'all. She's a smart kid.

167
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.540
She's got a PhD from the university of Wisconsin. Got a PhD in this,

168
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.450
to be honest, what the is sociology? Gender studies. It's.

169
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:39.480
You got a PhD. I'm not calling anyone. Who's got a PhD in sociology.

170
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:43.170
A doctor. We need to stop that. Let's just call it something else.

171
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:48.060
What can we call it? You got a PhD in. So it's a PHB. Yeah.

172
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.890
You're a something. Something posts. What is it? Post humeral. Doctorate.

173
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:56.460
Post general. Yeah. I mean, you're a doctorate, but let's,

174
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.110
you're closer to a doctorate.

175
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.660
Then these people who have a doctorate in medical field,

176
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.290
cause at least you can put your hands on my balls and tell me if I got cancer

177
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.660
and I need to ask you again, can we do it after the episode?

178
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.690
Are you having some problems? No, but you're a guy. Here's the thing.

179
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.030
You're a guy. When you touch another man,

180
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.610
you know how to separate do it medically. Yeah.

181
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.730
Cause you've touched my back a few times and I didn't feel weird.

182
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.320
I didn't feel like gay about it.

183
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.700
You know how to just put that aside and handle someone physically medically his

184
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.860
cosmic don't mistake. After I did that to you,

185
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:29.580
I went home and I hit my pocket. hard.

186
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.370
Yeah, because you're a doctor. You're a doctor. You're a doctor, Dr.

187
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:41.720
Rabbit doctorates. So, so this lady, Jessica Cruz, Jessica boom,

188
00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:46.640
by the Adda much like Clarence King for whatever Clarence King decided to do it

189
00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:49.790
for love. She decided to do it to be a victim and to get involved,

190
00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:53.570
to get ahead in life. I think she should beat. There should be.

191
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.210
There is a crime here though. I understand the 10 year rule,

192
00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:58.400
which I'm willing to give you a pass on this,

193
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.440
but there should be some crime here that needs to be kind of brought up. But no,

194
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:08.300
it's the same thing as like, uh, the long Island medium or John Edward,

195
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:11.090
what was his name? John. Like, you want to believe the. I mean,

196
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:15.170
if you want to believe it's a good point. If you're there. I mean, it's like,

197
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.180
well, you're going to put up the long Island medium on charges.

198
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.890
Cause she's pretending to speak to Larry. I mean, if, if yeah, if you,

199
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.940
my mom's been talking with dog sidekick, try to get in touch with Larry.

200
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.870
She's saying he's not there yet. I'm going to pass out.

201
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.100
Cause I got COVID Tucson, extra lightheaded,

202
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.660
