00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.050
<v 1>Hey, what's up everybody. Chrissy histories here. I'm today.</v>

3
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.560
I want to talk about the American revolutionary war and how it didn't start out

4
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.690
as a war for freedom against the English.

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.970
And it was kind of a revolutionary war,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.490
a civil war and a world war all-in-one queue.

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.460
So it all starts with the French and Indian war,

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.930
which was like 20 years before that.

9
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:31.730
And that had the French and Indians or native Americans, indigenous people,

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.230
French and Indians verse, the British and her loyal subjects, the Americans.

11
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:38.210
So how wild is that? Initially?

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.330
We're on the British side and the French and Indian war fighting against the

13
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:43.910
French who during the revolutionary war are going to come to our side.

14
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.620
Doesn't matter, war stupid, but French and Indian war.

15
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.890
We went them Americans and the British. We win that war.

16
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:54.160
George Washington himself was a Colonel in the,

17
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.410
in the British army during the French and Indian war and help them win the war.

18
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.500
So it's just all wild. The foreshadowing was like, Oh, bananas.

19
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.270
But we fight that war for them. As the 13 colonies, we fight them.

20
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.291
And, uh,

21
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.770
we helped the British win and retain her colonies and all this stuff that was

22
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.110
going on in the French and Indian war that's for another day,

23
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.190
but we help them win, but Wars cost money, right? So England is like, yo,

24
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:18.560
we have no money because I need to win a war. Especially is like,

25
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.660
who's going to spend the most money. That's usually what war is,

26
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:25.460
who spends the most money. So we win and Britain says,

27
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:27.670
okay, now we don't have any money. So what do they do?

28
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.170
They're like let's tax the people that helped us win the war.

29
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.530
Let's tax our loyal subjects to 13 colonies. And we're like, why though?

30
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.540
We just, we die for you. And when blood for you,

31
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.570
and now we have to pay more money for stamps. So the stamp act of 17,

32
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.510
seven of 17, 65 was like an F to us. I'm like,

33
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.530
we just helped you win the war WTF. But anyway, it starts to cause issues.

34
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.330
So the first kind of ideas of a war against England,

35
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:53.990
start with that. It starts with taxation without representation. We're saying,

36
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:57.080
Hey, you're going to tax us on stamps and teas and all these other goods,

37
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.830
but not let us be represented in parliament in London. Like what gives.

38
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.560
So it starts to get, we start to get off. And then we start to say,

39
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:06.170
we're not going to pay for the stamps. We're burning things down.

40
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.640
We start to F with the British soldiers on, you know, in New York and Boston,

41
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:12.440
the Boston massacre, the Boston tea party.

42
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.310
And it starts to people off King George. The third was like, why are these guys,

43
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:21.020
man? It's like, are you stupid? And kind of was so we're like, listen, um,

44
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.570
we're going to fight. We're going to start fighting you.

45
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.360
We're going to start fighting with 1775, but it's not about freedom.

46
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:27.380
We don't want to be free from you.

47
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.040
We're fighting you because we want to have legal representation in parliament.

48
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.960
If you're going to tax us for teas and stamps and all that other.

49
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.940
So we start to fight. We'll start getting our asses handed to us span. I mean,

50
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:42.860
we're losing Britain at that time was the biggest fiercest fighting force fierce

51
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.430
in the whole world. So we're getting our asses handed to us. I mean,

52
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.750
we're the 13 colonies. We're not the mighty United States.

53
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.780
There were just 13 colonies. So we don't even have shoes. I mean,

54
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:53.300
we're farmers with pitchforks trying to pick up muskets.

55
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:54.320
We barely know how to use,

56
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.110
to fight the most formidable fighting force in the world at the time.

57
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.920
So we're getting our handed to us. And then towards, you know,

58
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.050
the spring of 1776,

59
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.600
the soldiers are like putting their guns down on the American side.

60
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.940
And George Washington is like, Hey, we need to fight. And we're like, no,

61
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.900
they're like, yo, you got fight, bro. Like my farm is being rammed sack,

62
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.600
who knows what happened to my wife and kids. Everybody's dying.

63
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.470
I got no shoes on my feet are bleeding and we're losing this fricking war.

64
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.050
So the founding fathers at the time come up with an idea.

65
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.990
That's where the American ingenuity. I mean, it's just, it's great.

66
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.700
They come up with an idea and they say George Washington and Ben Franklin and

67
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:30.280
Thomas Jefferson and Alex Hamilton wax center,

68
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.960
Hamilton wasn't even a big deal yet. He was still,

69
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.700
he was just a regular soldier, but you know,

70
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.400
he still probably had something to do with it because I mean the play Hamilton,

71
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.570
but they start to say, okay,

72
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.770
how can we get the soldiers to stay and not put down their guns? I got it.

73
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.790
Independence.

74
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.020
Let's come up with the idea of independence from England.

75
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:51.360
Not just taxation without representation. That's minor.

76
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.900
Let's go major declaration of independence. So they get Thomas Paine.

77
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.090
It's great. This pamphlet called common sense here.

78
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.630
Thomas Paine was a great orator. He could, Thomas Paine was like, uh,

79
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.990
he could just sling lyrics. He was like the Kanye West of the time.

80
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.490
He could just get people to move.

81
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:07.770
He was slang in these lyrics doing a great job.

82
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.990
So Thomas Paine comes up with common sense and the pamphlet goes through the 13

83
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:17.970
colonies saying, we need freedom from this mighty tyranny government of Britain.

84
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.420
And so it starts to ignite the colonists, right? The colonists say, yes,

85
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.090
we're going to, we're going to get back in. We're going to the army.

86
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:27.570
Start to triple and quadruple after common sense.

87
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:32.430
Cause like freedom from England. So as the years go on, I mean we,

88
00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:34.680
yeah, we're doing okay, but you know, cause we got more soldiers,

89
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:38.640
but we're still getting our asses handed to us until the battle of Saratoga in

90
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:41.640
the battle of Saratoga, which is widely known as the turning point of the war,

91
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:46.470
we get a real nice decisive victory against the British and that makes France

92
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.810
Britain's mortal enemy on the sideline.

93
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.890
Even know we fought against them 20 years ago in the French and Indian war.

94
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.070
It makes France say, you know what? I kind of like these little colonists.

95
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.600
So we're going to join.

96
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.770
And France sends pretty much their entire army and Spain also Britain's mortal

97
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:05.580
enemy sends money. So Spain sending money on the wall. They're like,

98
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:06.930
you know what? We're not going to spend on soldiers,

99
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.350
but we're going to send you guys some casts. So they started wearing from Flint.

100
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.820
So they send, they send money. France sends their army,

101
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:17.190
which Frances unbelievable fighting force to.

102
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.500
You got to understand at that time in the 17 hundreds,

103
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:21.720
we didn't even have a Navy. The Americans did not have a Navy.

104
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.450
Britain has the most powerful Navy in the whole world.

105
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:27.810
So France sends their Navy, which is like, thank you.

106
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.950
So we start to fight them. And then the war, the tide of the war starts to turn.

107
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.070
So it's also a civil war though, as I mentioned,

108
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:39.840
because a lot of people were called loyalists back then and they were

109
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:41.040
loyal to the British crown.

110
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:45.180
They did not want to necessarily fight against England because they were like,

111
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:46.830
yo, they, England was really that bad to us.

112
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:50.190
So you had a lot of people in their own families. You would have one brother,

113
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.370
a revolutionary war, soldier fighting with the 13 colonies and the,

114
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:56.880
and the continental army and the other brother loyalists putting on a red,

115
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.030
a dirty red coat and fighting with the British enemy.

116
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.250
So it's like a civil war and you're like, bro, what the?

117
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.650
So we start winning as the F once the F once France joins, we start winning,

118
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.210
right? And we all know, by the way, we almost,

119
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.120
there's so many times during this revolution where we really almost lost.

120
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.720
I mean, thank God for the weather, Jesus Christ himself. I know for fact,

121
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:16.460
he's an American kid and he bleeds red, white,

122
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:20.450
and blue because the war was almost all about loss at the battle of Brooklyn in

123
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:24.920
August of 1776, because we had our whole army pin,

124
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.770
George Washington, and we had the army pan and we're like, yo, bro,

125
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.060
we're going to die. We're going to surrender.

126
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:32.480
But then a mighty fog rolls in the British were going to come and advance on us

127
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.720
the next morning. Right? Cause they had us pinned in this Hamlet, right.

128
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.160
And we had our backs against the wall backs against the water. And um, we,

129
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.450
we thought we were going to lose. And so at this mighty Fargo's end,

130
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.830
George Washington says, you know what? You can know what,

131
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.180
let's get our whole army on these boats that are trapped and sail them across

132
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:53.540
the water, underneath the guise of this fog. And the British will never know.

133
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.480
And lo and behold, the British go to storm the next morning,

134
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.690
there's two colonial soldiers there. And it's like, yeah, take me Dick head.

135
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.820
The rest of the army got across the water.

136
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:05.330
They were up into Harlem and they escaped to live another day because the thing

137
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.660
with George Washington is he really wasn't the greatest military tactician,

138
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.840
even though listen, he's my boy Memorial day. I love you, George Washington,

139
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.390
thank you for saving this country, but you weren't really that great on the,

140
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.360
as a military tactician, what he was very, very,

141
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:20.660
very good at is he knew what all the people said about him,

142
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:22.610
Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, all those guys.

143
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.630
What they said about George Washington is he, he,

144
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.250
he had the ability. He had the ability to say, you know what? We're not,

145
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:35.120
I'm not going to win. He knew that he wasn't going to win. He could see this,

146
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.620
his exact quote from Benjamin Franklin.

147
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.900
This is something you can take your own life. He said,

148
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.580
the greatest thing about George Washington is he was able to see things as they

149
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:48.500
were not as he wishes they were. So that's little life advice.

150
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.470
You know, you can apply that to anything. And especially in military battles,

151
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.200
it's like George Washington knew I'm not going to sit and fight.

152
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.830
The British were going to kill us in Brooklyn. I know that we're going to lose.

153
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:02.390
So let me get these ships across the water and get to safety. So boom safe.

154
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.700
So as time goes on, we start to really win cause that colonial American spirit,

155
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.120
we start to really win. And then eventually of course, we beat the British.

156
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:14.840
We make them surrender at Yorktown, um, down in the South on,

157
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.830
in 1781 because you know, it was really France, uh, that really, you know,

158
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.830
kind of helped us with the, they, they taught our military what to do.

159
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.600
That's why, when people like we hate France,

160
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.360
it's like why they gave us a country. Thank you, France. Like shout out,

161
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.030
Baghat's shout out pink Panther, like whatever, like shout out France.

162
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.920
Thank you. Um, so they helped us win the war, um, uh,

163
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.720
by sending all their troops to us. And you know,

164
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:39.110
of course the Marquis de Lafayette who was a 21 year old soldier and Rashaan

165
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.150
ball, rumble, Shaun, and I would say his name.

166
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.390
He was a great military leader there taught, uh, George Washington, um,

167
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.830
kind of a lot of military tactics and all our people, military tactics. Um,

168
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.570
and it was so, you know, and so,

169
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:54.020
so it really goes beyond just America versus Britain though,

170
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:58.980
because it is a world war. I mean, Spain sent money, France joined us,

171
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.450
you know, we fought against England,

172
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.230
the Netherlands joined and there are all these repercussions as time went on,

173
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.380
it was kind of like really the first world war, our first civil war.

174
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.240
And of course the revolution, I mean,

175
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:14.010
every country got involved pretty much in the revolutionary

176
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.460
war except China, because God knows what China is doing.

177
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:21.480
They're probably making viruses and putting them in bats when they could have

178
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:25.200
been helping us. But yeah, I don't know if I was supposed to say that,

179
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:28.020
but listen, I'm nine minutes in, so I can't go back now.

180
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.280
So I'm just going to post it.
