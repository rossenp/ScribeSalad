1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Columbus has like Columbus is like the Beatles of exploring, right?</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.560
Like they're just the ones, you know, if you're like, what was the,

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.410
what's the biggest rock band of all time? You'd be like, Oh, the Beatles.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.580
That's just what Columbus is. Like people, they teach them to everybody.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.320
So everyone's like, Oh, it's club.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.910
Like I literally thought Columbus sailed here, saw it,

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.600
went back and was like, Oh, this is the whole land. And everyone's like, cool,

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.810
cool. Yeah. The way they teach you in school, there's,

9
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:31.980
there's never any violence. There's never any phone torture or rape or slavery.

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.300
That is kind of like, so Columbus sailed here with three ships, the painter.

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.980
<v 1>They mean on the Santa. I know all of them. And they're like, then, you know,</v>

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.890
like I had an aunt Nina, Marie, I was like,

13
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:50.750
yay. You get 1492. They're like, that's it. You get an a in history. Yeah.

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.140
And then like, and then as you start to go on, like as like, you know,

15
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.690
time goes on, you're like, Oh wait, there was some evil that up there, like,

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.000
you know, I remember I like took a class in, uh,

17
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.610
like a college professor just casually through it. And it's like, yeah,

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.700
Columbus is one of the first people to experiment with biological warfare.

19
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:06.500
And I was like, huh. It was like, Hey,

20
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.030
gave blankets filled with smallpox and native Americans. I was like, Oh, what?

21
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.710
Sister? Mary never told us that the ocean blue in 1492,

22
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.670
I'm like, wait. So he killed every I'll be like, but they got vaccines. Right.

23
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:21.860
He's like, no, they killed half the population.

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.290
But that's what we got to do for our country. I was like, Oh.

25
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.700
<v 0>For me, it's falling asleep at 33 to an episode of ancient aliens,</v>

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.950
smoking a joint and then waking up. And they were like,

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.550
Columbus raped most of the women. And you're like, what's up?

28
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.330
<v 1>What's going on? Cause you realize that he, yeah,</v>

29
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.770
he basically brought the Spaniards.

30
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.300
<v 0>To be like, yo, grab some people.</v>

31
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.340
<v 1>Because that was like big business back then. And then, um, you know,</v>

32
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.980
but it's interesting because like in certain neighborhoods, like here,

33
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.830
we're in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and this is like pretty conservative neighborhood.

34
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.870
I remember I have a friend, my big, big Ryan he's a cop lives in Bay Ridge.

35
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.260
And I remember like a couple of years ago when they were changing.

36
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.290
Well I guess they have now legally changed it to indigenous people's day. Right?

37
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.140
It's like, it's not called Columbus day or it still is.

38
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.360
<v 2>They celebrate both.</v>

39
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.470
<v 1>They sell it. But,</v>

40
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.820
but in like another city it's just indigenous peoples or it's just Columbus.

41
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.920
<v 2>Certain States and certain cities just recognize it as Columbus day</v>

42
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:22.070
and other cities and States recognize it as both.

43
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.370
And some people just do indigenous people.

44
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.550
<v 0>God, that's so funny. It's like sexuality in this country or there's,</v>

45
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.170
there's still the, you know,

46
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:33.080
like cities that are like man or woman sanctity of marriage.

47
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.420
And then there's some people that are like, listen, if you're BI,

48
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.820
that's just what you are. If you want to be in Columbus,

49
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:40.790
if you want to be indigenous. And there's other people that are like, honey,

50
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.440
we're coming hot gay sex right here. It's indigenous people's day.

51
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:48.170
Like what it is, because there's,

52
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.500
what's the thing about Americans that, uh,

53
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.780
ultimately is a weakness for us is we latch onto narratives

54
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.520
in anyone that tries to change that narrative or immediately like you're

55
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.120
attacking everything I love. Right. Where it's like, nah, not really.

56
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.610
We're just trying to clarify some certain specific things. Yeah.

57
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.110
<v 1>Yeah. I think like the problem is with like looking back in history,</v>

58
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:12.090
like things with Columbus is like,

59
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.740
you're gonna find everybody was and in today's standards, uh,

60
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:20.400
pizza back then everybody was doing what he was doing.

61
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
<v 0>The dudes were wearing these hot wigs. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.100
Just salient selling people into slavery. It just raping and pillows.

63
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.700
<v 1>Yeah. Cause a man look at how quick the world changes. And like,</v>

64
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.720
I remember like the movie waiting just came out on Netflix and I've seen waiting

65
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:39.530
a bunch of times, but it just came out on Netflix, you know, with, uh, with, uh.

66
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.120
<v 0>Brian ran all Justin Long. Yeah. It's a great guy.</v>

67
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.260
<v 1>But then the whole premise of the movie is if you get stuck,</v>

68
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.620
if you get caught with, uh, looking at another employee's Dick,

69
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:52.710
they play a game looking at another guy's Dick. They kick you in the for being,

70
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.360
and it's like, that was a number one comedy movie just 10, 15 years ago.

71
00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:59.430
And now if you came to that premise,

72
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.340
you'd get canceled just for trying to pitch.

73
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.420
<v 0>Dude, have you tried doing that at an Applebee's now? Like you're out,</v>

74
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.430
you're out, dude. We can't have you at the beach.

75
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.920
<v 1>So imagine in 1492, hundreds of years ago, the things that they were doing,</v>

76
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:16.770
which were, they didn't realize that they were doing harm. I mean,

77
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:20.340
they probably did, but it was just like business was business back then.

78
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.840
And that's what it is. So it's like,

79
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.620
if you want to go back and cancel everybody, it's like, guess what?

80
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.430
It wasn't just old white explorers that were doing bad. Everybody,

81
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:33.690
every human being was living a different life with the way like America is,

82
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.100
you know, now like even white people it's w it's interesting Yonis.

83
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.830
And I honest read the article and then he told me about it.

84
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:45.030
It was fascinating that actually like, you know, like we're all created equal.

85
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.460
It's like, there's scientific proof.

86
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:49.590
Now they believe that that's actually not true.

87
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.270
Like we both liked Europeans and people more Northern from

88
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.070
more Northern countries come from a different strand of chimpanzee

89
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:03.660
DNA, then people more South. So it was like two slightly different,

90
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.320
but slightly different, but actual different types of human beings.

91
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.410
That's what they think. This is all pre you know, early signs.

92
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.770
But the Northern European DNA,

93
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:18.420
the one like that mostly white people are from is like 10 times more

94
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.430
vicious Chimp than the Southern ones.

95
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.930
So that's why it's like a European settler coming in and being vicious.

96
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.170
This article was saying their scientific evidence had potentially very early

97
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:32.910
stages backs all that up where it's like white people are just more evil

98
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:35.730
because of their DNA. That's what they said.

99
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.650
<v 0>White people are the pit bull of humans where it's just like,</v>

100
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.440
if there's an, if there's an unmanned white person that walks in, you go,

101
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.320
what is he going to do? What's he going to do? Can you really trust him?

102
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.950
If I ever had to get a snap? I don't know.

103
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.010
I don't know that a Rottweiler walks over, like, he's the problem?

104
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.593
Cause he's black.

105
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.400
<v 1>He thinks we're like, America's not innocent. You know that doesn't make me say,</v>

106
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.850
I want to hate America. No, it's just good to learn. But these things,

107
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.190
like there are these over correctness where it's like,

108
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.920
really now we're going to find about indigenous people's day.

109
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.970
It's like just shut it. Just kind of admit that there's blood on our hands.

110
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.410
And that, that helps the whole situation.

111
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.380
<v 0>So like when you see a good marriage,</v>

112
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.890
like a really good marriage and they had this honesty where they're like, yeah,

113
00:06:17.891 --> 00:06:20.680
she was a slept for like 10 years and now we're great. And we're like,

114
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.910
not gonna get me going. She's like, what do you want me to do? I this brother.

115
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:29.050
And it was 10 years or whatever. And you're like, I love her. God, I love her.

116
00:06:29.051 --> 00:06:31.570
But they, they just acknowledge a shared history where.

117
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.441
<v 1>And that's what it is.</v>

118
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:34.540
It's like calling indigenous people's day or Columbus day.

119
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:37.150
That shouldn't be a fight like that. Shouldn't be like,

120
00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:40.150
I'm taking a stand on one or the other it's stupid. It's entitlement.

121
00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:44.410
And makes us feel like it made this, I don't know this year,

122
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.470
if you'll have such a stink about what it's going to be called.

123
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.780
Cause now we're in a pandemic. So it's like,

124
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.290
now it's like the same thing it's like now nobody cares.

125
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:56.470
We were saying this last podcast, like nobody cares about the straws anymore.

126
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.770
Nobody cares if there's plastic being used on the ventilator that could

127
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:00.440
strangle.

128
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.440
<v 0>But this is that's, that's kind of this,</v>

129
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.710
the exact prime example of what all this is. It's like,

130
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.110
I bet native Americans don't really give a about the indigenous people's

131
00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:13.750
day. As much as they Ida, I'm not speaking for them. But I'm saying like,

132
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.730
look at the Dakota pipeline. You look at dude, look at Sturgis. This year,

133
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.930
Sturgis happens in the black Hills of South Dakota, which is Lakota nation.

134
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.060
That is still there. That's like their most sacred land and Sturgis is apart.

135
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:32.110
And they had like 300,000 people without masks during COVID just being like

136
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.250
whatever. And it was the protests of the natives that were there that were like,

137
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:38.150
dude, this. Why are you guys coming in?

138
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.660
And just bringing this is you're doing it. Yeah.

139
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.020
Doing the thing again where you're bringing a disease in,

140
00:07:44.021 --> 00:07:47.860
when we're telling you, we don't want you here. Hold on. I gotta,

141
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:49.840
she smash mouth

142
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.100
without a of lib tarred cloth.

143
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.420
I'm I might as well be wearing somebody far skin on my face.

144
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.750
You just want to see history, repeat itself, go read up about,

145
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.610
about the Sioux nation,

146
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.720
protesting Sturgis rally this year, the bike rally,

147
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.990
because it's just a bunch of fat people with hepatitis being like run up on my

148
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.930
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't believe in that. And you're like,

149
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.230
Hey, you guys suck. You're the problem. Yeah.

150
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.800
It's not like you're doing the lead. I don't know, man.

151
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.170
I just had that bug me like reading that. Cause you're like, man,

152
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.480
you guys are just doing the same thing, same thing.

153
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.300
But you're just acting like what? It's my rights.

154
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.410
I go to Sturgis every year and I watch my wife,

155
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.640
my fat wife get gang-banged by the hell's angels. And then I go home.

156
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:44.320
I go home and I listen to Legion and skank were shout out Legion [inaudible].

157
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.250
<v 1>Um, but see the, the whole reason why? Cause a lot of people like, Oh,</v>

158
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:50.860
we've never even met a native American. Why do we care? That's on purpose.

159
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:54.940
The United States government in the 19th century adopted a policy to isolate and

160
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.580
native Americans in places with few natural resources far from con far from

161
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.960
contact with the developing us economy because they knew that their land that

162
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.550
they were living on had all the and they were like,

163
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.920
let's just move them over here. And we'll, you know,

164
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.230
are new home near forget about their, their old home.

165
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.310
And they'll like their new home.

166
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:14.970
And now they just all live on for the most part reservations. Um,

167
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.980
making Arizona ice tea. That's what.

168
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.110
<v 0>It is. I've thought about. This one makes you.</v>

169
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.610
<v 1>Does anything make you? As much as when you drink a can of 99 cents Arizona.</v>

170
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.590
<v 0>Honestly, I'm too adapted to it. It's just fine. I can,</v>

171
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.980
I it's been awhile until I found out how much sugar was actually there.

172
00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:32.780
But I used to rip those green teas.

173
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.710
<v 1>Used to drink the raspberry iced teas and then just let it rip. I mean.</v>

174
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.370
<v 0>Oh, it was crazy. Yeah. I thought the green teas were healthy.</v>

175
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:46.040
I genuinely thought the Arizona green teas for four years of my life,

176
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.400
I scientifically were like, yeah, this is like a healthy green tea. I'm like,

177
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.980
I get in cam a meal and zinc and stuff.

178
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.460
<v 1>You have Arizona. I seen him or do they make it? Or I can look for it anymore,</v>

179
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.181
I guess,

180
00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:58.370
because like once you grow up and you realize how much sugar is in like your

181
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.890
mind, I was like, don't ever go near that mountain deal. I'm like,

182
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.730
did they stop making mountain Dew? It's like, no, your brain just let,

183
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.570
just says you can have that. So it's out.

184
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.860
<v 0>Yeah. You're a kid. You're like, yeah, no, but they got,</v>

185
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.950
they got new flavors now, dude. Oh yeah, they got, we got Baja blast.

186
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:17.180
You got, you can get into it dude, but multiple flavors. But.
