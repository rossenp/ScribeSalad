00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>I want to call Brad Williams because he remembered that, you know,</v>

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.980
this quading bales thing that happened. I do, yeah. The young gunner,

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.780
this Australian young buck and, uh, and people were really lightened into him.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.890
Yeah. Right.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
And Brad did a fundraiser for him and it was supposed to be to raise 10 grand.

6
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:18.510
And I think they raised about a lot more.

7
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:23.190
I want to say a couple of hundred thousand, unfortunately. Hold on. Okay. Sorry.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.480
Don't hold on. You say whatever you want.

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.870
<v 1>I was going to say, I'm sorry. Pictures.</v>

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.050
Pictures of that kid came out with him with strippers and stuff like that.

11
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.730
Did they really? So I don't think he's eight year.

12
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.640
I don't th they say he's not eight or nine years old, but I don't care.

13
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:37.010
He's still small enough. He still can't get on all the rides.

14
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:38.420
So we should still just send them out there.

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.520
<v 0>Well, I mean, if you want, I don't know what happened. So what I'm wondering is,</v>

16
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.570
do we know what happened?

17
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.600
And you guys are gonna have to put on the headphones to hear Brad.

18
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.170
<v 1>And when we call them, I mean, $300,000 is a lot of money.</v>

19
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.660
<v 0>I don't know Brad's number. All right.</v>

20
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.320
Cause this thing really captivated the nation last week and put the phone in the

21
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:06.590
middle of the table. Hey brother. What's up man? It's Theo. Hey buddy.

23
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.810
we got Krista Stefano here, um, in the podcast right now and.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.100

36
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.770
<v 1>Let's do it. Do it. That's why I'll stay an extra night.</v>

37
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.640
Then you don't need an extra night, bro. You just stop by during the day.

38
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.940
All right, I'll do that. I'll be that creeper that hangs out and Brad daylight,

39
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.803
cat house.

40
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.330
<v 2>You're going to be living in the apartments. Oh God.</v>

41
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.100
<v 0>Brad. We had, uh,</v>

42
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.700
we talked about the queen bales thing on podcast last week and um,

43
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:17.990
and everybody's been talking about it.

44
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:20.300
I know that you did a fundraiser for them. Um,

45
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.460
can you kind of take us through a little bit of that and where you're at now

46
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:23.600
with it? Yeah.

47
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.550
<v 2>No problem. Uh, first of all, uh, first of all, he's nine years old,</v>

48
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:33.380
everybody. Okay. So stop with your conspiracy theories. Uh,

49
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.180
he's nine years old. Anyway. Uh, I got, uh, I got winded the video because,

50
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.660
uh,

51
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.640
I've got some Australian fans that kept sending me the video and I don't

52
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:47.360
know why they kept sending it to me. Just like, Hey, you're a dwarf,

53
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.180
he's a dwarf. You can help him. Like I like, I don't know.

54
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.670
I don't know what they were thinking like, Oh yeah,

55
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.620
like I've got some hotline or something.

56
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.980
<v 1>But yeah, but.</v>

57
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.930
<v 2>I saw it, but I saw the video and like anyone who saw the videos got a pulse,</v>

58
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.440
I was, uh, really moved by it. Uh, of course,

59
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.220
of course I'm a fellow, a little person.

60
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.680
He's got the same kind of dwarfism that I do and I was bullied growing up.

61
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.220
So it really, it, it really spoke to me.

62
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.640
So I thought I got to do something, but I can't, you know, I'm, uh,

63
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.650
I'm out in Los Angeles. What can I do? He's in Australia. So I thought, well,

64
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.400
I'll throw together a go fund me page and send the kid to Disneyland.

65
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:34.330
I grew up going to Disneyland kids loved Disneyland. So, uh,

66
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.620
I did that set the goal at $10,000 because with $10,000 you can buy him

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.630
flights tickets and maybe two churros. Uh, those things are expensive.

68
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.640
Um, and I figured, you know, that that'd be, that'd be a good time.

69
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:53.440
So instead of the $10,000 tweeted it out and then I went to bed

70
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.300
and uh, the next day it was an $18,000.

71
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.330
And then a huge Jackman talked about it. William Shatner talked about it.

72
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.810
It started getting passed around all these celebrities. Uh,

73
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.830
and then currently we're at $460,000.

74
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.240
<v 1>Yes, ma'am for a weekend.</v>

75
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.700
<v 2>Oh, the boy is going to buy Disneyland. And I'm thrilled about that.</v>

76
00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:22.320
I hope it's worth owns Disneyland.

77
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.880
Cause then probably no more height requirement.

78
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 1>Okay. That'd be great. Yeah. Pretty smelling the whole day.</v>

79
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.520
<v 0>So whenever the, whenever the, the, the conspiracy theories came out, I mean,</v>

80
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.490
just because, you know, people are skeptical over everything. Um,

81
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.200
what did you do then?

82
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.810
<v 2>Oh man, I just kinda let it go.</v>

83
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.580
Like if I chase down every person that

84
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:49.290
was talking about it or saying that he's 18 years old or that he's,

85
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.300
he's not really 18, he's a 45 year old actor, you know,

86
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.110
just weird stuff like that.

87
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.970
<v 1>He was in Dunkirk. That's what people were saying.</v>

88
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.410
What were they dropping them out of? The plane, all kinds of stuff.

89
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.360
I have no idea.

90
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.850
He played one of the bombs dropping them onto the Germans. Yeah.

91
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.713
People were there.

92
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.240
<v 0>Kinds of conspiracy theories. People were saying that he worked for the city.</v>

93
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:14.700
I remember somewhere outside of Akron, there was all kinds of wild stuff.

94
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.620
But did you, did you check with him,

95
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.380
did you do any other recon to make sure that you were like,

96
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.430
did you have any question?

97
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.530
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, I just wanted to make sure that, uh, he's a good kid and that,</v>

98
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.730
you know, he's a kid, but I got the FaceTime with them and, uh,

99
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.830
FaceTime with both him and his mom.

100
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.230
And that's back when the fundraiser was at $20,000 and it really hadn't

101
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:40.860
picked up yet, uh, new, uh, news organizations.

102
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:45.210
Weren't really talking about it. Uh, so I was FaceTiming with him.

103
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.670
He seems like a fun normal kid.

104
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.770
And then once it started going above like $50,000,

105
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:55.050
$75,000, uh,

106
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.630
I started reaching out to a bunch of different people that, um,

107
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.160
run charities and do these kinds of things, all things all the time. Uh,

108
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.520
GoFund me is an incredible website. Uh,

109
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.340
because once a fundraiser hits a certain point,

110
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.850
they assign a team to that fundraiser.

111
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:18.230
So I had a team from go-fund me and constant, constant communication,

112
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.210
and they vetted everything. They, they looked into everything,

113
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:27.350
they did amazing work, so yeah. Where does the money go?

114
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.570
Well, and, uh, we, we posted an update on the page. Uh,

115
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.760
so Caden and his family actually released a statement that said that

116
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:42.110
they are turning down the trip Disneyland and they want all the money to just go

117
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:47.060
to charity. Wow. So he's, he's ridiculous.

118
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.170
The charity is he picked a charity. How does it work? Uh,

119
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.980
I did another FaceTime call with him and, and his mom.

120
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.940
And we kind of went through all, all the charities that we wanted to go through.

121
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.090
Because if you look at the original wording on my GoFundMe,

122
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.930
I said any excess money would be donated to charity. Uh,

123
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.260
so we, we picked some great charities and, uh,

124
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.770
they're actually posted right now on the GoFundMe page. We picked, uh,

125
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.120
six different charities. Uh, some, some charities,

126
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.980
yeah, stomp out bullying, uh, born this way.

127
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:26.660
Those are two charities in the United States. There's four charities in,

128
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.190
in, in Australia,

129
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.170
we're giving about $66,000 to each of those charities.

130
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:36.200
And then whatever money is left over, uh, I,

131
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.220
I decided to give it to Katie and his family and said, uh,

132
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.620
you guys can spend that money, however you want.

133
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:44.210
I know you're turning down money,

134
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:48.200
but many people donated to this fund with the thought of their money going

135
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.110
directly to the family. Right. So I thought on.

136
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.870
<v 1>Is it 400,000 us or Australia?</v>

137
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.930
<v 2>Yeah. It's a 460,000 us over</v>

138
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.330
700,000 Australian.

139
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.380
<v 1>They could buy one of those, they could buy the Aborigine people.</v>

140
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.570
<v 2>Well, not all of them. You could buy probably a couple.</v>

141
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.460
Uh, and, uh, this is a good time to add that, uh,

142
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.210
some of the charities are anti-black racism charities that stand up for the

143
00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:21.370
rights of the Aborigine people. Absolutely.

144
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.100
<v 1>I haven't met an Aborigine person. Have you? I would love to. I would,</v>

145
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.070
I would love to meet one I'd know. Cause I have a,

146
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.890
I don't think I have any Aboriginal, uh, fans, but I'm looking for that.

147
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.140
That's one of the things I'm trying to get from my podcast.

148
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.240
<v 2>There you go. You got to get some.</v>

149
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.200
<v 1>And I, Brad too, because, you know, cause I'm only,</v>

150
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:43.720
I'm just a victim of the internet as well. There it's like,

151
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.620
all these pictures are like, Oh, he's 19 years old. He's with strippers,

152
00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:51.520
he's got guns. I mean, how do they do all that? Like what, like.

153
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.560
<v 2>What is it? What is a Photoshop?</v>

154
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.950
The internet is an amazing place. Uh, both good and bad.

155
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.870
I mean, there were, there were people that were spreading rumors that like, Oh,

156
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.520
uh, like there was some,

157
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.140
like I looked at a lot of this stuff because I wanted to make sure that the,

158
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.390
that, that the money was going to a good spot.

159
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.370
There was one person who had a Facebook talk show that said,

160
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.960
like that Kayden was like this nine year old running around, uh,

161
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.880
the school, like sexually assaulting girls. And I mean, they,

162
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.950
they, they said that their proof was that they read one Facebook comment that,

163
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.420
and they posted the Facebook comment and it said, Oh, a friend of mine, his,

164
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.370
his kid goes to the same school and noticed some girls where this

165
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.990
happened. I'm like, really? You're going through all this off of Facebook. Like,

166
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.640
yeah. Do you.

167
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.630
<v 0>Is there, I mean, yeah, there's all kinds of stuff. Somebody,</v>

168
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:53.100
people who said he opened up for Gucci mane, there was all kinds of.

169
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:54.711
<v 1>Well, that,</v>

170
00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:58.220
that is the problem is when UTA signs him and he starts taking dates away from

171
00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:03.140
everybody, we'll be like, you, Brad. That's a great point, man. You know,

172
00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:04.790
they signed bagel boy bagel.

173
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.810
<v 0>Oh yeah. They had this kid named lightening rod, a lightning rod.</v>

174
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.720
I don't want to say lightening rod lightening, Rodney.

175
00:10:11.721 --> 00:10:12.770
Maybe when I was growing up,

176
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.350
some guy that got hit by lightning and they tried to turn them around locally.

177
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.020
<v 1>Really? He was probably moving major tickets.</v>

178
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.210
<v 0>He wasn't doing anything. Maybe 40 tickets sell out. Now what about this bread?</v>

179
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.470
Are there higher costs associated with being like a, a little person growing up?

180
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.350
Like, are there costs that, are there extra costs?

181
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.720
<v 2>Yeah. Well, like just in terms of, I mean, at your most basic costs, uh,</v>

182
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.220
most clothes that, uh, I would like to buy, uh,

183
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.990
don't fit me. So you got to get stuff that, uh, tailored,

184
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.430
unless you just want to be walking around with like a shirt that has Bob the

185
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:53.390
builder on it. But, uh, I doubt you want that. So yeah.

186
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:58.100
You have extra tailoring and then plus a lot of little people have,

187
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.920
uh, medical problems, whether it be neck or, uh, leg surgeries,

188
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:08.680
I've had one dwarf related surgery on my legs. So yeah, they,

189
00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:11.300
they can, they, they can get problems that way as well.

190
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:15.920
So that's why I wanted to give the family a little bit of money just because

191
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.350
if those kinds of things are coming up with Caden,

192
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.150
I want to make sure that they're taken care of.

193
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:24.360
And that's what the people who gave money to the campaign wanted as well. So,

194
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.510
uh, that's dope. Yeah. And, and, and, and it's really great. And really,

195
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.500
and, and people stepped up and we ended up donating a ton of money to charity.

196
00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:38.470
That's going to anti-bullying and anti-abuse, uh, anti-racism charities.

197
00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:40.550
So a lot of people are,

198
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.760
a lot of people are going to be helped in a very positive way because of this.

199
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.050
I cannot be more thankful.

200
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.870
<v 1>Man. And I know, you know, and cause you're, I'm a, I'm a dad.</v>

201
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:50.990
I know you're a new dad. Congrats. It's like, when I say stuff like that,

202
00:11:50.991 --> 00:11:54.340
and I'm sure it's the same with you. It's like, you can't help. But think like,

203
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:57.010
what if that was my child being abused that way? Like, you know,

204
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.480
so it's great that you can,

205
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.050
that you made an effort and did it cause I there's things there's times when I

206
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:04.960
see videos like that. And I'm like, I can't, what if that was my daughter?

207
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.890
And then I have a chance to donate and I just watched porn hub or do something

208
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.380
different, but you actually went out there and made a difference,

209
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.270
which is why you're happily married and, um, you know,

210
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:15.160
single living with Don to pet on his couch.

211
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.090
<v 2>There's still time.</v>

212
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.270
<v 1>Yeah. That's why I got visitation rights, but you, you know,</v>

213
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.680
but you have a full, happy family. There's still time. Uh,

214
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.690
thanks so much, man. And uh, yeah,

215
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.850
at least Chris will be warmed up for your podcast later this week.

216
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.600
<v 2>Hey, sounds great. Thank you guys, gang gang.</v>

217
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.860
<v 0>Uh, before he hangs up, can you hear me? Yeah. What's the quickest way to, uh,</v>

218
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.500
get to your GoFundMe. Cause when you just search on go fund me,

219
00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:44.070
we can't find it. So how can we get to the actual GoFund me?

220
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.110
<v 2>Uh, if you guys still want to donate to the go-fund me, cause it is still open.</v>

221
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.300
Uh, you can, uh,

222
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.440
probably quickest way is just to go to my Twitter and then scroll down the

223
00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.720
tweets and you'll find, you'll find links.

224
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.470
I'm on Twitter at funny Brad and uh, if not,

225
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:06.240
I'm sure you can just Google, uh, GoFund me for,

226
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.200
uh, bullied Australian boy. And something's gonna pop up.

227
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.830
There'll be news articles. There'll be links. Uh, you can.

228
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.920
<v 0>And there'll be $460,000 in there already. So.</v>

229
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.020
<v 2>Yeah. Oh man. I had, so, and I had so many friends that were like,</v>

230
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.550
it really makes you realize who your friends are because I had so many friends

231
00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:31.440
that were like, uh, sending you messages, like dude, embezzle it,

232
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.400
take it, go to Sweden. And I was like, yeah.

233
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.030
<v 0>Oh. What if you disguise yourself as quading and went.</v>

234
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.863
<v 1>To Disneyland?</v>

235
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.750
<v 2>Uh, Shay get shave, get a tan. Oh yeah.</v>

236
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.700
<v 1>Oh yeah. It could happen.</v>

237
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.900

<v 0>Thank you. Ma'am good evening. Good afternoon. And other times.</v>

241
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.580
Thanks for watching that video. You just saw. I mean it was okay,

242
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.940
but the next video you could watch could be way better.

243
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.480
What if you watch a video right now that changes your life where you could watch

244
00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:20.040
this one or watch this one, watch this one, watch this one, watch this one.

245
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.720
Ah,
