00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>Well, we're going to also say, since we're from New York,</v>

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.830
we're going to call her. Although it's spelled Houston,

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.490
we're going to call her Whitney house than strictly house Whitney house.

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.090
Whitney house in Houston started her modeling career when she was 16.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.220
Here's the difference between America and Canada?

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.960
Our most favorite or most famous crack addict is Whitney Houston.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.180
One of the greatest cigarettes to ever grace the earth in all of

8
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.014
history.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.310
And Canada's most famous crack user is a Toronto mayor,

10
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.144
Rob Ford.

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.510
And that's should go more to tell you that because we're just better at

12
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:34.950
everything. Even our crack is better.

13
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.770
<v 1>Of emotional stress. Yeah. Okay. My eating habits awful.</v>

14
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.240
Quit the dying crack rehab phase. First of all,

15
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.510
let's get one straight. Exactly cheap Coke.

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.390
I make too much money to ever crack.

17
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.260
Let's get that straight exactly to crack is whack.

18
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.230
So I still do this day and like do not lack.

19
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.330
<v 0>The girl is an amazing singer. Um, same with Amy Winehouse.</v>

20
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.120
The voices are beautiful, but it just seems like, yeah,

21
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.710
a lot of that talent up there, it just musically. I mean,

22
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:10.820
they just get in drugs and alcohol.

23
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.780
I think it's a lot of the lifestyle is a big part of it, I think.

24
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380
And I think ma do you think maybe just cause this is a cosmic joke does life

25
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.670
that when you're given that much of a talent, there's also an equally, an equal,

26
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:26.600
but opposite blind spot. And that blind spot was for some good old,

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.040
big fat jailhouse, former boy band.

28
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.020
Good old Dick, Dick Bobby Brown, Bobby Brown, Dick.

29
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:39.200
Must've been stupid. They famous. Yeah.

30
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:42.770
He's dancing mind do while the eighties were wild where you could just wear a

31
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:46.610
space suit. You're just good. And a flat top because I mean, you're,

32
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:49.070
everyone's outfit in the eighties when they were on stage,

33
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.800
looked like they were in space X and they were going to Mars. Yeah.

34
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:54.830
They were going to Mars, but yeah, they're all, it's all Elon Musk stuff.

35
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.410
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

36
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.010
<v 0>He had SIG God did not bless us with that. It did it pledged for that.</v>

37
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:11.840
And are we going to get limited or no ads?

38
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.480
Because we sang a cover because they're going to listen to it.

39
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.330
And they won't even recognize that it was her song because we sounded so

40
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:18.081
banking.

41
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:22.280
Imagine being on that set and just getting to see the magic work and imagine

42
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:25.400
just getting able to being able to kiss Kevin Costner and his scene. I mean,

43
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:28.160
that's the thing. I mean, Kevin Costner, he was.

44
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.270
<v 2>In dances with wolves.</v>

45
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.260
<v 0>With Dolly Parton, 1970s, Dolly Parton. I first girl,</v>

46
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:37.610
I ever jerked off till she had, she was the original, like big Natty,

47
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120
big Natty celebrity. And those were nannies, right? Yeah. Well,

48
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.720
here's a fun fact. Saddam Hussein love Whitney Houston's rendition. Uh,

49
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.910
so much that he used it in Arabic version of IO.

50
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.570
I will always love you as his re-election campaign theme. So he used,

51
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:54.320
I will always love you and Arabic as his reelection campaign theme,

52
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:58.220
Saddam Hussein, right? Everyone. Like I agree with you,

53
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:03.020
people aren't going to live anyway. It's like, if you want to do some drugs and,

54
00:03:03.021 --> 00:03:07.450
and go out of 48, that's your business right there. She gave the world her gift,

55
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.770
like you said, well, what else do you want me to?

56
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.480
What else do you want this lady to do?

57
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.770
Then auto tune came out and all these AI robots, you know, copying her voice,

58
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.080
people copied her style. What else do you want to do? I mean,

59
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.860
you gave us your angelic gorgeous, beautiful voice. You know, I have t-shirts,

60
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.560
I'll get a Whitney Houston tattoo. I don't give a. It's like,

61
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:26.560
if you went on a bathtub before 50, I mean, most of them don't make it,

62
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.380
you know, Prince Michael Jackson, Whitney. It's like what? It's like,

63
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.610
it's like seeing a tall, older person, you know, if you don't,

64
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.481
it doesn't happen.

65
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.300
You don't really see rock stars living into their seventies or eighties.

66
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.000
There's a few, but most of them go out early and it's sad,

67
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.090
but it's just kind of par for the course. I think, you know, I mean,

68
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.710
if you're going to die in a bath, Tom, you want to die in a first rate bathtub.

69
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.690
I mean dying in the Beverly Hills hotel bathtub beats the out of dying

70
00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:54.720
at a Ramada in bathtub, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania,

71
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.010
which is how I'm going to die, which is how you're going to die.

72
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.200
What a soul Joel gig. We really hope you enjoyed that episode.

73
