00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>I hosted a show on, uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.130
on Netflix called the ultimate Beastmaster and I got fired.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.850
<v 0>Great show. It's like American Ninja warrior,</v>

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.100
like through like a Dragon's mouth, whatever.

6
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.890
They hired us to be the host of the team USA. And they told me, they're like,

7
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:19.280
look, you're a comedian. Okay. All for white women. You're a comedian.

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.930
Make fun of the other countries.

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.890
I got fired immediately because people were tweet and going nuts.

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.730
But I had one joke that people going off about it's like you called up. Okay.

11
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:31.520
So the wa if you fell into the water, they called it the beast blood.

12
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.810
So the Chinese team was going,

13
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:36.050
and one of these competitors fell off it and his name was Ben Fong,

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.260
and he fell off into the water, but I didn't call it the beast blood. I go,

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.790
that goes, Ben Fung into the duck sauce.

16
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.570
