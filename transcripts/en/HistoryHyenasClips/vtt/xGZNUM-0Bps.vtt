1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>Yeah. Cause we w it's funny to think about,</v>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.740
I would have three levels of women in my heroine. Why, what would they be?

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.430
It would be for rum. Yeah. Okay. Forearm. So meaning like, listen,

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.130
you're so hot. It's not even in my control. You're just for Rome. We Pat,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.810
you know, when we pass the girl on the street or something, or if you are,

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.290
what your friends do, you pass, go on the street and she's so high.

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.440
He can't handle it. That is for Rome level. There's nothing you can do that.

8
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.320
It's beyond your control, too hot. She's she's more than a 10.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.770
She's the hottest girl you've seen. It's just, it's painful. How she is.

10
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.050
You just ride their Instagram wall for wrong.

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.750
<v 1>So any, any.</v>

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.330
<v 0>Hot women you see, you get to start. If you start to see for Rome,</v>

13
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.550
you know what we mean? She's like, I'll right now. Right now. I I'll ride on,

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.610
you know, Rosario. Dawson's won't, you're just, you're [inaudible] for rubbish.

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.750
I can't do anything. I have to take you for wrong. You know, part Dawn,

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.440
my tearing pot tear sheets got to come with me, Marone for Rome. Okay.

17
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:59.330
What's the other next level of course is, um, is, uh,

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.620
what was the next level of Rome is number one Alzheimer's early onset,

19
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.360
early onset scares.

20
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.210
It sucks because I always thought I'm going to be one that goes down first,

21
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:11.540
but you're. It'll be fun to talk to you as a puppet though.

22
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.320
It'll be fun to just watch you just talk and just say to you.

23
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.180
Cause what's the middle. What's the middle ranking.

24
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.850
We've just talked about a wrong, right? Yeah.

25
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.630
I honestly go deep as the lowest go. Deepest. The lowest

26
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.963
lead.

27
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.330
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

28
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.490
<v 0>Rome at the top. Number one, number two is clean out, clean out.</v>

29
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.580
So what do we mean by clean? Explain that to the table. Make no mistake.

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.530
You have to clean that out. You got to clean it out by any means necessary.

31
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.050
You're so hot. You need to be cleaned out. Not that you were dirty,

32
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:45.470
but I just need to clean you out like a dog with a peanut butter.

33
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.960
<v 1>That is a perfect description of clean.</v>

34
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.350
Just got to put your tongue in there and clean it out in and out.

35
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.020
<v 0>It's what it is. That's so that's how you're that level hot.</v>

36
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.840
And then the third and final level is go deep is go deep.

37
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:03.080
And what we seek go deep. What we're really referring to is Randy Moss.

38
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.160
If we said go deep or Randy Moss, that just means, um, you know,

39
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:10.880
Randy Moss was obviously, if you guys don't know, is a hall of fame,

40
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:15.560
a wide receiver, um, that would, you know, go deep and you know, would go deep,

41
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.070
take your couch. It passes from quarterback to catch it.

42
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.540
You could make means you could catch it.

43
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.770
So that's what we're trying to say with that.

44
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.460
So as always forum for room clean out and go deep.

45
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.970
And if you see me in Chrissy and you hear any wide receivers name,

46
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.730
that means just somebody in the vicinity that could go, Dave,

47
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.240
I could go there and you have to find them. So, yeah, so that's,

48
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:39.380
so that's kind of the Rome that we would live in.

49
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.550
And we've talked about that and we've joked about that a lot, uh,

50
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.930
in our friendship. And when we started researching Nero, we were like, wow,

51
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.910
the roam that we create it as a joke is the roam that Nero created in real

52
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:56.000
life. That's how wild that's how wild Nero was.

53
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.450
He just lived anything. See, here's the thing. Okay.

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.770
You don't even have to call this episode. Nero's wild.

55
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.570
We could just call it Nero because he's wild. It's self-explanatory that?

56
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:11.890
It's a fun. Yeah. It's like eponymous. Good word. Yeah. Eponymous.

57
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.660
I was going to say redundant redundant as the Ridgewood way,

58
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:20.940
but eponymous is to yeah, yeah, it. Yeah.

59
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.020
Yeah.
