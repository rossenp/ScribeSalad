00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.340
<v 0>Okay. Hello, I'm Linda you and you kinda miss that broadcaster.</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.300
Welcome to this episode of the intelligence squared business podcast.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.140
I'm joined by David Epstein to discuss his new book range.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.320
Why generalists triumph in a specialized world?

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.910
David is a New York times best selling author who also wrote the sports dream.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.590
He has worked as an investigative reporter for a pro Publica and senior

7
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.130
writer for sports illustrated. Welcome David.

8
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:34.050
It's lovely to have you here to speak with you about this terrific book.

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.510
I'm going to just kick off and ask you, um,

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.320
what led you to write this book and after reading it,

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.290
I felt it had personal resonance for you. Didn't it?

12
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.930
<v 1>It definitely did. I mean, I think even when I don't realize it at the time,</v>

13
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.500
in retrospect, I think a lot of my writing projects come out of things.

14
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:53.900
I'm curious about that I, that I see in my own life.

15
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:58.640
And particularly though the Genesis of range came out of my

16
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.050
first book, the sports gene,

17
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:03.830
where I sort of criticized some of the science,

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.700
the rigor of the science underlying the so-called 10,000 hours rule or the

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.710
deliberate practice framework as scientists call it.

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.190
And that brought me into a debate with Malcolm Gladwell, um,

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.280
at something called the MIT Sloan sports analytics conference.

22
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:21.080
And we were brought there to debate about the best way to develop athletes and,

23
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.870
uh, I'd never met him before. Um,

24
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:26.570
and he's obviously pretty clever and I didn't wanna get embarrassed on stage.

25
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.170
So I went through his writing to, to try to guess what he would argue.

26
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.471
And I saw,

27
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:35.090
I was writing about how important it was to specialize early in narrowly.

28
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.010
And so when we got to that debate, I,

29
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.570
I made a big point of the data showing that in fact,

30
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:43.820
athletes who go on to become elite, usually don't do that.

31
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.420
They have this sort of so-called sampling period where they do sort of variety

32
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.420
of physical activities. They gain these broad general skills,

33
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.410
learn about their interests and abilities and delay specializing until later

34
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:57.530
than peers who plateau at lower levels. And when we were coming off the stage,

35
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.980
he said, you know, that that data really didn't comport with,

36
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.570
with my thinking,

37
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.170
like what you want to go on a run tomorrow when we're both back home in New York

38
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.220
and we'll talk about it more.

39
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.740
And so we became running buddies and we would talk about this stuff on our own

40
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:14.240
time. Um, and you know, CA called it the Roger versus tiger problem,

41
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.450
which turned out to be the introduction of the book came directly out of our

42
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:20.420
discussions. And so just as we were talking about it,

43
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.970
w w I started to think about it,

44
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.100
whether what we were seeing in sports could really be just an analogy for other

45
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.430
domains of work in the world. And so I started getting interested in all these,

46
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.300
these other domains and seeing which of those sort of fit that surprising

47
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:37.450
pattern in sports and which didn't, and that,

48
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.900
that was the Genesis of the project.

49
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.390
<v 0>And for you personally, you sample didn't, you, you didn't specialize early.</v>

50
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.860
<v 1>Oh, no, absolutely. I mean, you know, in sports and in life, right?</v>

51
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.380
It's like American football, basketball, baseball,

52
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.790
cross country track and sports. I ran track in college, but I was,

53
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.700
when I was like 16, I, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

54
00:02:58.701 --> 00:02:59.680
I was going to be a test pilot.

55
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:01.360
I was going to go to the United States air force Academy.

56
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.300
I was at the end going to be an astronaut. I didn't do any of that stuff. Now.

57
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.200
I have no idea.

58
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.770
Like I've gotten almost linearly less knowing what I'm doing as I've gotten

59
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:13.390
older. And in, in university, I, um, was training to be a scientist.

60
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.080
So I have a master's degree in environmental sciences. Um,

61
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.760
but I decided that, you know, that wasn't kind of a,

62
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.120
a fit for me. It wasn't good, you know, some economists call it match quality,

63
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.550
the degree of fit between my interests and abilities and,

64
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.960
and the work I was doing. And I sort of decided because of some,

65
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.580
some kind of personal events to try to merge my interests in sports and

66
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:39.970
science, and, and at the time write about sudden cardiac death in athletes.

67
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.370
Cause I'd had a training partner who had died at the end of a race.

68
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.050
So I took my sort of scientific background where I was like very normal as I was

69
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:50.500
like living up in the Arctic, you know, doing research in the Arctic Tundra.

70
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.790
And I was a very normal, I would say, around other scientists,

71
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:58.060
but then you take those skills, move them over to like a sports magazine.

72
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.240
And suddenly I realized how unique that was,

73
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.100
even though it was ordinary in one area.

74
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.910
And so actually that attuned me to something that I just continued to do

75
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:07.571
throughout my career,

76
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:11.200
which is take skills that were sort of ordinary in one mill you and, and,

77
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.490
and transport them to somewhere where suddenly they were seen as like, you know,

78
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.210
innovative and creative. And so, um, I did realize that that was something that,

79
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:23.710
that started helping me. And so I've zigzagged like crazy,

80
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.431
and I'm still doing that.

81
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.010
I still like truly have no idea what I'm going to be when I grow up.

82
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.570
<v 0>That's actually a very good intro to your book, because it's all about, um,</v>

83
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.690
this, you know, thinking differently, I think about, um,

84
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.140
how you undertake your career. Um,

85
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.680
and I love this quote that you start with and you get the full quote,

86
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.520
a Jack of all trades is a master of none,

87
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.090
but oftentimes better than a master of one.

88
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.860
So tell us about this quote and the premise of your book a bit more that,

89
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:56.790
that quote.

90
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.700
<v 1>So usually we only hear Jack of all trades master of none,</v>

91
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.240
and I thought it's kind of culturally telling that we lop off the end of the

92
00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:05.730
quote, which is oftentimes better than master of one,

93
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:08.370
this isn't to say that we don't need specialists and of course not.

94
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.860
But I do think it's,

95
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.040
there's all this like cultural mythology that,

96
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.430
that sort of makes people feel bad about having brought interest. And in fact,

97
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.350
the first use of Jack of all trades as an insult,

98
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.480
um, the first written use at least.

99
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:28.660
So the first one we have record of was Yohanis factotum in,

100
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:32.460
in new Latin. And it was written by, um,

101
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.050
a playwright who was insulting another young playwright who didn't have formal

102
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:38.880
higher education, uh,

103
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.050
who was really a poet who was trying to write plays and trying to act and help

104
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:46.290
run a theater company, copy scripts. And so he said this, you know,

105
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.160
this losers trying to do it all. And, and that loser was William Shakespeare.

106
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.660
So he was the, he was the butt of the first Jack of all trades insult.

107
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.570
Um, but I think that's sort of common because if you look through sort of,

108
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:02.480
especially, you know, science and technology, innovation history,

109
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.640
but also literature in the arts, these,

110
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.320
these people who are coming with an unusual background that often change a field

111
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.570
are at first denigrated by the people who are sort of, um, you know, the,

112
00:06:13.571 --> 00:06:16.790
the sort of status quo standard bears in, in the field. And so that,

113
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.750
that quote kind of came to be representative, uh, to me of that. But,

114
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.010
but we forget the past half of it just like we only focus on

115
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.310
stories of precocity, right? So w in the book,

116
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.770
when I opened up with Roger Federer and tiger woods,

117
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.800
where Roger Federer did all these sports as a kid and delayed specializing and

118
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:37.250
tiger obviously specialized early, those are both examples of success.

119
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.840
I didn't dispute that at all, obviously,

120
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.390
but everyone knows the tiger woods story.

121
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.160
And even though Federer is just as famous as an adult, nobody knows his story,

122
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.390
even though it's the norm, according to the science, not the exception, right?

123
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:54.410
Everyone knows Serena Williams played a lot. As, as a girl,

124
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.050
I got to talk to her last year. I'd been a sports reporter. I didn't even know.

125
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:01.610
She told me I did TaeKwonDo, ballet, gymnastics, track, and field, uh,

126
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.530
learn how to throw a football for my overhand serve.

127
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:06.620
I worked at a sports magazine. I'd never even heard that. Or, you know,

128
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:09.830
we think of the Mark. Zuckerberg is like this, the young prodigy, right?

129
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:12.050
He said, young people are just smarter when he was 22.

130
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.380
He doesn't say that anymore. But last year,

131
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.960
MIT in the us census Bureau released research,

132
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:22.910
showing that the average age in the U S at least of a founder of a fast-growing

133
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.670
tech startup on the day of founding is 45.4.

134
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.450
But it's just like all these other stories where we focus on these exceptions,

135
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:32.030
because they're dramatic and they're these tidy narratives.

136
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.930
And we ignore what the research says is actually, uh, the norm,

137
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.640
even though there's a huge amount of variability,

138
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.810
I think it's important to know what's typical when we're all focused on these

139
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:42.644
exceptions.

140
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.440
<v 0>I found that, um,</v>

141
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.380
aspect of your book absolutely fascinating because you're right.

142
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.370
We think of the norm as actually, um,

143
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.520
the tiger woods, the kind of young, you know, startup,

144
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:58.090
and I've certainly seen equivalent studies in other countries where, you know,

145
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.560
you're, um, entrepreneurs on average, a fast growing startup.

146
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.820
So actually in their forties,

147
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.810
people who have had experience and therefore they decided to strike out on their

148
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:11.320
own. And, um, and yeah, that's not our perception at all.

149
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:15.910
So I found all of this to be, um, a good reason by the way, David,

150
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:20.710
to write a book. So let's talk about it and, and change perceptions.

151
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.430
Um,

152
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.320
so I'm going to ask you about the cult of the headstart and the story

153
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.740
of the poker, sisters and chess. Of course, coincidentally,

154
00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:34.330
the Queens gambit on Netflix is garnering attention right now.

155
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.410
<v 1>Yeah, it's a, and it's a really good show. I watched it, you know,</v>

156
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.650
I think deservedly. So I think like the cinematography is beautiful.

157
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:46.300
The acting is wonderful, but it's interesting because I just, I just,

158
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:48.970
the other day did a Q and a where I was the,

159
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.680
the question asker with a guy named John Urschel who used to play in the NFL,

160
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.233
um, getting, you know, American.

161
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.750
And at the same time started his math PhD at MIT at the

162
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:03.180
same time while he was in the NFL. And now, now he's,

163
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:04.950
he's a mathematician finishing his, he retired,

164
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.190
decided to retire from the NFL after he had a, you know,

165
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:12.690
a pretty severe concussion. Um, and he's finishing his PhD in math at MIT,

166
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.140
and he's also, he's become a good chess player.

167
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.170
And his best friend is one of the best chess players in the United States.

168
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.160
And he was talking about Queens gambit and saying how he gets bothered,

169
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:28.080
sort of by the portrayal of genius in a lot of media where

170
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:32.190
it's like, just this like bolt of lightning out of the blue rights,

171
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:35.360
like someone who just has this incredible talent right away, because that's,

172
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:39.510
that's often not exactly how it works, right.

173
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.880
It's probably not quite as rare as those things make it look,

174
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.910
but it's like usually a slower process. There are,

175
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.250
there are cases that are these sort of bolts out of the blue, but,

176
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.700
but usually it's more, someone gets interested in,

177
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:51.900
something builds a little skill.

178
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:53.730
Maybe they learn a little faster than they thought,

179
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:57.540
and they it's usually much more fits and starts and all sorts of lock-in

180
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.310
coincidences. And there is some of that luck in, in Queens gambit, for sure. Um,

181
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.880
but I think it,

182
00:10:03.881 --> 00:10:08.400
it is just like one more pebble on this huge pile that suggests

183
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.000
either you got it early, or you don't got it at all. And,

184
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.890
and the fact is development is very non-linear and that's usually not

185
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.660
the way these things look and chess by the way is also in many ways,

186
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.620
I think a poor example. So to go back, you mentioned the Polgar story,

187
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.430
that's in the book. So let me, let me talk about that because in some ways it,

188
00:10:28.431 --> 00:10:32.220
it would be interesting to people who've been watching, um, Queens gambit,

189
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:35.010
so they should go watch, uh, the Polgar variant,

190
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:37.020
which is a great documentary about the Polgar sisters,

191
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.430
where these three sisters whose father Lazlo decided to train them in chess in a

192
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:44.550
very technical manner, um, from a young age in Hungary,

193
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.790
and really he didn't care about chess so much.

194
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:51.540
He just wanted to show that any child with a headstart and so-called deliberate

195
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:56.010
practice, deliberate practice being like not playing it's very focused,

196
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:57.450
coached, focused on error,

197
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:01.620
correction that any kid could become a genius in anything with a headstart and

198
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:03.510
deliberate practice. And in fact,

199
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:06.480
two of his daughters went on to become Grandmaster, uh, players.

200
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.910
And one of them went on to become the highest ranked, uh,

201
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:12.000
woman in the world Judit Polgar. And so this,

202
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:15.150
this showed up like the tiger woods story in a whole bunch of best-selling books

203
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:17.820
saying like, this is the key. You just need this, this early start.

204
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.360
And the fact is in chess, it, it actually is, um,

205
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.420
really beneficial to get an early start because chess is based on repetitive

206
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:27.930
patterns that you have to start recognizing almost like unconsciously.

207
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.540
And if you haven't started studying those by age 12,

208
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.430
the chance of a competitive player go reaching international master status,

209
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:39.030
which is one down from Grandmaster dropped from about one in four to about one

210
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:43.140
in 55, you have to start doing that, but that's also why it's so relatively,

211
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:46.170
so easy to automate, right? Because it's based on these recurring patterns,

212
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.640
the computers are much better at.

213
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.620
And so it's actually a really bad model in many ways of most of the

214
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:56.590
things like that. We want to learn in the rest of the world or the tiger woods,

215
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.540
like golf being the most famous example,

216
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.310
golf is almost a uniquely bad model of almost everything else that humans want

217
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.210
to learn. So there's nothing wrong with those stories until we extrapolate them,

218
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.650
which is mainly what we do with them, right? So golf and chess. These are,

219
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.250
these are very far on the spectrum of what they're psychologist,

220
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:19.990
Robin Hogarth called kind learning environments where kind learning environments

221
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.200
are those that have repetitive rules that never change patterns,

222
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.370
that repeat goals.

223
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:28.270
And next steps are clear feedback as quick and accurate work next year will look

224
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:31.570
like work last year on the other end of the spectrum of what he called wicked

225
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:35.020
learning environments, where next steps and goals may not be handed to you.

226
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.430
Rules may not be clear.

227
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.670
They may change feedback may be delayed or an accurate patterns.

228
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:43.210
Don't just repeat work next year. Won't look like work last year. So like,

229
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:47.290
which one of these sounds like the world that most of us who aren't like pro

230
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:50.740
golfers or chess players are living in, right? Some of both, some of both,

231
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.200
but increasingly more of the, of the wicked.

232
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:57.220
And so it's not that I have a problem with the poker story and they are,

233
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.050
by the way, I should just say they,

234
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.690
in what little interaction I've had with the Polgar sisters,

235
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:03.250
they seem like lovely well-adjusted people.

236
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:05.560
I don't think this is a story of like, you know,

237
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.870
kids being turned into monsters by an overbearing father.

238
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.210
But the problem is when we extrapolate those lessons to these other domains

239
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.010
where the lessons don't apply well.

240
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.560
<v 0>Yeah, absolutely. Um, fascinating. Um,</v>

241
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.250
I recommend everybody get David's book and watch the Queen's gambit too,

242
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.200
as well. That's the other book

243
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.380
I want you to tell the team each of the different parts of this.

244
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:34.560
So you include so many fascinating study.

245
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.250
So one of the ones that you include is compared to other scientists,

246
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.910
Nobel Laureate. So these are the people at the top of their profession,

247
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.110
normally in science and medicine, and even economics are bad,

248
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.240
I at least, and this is quite extraordinary. Um,

249
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.490
22 times more likely to be an amateur

250
00:13:56.491 --> 00:13:59.190
dancer, magician, or a performer.

251
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.560
So say more about how having range helps these high performers

252
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.960
break, old patterns, um,

253
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.160
which then helps them succeed versus people who are, um,

254
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.890
more specialized. Oh, and, and, and try to, um,

255
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.070
add in a Steve jobs story as well. Cause I think that was also brilliant.

256
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.960
<v 1>Okay. Yeah. So as musicians, writers, musicians, all these other Fords,</v>

257
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.570
storms, sorts of performers that,

258
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:27.750
that Nobel Laureate scientists were much more likely to have these sorts of

259
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:30.120
hobbies compared to typical scientists. And not only that,

260
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:34.860
but in other studies of, of engineers who made creative contributions, um,

261
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.920
compared to sort of engineers of similar technical skill,

262
00:14:37.921 --> 00:14:41.370
they tended to have aesthetic hobbies outside of work. And again,

263
00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:44.490
in the work of a professor named Abby Griffin who studied so-called serial

264
00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:45.091
innovators,

265
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:47.790
these are people who make like repeated creative contributions to their

266
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:50.130
organizations. She found a,

267
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.400
they have tend to have more hobbies than their peers.

268
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:54.350
They read more and more widely. They have a,

269
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.690
a need to learn outside their discipline.

270
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.330
They have lots of people in their network who are outside of their own

271
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.480
discipline, all these sorts of things that are just, you know,

272
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:05.540
they just have like wider, longer antennas for the world.

273
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.200
And it seems like in the creative creativity research,

274
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:11.720
a lot of researchers use different terms for what this is some called,

275
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:13.130
like network of enterprise.

276
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:16.250
They have sort of a lot of things that they're interested in. Um,

277
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.280
but it seems to help avoid so-called cognitive entrenchment,

278
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:21.710
where you sort of get stuck. And, and again,

279
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.070
there are different words for this like functional fixedness means people who,

280
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.341
you know,

281
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:29.660
they're only able to use a certain type of tool the same way over and over,

282
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:32.840
and they forget it can be used in different ways or the Einstein lung effect.

283
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:36.590
Once you've been accustomed to a certain type of solution for a problem,

284
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:39.860
you get stuck in it, even when it doesn't work for new problems anymore.

285
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.770
And so these are all forms of this cognitive entrenchment,

286
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:47.090
where with experience you become, you know, with sort of specialized experience,

287
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.460
you, you become much more efficient in certain things,

288
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.490
but there's also a trade-off you can think of it almost like an internet

289
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:55.250
browser, right? It's like if you go to the same sites all the time,

290
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:57.530
you'll get cookies and you can go to those sites even faster,

291
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.330
but you're sacrificing some sort of flexibility for searching more broadly.

292
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.660
And so in all this creativity research,

293
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.980
it just showed up over and over and over that the people who made contributions

294
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:14.120
tended to have like multiple streams of interests often that didn't have

295
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:15.890
anything to do with one another, like they would have,

296
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.470
they didn't seemingly didn't have one to do with one another.

297
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.910
They would say that it would give them insights into, into some of their work.

298
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:24.320
Um,

299
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.620
and so I think it's suggested that we want to avoid sort of getting stuck in the

300
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:29.060
same thought patterns.

301
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.220
You want to have ideas coming from places that aren't just in your,

302
00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:35.090
your direct line of sight every day.

303
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.330
Otherwise you increasingly know the same things that the people in your,

304
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.860
you know, that are around, you know, basically,

305
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.350
and that's where the Steve jobs story comes in. Oh right. The Steve jobs story.

306
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:48.370
Right. So he, he famously said, I mean, Steve jobs was sort of a, uh,

307
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.770
obviously Apple has very important specialists,

308
00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:54.100
but he was kind of a master generalist, um, in, in many ways.

309
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.410
And he famously said that he, he audited a calligraphy class, uh,

310
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.160
because he was interested in aesthetics and this gave him the idea to have

311
00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:06.430
different type faces. Right. And that led to all computers,

312
00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:09.460
having all these different type faces and a whole bunch of aesthetics that grew

313
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:12.910
out of that. So it was just this auditing, this class in calligraphy, uh,

314
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.460
they gave him an idea that really changed the aesthetics of,

315
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.680
of personal computing. And he had,

316
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.820
he had a bunch of things like that where he would pick up some, uh,

317
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.510
like he would, he would go and browse stores, you know,

318
00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:29.110
for kitchen supplies or something, and see like, you know, I like,

319
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.550
I like the way this, like blender fits in this spot or whatever maybe we can do.

320
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.760
So he was, he sort of saw the world in the way.

321
00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:39.430
I think like Saul bellow saw when he like walked among people.

322
00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:42.640
He was like shopping for parts of people to put in his characters in the books.

323
00:17:42.641 --> 00:17:46.600
And Steve jobs was like shopping for little aesthetic things when he went around

324
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:48.490
the world. And so I think he was just like,

325
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.510
I think that was a common theme of what a lot of these,

326
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.650
like these Nobel laureates would do is they really were just curious about the

327
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.630
world. Like they were always, even in their personal time,

328
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:00.510
they were like shopping for new ideas and sometimes those would end up

329
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.250
influencing their, their main work.

330
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.920
<v 0>You illustrate, um, the importance of range or the title of your book,</v>

331
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.600
um, using team GV success at the 2012 Olympics.

332
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.800
So tell us that story.

333
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.810
<v 1>I particularly use this because I was sort of responding to</v>

334
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:27.320
a British writer who I liked by the way, um, who, who said that, uh,

335
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.180
you know, blame some of the problems of British governance on,

336
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:33.680
on moving like different ministers into different positions and said, like,

337
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:37.910
this makes no more sense than moving tiger woods to play hockey or something

338
00:18:37.911 --> 00:18:41.300
like that. And, you know, I think the extreme end of that argument would be,

339
00:18:41.301 --> 00:18:43.220
well, you should just have like a King and they should just like,

340
00:18:43.221 --> 00:18:45.710
stay there all the time. Right. Cause then they'll get the most experience,

341
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.820
but nevermind that. So,

342
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:51.440
but I thought it was interesting that that team GB, um,

343
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.940
has he made that sports analogy?

344
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.100
I had some insight into some of what was going on to try to,

345
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.100
I mean, Britain quite frankly, had, had, uh,

346
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.710
been gone from being a world sporting powerhouse,

347
00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:08.360
to being very mediocre for four decades and then has bounced back

348
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.860
in, in a big way.

349
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.210
And a lot of that had to do with these programs that were set up to actually

350
00:19:14.211 --> 00:19:18.320
find late bloomers. So as one of the architects of this,

351
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.080
this program and a woman named Chelsea ward told me, she said, well,

352
00:19:21.081 --> 00:19:23.030
we know we have these fast risers, right?

353
00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:26.240
Like the kids who develop physically early or whatever it is,

354
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.220
and people pay tons of attention to them,

355
00:19:28.221 --> 00:19:31.370
but they're like the easiest people to spot. And they're the minority,

356
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.020
it's the slow bakers.

357
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.830
These people that we don't pay attention to who could keep coming around and

358
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:40.460
being like the most important members of our programs and we don't pay any

359
00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:41.294
attention to them.

360
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.530
So part of the plan was to reform the pipelines so that these people who

361
00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:49.920
developed more slowly wouldn't get kicked out prematurely and you could,

362
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.100
you could, they could keep themselves in,

363
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.810
even if they weren't the best early on.

364
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.140
And a lot of those people go on to become the world champions and Olympians in

365
00:19:57.141 --> 00:20:01.400
some cases, um, do UK set up even these,

366
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.650
these so-called talent transfer, uh,

367
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.370
programs where you can take someone from one sport and just say, you know,

368
00:20:07.371 --> 00:20:09.980
you're not really gonna make it in this one. You want to try some others.

369
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.450
And occasionally things like that would produce Olympians or gold medalists like

370
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.380
Helen Glover, uh, you know, who, who for awhile, it was probably the,

371
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.870
a rower who was probably the most dominant athlete in the world.

372
00:20:20.871 --> 00:20:24.680
She got spotted in a talent search in Britain. She won,

373
00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:25.820
I think the first her and her,

374
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:30.080
her teammate won the first gold medal for the home team at the 2012 Olympics.

375
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:35.270
She had not road as of the previous Olympics ever. Right? So these are,

376
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.570
this goes really against these 10,000 hours of, well, if you didn't start early,

377
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.050
uh, you lost. And I think, um, you know,

378
00:20:42.051 --> 00:20:43.850
some countries that have realized that that is,

379
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.520
that's not the case have really capitalized on it in,

380
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:50.980
in diversifying their developmental pipeline to capture some of the, you know,

381
00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.900
late bloomers, which typically make up the greater portion of,

382
00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:56.080
of the people who go to the top.

383
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.950
<v 0>And you write about a variety of paths to excellence,</v>

384
00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:05.070
which all involve the sampling period when you just described your sort of

385
00:21:05.071 --> 00:21:07.530
sample sports and various things.

386
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.180
So I must get you to tell us the story of Duke Ellington. Um,

387
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.870
that was just a great example of a different paths.

388
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.900
Definitely not starting early. So.

389
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:23.100
<v 1>Course this came out of my personal interest because I think he's a jazz</v>

390
00:21:23.101 --> 00:21:26.370
musician, um, a, uh,

391
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.930
through his art in important social critic at the time. Um,

392
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.610
and he, he creatively reinvented like his most famous work.

393
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.250
If you Google it as stuff from the thirties, this big band music,

394
00:21:38.251 --> 00:21:41.430
which honestly sounds a little bit like cheesy to my ear, to the modern ear.

395
00:21:41.431 --> 00:21:43.320
But then if you look at his stuff in the sixties,

396
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.970
that people are less familiar with,

397
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.860
it is you would never know as the same musician. And it is amazing,

398
00:21:49.861 --> 00:21:54.090
like go to YouTube, listen to Florette African, um, with Duke Ellington,

399
00:21:54.091 --> 00:21:58.230
it's totally different music and it's, it's very modern and, and incredible.

400
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.990
Um, but he actually had an offer of music lessons when he was a kid from this,

401
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.090
I love the name of his, the teacher. He was offered Marietta clink scales. Um,

402
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.300
and he decided not to do it because he wasn't interested at the time he was

403
00:22:12.301 --> 00:22:15.690
focused on baseball and painting and drawing. He actually was offered, uh,

404
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.770
an art scholarship to college, but turned it down. And it was only, you know,

405
00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:22.680
it was about seven years after that.

406
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.520
And he was a teenager where he heard ragtime and said, you know,

407
00:22:26.521 --> 00:22:28.620
now that that I'm interested in.

408
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.340
And then he went to the piano himself and started trying started trying to copy

409
00:22:32.341 --> 00:22:36.930
and work things out. And a theme for him became that he was,

410
00:22:36.931 --> 00:22:40.920
he wanted to go and immerse himself and sort of try and experiment and learning

411
00:22:40.921 --> 00:22:44.160
by sort of being told, do this over and over and over, um,

412
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.590
was not the thing for him. And I think,

413
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.610
I think that is sort of in fact, I mean,

414
00:22:50.611 --> 00:22:54.720
he became at one time the preeminent creative composer in the United States,

415
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.610
and he was still using some of his own made up notation because he had never

416
00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:02.850
formally learned like real musical notation and people had to sort of like

417
00:23:02.851 --> 00:23:04.890
transcribe it for him. And that,

418
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.830
that sort of is in line with a lot of research that suggests, look,

419
00:23:07.831 --> 00:23:11.250
if you're just looking to try to play classical music,

420
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.010
then this huge amount of repetition. Absolutely.

421
00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:17.610
But if you're looking to create and compose, then sometimes this,

422
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.020
this process that is much slower at the beginning where you sort of dive in and

423
00:23:22.021 --> 00:23:25.950
fail and are immersed and it should be more like the way we learn language,

424
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.860
right? Like you don't get taught grammar first. You, you,

425
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.810
you jump in and you try and you fail and later if ever

426
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.530
you learn the grammar. Right. I, I mean, I'm a writer. I, I don't know.

427
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.260
I know very little about grammar is kind of, well,

428
00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:43.890
I'm not embarrassed by it anymore because now, but like, you know,

429
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.100
my in-laws sometimes still make fun of me because I don't know,

430
00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:49.400
like formal rules of grammar. And I'm like, but it's okay. I mean,

431
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:50.750
I'm living with professional writers.

432
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:54.260
So obviously it's not holding me back in the same way that many of the great

433
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:58.460
jazz musicians either learn to read music late or never learned to read music

434
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:03.140
late. And so when they had to learn early on, it was as much initially slower,

435
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.740
but more immersive creative experimental process that,

436
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.800
that grew very organically into their creativity.

437
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:11.201
<v 0>I love that.</v>

438
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:15.820
To joke that you mentioned in the book when a jazz musician is asked,

439
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:20.380
um, can you read music? The answer is not enough to affect my plate,

440
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:25.540
not enough to hurt my plan. Um, David's actually fascinating.

441
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:30.160
I want to kind of get into now some of the, um, the concepts, um,

442
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.010
but all these stories illustrate. So, um,

443
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.310
I'm going to rattle through a couple of them and, um, get you to elaborate.

444
00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:40.030
So reasoning by broad analogy.

445
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.560
So we've touched on that already.

446
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.330
That's sort of one of the takeaways another takeaway is, and this,

447
00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:46.960
this is very interesting, um,

448
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.490
why you have to set aside expertise sometimes, um,

449
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.090
cause there's a problem of deep and specialized expertise.

450
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:56.950
So just kind of talk us through that.

451
00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.880
<v 1>Yeah. So I think one of the, um,</v>

452
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.610
the problems with expertise sometimes, and again, I,

453
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.680
I don't mean to suggest that we, we don't need it,

454
00:25:08.681 --> 00:25:13.450
but is the over use of solutions that may have

455
00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:16.030
worked in certain situations or that people have gotten used to,

456
00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:17.290
even if they don't work anymore.

457
00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:21.700
So to give one sort of stunning example like there, um,

458
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.180
some interesting work by an economist recently in two S two Harvard led studies

459
00:25:25.181 --> 00:25:28.540
that found that in the U S again, it's specific to us.

460
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.270
If you're checked into academic hospitals.

461
00:25:31.271 --> 00:25:35.620
So hospitals associated with universities with certain cardiac conditions,

462
00:25:35.621 --> 00:25:39.790
like a heart attack and the dates of a national cardiology convention,

463
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.470
when the most esteemed specialists are away, you're less likely to die.

464
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.940
And the conclusion the researchers made is that there's a lower rate of these

465
00:25:48.941 --> 00:25:50.620
very intensive procedures.

466
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.290
That specialists are very used to doing over and over,

467
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.820
even though the evidence has shown either that they don't work in certain

468
00:25:57.821 --> 00:26:01.060
situations, you know, they're, they're dangerous or they're ineffective or both,

469
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.060
and yet they keep doing it anyway.

470
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.480
And initially this was thought maybe to be these sorts of phenomenon to be

471
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.180
coupled to compensation, right.

472
00:26:10.181 --> 00:26:13.180
But then some institutions tried to decouple the number of times you do a

473
00:26:13.181 --> 00:26:16.390
procedure from compensation and it still stayed. So it's a deeper bias.

474
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.060
And if you go look in specialist journals,

475
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.420
you'll see even when overwhelming evidence contradicts some practice,

476
00:26:22.421 --> 00:26:25.540
they'll say, but I've seen it work. Right. Which of course,

477
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.260
the reason we have science is because you can't just tell at work from having

478
00:26:29.261 --> 00:26:30.094
seen something work.

479
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.930
And so you can get this effect where people do things

480
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.370
like without thinking about it really, or in a situation that's changed,

481
00:26:39.371 --> 00:26:44.250
or even in spite of evidence. And one of the examples I use later the book, um,

482
00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:49.080
come from a psychologist named Carl White, who studied, uh, organizations that,

483
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.640
that have to perform under high pressure and high reliability. And so they,

484
00:26:52.641 --> 00:26:54.180
they train really a lot, you know,

485
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.790
over and over and over and over to create so-called muscle memory.

486
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.800
And then the problem sort of becomes when a situation changes and they do those

487
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:02.820
same things anyway.

488
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.560
So something like 80% of commercial air traffic, uh,

489
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:12.090
accidents happen because a flight crew sticks to like the familiar procedure,

490
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.350
even when to an outsider,

491
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:17.940
it's clear that the situation has changed or is why one of his famous examples

492
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.680
was in wilderness, uh, wilderness firefighters where, you know,

493
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:25.440
they'll either hike in or parachute into a fire's fire fire,

494
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.160
and try to dig a trench around it. And they're very elite, you know,

495
00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:31.410
highly trained professionals.

496
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.260
And they do a really good job except occasionally something unexpected happens

497
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:38.370
like a fire jumps from one hillslope to another and starts chasing them uphill.

498
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.630
And what he,

499
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.380
what he found unusual in those cases is that when there would be a tragedy and

500
00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:45.780
there'd be loss of life and bodies would be recovered,

501
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.530
they would often still have like 200 pounds of equipment on them.

502
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.620
Only 50 feet away from where they could have run to safety.

503
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.440
And what he learned was that they would not,

504
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.080
they were unwilling to drop their tools. So he used this phrase,

505
00:27:58.081 --> 00:28:00.210
drop their tools, um,

506
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.100
which meant to dispense with your familiar procedures when the situation has

507
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:08.040
changed, but they were so highly trained, never to get rid of your tools.

508
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.800
Your tools are part of your identity as a wilderness firefighter.

509
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:14.310
They save your life that even when they were being commanded to do so,

510
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:17.100
drop your tools and run, they would not do so.

511
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.810
And they would die holding their tools.

512
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.520
And eventually this finding actually led to diversification of training in some

513
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:24.810
of these areas where people are,

514
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.720
have more improvisation built into their training,

515
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:32.340
but he saw this issue of dropping your tools as sort of an allegory for a

516
00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:35.910
variety of industries where people continue doing something they're used to,

517
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.860
even when the problem in front of them has changed.

518
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:44.480
<v 0>Um, um, I want to focus on one more aspect, um,</v>

519
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.560
which is grit. So you write that grit has two parts,

520
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.740
a work ethic and resilience, and a second part,

521
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.500
which is knowing exactly what one wants.

522
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.330
So tell us the beast story and, um, and why,

523
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.260
um,

524
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:04.670
how that story and grit predicts success better than comprehensive scores and

525
00:29:04.671 --> 00:29:07.070
all the kinds of things that we're used to looking at.

526
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.300
<v 1>Yeah. So grit, like you said, again, just a quick refresher for I've,</v>

527
00:29:11.301 --> 00:29:12.640
everyone's probably heard the term, but it's,

528
00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:15.740
it's a psychological construct based on a 12 question survey,

529
00:29:15.741 --> 00:29:19.580
half the points awarded for persistence of effort like perseverance and the

530
00:29:19.581 --> 00:29:21.920
other for so-called consistency of interests, you know,

531
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.660
knowing what you want to do and just that,

532
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.360
and it became really famous with the work of Angela Duckworth.

533
00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:29.240
Another person I really liked by the way, um,

534
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.500
w when she did research at the U S military Academy, um,

535
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.850
so-called West point and the grit survey turned out to be a better predictor of

536
00:29:37.851 --> 00:29:40.180
who would survive beast. The,

537
00:29:40.181 --> 00:29:44.770
the initial orientation that's very physically and emotionally rigorous.

538
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:45.730
Um,

539
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:50.230
it was a better predictor than were traditional things like tests of athleticism

540
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:55.120
and, and standardized tests and, you know, other traditional evaluations.

541
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:58.960
And so I think that was surprise and something that was very interesting. Um,

542
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:02.830
it also turned out to have some predictive value for who would graduate as did

543
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:07.700
those traditional measures. And so that's, that's interesting thing to know the,

544
00:30:07.701 --> 00:30:12.630
the part of it that I critiqued was, um, if you,

545
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.590
so those West,

546
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.160
but the point of West point is not to make these survivors or graduates is to

547
00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:19.860
make the future leaders of the organization in this case, the U S army.

548
00:30:19.861 --> 00:30:23.070
So they have a five-year active duty commitment after they graduate fully

549
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:27.570
funded. And since about the mid 1990s, after those five years,

550
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.660
almost half of them quit like on the day that they were allowed.

551
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.430
So suddenly these very gritty people are dropping like flies, and this and this,

552
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.770
this phenomenon started really in the mid nineties.

553
00:30:37.771 --> 00:30:40.830
So some high ranking officers said, Oh, we have a millennial grip problem.

554
00:30:40.831 --> 00:30:43.260
You know, like, I don't know too much avocado toast,

555
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.050
not enough mortgages or something. I don't know what the exact idea was,

556
00:30:46.051 --> 00:30:48.090
but they thought they had developed a grid problem overnight.

557
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.690
And then a group of officers and researchers decided to study the problem and

558
00:30:51.691 --> 00:30:54.600
found they had not, in fact, developed a grit problem, overnight surprise,

559
00:30:54.601 --> 00:30:59.040
surprise. They had developed a match quality problem. So they were,

560
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.440
they had this traditional structure of you assign someone a career.

561
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:02.700
They can express preferences,

562
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.650
but you assigned them a career track and they get up or out.

563
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.040
And that worked quite well when the rest of our economy was like that with very

564
00:31:08.041 --> 00:31:09.360
little or lateral mobility.

565
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.990
People had discreet periods of training followed by discrete period of work,

566
00:31:12.991 --> 00:31:14.040
where they would do the same thing,

567
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.220
but then enter the knowledge economy and information economy.

568
00:31:17.221 --> 00:31:18.180
And that goes out the window.

569
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.200
And now we prize people who can engage in creative problem,

570
00:31:22.201 --> 00:31:24.690
solving knowledge creation, who are adaptable.

571
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.940
And so these young people start realizing things about themselves in their late

572
00:31:29.941 --> 00:31:33.270
teens and early twenties and realize they have no agency over career matching in

573
00:31:33.271 --> 00:31:35.820
the army. So they would leave to do it outside.

574
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.290
And first the army tried to throw money at them. Um, and that didn't work.

575
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.520
The ones who are going to stay took the money,

576
00:31:41.521 --> 00:31:43.590
the ones are going to leave left anyway, half a billion dollars,

577
00:31:43.591 --> 00:31:44.850
taxpayer money down the drain.

578
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.090
Then they started programs like one called talent based branching,

579
00:31:48.091 --> 00:31:50.190
where instead of saying, here's your career track, get up or out.

580
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.950
They pair these cadets with like a coach or like a mentor.

581
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.830
They let them sample like five different career tracks,

582
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.830
reflect on how each one fits them and,

583
00:31:57.831 --> 00:32:02.040
and learn about themselves as they go 90% of the cadets who went through that

584
00:32:02.041 --> 00:32:06.240
talent based branching program changed their career preference, 90% of them,

585
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.850
and that improved retention where money hadn't.

586
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.840
And so I think as one of the researchers in this area told me, when you get fit,

587
00:32:12.841 --> 00:32:13.890
it looks like grit.

588
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.610
Meaning if you get people in work that fits their interests and abilities, well,

589
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.510
they will display characteristics of grit, even if they didn't before.

590
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.000
And so it's not that I don't think grit is important,

591
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.770
but I think the evidence suggests that there's an even higher return to good

592
00:32:28.771 --> 00:32:33.120
match because people will then display those characteristics, uh, of,

593
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.590
of grit anyway. Um, so that was sort of where I think grit is both important,

594
00:32:37.591 --> 00:32:42.590
but also some of our extrapolations about it have been

595
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.770
just like with the tiger woods story have been ill-conceived. And by the way,

596
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.100
Angela Duckworth is she feels the same way.

597
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:53.870
So I highly recommend Google summer is for sampling. It's her,

598
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:57.800
it's a edition of her newsletter that came out like a day before my book.

599
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.780
And it talks a little bit about some of these,

600
00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.600
these misconceptions of Google summaries for sampling Angela Duckworth.

601
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.500
<v 0>Lovely. Um, again, gonna squeeze in one more story for you to tell,</v>

602
00:33:08.501 --> 00:33:11.380
because I think it's a great story to wrap up with, um,

603
00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.800
before I get you to just kind of sum up, um, our takeaways.

604
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.720
I want you to tell us the story of the first time CEO, um,

605
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:24.250
who was also her first professional job at the age of 54,

606
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.410
and she never went to college.

607
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.450
So you ride that uncommon career paths are actually

608
00:33:31.451 --> 00:33:34.120
common and they're not that rare.

609
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.210
So illustrates the importance of short-term planning.

610
00:33:37.211 --> 00:33:39.100
So tell us that story and about short-term plan.

611
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.960
<v 1>Yeah. And she was, she had one semester of junior college, that's it? Um,</v>

612
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.170
so this is a woman named Frances Hesselbein, um,

613
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.320
who grew up in sort of industrial town in Pennsylvania.

614
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:55.150
And basically her career strategy or lack thereof really was,

615
00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.040
as she said, do what's needed at the time.

616
00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.130
So she would volunteer in her community, or her husband, uh,

617
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.070
had been a military photographer and came back and started a photo store.

618
00:34:03.071 --> 00:34:05.770
And she would just sort of, she was the literal Jack of all trades.

619
00:34:05.771 --> 00:34:08.620
Like if somebody had a weird request, it was like, Francis,

620
00:34:08.621 --> 00:34:12.280
just go figure it out. Like, I remember one story, she told me it was somebody,

621
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.220
someone came in with their dog and said, I want you to take a photo of them,

622
00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:17.860
but I want it to look like a painting, you know, like an oil painting.

623
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:21.040
It's like, all right, Francis go like, figure out how to do that.

624
00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:26.350
And so she was just a sort of Jack of all trades and, and in her mid, uh,

625
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.940
and she, she started volunteering with the girl Scouts eventually.

626
00:34:30.941 --> 00:34:31.870
And she didn't really want to,

627
00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:33.550
but someone from our neighborhood came around and said, look,

628
00:34:33.551 --> 00:34:35.470
we're going to have to disband this group of girls,

629
00:34:35.471 --> 00:34:38.650
unless someone like volunteers to be their leader.

630
00:34:38.651 --> 00:34:40.870
And so Francis does it and says, I'll do it for a few months,

631
00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.750
but then she just keeps doing it and keeps doing and keeps doing it.

632
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.720
And she gets more involved in girl Scouts. And at age 54,

633
00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:50.980
she takes her first professional job as sort of a regional director of the girl

634
00:34:50.981 --> 00:34:55.960
Scouts basically. And then she just starts every time she never wants to.

635
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.660
She always says no to the things. Every time somebody offers her something,

636
00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:01.030
she always says, no, like shortly after that,

637
00:35:01.031 --> 00:35:04.930
which he had said no to someone comes to her and says, look,

638
00:35:04.931 --> 00:35:08.050
we need you to lead the United way fundraising campaign for girl Scouts because

639
00:35:08.051 --> 00:35:12.010
it's in disarray. And if you don't, then we're just gonna, you know, we're,

640
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.030
it's just girl Scouts are gonna lose the partnership. And Francis like fine.

641
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:17.530
If the first she says no. And then she says, well,

642
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.730
if they're gonna lose the partnership, I'll do it.

643
00:35:18.731 --> 00:35:22.930
So she's the first woman to do this. And Johnstown,

644
00:35:22.931 --> 00:35:26.710
Pennsylvania like leads the country in, in giving that year.

645
00:35:26.711 --> 00:35:30.280
And so it's this huge success. Eventually in her sixties,

646
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.000
she goes on to become the CEO of the girl Scouts. Again, something she says no,

647
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:35.710
when they ask her, because the previous,

648
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.210
the previous leaders of the Scouts had been like a woman who started the us

649
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:41.640
coast guard reserve and a university Dean.

650
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:43.800
These people with incredible leadership credentials,

651
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.840
France said one semester of junior college.

652
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:50.280
And it was one of like 350 regional directors. And,

653
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.540
but again, once again,

654
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:54.150
she'd sort of decides to do it and under a little bit of pressure.

655
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.120
And because the organization was tanking early seventies,

656
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.390
society changing for girls and women, a lot of girl Scouts,

657
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.540
not changing very much. So it was in a tailspin losing membership,

658
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.960
losing volunteers. She comes in, throws out all the traditional stuff, right.

659
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:10.140
Which was one of the big moves because they could not the people who are more

660
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.200
steeped in it could not like they had campsites that people weren't using,

661
00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:15.630
but there was so much nostalgic value. They wouldn't get rid of them.

662
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.180
And she was like, we gotta, we gotta save the organization,

663
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.890
rip up the one handbook, make all these handbooks tailored to, um,

664
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.150
her target audiences recreate the leadership team to look like the audience that

665
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:30.060
she wants to serve. As she said, I want, if a,

666
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:32.970
if an indigenous girl on an ice flow in Alaska opens our book,

667
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:37.800
I want her to see herself in a, um, uh, in a girl Scouts manual. Again,

668
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:41.430
this is in the seventies and she saves the organization.

669
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:45.510
She triples minority membership. She has 130,000 volunteers.

670
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.000
So it turns the cookie business into a third of a billion dollars a year.

671
00:36:48.001 --> 00:36:50.910
Whether it's various crises, changes it from an organization,

672
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:52.740
preparing girls for life in the home to one,

673
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:56.700
preparing them for careers in math and science. She gave me, Oh,

674
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:58.830
I guess I did a podcast. We wouldn't be able to see it,

675
00:36:58.831 --> 00:37:01.110
but a badge that came out of her tenures,

676
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.120
binary code for girls learning about computers, um, and it,

677
00:37:05.121 --> 00:37:07.500
and she turned the whole thing, uh, around,

678
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.320
she changed the hierarchical structure to when she called circular management,

679
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:13.050
because she knew she didn't have enough specialty to get all the information she

680
00:37:13.051 --> 00:37:16.470
needed. She needed information flowing from more levels of the organization.

681
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.840
And after that, she tried to retire.

682
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:22.650
And like two days after that got a call from someone saying,

683
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.350
we have an office for you. Come take it. You'll figure out what to do later,

684
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:27.300
which is what she had always done in her life anyway.

685
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:32.010
And she started a leadership Institute that she still runs works five days a

686
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:36.150
week in Manhattan. And she just turned 105 earlier this month. So,

687
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.050
uh, who knows what's next for Francis, but it was,

688
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:43.980
I just used it as this extreme emblematic symbol of this,

689
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.550
this greater research that I profiled called the dark horse project that talks

690
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:49.920
about how people find work that fits them really well.

691
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.360
And basically the pattern was they could have long-term goals, but if so,

692
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.690
they didn't hold to them very tightly. What they really did was say,

693
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.600
here's why I'm right now, here are the options in front of me.

694
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.500
I'm going to do this one.

695
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:03.750
And maybe a year from now will change because I will have learned something

696
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:05.550
about myself or my options will have changed.

697
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.060
And they just keep on doing that over and over, like throughout their,

698
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:12.030
their lifetime until they find better and better matches. And so she's,

699
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:16.080
she sort of occurred to me as an extreme version of that. And also frankly,

700
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:16.831
as someone whose story,

701
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:21.000
I think deserved a lot more attention that the famous management guru,

702
00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:24.300
Peter Drucker at one point called her the greatest CEO in America.

703
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.010
So she deserves more attention.

704
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:31.340
<v 0>Great story to end with. Um, but David, before we wrap up,</v>

705
00:38:31.341 --> 00:38:35.980
I want you to sum up what are your tips, um, to,

706
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.640
uh, for our, um, for those who are tuning in, um,

707
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.550
to become a generalist who try it?

708
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:47.160
<v 1>Yeah. So first don't worry about being behind because, uh,</v>

709
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:52.290
development is so nonlinear, whether that's physical development or your,

710
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.700
your, you know, career development, um, that we are,

711
00:38:56.701 --> 00:39:00.960
our intuition is to see people at a space in time and assume that's a stable

712
00:39:00.961 --> 00:39:04.500
trajectory and that's not, that's just not the case. It's almost never the case.

713
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.090
Um, so don't, don't feel behind it. Doesn't help you.

714
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.060
You don't even know where you're going, but I think an approach,

715
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.360
like I just mentioned those dark horse, the dark horse project people,

716
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.180
a lot of those people ended up with this incredibly broad skillset,

717
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.920
but typically they didn't set out to say like, I'm going to be a generalist.

718
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.950
They set out in search of match quality for their work,

719
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.970
and they would go somewhere and find, um, you know, and you, you only,

720
00:39:29.971 --> 00:39:31.980
you only learn about yourself by doing stuff. My,

721
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.850
my favorite quote in ranges from Herminia Ibarra,

722
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.500
London business school professors, did we learn who we are in practice,

723
00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:38.334
not in theory,

724
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.690
like there's all this personality quiz industry that wants to convince you that

725
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.790
you can just look inside yourself and know what to do.

726
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.180
When in fact you have to do stuff and then reflect on how it fits you,

727
00:39:48.181 --> 00:39:49.260
what you were good at and bad at.

728
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.350
And so these people would take this approach of,

729
00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:57.270
of trying things to figure out about themselves and then pivoting in response to

730
00:39:57.271 --> 00:40:01.740
that, those lessons in that lived experience. And by doing that,

731
00:40:01.741 --> 00:40:05.490
they would end up with this by being curious about themselves and their options,

732
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.040
they would end up with these broad skills.

733
00:40:08.041 --> 00:40:11.340
And so I would say you don't even have to set out to be a generalist,

734
00:40:11.341 --> 00:40:13.620
be curious, diversify your sources of information,

735
00:40:13.621 --> 00:40:18.450
be open-minded and try to get the maximum amount of learning from

736
00:40:18.451 --> 00:40:20.940
each of your experiences about yourself. What surprised you,

737
00:40:20.941 --> 00:40:22.590
what interested you that you didn't expect?

738
00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:24.450
What were you good or bad at that you didn't expect?

739
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.950
That was another surprise in that,

740
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.840
in the Army's talent based branching research,

741
00:40:27.841 --> 00:40:30.780
the cadets were often surprised by things that they weren't as good at as they

742
00:40:30.781 --> 00:40:33.930
thought they would be or interested in things they didn't think they would be

743
00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:37.920
interested in. And so make sure you,

744
00:40:37.921 --> 00:40:42.240
you make the most of those lessons and then don't ignore them like pivot in

745
00:40:42.241 --> 00:40:46.530
response to them. You know, it's, it's, I think we,

746
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.080
everyone wants like a linear looking LinkedIn, you know,

747
00:40:49.081 --> 00:40:53.130
but we shouldn't reward people for forging ahead.

748
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.310
If they learn things that say they should pivot. And in fact,

749
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.840
LinkedIn's own research on a half,

750
00:40:57.841 --> 00:41:00.390
a million members showed that the best predictor of who would go on to become an

751
00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:03.540
executive was the number of different job functions someone had worked at.

752
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.650
And yet you could argue that their product might Augur against people feeling

753
00:41:07.651 --> 00:41:11.850
like they should do that. And so I think we should just don't,

754
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:16.290
you know, don't be scared to try different things, um, and,

755
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.150
and pivot in response to the things you're learning,

756
00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:21.660
take every different opportunity to try something as, um,

757
00:41:21.661 --> 00:41:23.610
an opportunity to learn about yourself and your options.

758
00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:25.170
I forced myself to do it. I keep something.

759
00:41:25.171 --> 00:41:26.850
I called a book of small experiments, right?

760
00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:29.850
Forced myself to investigate something new at least every other month.

761
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.820
And so I think it'd be good if we all had systems for forcing ourselves to

762
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:37.370
diversify our learning a little bit or try new things.

763
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.080
Because once you get competent at something,

764
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.920
most people will settle into that thing and keep doing it at a certain level

765
00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:46.430
forever. If you want to continually get better, you have to do different things.

766
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:49.640
You can't lift the same weight at the same number of times every day and expect

767
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:52.250
to get better. You might not get worse, but you won't get better.

768
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.870
So find methods to diversify,

769
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.410
don't feel behind and pivot in response to the pay attention,

770
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.930
to the lessons you're learning, reflect on them and pivot in response to them.

771
00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.020
<v 0>Great summary, thank you so much. Um, David Epstein,</v>

772
00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.240
I encourage everyone to pick up his book range.

773
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:10.060
Why generalists triumph in a specialized world?

774
00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.620
It's a lively read and they're huge. Um,

775
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.200
a number of just fascinating examples,

776
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:20.680
including when we didn't have time to get to, but I absolutely loved,

777
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.860
which was the story of van Gogh, the painter.

778
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.750
And I think once you read the book,

779
00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:30.460
it'll inspire you to start thinking differently about your path

780
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.890
forward or paths forward.

781
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:37.390
So thanks very much again to David Epstein and thank you all for tuning in for

782
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:42.160
more business podcasts, go to intelligence squared.com. I'm Linda. You.

783
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.960
<v 2>Great. Thanks guys. That was, that was really interesting.</v>

784
00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:50.560
I learned a lot myself there. I love the stories.

785
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.040
<v 1>Tell I have a very digressive brain.</v>

786
00:42:54.041 --> 00:42:58.810
So as basically as digressive as my book is that's me being organized in my

787
00:42:58.811 --> 00:42:59.650
thinking. So.

788
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.260
<v 0>Your summary was great.</v>

789
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:06.490
I just wanted to give you a chance to summarize because there's so many never

790
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.510
covered everything, but it was so interesting. I found the book counselor.

791
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.050
They interesting, so many different.
