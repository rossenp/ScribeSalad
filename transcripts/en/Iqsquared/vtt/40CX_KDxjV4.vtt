<v 0>Hello, I'm Joshua Rosenberg on a legal commentator,</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.470
and I've been invited by intelligence squared to present this podcast.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.870
Joining me is Chris Dore,

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.460
QC it barrister specializing in criminal law and author of a new book called

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.410
justice on trial radical solutions for a system at

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:21.150
breaking point. Chris,

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:25.110
we've seen quite a few memoirs by criminal lawyers over the years,

8
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:28.650
and we've even seen one or two books by lawyers who think that the criminal

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.580
justice system is broken. What's what's special about your book?

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.530
<v 1>I think it's the fact that I'm trying to draw together all of the strands in one</v>

11
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:41.030
place. Um, I, I, it's not a memoir. Uh, although there are case studies,

12
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:44.900
as you know, and, and examples of the kind of cases I've done over a 25,

13
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.360
26 year career as a criminal defense lawyer. But,

14
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.980
but what I'm trying to do in the book is really try and hit the main headlines

15
00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:53.240
of what's wrong with the system.

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.330
And many books have done that too in different ways in the past, as you say,

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.890
but then brought it all together in a kind of overarching kind of

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.000
polemic. If you like, as to, as to what we can do about it,

19
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:09.410
some real practical solutions as to how we can stop wasting money and stop

20
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.440
wasting lives in criminal justice, which suddenly I think we just do too much.

21
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.671
<v 0>What about that?</v>

22
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:17.750
Because you subtitled your book radical solutions for a system at breaking

23
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:18.081
point,

24
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:22.970
and perhaps the most radical visa is summed up in the title of chapter two,

25
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.050
why we should close all prisons, all prisons.

26
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.430
<v 1>Yes. All prisons as we know them now. So my, my, um,</v>

27
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.110
very strong belief is that the infrastructure of prisons, which largely is a,

28
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.650
is a hangover from the Victorian era. In fact, we still have many prisons, um,

29
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.830
which are operating, which were built in the Victorian era,

30
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:47.430
such as Strangeways in Manchester and many of the other large city prisons. Uh,

31
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.350
my view is that it's the infrastructure and the architecture of those

32
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.500
institutions, which actually in many ways, perpetuates criminality, which,

33
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.180
which creates an atmosphere within the institutions,

34
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:03.140
which really just says to people you're a criminal and we're going to treat you

35
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:07.280
like one and unsurprisingly, when you treat someone like a criminal,

36
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.340
they come out even more of a criminal than the one we went in.

37
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.080
<v 0>Picture. But, but I mean, you know, all prisons have walls.</v>

38
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:19.330
All prisons have bars, some prisons are modern, some prisons,

39
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.990
reasonably attractive. They're quite spacious those, uh, out in, out in, uh,

40
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.300
out of the city centers. Um,

41
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.880
are you saying that those are unsatisfactory as well?

42
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.660
<v 1>Well, it's very interesting. No, they're all on satisfactory.</v>

43
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.570
It's very interesting that you should say that they all have bars and they all

44
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:37.940
have walls in Britain. That's largely the case,

45
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.420
although not completely some of the low security prisons don't have walls for

46
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:45.710
example, and don't have bars. Um, but in other countries,

47
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.490
and I talk extensively about a number of other countries from a sort of extreme

48
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.450
deep South kind of, uh, a dystopian nightmare of the prisons of,

49
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.380
of the U S to the much more pragmatic, uh, uh,

50
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.240
progressive prisons of the Scandinavian countries. And in those countries,

51
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.790
prisons don't look like prisons. As we know them,

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.140
they look like residential communities. Now, some of them, but for the,

53
00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:10.930
for those who are the most dangerous prisoners have security measures and

54
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.150
security fencing to prevent people escaping.

55
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.760
But once you get into the secure environment,

56
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.990
they try to make the environment look as much like normality as much as like the

57
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.250
outside world as possible.

58
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.300
And that's where I'm coming from because the focus of our prison system has

59
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:29.050
always been the client of the prison Gates and locking people up behind these

60
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.780
big walls and cell doors and bar AHS.

61
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.650
And actually the focus shouldn't be on the shocking and scaring people.

62
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.540
The moment they go into prison, it should be,

63
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.800
how do we prepare that person to actually fairly seamlessly move from prison

64
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:45.130
into normal life, where they can have a job. They can look after their family.

65
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.580
Um, and at the moment we're failing completely on that school because people are

66
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:52.690
just living in this state of alienation in this entirely, um,

67
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.690
kind of different universe of being prison. And when they come out,

68
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.850
they're blinking in the sunlight. They have no idea what to do.

69
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.830
And unsurprisingly, most of them commit more crime.

70
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.500
<v 0>Way. Of course,</v>

71
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:06.330
that we do prepare prisoners to be released is by putting them in open prisons.

72
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:07.164
And as you say,

73
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.270
there are some prisons where prisoners go out to work during the day and apart

74
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:16.470
from one or two punishment cells that they may have, uh, anybody who, uh,

75
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.640
disobeys the rules before they're chucked out of these open prisons and returned

76
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:25.560
to close conditions, they are, um, they don't have bars on the, on the,

77
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.250
on the doors and, you know, you can walk in and out of them all,

78
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.050
obviously you have to return and obey the rules,

79
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.430
but you are acknowledging though that some prisoners will still have to be

80
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:39.780
behind bars, even if the architecture is better than we have at the moment.

81
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 1>Yeah. So for me,</v>

82
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.960
the important statistic and I deal with it extensively in the book is that 69%

83
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:50.580
of those who are in prison today every day in the UK on non-violent

84
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:51.390
offenders.

85
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.110
So they don't present a risk to the public of hurting people with committing

86
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:56.940
serious assault or murder or rape.

87
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.810
They are people who have committed crimes often financially driven and often

88
00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:02.430
drug-related. And that's as you know,

89
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.480
a large chunk of the book revolves around drug policy. So yes,

90
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:08.610
there is a small minority of the prison population,

91
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:12.840
probably 10 to 15% who represented ongoing and immediate risk of harm to the

92
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:15.540
public. And they need to be kept in secure conditions,

93
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.610
but nearly every one of those will be released bar about

94
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.350
60 or 70, who are serving what we call full life terrorists, but,

95
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:26.130
but whole life terrorists rather. Um,

96
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.140
so 99.9% of all prisoners, no matter how violent the crime,

97
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.390
no matter if they've committed murder or several murders,

98
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.210
the great majority will be released one day.

99
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.990
And so even those most dangerous ones, they need to be kept secure,

100
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.780
but you've still once you've got them in a secure environment,

101
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:44.940
which can be done through electronic means. And of course,

102
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.440
through fencing and the light that doesn't have to be a great big brick wall to

103
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:52.740
keep people in. But once they're inside the environment,

104
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.410
I still believe no matter how serious their crime that they should be treated or

105
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.870
that the conditions should be as normal as possible.

106
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.930
They should have normal living arrangements as much as possible, for example,

107
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:04.400
to cook their own food in all the kitchens,

108
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:08.420
rather than so shuffling into a Victoria mess hall, queuing up for food,

109
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.300
to be slopped onto a plate, the sort of conventional image of prisons.

110
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.260
That's just putting people in an environment which takes them away from the

111
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.530
mainstream and makes it harder and harder for them to reintegrate when they

112
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:19.364
finally get out.

113
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.850
<v 0>But what you say is that we should leave those convicted of most crimes in their</v>

114
00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:28.420
own homes. You would prefer not to send many prisoners,

115
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.210
people who go to prison at the moment to prisoner tool.

116
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.340
You would prefer them to be monitored by electronic tags and so on.

117
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.510
But as you know, better than most people, many criminals don't have homes.

118
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:43.810
And if you didn't lock them up while they were awaiting trial,

119
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.420
they'd never turn up in court and they'd never be convicted.

120
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.531
<v 1>Well, I,</v>

121
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:50.410
I don't think we should be using the criminal justice system as much as we are

122
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:53.020
anyway, particularly for non-violent crimes. So, uh,

123
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.990
and you're absolutely right that many of those who are in the prisoners state

124
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:59.530
and the prison system are in there because they're homeless because they are

125
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:03.520
addicted to drugs or because they have mental health problems rather than

126
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:05.530
because they are inherently dangerous.

127
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:08.350
People who want to go out and commit crime for its own sake.

128
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.130
And so you're absolutely right to address the issue that many of those who enter

129
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:16.720
the system, they need care. What they don't need is to be punished,

130
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.860
to be locked up in Victorian conditions. Uh, and of course, when you do that,

131
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.620
and I tell the story in the book of, uh, of, uh,

132
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.850
clients and former clients about who,

133
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.250
who for the purposes of the book is called Michael. Um,

134
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.450
and he'd been in prison for 30 out of his 52 or so years of life.

135
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.410
And he told me very clearly. And, and I tell the, tell you the book. He said, I,

136
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.390
I don't, I don't like it on the outside.

137
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.010
I only know prison is the only way of life I have. And so when you,

138
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.700
when you spending millions to keep people locked up in institutions,

139
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:48.490
only for them to just keep coming back through the revolving door,

140
00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:51.850
you've got to ask yourself why what's the point of that. Um,

141
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.420
but to answer your direct question. So, so of course anyone who's homeless,

142
00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:58.240
shouldn't be homeless. So whether a criminal or not, and if we,

143
00:07:58.241 --> 00:08:02.410
as a society accepting that people can be homeless and we just don't care and

144
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:05.560
therefore we'll put them in prison instead of, instead of a home,

145
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.380
then we're clearly getting something seriously wrong because as you know,

146
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:11.860
it cost 50,000 or so on average a year to keep someone in prison.

147
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.860
It costs a lot less than that to house someone in the community,

148
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.440
outside of prison and provide them safe, uh,

149
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.360
hygienic conditions and the ability to access health care and, you know,

150
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.590
decent living conditions.

151
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.830
So if someone's committed a non-violent crime and they're homeless,

152
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:29.380
then they should be given accommodation, but they shouldn't be sent to prison.

153
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.960
<v 0>Last question from me on prisons, um,</v>

154
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.250
it's almost 250 years since John Howard,

155
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.230
the great prison reformer, uh,

156
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.850
gave evidence to MPS on conditions in prisons. And of course,

157
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:47.410
many people have followed him over the centuries. What makes you think that, uh,

158
00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:48.244
with your book,

159
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.780
you're going to be any more successful in engendering a reform of the prison

160
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:53.614
system?

161
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.670
<v 1>Well, it's a, it's a good question. And I, uh,</v>

162
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.260
my concern is actually that no matter how rational the suggestions and I believe

163
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.600
that they are really quite sensible and pragmatic,

164
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.050
they're not even complicated suggestions, but particularly around drug reform,

165
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:09.010
particularly around, uh, the,

166
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.650
just the S the complete failure of prisons to actually produce the

167
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.280
outcome that people want, which is fewer criminals and less crime.

168
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.230
That's the point of the criminal justice system,

169
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:22.650
and yet the criminal justice system and the prisons in particular achieve the

170
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:24.660
diametric opposite of that. So,

171
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.350
all I can hope is that by making an argument and I'm trying to make it

172
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:32.880
passionately, but also calmly and clearly basing it on evidence.

173
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:35.100
And I've traveled as you know, for the book all over the world,

174
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.310
I've been into prisons in different countries. I've looked at court systems,

175
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.570
I've interviewed judges from,

176
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:43.320
from different jurisdictions and prosecutors or defense lawyers and the

177
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:47.820
cumulative evidence that I am absolutely no doubt about is that the way we're

178
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:49.140
doing it now is failing.

179
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.340
And that there is a much more sensible way of trying to address crime,

180
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:56.970
which will actually save lives and reduce the amount of victims of crime.

181
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.250
And I guess, Joshua, the answer is,

182
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:03.240
am I cynical about whether there's likely to be uptake? Yes, I am.

183
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:06.360
Am I skeptical as to whether the politicians will buy into this? Yes,

184
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:11.010
I am sadly, but that, you know, I've had 25, 26 years of doing this job.

185
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.510
And I think a lot of what I do,

186
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.970
and a lot of what those of us in the system do is,

187
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.690
is really a waste of time because it achieves nothing except making things

188
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:19.350
worse.

189
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.300
So I think it's almost juicy bound to kind of say the emperor's got no clothes.

190
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.710
W w w we,

191
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:29.700
we pay lip service to justice and punishment and rehabilitation,

192
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:31.740
but actually the whole system is broken.

193
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.070
And if my ideas can get people talking,

194
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:38.820
and if we can even get a few steps on the road to a much more sensible,

195
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.990
a much more fair and rational system, then, then job done. Um,

196
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.990
cause at the moment there's very little debate actually around these things.

197
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.770
<v 0>All right, well, let's move on to chapter three,</v>

198
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.540
which is called why we should legalize drugs, all drugs.

199
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.780
<v 1>Drugs. Uh, absolutely. Uh,</v>

200
00:10:56.781 --> 00:11:01.370
and of course the arguments I make is not as some would no doubt, um,

201
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.980
characterize it that there's a free for all, of course,

202
00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:07.490
there isn't any more than there's a free for all for alcohol or cigarettes. Uh,

203
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.010
you would have quality controls. You would have licensing,

204
00:11:10.011 --> 00:11:13.520
you would have processes and age restrictions and all of the things that go with

205
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:18.260
any licensed in toxicant, uh, wherever that, that might be sold in the world.

206
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.580
Um, but absolutely because the minute you start to prohibit a substance,

207
00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:26.510
you create a black market for that substance. And once you have a black market,

208
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.850
that's where chaos reigns, that's where deaths happen.

209
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.100
And that's where overdoses happen.

210
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.890
That's where violent gang violence and turf Wars happened in a prohibited

211
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:38.060
market. So you can't, you can't, um, uh,

212
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.360
as you were carve some drugs out of legalization,

213
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:45.260
any more than you can cough most alcoholic drinks out of the system. I mean,

214
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:49.790
there are very, very, for an alcoholic drinks available to buy at 60, 70%,

215
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.013
80% proof,

216
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.940
but you restrict the sale of it and you restrict the licensing conditions around

217
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:56.350
those products. Um,

218
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.070
but if you restrict them too much and you make them accessible to people who

219
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:01.030
want them, then they,

220
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:04.390
then they will go to a dealer and there will be a black market. So,

221
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.790
absolutely I, I, I understand the argument. Some people say, well,

222
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.850
let's legalize cannabis. Actually cannabis is quite a dangerous drug, uh,

223
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.880
objectively, it's not as dangerous as alcohol or tobacco,

224
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:15.640
but it's still a dangerous drug. Um, so I don't,

225
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:17.920
I don't buy into the whole classification.

226
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:21.310
One's better than another basically human beings take drugs.

227
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.140
And this is the point I'm making the book. As you know,

228
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.880
I w P human beings have taken,

229
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.690
there is evidence that human beings were ingesting psychotropic plants as long

230
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:30.040
as 200 million years ago.

231
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.960
And certainly for tens of millions and certainly throughout human civilization

232
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.560
for, for the last 10,000 years, you'll never going to stop it.

233
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:40.660
And the point I make is if you can't stop something,

234
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.530
you need to regulate license and control the supply of it so that you create

235
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.360
safer conditions for those who choose to use.

236
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.780
<v 0>And now you say regulate and control the supply, but if you make drugs legal,</v>

237
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.350
then surely more people will take them. Is that right or not?

238
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.560
<v 1>That's not the evidence of any system where there's been a degree of</v>

239
00:12:58.561 --> 00:13:01.590
liberalization or degree of decriminalization,

240
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.810
but what we haven't seen actually,

241
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:06.900
other than in a few States in the U S and a few other countries in relation to

242
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:07.763
cannabis,

243
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.510
but we haven't seen is a comprehensive regulatory and

244
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:15.000
licensing system of the kind that is applied to alcohol,

245
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.490
so that you have to have a license to sell it.

246
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.980
You have to have a license to produce it. You have to,

247
00:13:19.981 --> 00:13:23.610
you can only produce a certain standards. Um, I mean, one of the,

248
00:13:23.611 --> 00:13:26.880
I think the main point of the book, when you go buy a children's toy,

249
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.390
it's subject to 57 different regulations from the EU,

250
00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:33.210
from international regulation to every degree of safety standard,

251
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.860
and yet a 15 year old child.

252
00:13:34.861 --> 00:13:37.350
As I tell the tragic story of Martha from back in the book,

253
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:40.320
a 15 year old child can go out on the streets and buy ecstasy.

254
00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:42.930
That's 91% pure that could kill a horse,

255
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.100
and there's no regulation, and there's no licensing of that product.

256
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.170
<v 0>There's no regulation, except that is illegal. But, but let, let, let, let,</v>

257
00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:54.900
let me talk about the age, because you say that she was a 15 year old girl,

258
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.430
she sadly died. Um, you say you would set an age limit for, uh,

259
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.850
purchasing drugs legally. W where would you put that age limit?

260
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.690
<v 1>Well, the age, the age may vary depending on the drug. Um, uh, but I, I,</v>

261
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:11.880
I think that 16 or 18 was a logical is a logical place to start, uh,

262
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.450
depending on the nature of the drug. Um, but, but you, you make a valid point,

263
00:14:15.451 --> 00:14:17.730
which is yes, of course, under any system,

264
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.670
you wouldn't make drugs freely available to ten-year-olds, for example.

265
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.580
<v 0>Hey, you, you say, you say 16, and this girl who tragically died was 15.</v>

266
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:31.410
So she wanted to continue to take drugs as she did. Um,

267
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.990
then she would have to take drugs illegally.

268
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.770
<v 1>Yes, she would. But the, but the, the product to which she would have access,</v>

269
00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:39.960
just like when a 17 year old drinks, alcohol,

270
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.730
the 17 year old who drinks alcohol,

271
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:45.720
doesn't go and take a hundred percent volume moonshine. They get alcohol,

272
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:47.640
that's been bought by someone else,

273
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:49.680
legally in a supermarket or an offline license.

274
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.860
And they know that it's what the product is.

275
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.990
That doesn't mean it can't make the meal, but what they,

276
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.040
what they can't do as a 15 or 16 year old is go buy alcohol. That will,

277
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:02.240
if they take one drink of it will kill it. That's the difference.

278
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:02.681
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

279
00:15:02.681 --> 00:15:07.630
But the 15 year old might still be targeted by a pusher who would give

280
00:15:07.631 --> 00:15:11.530
her, uh, dangerous drugs. And under your scheme,

281
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.210
she would have to get an older person to buy her, the drug parent,

282
00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:21.010
perhaps older sibling, or lie about her age and, and, and commit an offense.

283
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.800
So she would just, uh,

284
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.300
still be targeted by drug pushers or by people who would sell her drugs more

285
00:15:28.301 --> 00:15:30.700
cheaply than she could buy them lawfully. Surely.

286
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.760
<v 1>Well, no, if you think about it. So Martha's mother, uh,</v>

287
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.020
Emory who I interviewed for the book and I, I,

288
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:40.210
I was a really kind of powerful source of, of both information,

289
00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:44.050
but also kind of common sense of pragmatism Martha's mother is in no doubt.

290
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.600
And I'm in no doubt that no, no, in a,

291
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:49.000
in a market where you could go and buy ecstasy tablets,

292
00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:53.230
or FDMA the strength that is the strength that users want to take.

293
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:56.350
So it gets them high, but they come down the next day and they're okay.

294
00:15:56.351 --> 00:16:00.010
A couple of days later that nobody wants to take 91% pure MTMA,

295
00:16:00.011 --> 00:16:03.790
which will kill you, which will instantly kill you. Nobody wants to take that.

296
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.300
And no dealer wants to sell that to somebody, but she was,

297
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:11.830
she didn't buy it at 91% pure because the dealer intended to sell her 91% pure.

298
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.510
The dealer didn't know, that's the thing you were in, in the,

299
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:16.450
in an uncontrolled unregulated market,

300
00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:19.390
drugs are mixed up in cement mixers or people's kitchens.

301
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.690
So someone's got 0% and someone else has got 91%.

302
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.150
If you have a market where the, where the,

303
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.030
the dosage is controlled and written on the packet,

304
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.540
there is absolutely no incentive for people to buy drugs.

305
00:16:31.541 --> 00:16:34.240
That'd be produced in another way, any more than the race,

306
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.600
an incentive for people to go out and buy alcohol that's been produced

307
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.110
illegally, or, or still somewhere there's a tiny,

308
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.080
tiny percentage of alcoholism is made in that way, but it's,

309
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.530
it's insignificant 99% of alcohol is either sold,

310
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.100
is a licensed illegal product. It may have been bought by someone under age,

311
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.830
but at least the product is as safe as it can be.

312
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.660
And you know what you're taking and the,

313
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.810
and the point I'm making the book is if Martha had been 15 and she'd pass

314
00:16:58.811 --> 00:17:00.940
herself off as 18 as he went into a pub,

315
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.810
what she couldn't do is buy a drink that she sit and then dropped dead on the

316
00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:07.600
floor. And she was able to do that in this market.

317
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.330
<v 0>Let's talk about heroin. Uh,</v>

318
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.980
heroin would be available to heroin users. Uh,

319
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.600
would these people be able to hold down responsible jobs while

320
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.890
taking heroin so that they could pay for their drugs or would heroin use?

321
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.860
<v 1>It's a very good question. So we're very good question.</v>

322
00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:29.980
So one of the places I've visited in the course of my research was the heroin

323
00:17:29.981 --> 00:17:34.000
assisted treatment program in Geneva and Switzerland is led the way for many,

324
00:17:34.001 --> 00:17:34.780
many years,

325
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.710
Switzerland had a horrific problem with heroin in the eighties and the fruits of

326
00:17:38.711 --> 00:17:41.890
the early nineties, where they had people shooting up in parks.

327
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.100
They had skyrocketing levels of HIV infection.

328
00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:47.890
They had massive rates of overdose and heroin deaths.

329
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.310
So they decided to do something about it.

330
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.680
And what they did was introduced a number of different measures,

331
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:56.430
but the most radical and the most important one was a heroin assisted treatment

332
00:17:56.431 --> 00:18:01.200
program where heroin users were, are able. And I saw them, I visited the center.

333
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:04.860
I spoke to the head of the unit psychiatrist, wonderful psychiatrist, uh,

334
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.770
out there. And they visit the center twice a day.

335
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.950
They come in the morning and they come in the evening. And many, many of them,

336
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.500
if not the majority do exactly what you say,

337
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:16.800
which is they come for their heroin in the morning, they go to work or college,

338
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.390
they come back, they have more heroin in the evening,

339
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.600
and then they carry on with their lives. And then they get that heroin.

340
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.970
<v 0>I was just going to say, is the heroin provided free for them?</v>

341
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.600
Or these are the sentences?

342
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.380
<v 1>Well, not exactly. They have a very interesting approach in Switzerland.</v>

343
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:34.700
So this is the Swiss Supreme court decided that heroin addiction and the other

344
00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:36.250
addictions, uh, uh,

345
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.160
our disability in law and therefore under Swiss law,

346
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.090
a disability is something for which you're entitled to very substantial health

347
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.133
and financial support.

348
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.830
If it's a physical disability or a mental health disability, or an addiction,

349
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.000
they're treated the same way.

350
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.320
So what happens is that heroin addicts I'll give them the same medical and

351
00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:57.830
social security payments as everybody else. Who's disabled,

352
00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.430
who may not be able to walk or may need assistance with their life in another

353
00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:05.120
way. And it's that benefit as it were as a disabled, as the disability,

354
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.140
as an illness, which is used to fund the heroin assisted treatment program,

355
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.680
which provides the heroin, but of course, heroin, pharmaceutical, heroin,

356
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.230
which is pure, and which has a known dosage,

357
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.550
and which cannot possibly have any adulterants that a or B of such a sprint that

358
00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:21.620
it would kill you is actually relatively cheap.

359
00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.520
It's not an expensive product to produce for a government under license.

360
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.570
It's only expensive when it's sold on the street by dealers who have to have a

361
00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:33.620
whole criminal supply chain going right back to Afghanistan,

362
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.350
or all the original poppy fields where the, where the,

363
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.750
where the heroin or the opium poppies are growing.

364
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.250
It's because of all the illegality and the need to constantly sell and resell

365
00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:46.730
and cut and uncut. And so that's why street heroin is so expensive.

366
00:19:46.731 --> 00:19:49.490
And that's why street heroin users have to commit so much crime,

367
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.040
but actually their dosage costs just a few,

368
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.760
few quid a day when it's produced and supplied lawfully by the state.

369
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.810
Cause it's not an expensive drug. So, so what happens in Switzerland?

370
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.730
What's the outcome. The outcome is straightforward.

371
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.620
The vast majority of those patients who go to that unit live a law abiding life

372
00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:09.260
and don't commit crime because they don't need to because they don't have to go

373
00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:13.190
out and commit crime to get the heroin. And the vast majority is 80% in the end,

374
00:20:13.191 --> 00:20:14.680
come off heroin because,

375
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.010
because actually heroin use is often symptomatic of some other issue in life.

376
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.700
It's often symptomatic that someone's in distress or has mental health problems,

377
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.563
or is in pain.

378
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.440
And once they're in the medical system and they obtain their hair, heroin,

379
00:20:27.441 --> 00:20:31.010
medically, all of those other problems start to be solved as well.

380
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.450
And so you see heroin usage over time reduces there is the level of crime

381
00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:39.380
reduces or the overall cost of that system per user is,

382
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.790
is a tiny fraction of the overall cost that we spend in this country on and in

383
00:20:43.791 --> 00:20:47.180
the U S on heroin users, which of course is mainly criminal justice,

384
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.890
health interventions. The cost of that, there were,

385
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.480
there were virtually no heroin overdoses in Switzerland because heroin users

386
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.730
have access to medical care.

387
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.180
They have access to the drugs that are needed if they do take a little bit too

388
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:04.990
much immediately without any judgment upon them. Whereas in Britain,

389
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:07.180
including some of our major cities like Glasgow,

390
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.800
the rate of overdose is absolutely catastrophic and in the States it's even

391
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:14.650
higher. So, so we're killing people by prohibition,

392
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.070
in a country that has legalized and licensed heroin treatment.

393
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.330
The heroin user is much safer. And so is the general public. Okay.

394
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.080
<v 0>I've got some broader questions to ask you in a moment,</v>

395
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:30.030
we're going to take a break. Now I'm Joshua Rosenberg. My guest is Chris Dore,

396
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.880
and we'll be back after this short break,

397
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:35.970
crystal,

398
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.950
your roadmap would be fine if we didn't have to start from where we

399
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:43.650
are. Now, people turn to crime.

400
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.340
People turn to drugs because of the way they were brought up.

401
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.730
If you want to move people away from a life of crime,

402
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.570
you have to start almost at birth. Certainly when they're youngsters,

403
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.520
certainly you have to bring them up in a way that avoids them being drawn into

404
00:21:59.521 --> 00:22:02.250
crime, being drawn into illegal drugs.

405
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:07.020
You can't really adapt the situation now, uh,

406
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.870
without changing the whole thing,

407
00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:14.560
it's going to take you a decade or more of people, uh,

408
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:19.920
in this situation before you can actually start to see reforms,

409
00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:24.240
because it's only the people who you might start to bring up from an early age

410
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.910
now who are going to, uh,

411
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.430
go through with the reform that you're talking about.

412
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:30.540
<v 1>Well,</v>

413
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.130
obviously to completely change and radically changed the entire approach to

414
00:22:35.131 --> 00:22:37.050
criminal justice. Isn't an overnight thing.

415
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.790
And I fully accept that it would take a decade or more to start to see the full

416
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.130
benefits of what I'm proposing apart from anything.

417
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.570
If you're going to knock down a prison that contains a thousand or 1500 people,

418
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.210
uh, or you've then got to find somewhere else for them initially,

419
00:22:51.211 --> 00:22:52.890
or you've got to find some other kinds of, uh,

420
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.560
roots out of the justice system for them. So of course,

421
00:22:55.561 --> 00:22:59.070
rebuilding restructuring the entire prison estate is a massive job,

422
00:22:59.071 --> 00:23:00.840
and it would take a decade or more to do that,

423
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.350
but there are some easy wins and drug legalization,

424
00:23:04.351 --> 00:23:09.330
and licensing is one of the easy wins because drug drug use and drug

425
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.750
prohibition is behind probably by most estimates,

426
00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:15.480
60 to 70% of the entire criminal justice system.

427
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.830
So 60 to 70% of violence, 60, 70% of property crime.

428
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.900
And of course there's drug crime itself,

429
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.280
which many thousands of people are in prison just for,

430
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.420
just for the drug crimes themselves. So just by over a,

431
00:23:27.421 --> 00:23:29.880
say one to two year period, probably two years,

432
00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:33.600
by the time you could do it in a sensible way to move back actually to the

433
00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:36.090
system we used to have in England before 1971,

434
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.730
we used to have what was called the English system,

435
00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:42.780
which was that heroin was available from certain doctors on prescription.

436
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.240
There were a small number of heroin users that were very few problem users. Um,

437
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.540
and then we criminalized it in 1971. And within a decade,

438
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:53.000
there were 300,000 plus people who were addicted to heroin.

439
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.120
And that was the direct effect as I make the point in the book. But,

440
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.990
but if you reverse that course, you would begin to see. So,

441
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.420
so you would stop. Um, for example,

442
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.450
you would shut down much of the organized crime network almost overnight.

443
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.340
I mean, big time drug dealers,

444
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.610
some of whom I've represented some of the largest importers of drugs, uh,

445
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.320
into this country, I'd be my clients.

446
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.460
The one thing they all agree on is that prohibition is great for them. It's the,

447
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.740
it's the only thing that keeps them in business and the,

448
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:22.490
and their absolute worst nightmare is legalization because they suddenly have no

449
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:25.490
source of income anymore. So when you think about it that way round, you know,

450
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.910
why is it that big drug dealers are happy with the status quo? Um,

451
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.130
it does strike you somewhat, you know, uh, of, uh, of, uh,

452
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.700
at least an alarm bell that should be ringing. Um, but,

453
00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:38.090
but legalization and licensing of drugs would have a dramatic effect within a,

454
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.890
within a five-year timeframe.

455
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.730
It would dramatically reduce the volume of people going through the criminal

456
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:44.564
justice system.

457
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.960
It will dramatically reduce the amount of crime and violence on the streets.

458
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.190
And you would see that change very quickly. Some of the other things, I mean,

459
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:55.040
you could also move very quickly on, on my, my other proposal,

460
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:59.120
which is to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 as it is at the

461
00:24:59.121 --> 00:24:59.520
moment,

462
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.840
I'm would predict a situation with 10 year old children are sitting in court,

463
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.980
charged with crimes. I mean, it's just ludicrous and, and,

464
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.750
and offensive to anyone who, who knows anything about children,

465
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.780
let alone anything else. Um, but, but if you did that,

466
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:13.580
if you raise the age of criminal responsibility,

467
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:16.940
as they have done in Luxembourg and most other countries have a much higher age

468
00:25:16.941 --> 00:25:19.970
of criminal responsibility than us, then again,

469
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.050
you would divert what these children who go into the revolving door of criminal

470
00:25:24.051 --> 00:25:27.080
justice from the age of 10, 11, 12, they will be diverted.

471
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:28.430
You'd have to have resources for them,

472
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.360
but it will be a hell of a lot cheaper to provide resources and youth services

473
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:35.510
than it is to put them in the criminal justice system and leave them there for

474
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:36.344
life. I mean,

475
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.190
it costs millions to have a child go through criminal justice for life.

476
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:40.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

477
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.310
I'll ask you about that because I attended the trial of John Venables and Robert

478
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.610
Thompson,

479
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:50.440
the two ten-year-olds who murdered two year old James Bolger in 1993,

480
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.690
uh, as you know, they were tried in an adult court, but they avoid precedent.

481
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.100
Uh, yes. Uh,

482
00:25:57.101 --> 00:26:00.760
and it was extraordinary seeing them because there they were on raised chairs,

483
00:26:00.761 --> 00:26:03.610
but their heads are only just above the level of the dock.

484
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.370
This was Preston crown court, a very traditional court, you know, well,

485
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.470
they avoided the adult prison system, at least Thompson did. Now, as you say,

486
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.430
10 is the age of criminal responsibility in England Wales, Northern Ireland,

487
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.360
Scotland, I think is in the process of raising it from eight to 12.

488
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.403
What do you think insurance?

489
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.270
<v 1>It should be 18 in my view, um, it should be 18 as it is in Luxembourg,</v>

490
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.240
because how can you justify telling a,

491
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.550
a child you're not young enough,

492
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.060
you're not old enough to make a decision as to who you want to be your MP.

493
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.060
You're not old enough to decide whether you have a drink of alcohol or not.

494
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.620
You're not old enough to drive a car,

495
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.940
but you're old enough for us to hold you responsible completely for all of your,

496
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.880
as if you are an adult.

497
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.630
And we will treat you for criminal purposes as if you're an adult,

498
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.750
but for no other purpose, no other purpose.

499
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.520
<v 0>You've represented 17 year old, 16 year olds. Some of them,</v>

500
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.950
I think most people would say are pretty mature.

501
00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.630
They may well be living on their own. Uh, they may have one parent at home,

502
00:27:02.631 --> 00:27:06.080
but they may not be with their parents at all. Uh,

503
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:11.060
surely those people are old enough. Those, uh, senior teenagers,

504
00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:15.560
if you like are old enough to know what's right and wrong, and to be,

505
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.920
uh, to be susceptible to the criminal justice system.

506
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.220
<v 1>I don't agree. I don't agree at all. I don't, you aren't,</v>

507
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.820
you have to make a choice as to what the age of maturity and adulthood is.

508
00:27:25.821 --> 00:27:27.950
And all of the evidence is clear. I mean,

509
00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:31.400
I spent time last year filming a BBC series, and I spent, uh,

510
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.980
some time in a young offender institution in Scotland.

511
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.920
I interviewed the governor that, who I talked about the interview in the book,

512
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.810
and she was crystal clear that the maturation process of a young man,

513
00:27:41.811 --> 00:27:44.360
but also young women in slightly different way. Um,

514
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.230
it really doesn't fully complete until the early to mid twenties.

515
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.860
So the idea that you treat a 15 or 16 or however mature,

516
00:27:51.861 --> 00:27:56.120
they are on the surface in the same way as you would a 30 or 40 year old,

517
00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.470
a mature adult, again, it's just, it defies the evidence.

518
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.610
The evidence is that the maturation process does not really fully complete.

519
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.470
That doesn't mean that you can't, you don't do anything. I mean,

520
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.500
even in a country like Luxembourg, where as I say, you can't be,

521
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.650
you can't be deemed to have committed a crime at the age of 50,

522
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.740
but there are secure schools and they are called schools.

523
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.760
They're places of education where you restrict the Liberty of children who are

524
00:28:19.761 --> 00:28:22.850
very dangerous and violent, and can't be safe to be on the streets.

525
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.000
But it's all about the mindset. It's about once you,

526
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.610
once you tell a child that they're a young offender,

527
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:33.230
they then become an offender and that's what they perceive themselves as.

528
00:28:33.231 --> 00:28:35.570
And that's how they behave. But you treat them as.

529
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.260
<v 0>I was just going to say, surely if you lock them up and as you say,</v>

530
00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:43.070
they would have to be in secure conditions, even if they're being taught.

531
00:28:43.071 --> 00:28:44.990
And so on, surely if you lock them up,

532
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.350
they see themselves as apart from everybody else.

533
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.340
And they see themselves as being punished simply because they can't go out and

534
00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:53.630
enjoy themselves like other teenagers.

535
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.160
<v 1>But, but it would be in my kind of ideal scenario. There'd be very, very few.</v>

536
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.950
I mean, I mean, if you think about the point I made earlier about the,

537
00:29:00.951 --> 00:29:02.090
about the adult prison system,

538
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:06.290
there's only a small percentage of that system who are entrenched violent

539
00:29:06.291 --> 00:29:08.450
individuals who present an immediate risk to the public.

540
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.960
There's an even tinier percentage of young offenders in that category.

541
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.230
And so rather than, you know, having, having a philosophy that you, that you,

542
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.640
it doesn't, you don't distinguish well. I mean,

543
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.500
when you go to a young Zen young offenders institution,

544
00:29:21.501 --> 00:29:24.950
it's just a prison that were prison uniforms. They bang with the cell doors.

545
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.270
It's exactly the same as a prison.

546
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.870
And that's what that's deeply offensive to me. So would,

547
00:29:29.871 --> 00:29:32.300
if you put them in a secure school that had a secure fence,

548
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.590
there would have been a handful for the entire country who will be so dangerous

549
00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:37.820
as to need those conditions.

550
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:43.060
The great majority of children would simply go to a much better

551
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:45.370
form of education environment, which would allow,

552
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.900
which would be specialized around. Many of them are deeply damaged. I mean,

553
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.770
there's a very statistic.

554
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:55.570
I mentioned the book that the care leavers are 15 times more likely to

555
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:59.410
go to prison or young offense institutions than other children. And you, you,

556
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:03.250
you say to yourself, well, how are we not responsible or I do anyway,

557
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.860
how are we not responsible for that? Well, you know, we can't,

558
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:09.820
you can't blame these. They're not 15 times more inherently dangerous at birth.

559
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.540
We've done something with them in the care system and their lives as children

560
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:18.010
have been so damaged that they end up having to go through the system,

561
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.570
or we actually then it trench it or make it worse by criminalizing them and

562
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:25.960
brutalizing them in the, in the, uh, in the custodial environment.

563
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.970
<v 0>But care leavers are precisely the people who are likely to be homeless.</v>

564
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:35.220
They don't have secure home lives. They couldn't live at home and go to school.

565
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.660
So you'd have to put them in some sort of accommodation,

566
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.570
whether you have a high wall around it or not,

567
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.390
because they're the people who need structure,

568
00:30:45.391 --> 00:30:48.600
who needs support and who may well need, uh,

569
00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.930
telling that they must be there and they can't go off.

570
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.830
And as they would at the moment, if you consider them to be crimes,

571
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:56.970
commit more crimes.

572
00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.850
<v 1>Uh, I just, I just find the whole language.</v>

573
00:30:59.851 --> 00:31:01.860
And I know that you're sort of paraphrasing an argument.

574
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.720
I'm not suggesting that you're expressing your own view,

575
00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:07.980
but I find the whole narrative around, you know, the need to, to, to,

576
00:31:07.981 --> 00:31:11.400
to lock people off and the mindset of

577
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.720
treating them as if they are inherently evil. And of course, as you know,

578
00:31:15.721 --> 00:31:17.880
one of the big themes of the book is that people are not evil.

579
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.990
They come out of the womb with some different kind of otherness,

580
00:31:21.991 --> 00:31:22.591
as it were some,

581
00:31:22.591 --> 00:31:27.570
some terrible kind of a genetic predisposition to criminality. I mean, that's,

582
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.100
that's well known evidentially. Um, and,

583
00:31:30.101 --> 00:31:33.810
and you just have to stop saying a child is, is, is a criminal.

584
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.740
And that's why th that that's just my view. And the minute you stop doing that,

585
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.850
you will improve the outcomes. And, and that's okay.

586
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.240
<v 0>How do you think this is going to go down with the wider public,</v>

587
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.390
who regard these people as criminals,

588
00:31:48.391 --> 00:31:51.840
if they've stolen things or attack people or assaulted people,

589
00:31:51.841 --> 00:31:56.610
or even more serious offenses, which you see increasingly in cases of knife,

590
00:31:56.611 --> 00:32:01.290
crime are committed by youngsters and the public think that governments should

591
00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:05.040
protect them from the people they regard as criminals.

592
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.980
And if you're going to have any success in this,

593
00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:12.540
you've got to persuade the politicians that there is some way

594
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.230
in which they can persuade their electors,

595
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.250
that closing prisons, legalizing drugs,

596
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:25.110
raising the age of criminal responsibility is actually going to

597
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:29.130
work. It's the voters who don't have any confidence in this.

598
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:34.260
And it's not surprising that politicians, if they want to succeed,

599
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:39.530
uh, are giving people what the people seem to want. Well,

600
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.070
you're absolutely.

601
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.420
<v 1>Right. And that's where we are, where we are.</v>

602
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.410
That's why our system is so catastrophic, really damaging and failed so much.

603
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.470
Um, and the way the U S system, which is, you know,

604
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.000
many times greater in terms of numbers, 2.3 million, I call the,

605
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.000
the U S prison population in the book, the city of incarceration.

606
00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:58.310
It would be the fifth largest city in America. If, uh,

607
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.260
if it were actually a city. Um, aye, aye, aye,

608
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.780
aye. Illustrate your point. Precisely in the book.

609
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.990
When I talk about that interview that I did with a judge who refused to be who

610
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:13.540
understand that he was off the record and elected criminal judge in, in,

611
00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:16.220
in Alabama. And I said to him, you know, you've got the,

612
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:20.330
you've got death penalty. You've got you lock away 18 year olds for life,

613
00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:24.350
without parole, for drugs, offenses, not even for violent crimes. Uh,

614
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:26.530
you've got this vast prison population, um,

615
00:33:26.531 --> 00:33:29.840
and whole chunks of your communities in inner cities, which are,

616
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.500
have virtually no young black men left because you've locked nearly all of them

617
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:38.000
up. And yet your crime rates, the murders, the robberies,

618
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:42.830
and the shootings and stabbings are a hugely massive levels. And he said,

619
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:44.510
you know, I know you're right. It doesn't work.

620
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.670
If everything we're doing is completely wrong. I said, well,

621
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:48.980
why the hell are you doing it doesn't make any sense. And he said,

622
00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:52.220
because if I were to argue for any of the things that you believe in,

623
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:53.683
either I believe in,

624
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.310
then I'd never win election and I'd be out of office in five minutes flat. So,

625
00:33:57.311 --> 00:33:58.120
so you're right.

626
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.240
There's a disconnect between the reality evidence of what reduces crime,

627
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.690
which are the sorts of things I advocate and what people instinctively and

628
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:08.630
emotionally want. And I go into the whole history of that in the book, you know,

629
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:10.900
because I go back to, you know, justice in,

630
00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:13.460
in the Mayan civilizations Roman times,

631
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:18.380
and always there is this instinctive eye for an eye mentality.

632
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.370
And that sadly people buy that because it's a very saleable message.

633
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.300
It's much easier to sell crack downs and toughness than it is. Hey,

634
00:34:26.301 --> 00:34:26.811
hold on a minute.

635
00:34:26.811 --> 00:34:30.080
Let's listen to a nuanced argument about evidence people switch off.

636
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.440
And that's why I tried to make the argument simple. You talked about my, my,

637
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:37.000
my chapter headings, you know, I'm trying to, you know, give,

638
00:34:37.001 --> 00:34:38.420
give the other side a run for its money.

639
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.353
<v 0>Uh, let me, uh,</v>

640
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.860
bring the situation up to date with the criminal justice system as it is now,

641
00:34:44.861 --> 00:34:47.240
we've seen a lot of complaints in,

642
00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:52.240
in recent weeks by people who say they've been stopped by the

643
00:34:52.241 --> 00:34:55.810
police purely because of the color of their skin.

644
00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.800
Do you think that something's gone particularly wrong in terms of racial

645
00:34:59.801 --> 00:35:01.660
profiling, the way the police operate.

646
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.140
<v 1>Lately? It's been wrong for generations. I mean,</v>

647
00:35:05.141 --> 00:35:07.180
it's been wrong for decade after decade it's,

648
00:35:07.181 --> 00:35:11.830
but it's obviously at its most extreme wrong in the

649
00:35:11.831 --> 00:35:15.700
United States. And, and there's no surprise to me that hundreds of thousands,

650
00:35:15.701 --> 00:35:17.500
if not millions of people who have been on the streets,

651
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:22.240
protesting black lives matter in the States, I have a, a client and,

652
00:35:22.241 --> 00:35:24.280
and there's been an, uh, he he's, he was interviewed,

653
00:35:24.281 --> 00:35:27.010
I can disclose it cause he was interviewed for channel four news. Recently,

654
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:31.360
a young black bank manager who had never been in trouble in his life

655
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.420
was in his mid to late thirties. Very successful,

656
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.350
reached quite a high position already in one of the major banks. Um,

657
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.470
he was stopped in his very nice car,

658
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:44.220
which he paid for out of his very handsome salary almost every month and

659
00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:46.290
asked where's the money for the car come from.

660
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.740
And that experience of young black men,

661
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:52.980
whether they be professionals like him or whether they just be young men who are

662
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:54.510
driving around money and they're in business,

663
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:59.340
that experience of constantly being challenged about how you can justify just

664
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:02.310
walking down the street or while you've got nice clothes or where you've got a

665
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:07.110
nice car that is absolutely catastrophic for relations

666
00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:08.790
between the police and the community.

667
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.010
And it leads to this tension and it leads to this sense of injustice and a

668
00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:18.600
justified one, which, which many, uh, black and minority ethnic people feel,

669
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.180
uh, and it's just institutionalized. It was,

670
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:26.070
it was shown as institutionalized by the Stephen Lawrence inquiry and sad to say

671
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.340
it remains institutionalized, but not necessarily to an individual level,

672
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.470
but just the way in which police he works.

673
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:36.270
If you're a 17 or 18 year old white middle-class boy from a nice area and you

674
00:36:36.271 --> 00:36:38.220
and your mates go out and take cocaine at the weekend,

675
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.770
the chances that you will be arrested or stopped or challenged,

676
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.760
but virtually zero,

677
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.880
if you're a young black man walking the streets of East London,

678
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.170
the chances you'll be challenged are infinitely higher and that's where it goes

679
00:36:49.171 --> 00:36:51.510
wrong. So you end up where you don't have, like for like,

680
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.470
because one community is treated in a totally different way to another

681
00:36:55.471 --> 00:36:57.300
community, even though the outside, they are,

682
00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.750
their actions are exactly the same. So we have to do something about that.

683
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.793
It's really important.

684
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.650
<v 0>Last question. Um,</v>

685
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.720
let's imagine you were made home secretary tomorrow or justice secretary if you

686
00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:10.100
prefer. Yep.

687
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.870
<v 1>I'll be quite critical of Boris Johnson. You know,</v>

688
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.840
it seems an improbable scenario, but we'll go with your thought experiment.

689
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:20.000
<v 0>One of the problems because he remains prime minister and he is not going to</v>

690
00:37:20.001 --> 00:37:23.750
keep you in that cabinet post a very long, if you annoy him,

691
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:27.110
nor is he going to give you very much money, uh,

692
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.610
certainly not much more money than the present incumbents have. And, uh,

693
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.840
yet he says, well, you know,

694
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.640
solve the problems with all the constraints of the voters and the treasury.

695
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:38.960
What's the first thing you do.

696
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.770
<v 1>You have to go down some route of drug reform,</v>

697
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.580
drug law reform because it's cost it's, it's an immediate cost benefit.

698
00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.390
It reduces. So you actually will spend much less money if you,

699
00:37:50.391 --> 00:37:55.040
if you reform drug laws. And I don't think if I, in the, uh,

700
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:58.730
inconceivable scenario that I were called upon to service or as Johnson's home

701
00:37:58.731 --> 00:38:02.420
secretary, I don't think, uh, it would be, uh,

702
00:38:02.421 --> 00:38:06.080
attractive to him to follow the whole of my, um, agenda. In other words,

703
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.080
the liberalization and the regulation of all drugs,

704
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.540
but I would start with heroin assisted treatment.

705
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.480
I would start with the licensed and, uh,

706
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.760
NHS led heroin assisted treatment program.

707
00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.680
They're starting it in Glasgow in a very small way.

708
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:21.710
So it's coming to some extent to the United Kingdom.

709
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.730
I appreciate that's a devolved system and not under Boris Johnson's c'mon,

710
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.910
but I would start by saying, let's at least do something about heroin.

711
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.840
Let's go back to the system we had before the 1971 act with heroin treatment

712
00:38:32.841 --> 00:38:34.670
that would, that would have an enormous impact.

713
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.300
And it have a huge economic and treasury impact,

714
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.440
a beneficial impact from the very start. So I'd start to argue around that.

715
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:43.780
And then if I were there long enough, I might start to say, Hey,

716
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:47.160
this has worked. Let's look at how we might do it with other drugs. And, and,

717
00:38:47.161 --> 00:38:48.520
and, and by the way, bars,

718
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:52.480
how about we just experiment with another form of prison environment and just

719
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:54.010
see whether if we,

720
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:57.190
if we have prisoners living in fairly normal conditions and cookie,

721
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.440
the right food, and maybe their families can come and stay there,

722
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.480
if that's considered safe,

723
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.330
and then they come out and they refund only 20% like Norway rather than 75% as,

724
00:39:06.331 --> 00:39:09.100
as, as here. Well, hold on. That experiment was quite successful.

725
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:12.580
And then by the time I started my second term, Joshua, the same secretary,

726
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.760
or perhaps even be promoted by then, we might be able to, uh,

727
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.340
we might be able to, to, to, to crack on with the rest of my agenda.

728
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.150
<v 0>Christo QC many. Thanks indeed,</v>

729
00:39:21.151 --> 00:39:24.030
for telling me about your new book justice on trial,

730
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:28.020
you can read more about Chris's book and the podcast description.

731
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.460
There it is on the screen for those of you who are watching, uh,

732
00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.430
those of you who are listening can see it on the podcast description,

733
00:39:35.431 --> 00:39:38.220
where you'll also find a link to my new book,

734
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.850
which is called enemies of the people aren't Joshua Rosenberg.

735
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.570
And this podcast was produced by intelligence squared.
