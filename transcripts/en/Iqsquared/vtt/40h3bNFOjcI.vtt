00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>Hello, and welcome to this intelligence squad podcast with me coming up,</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.660
we are recording this on November the 12th,

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.140
so that's just a week after the U S 2020 election.

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:14.130
I'm delighted to welcome our guests, Ruth Ben GAT historian,

5
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.700
and author of strong men. How they rise, why they succeed, how they fall,

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.973
Ruth. Hello.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.570
<v 1>Hi, thanks for having me on.</v>

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.140
<v 0>So Ruth, um, question number one.</v>

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.210
Could you paint the like idealized strong man for

10
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:32.990
us? Like what, what does, what does kind of, you know, the, the,

11
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.780
the perfect strong man look like, you know, get that fees,

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.460
sexual appetites,

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.810
Stalin's enthusiasm for a secure code bureaucracy, you know,

14
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.270
w w w what, what, what,

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.090
what would you in your mind's eye see strong manners as perfectly Benning?

16
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.280
<v 1>So I'm using the term, uh, and the, the, the,</v>

17
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.110
the men in my book are all successful, strong men rulers. Um,

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.780
these, the 20th century ones for,

19
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:04.070
to refer to a type of authoritarian or authoritarian tending ruler

20
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.750
who, um, definitely exerts executive power destroys the,

21
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:10.370
or damages democracy,

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.470
but also has this kind of macho bluster and personal

23
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:20.360
relationships with, uh, other male despots often come to influence,

24
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.930
uh, national and foreign policy. And in general,

25
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:28.760
a strong man is somebody who exercises what I call a personalist form of rule

26
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.040
and his personal quirks character, financial needs, uh,

27
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.840
other such things, uh, come to dominate national and foreign policy.

28
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.590
He domesticates the judiciary, domesticates his party.

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.980
So the strong man is a man who is, uh,

30
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.840
highly seductive to many highly brutal, and these two things go together.

31
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.720
<v 0>So w w what is the relationship between a</v>

32
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.160
strong man as a kind of ruler and authoritarianism as a form of

33
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:02.150
government, are they, are,

34
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.530
they necessarily have to both be present in order for a strong man to truly be

35
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:09.620
able to exercise that kind of appetites and proclivities.

36
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.900
<v 1>So the book looks,</v>

37
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.350
I felt it was time to step back and look at a hundred years of

38
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.630
authoritarianism, and there are three phases. There's the fascist phase,

39
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.420
there's the military coup phase. So I've, Khadafi, there's,

40
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.400
Mabutu Pinochet in Chile.

41
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.470
And then there's what I call new authoritarians and authoritarianism kind of,

42
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.670
uh, evolves over a century and strong men rulers.

43
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:39.560
I see them as a subset of authoritarians there they're

44
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:42.380
always personalist rulers. And so, for example,

45
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.950
there were lots of military who into us during the cold war,

46
00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:50.540
but peanut Shea and Sheila was the one who immediately exercised

47
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.880
personal power. Uh, you know,

48
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.730
patronage networks all depended on him.

49
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.970
So they're a subset of ruler,

50
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.980
but it also evolves over a century because today

51
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.900
authoritarians and strong men,

52
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.620
they get in by elections and they manipulate elections to stay there.

53
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.450
So the pioneer, there was barely scrawny in Italy who definitely, uh,

54
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.600
he never destroyed democracy, of course, but he controlled the media,

55
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.040
they own TV networks, and he ended up rapping, uh, the,

56
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:24.520
the state and the legal structure around his own financial and personal needs.

57
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.340
<v 0>Hmm. You used a really, really interesting phrase, I think,</v>

58
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:33.630
to describe the kind of opening of this third chapter in the kind of historical

59
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.700
epochs of strong man, you know,

60
00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:40.260
and a liberal evolution of democratic politics. Um,

61
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.300
you, you chart the beginning of that, I believe as around 1990s, is that right?

62
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.350
And, and kind of,

63
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:51.090
what do you think began to happen then to kind of begin to usher us into this,

64
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.700
into this third phase where we're beginning to live through now?

65
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.970
<v 1>I mean, it's the end of the cold war,</v>

66
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:01.080
and I should say that because I'm looking mostly at, um,

67
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.230
people who destroyed or damaged a democracy,

68
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.520
I don't have communists. I'm not looking, I'm not looking at communist leaders,

69
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:10.290
so there's no style and there's no mile,

70
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.010
although there's a lot of attention when they influence right wing strong men.

71
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.380
So the end of the cold war allowed for the rise of a new right wing, um,

72
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.850
and a new phase of authoritarianism, but it's also a new phase of media.

73
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.640
And you get people who, again are,

74
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.780
there's fewer one party States today outside of communist, um,

75
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.910
countries like North Korea and China.

76
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.390
And so things evolve in a different manner. Um,

77
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.880
if you think of Putin and Edwin and Orban,

78
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.560
and over the time I've written this book, it took a few years to write the book.

79
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.970
Uh, many of those who are now ruling have consolidated their power, like Orban,

80
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.590
who now rules by decree, but they came in through elections, um,

81
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.221
and they,

82
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:58.200
it took them a while to come to amass this amount of power.

83
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:02.790
So today it's evolution and not revolution in the strong men world.

84
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.580
<v 0>Well talking of elections,</v>

85
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.090
I don't think that we can go any further without talking about the one we've

86
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:12.480
just had. And of course, Trump. Um, so,

87
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.623
um,

88
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.580
how neatly does Trump fit within this definition of a strong

89
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:21.414
man?

90
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.320
<v 1>So I live in America and, uh,</v>

91
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.670
one of the impetus for writing this book was in

92
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.560
2015 and 16.

93
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:35.400
I saw Trump start to have rallies with loyalty oath.

94
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.890
He started to threaten violence. Uh,

95
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:41.310
when he said I could stand on fifth Avenue and shoot someone. And of course,

96
00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:43.080
this is the kind of threats that, you know,

97
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:47.280
both scenario made in Brazil and do territory made while they were candidates.

98
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.020
So I started to track Trump as a kind of strong men figure. And again,

99
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:55.050
you have the, you have Berlusconi who, uh,

100
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.630
was also a strong and figure in democracy. Trump is far more dangerous.

101
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.720
So what we're going through now, uh,

102
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.640
is the logical and very predictable extension of his behavior that he

103
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.990
set up very successfully, uh, doing his first term.

104
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:16.490
He's had four years, uh, to completely domesticate the GOP.

105
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:20.240
It's really, it's really his tool, his personal tool,

106
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:25.070
which has all the more, uh, astonishing because men like Bose Connie or,

107
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.250
or Mussolini, they formed their own parties,

108
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.960
or you think of Orban who they were.

109
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.600
They had a leadership role in their parties for many years.

110
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.530
Trump came from outside and he still managed to, uh,

111
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.490
have this loyalty code and this corruption, he, you know,

112
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:44.870
he made them co-conspirators. So they stuck with him through everything.

113
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:49.430
And the GOP is the conservative elite equivalent of those

114
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.330
groups who, uh, backed Hitler and Mussolini to come to power.

115
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.450
And so you always see these figures, these conservative elites,

116
00:06:56.451 --> 00:07:01.250
these political elites. So what we see now is that he's refusing to,

117
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.320
uh, acknowledge the results of the election and his personality cult and his

118
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.560
propaganda machine have so far carried him through.

119
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.513
<v 0>Well, I,</v>

120
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.300
I thought we might use Trump as a microcosm to talk about the kind of three

121
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:20.650
phases in a kind of strong man's career, you know, the winning of power,

122
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.720
then the use of it, and then finally the loss of it. So, um, do you know, to,

123
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.470
to, to what extent then do you think kind of Trump capture of power, you know,

124
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:30.940
and I'm thinking, especially if the,

125
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.020
that fateful 2016 campaign and the way that he kind of built himself,

126
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:39.460
this kind of incredible kind of insurgent momentum to take on being convents

127
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.620
within rebel party towards scent,

128
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.030
is that kind of iconic and characteristic of the way in which strong men

129
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:49.600
normally catapult themselves into the kind of highest echelons of government.

130
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.640
<v 1>So one of the things that, um, was truly, uh,</v>

131
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.980
eye-opening to me was that, you know,

132
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.480
so the book is an attempt to show certain patterns in all of these

133
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.560
phases. Um, and it's actually an expo. The, the,

134
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:08.380
the body of the book is an exploration of the tools of rule corruption,

135
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:12.790
propaganda, machismo, incitement to violence or violence.

136
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.190
And so, again, things work differently in the 21st century for some aspects.

137
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.400
Um, Trump didn't have the violence that Maslany had,

138
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:26.500
but you have this dynamic where the outsider comes in and he's

139
00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:28.930
clearly an extremist. He talks about in his case,

140
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:33.490
he talks about violence and he's let into the system by elites

141
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.270
who want to, for, they think they can use him,

142
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.120
and then he'll calm down. If he gets into government,

143
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:43.450
I call this the pivot delusion, or they call them a clown.

144
00:08:43.451 --> 00:08:46.540
And they thought that they could tame him and use him. And this was, of course,

145
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:50.410
the fallacy with Hitler and Mussolini and even peanut chain chili,

146
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.670
although it was a coup,

147
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.070
there were Christian Democrats who supported him because they thought that he

148
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:58.020
would restore order, get rid of Ian,

149
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:01.470
did a socialist and then have a return to democracy.

150
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.610
And of course that was tragically wrong. So over and over again,

151
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.640
these men behave the same way. And one of the, uh,

152
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.900
very unfortunately for us in America and actually the whole world Trump's

153
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:14.550
personality, his,

154
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.560
his temperament maps on a hundred percent to those of ruler's past

155
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.780
the outcome is different today, but the aspirations and the, uh,

156
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.760
style of rule because of character, including the refusal to leave office, um,

157
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.990
is exactly the same.

158
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.270
<v 0>And in terms of the use of power, then, um,</v>

159
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.440
that a once a strong man is, is in power. Um,

160
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:46.070
I, you point to kind of propaganda and virility and corruptions as these main

161
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.030
major attributes. But, but I, I want you to talk about, um, spectacle,

162
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.350
because there seems to be this kind of incredible draw to spectacle that strong

163
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.460
man hat, you know, whether it's Trump's wall or Gaddafi is tent city, or,

164
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.580
you know, giant golden statues, why are they so drawn to it?

165
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.150
<v 1>One thing I've found is that almost all of the men who have success,</v>

166
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.320
cause there's lots of, you know, men who are around who are liberal figures,

167
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.550
but the ones who are success often have a background in

168
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.420
spectacle or media. Um, Mabutu uh,

169
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.220
was a journalist as well as Mussolini. Um, of course, Hitler, Hitler,

170
00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:29.990
actually, maybe your listeners know this. Um, he, you know,

171
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:34.250
he was a very, he was a big fan of miscellany and he studied him very closely,

172
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.610
but Hitler couldn't get to power for a decade. You know,

173
00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:41.570
he had his push and then he went to jail. So he took hypnotism lessons.

174
00:10:41.571 --> 00:10:46.160
He took acting lessons and voice lessons, and he practiced his spectacle,

175
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:50.660
his gestures that became famous in front of a mirror during the 1920s.

176
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.880
So all of these men, and of course,

177
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.580
Beverly's Connie was the master of television.

178
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.180
And we have Donald Trump who is a real reality television star.

179
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.650
All of them are highly attentive to how they present themselves,

180
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:07.610
how they use their bodies and how they seduce followers.

181
00:11:07.611 --> 00:11:09.830
So one of the things that was, you know,

182
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.640
the many red flags about Trump was his skill in, uh,

183
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.810
forging these bonds with his followers and their emotional bonds.

184
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.880
It's not just about obeying him. It's about making them feel part of something.

185
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.260
And this was the movement,

186
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.550
and this is buying him through this illegal, uh,

187
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.490
maneuvers he's trying to do now to discredit our election,

188
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.170
70 million Americans, more than that voted for him,

189
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:39.170
despite his criminal mismanagement of the pandemic.

190
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.360
And that is a Testament to his skill at staging these spectacles.

191
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.230
<v 0>When you, when you think about, um, strong men,</v>

192
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:52.640
how would you navigate this kind of strange dualism of like skill and

193
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.560
madness, because it seems that they, they, you know, you, you,

194
00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.940
your descriptions of them both kind of recognize that, uh, dryness, uh,

195
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.830
being able to yeah, manage large populations and their own image and, you know,

196
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.770
exploit crises and act decisively. But at the same time,

197
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.860
it feels like almost exclusively,

198
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:15.400
the strong men that you deal with are literally insane at the same moment.

199
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.390
<v 1>You know, there,</v>

200
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.910
then I don't see them as insane that there are many of them are criminals,

201
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:27.630
of course, and, and come to a power with a criminal record.

202
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.550
And then if they're willing in a democracy, uh, like Berlusconi and Trump,

203
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.420
that governance becomes about, uh, damage control.

204
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.680
So we can differentiate those kinds of figures from, you know,

205
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:44.700
people who had one party dictatorships. Definitely one of the,

206
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.700
one of the things they do in the corruption chapter is look not only at their

207
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:52.650
financial con corruption, but how they establish this divided rule,

208
00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:55.230
how they, how they structure their governance, uh,

209
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.170
in ways that allow them to have total power.

210
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.580
So that hiring and firing people constantly Kadafi, for example, he,

211
00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:04.620
he was energized by chaos.

212
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.940
And so one of the macro themes, um, is that,

213
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.890
although we're led to think that authoritarianism is a productive

214
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:19.020
form of government, it's efficient, um, it's good for business. Uh, Trump,

215
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.740
you know, miscellany made the trains run on time, what I show,

216
00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:26.940
and there are more and more studies coming out by economists on this is that

217
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:31.080
it's a highly destructive and chaotic form of government. Uh,

218
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.010
there's so much waste, not only human waste from, um,

219
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.320
from violence and people being prisoned,

220
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:41.790
but also the formation of large communities of exiles who are business owners

221
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:44.670
and other people who have invested in their country for decades and have to

222
00:13:44.671 --> 00:13:47.790
leave the country. So there's capital there's capital flight,

223
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.840
there's all kinds of negative, um, you know, outcomes that,

224
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.340
that we've been too influenced by, uh,

225
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:58.920
American PR firms who work for authoritarians authoritarians own propaganda

226
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.820
to fully grasp the magnitude of this destruction that cause, and,

227
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:06.870
and here it does relate back to they're very, um,

228
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.370
they're very kind of irascible and impulsive temperament.

229
00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:14.670
And so the book is an arc. It goes from their rule, their,

230
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:17.220
their ascent to power, but it shows how the,

231
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.150
in some cases they're their own worst enemies because the systems that they set

232
00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:25.980
up are counterproductive and lead them to make bad decisions. And then, uh,

233
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:26.843
they fall.

234
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.500
<v 0>Well, we're going to get to the full in a second.</v>

235
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.550
Cause I think that's especially what we all have to deal with at the moment.

236
00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:37.110
But, but before we do, I just wanted to briefly talk about crisis, um,

237
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.820
is that, that seems to have an especially important kind of role in the kind of,

238
00:14:41.821 --> 00:14:45.690
you know, as a punctuation point of a tool in the, in the, um,

239
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.380
in the lives and careers of strong men, um, how important is it and,

240
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:52.760
and how worried should we be about,

241
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:57.410
about Corona virus now as being another opportunity for strong men across the

242
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:00.560
world? Not just Trump too, to kind of see this as a moment, which they,

243
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:03.770
where they can really extend power in ways, which they weren't able to before.

244
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:10.030
<v 1>You strong men thrive on crisis, and it can be any kind of crisis.</v>

245
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.710
And ideally they're helping to create a crisis and then they weaponize it and

246
00:15:14.711 --> 00:15:17.410
exploit it to influence their power.

247
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.670
So whenever you see a one way you can think, well,

248
00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.580
is this person there's a new politician on the scene?

249
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.800
Are they kind of a strong man type?

250
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.270
If they start talking about crisis politics and also their own victim hood,

251
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.920
um, and how their victim, but they're also savior, um,

252
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.510
both going to use to call himself the Jesus Christ of Italian politics because

253
00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:42.970
of that. So they take the hits for the nation,

254
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.410
but they are also the only ones capable of saving the nation. And then every,

255
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:49.930
anything that goes wrong when they mismanaged things,

256
00:15:49.931 --> 00:15:53.020
because it becomes a result of their kind of victimhood.

257
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.480
So when Corona virus hit,

258
00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:00.040
it was very interesting to see the initial reactions of world leaders.

259
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.900
And so you had both Sinero and Trump,

260
00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:06.520
who first tried to kind of deny it and saying it was like a little flu,

261
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.060
right. And try to make it go away, manipulate statistics.

262
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.130
And eventually Trump, just a Trump administration just gave up.

263
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.661
Um, and they said,

264
00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:20.860
we're not going to even try and manage this and continue to have rallies.

265
00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:23.530
And this was his ego need to have the rallies that,

266
00:16:23.531 --> 00:16:25.900
that they are nothing without an audience.

267
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.130
And so Trump's need to be on the campaign trail and to keep the bond with his

268
00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:33.490
followers far out, weighed his concern for public welfare.

269
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.400
So in the case of Trump, it's a very,

270
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.670
it's like a microcosm of all these dynamics. Um, and,

271
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.010
and truly the thing we need to realize about Trump is that, um,

272
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.000
because of Americans have never had a foreign occupation or dictatorship,

273
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.740
they've used a democratic framework to interpret Trump, and this is wrong.

274
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.950
Trump is not there to govern in a democratic sense.

275
00:16:56.951 --> 00:16:59.290
He's there to make money for Trump organization.

276
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.610
He's there to build his personality cult and keep his followers.

277
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.380
And he's there to stay in power. And,

278
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.340
and idea of public welfare public goods is, is,

279
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.070
is completely alien to him. Hmm.

280
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.020
<v 0>But this was the thing that confused me about, about the, the, the, this, the,</v>

281
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:20.980
the kind of strong men reaction to Corona virus. Was that kind of,

282
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.220
if you look back at other crises, you know, like the Reichstag fire,

283
00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:27.190
or what do I say is more contemporary already done in the Philippines,

284
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.150
they've kind of used crisis as a way of expanding the reach of government,

285
00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:34.750
you know, emergency laws, more legislation, you know,

286
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:38.090
the deployment of military on the streets and so on. But that,

287
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:41.980
that isn't what say a bowl scenario or a Trump did with COVID. Was it, I mean,

288
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.570
like you would have thought that in a way the,

289
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:48.850
the obvious reaction would have been an extension of government, you know,

290
00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:53.490
and an extension of the rain power into previously, you know, um,

291
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.470
kind of, uh, uh, contested spaces of people's lives, you know, or, um, kind of,

292
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:01.450
you know, places where government couldn't normally reach, but, but,

293
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.470
but it was a weird way that they kind of actually would drew government in a way

294
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:07.110
from, from the pandemic and its management.

295
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.960
<v 1>Well, so we have to differentiate because there are, uh, uh,</v>

296
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.250
very frighteningly,

297
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.260
there is a parallel process going on with the help of his ideal

298
00:18:18.261 --> 00:18:21.230
co-conspirator William Barr, the department of justice,

299
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.920
who has completely politicized and purged the department of justice.

300
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.760
And they have been setting up, uh, since, uh, you know,

301
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.680
Trump's been doing this in 2018, setting up the whole structure to label any,

302
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.790
uh, civic descent, any protestors as terrorists.

303
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.750
And we saw during the summer in reaction to the black lives matter protests,

304
00:18:41.751 --> 00:18:44.240
he sent in the military. Um,

305
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.910
there were people being bundled into unmarked cars.

306
00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:50.120
Like it was people that's why people were talking about Huna does and peanut

307
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.230
check, and, and the GOP went, you know, along with this, in,

308
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:58.040
in great measure, uh, there was Senator Tom cotton who said,

309
00:18:58.041 --> 00:19:01.370
let's bring in the military, you know, to turn the military on own people.

310
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.840
So they are extending government in ways that are very frightening. And I have,

311
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.980
I have zero doubt that if he were reelected, um,

312
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.710
we would see this extension of government in,

313
00:19:12.711 --> 00:19:17.240
in ways that are very dire for journalistic freedoms and

314
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:20.570
for the right to protest the right to assemble. Um,

315
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.370
all of this infrastructure is being completed with Corona virus. It's really,

316
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.900
uh, Trump is not interested in devoting his time to good governance.

317
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.880
And so they'd simply gave up and indeed, uh, other, uh,

318
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.350
governance priorities,

319
00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:40.990
like keeping his personality cult weighed more far more. And,

320
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.541
and yes,

321
00:19:41.541 --> 00:19:46.340
this is destructive because he could have come out fairly easily

322
00:19:46.341 --> 00:19:51.020
as, you know, no one could perhaps Tane Corona virus. We see in democracies,

323
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.050
they're in lockdowns again, but he could have done a much better job,

324
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.100
but he's not interested in doing that job. He's interested in other jobs.

325
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:00.920
<v 0>Um,</v>

326
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.180
we've spoken a lot about the kind of vulnerabilities of society to strong men

327
00:20:05.181 --> 00:20:08.270
and authoritarian rule, but could you, could you talk a bit about some of the,

328
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.520
like resiliences, which society has? What, what, what,

329
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.880
what typically are the characteristics of societies,

330
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:16.550
which kind of can either reject or recover from,

331
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.260
from these kinds of power grabs?

332
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.110
<v 1>So this was, uh, at times this was not a fun book to write.</v>

333
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.320
Um, there was a lot of grim stories of, you know,

334
00:20:27.321 --> 00:20:32.300
institutionalized racism and sexual abuse and all of this.

335
00:20:32.301 --> 00:20:35.690
So when I got to the resistance chapter, it,

336
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.550
and there is acts of resistance,

337
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.260
resistance are in every chapter it's threaded throughout, but, um, it was,

338
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:47.200
uh, it was inspiring to see the forms of resistance and how over a

339
00:20:47.201 --> 00:20:51.730
century. Um, there are techniques that continue, um, and,

340
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.640
and depending on the situation,

341
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:59.020
which each society can vary in the amount of policing that there is, but,

342
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.790
you know, small acts, um, sometimes resistance resistance is what you don't do.

343
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.690
Um, you, you don't, you don't do the Hitler salute.

344
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.220
You don't show up to the fascist youth group. Um, but many times, uh,

345
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.160
the core of resistance, even in our digital era.

346
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.690
And I look at how certain, um, key moments, synagogue,

347
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.800
cinematic, moments of resistance, where the police break down your door,

348
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:27.790
and you have to hide your documents nowadays, like in the 20th century,

349
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:32.110
we couldn't really see that because, uh, we didn't have social media nowadays,

350
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:35.590
like in Russia, when, when, uh, critics of Putin, you know,

351
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:39.160
the police come to their door, they're filming it and they're streaming it live.

352
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.700
And I recount, uh, one, uh, critic who, uh, filmed his, uh,

353
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.510
drone, carrying his hard drive out the window to a friend's house to save his

354
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:50.350
contacts.

355
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.390
So I try and have these examples in the book of how things have changed and how

356
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:58.210
things have stayed the same. And so the book,

357
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.590
each chapter goes over a hundred years and talks about a different, uh,

358
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.820
either instrument of rule like propaganda or the resistance chapter.

359
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.080
So,

360
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.670
but the core of resistance remains bodies coming together to reclaim

361
00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:13.840
public space,

362
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.830
to speak back publicly to the ruler,

363
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.220
but also to his allies and also to foreign lenders.

364
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.530
And this kind of nonviolent mass protest is at the right time

365
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:30.550
when, uh, when, uh, uh, a leader is losing his power.

366
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:33.970
We have Belarus today as an example, um,

367
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.970
it's highly effective and there,

368
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.320
there are kind of rituals that can go on, um, that get recycled.

369
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:44.950
And this was very inspiring. Um, during the fall of communism,

370
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:49.060
there was a ritual called the Baltic way where everybody held hands across

371
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:52.300
several States and in 2019 in Hong Kong,

372
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.160
protesters revived this and paid homage to it by linking hands.

373
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.910
So, so I think, you know, the,

374
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:05.500
the reader will have a lot of sense of the range of resistance. Um,

375
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.180
and it's not, some is violent and the most effective has been non-violent.

376
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.040
<v 0>We are going to come back to loss of power and Trump in just one second.</v>

377
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.880
Cause I think people listening to this will badly want to know your thoughts

378
00:23:17.881 --> 00:23:19.710
about how, um,

379
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.190
we can have a roadmap of sorts from history about what's going to happen next

380
00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:25.230
and, and, and where it's all going to go.

381
00:23:25.231 --> 00:23:29.430
But before we do that one final question about, um, you know,

382
00:23:29.431 --> 00:23:33.570
resilience and Rumba vulnerability, you know, and that's around technology, um,

383
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.041
because we,

384
00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:37.890
we seem to be faced with quite a kind of complicated story now about technology,

385
00:23:37.891 --> 00:23:42.600
both in some cases kind of heralding and aiding despotism and

386
00:23:42.601 --> 00:23:46.460
strong men and their culture personality, I suppose, particular. Um,

387
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:51.410
but then also of course being an absolute kind of endemic, um,

388
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.130
uh, kind of part of the story of resistance and protests. How,

389
00:23:56.131 --> 00:23:59.690
how do you see that playing out now in terms of changing the kind of playing

390
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:03.860
field, um, upon which, you know, strong men, um, kind of operate.

391
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.590
<v 1>Yeah. The big debate about whether, um,</v>

392
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.300
digital media help or harm the strong men is,

393
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:18.640
is, is going to be ongoing. And, um, you know, for every time, uh, I mean,

394
00:24:18.641 --> 00:24:19.810
obviously, uh,

395
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:25.210
rulers like Putin and Erawan have been extremely able in blocking, um,

396
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.010
you know, platforms that they very quickly that are going to do them damage,

397
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.610
but the resilience is in the workarounds that people find.

398
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.870
And you saw this in Hong Kong. Again, I don't talk about Chinese communism,

399
00:24:37.871 --> 00:24:40.570
but Hong Kong where they, they w they, uh,

400
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.830
took advantage of Tinder or Apple's airdrop to get around, uh,

401
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.680
these platforms that, that were, that were banned.

402
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.750
So that kind of inventiveness will continue. Um,

403
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.180
but clearly when I, uh,

404
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.440
studied the story of Trump's rise and his use of Facebook,

405
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.990
and he actually used a kind of e-commerce model and the product was

406
00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:08.980
Trump, and the, the means by which he, uh,

407
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.390
publicized his product was Facebook mostly. And I,

408
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.730
the reader will find the exact number here,

409
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.710
but tens of millions of ads were taken out by the Trump campaign

410
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:26.170
on Facebook versus about 60,000 by the Clinton campaign.

411
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.570
So the Trump was, was so savvy and using digital media,

412
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:36.040
and this is one, perhaps the only thing that Cushner, um,

413
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.090
got right, uh, and, and pushed for.

414
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.123
Um, so,

415
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.900
so Facebook and certainly Twitter have been a kind of,

416
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:52.410
co-author one could say of the Trump presidency, um, uh,

417
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.810
the, the Facebook in the ascendant phase, uh,

418
00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.610
and Twitter in the maintenance of power and both Trump and both scenario

419
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.900
use their personal accounts. And when Trump leaves office, if he does,

420
00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:09.670
he will retain that personal account and thoughtful retain

421
00:26:09.671 --> 00:26:12.760
his S it's integral to his personality cult.

422
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.310
<v 0>Well, coming now then finally, to Trump and loss of power, um,</v>

423
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.470
how close has Trump got to

424
00:26:23.471 --> 00:26:27.010
genuinely shaking the foundations of American democracy?

425
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.000
Because I guess th this is going to counter view here, which says, okay,

426
00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:33.490
Trump did lots of really horrible things. Um,

427
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.440
he was certainly extremely populist.

428
00:26:35.441 --> 00:26:39.070
He certainly himself doesn't seem to betray any great love of, of democracy,

429
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.950
but the basic institutions and the norms and the culture and this,

430
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.380
and fundamentally the separations of power within American government have

431
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:50.100
remained strong, and they will eventually be the things that get rid of Trump.

432
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:57.770
<v 1>So, um, I would beg to differ a bit,</v>

433
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.390
uh, with that because Trump has been successful, uh,

434
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.780
in politicizing the federal bureaucracy,

435
00:27:05.781 --> 00:27:08.660
starting with the department of justice, the department of state,

436
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:13.550
there have been hundreds of thousands of civil servants who have left, uh,

437
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.670
and have been replaced by ideologues, by zealots,

438
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.670
by corrupt people who will do Trump's bidding.

439
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.170
And the number of judges Trump has appointed, uh,

440
00:27:24.171 --> 00:27:28.310
hundreds of judges and every level we hear most about the Supreme court.

441
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.780
So there are statements from, uh, you know,

442
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:37.730
democratic senators and political analysts that talk about the

443
00:27:37.731 --> 00:27:42.530
independence of the judiciary and the kind of independence of the three

444
00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:46.220
branches has been badly harmed by Trump.

445
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.770
And in the case of the judges, uh,

446
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.720
it's going to take many years to recover this, and this is why, of course,

447
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.960
the conservative, the GOP. That was one of the things that,

448
00:27:56.961 --> 00:27:58.190
that was part of the pact.

449
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:03.500
And also for evangelical Christians who have been very important. Uh,

450
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:08.210
so w we haven't begun to assess the damage that Donald Trump has

451
00:28:08.211 --> 00:28:13.100
done to institutions to, again, the federal bureaucracy,

452
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.380
it's, it might seem a very boring topic,

453
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.650
but it's absolutely key to the implementation of policy,

454
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.770
to the imposition of a certain ideology.

455
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.290
So the office of civil rights,

456
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.390
civil rights used to mean a struggle for racial equity

457
00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:34.340
for, for economic equity. Um, and now it, it's,

458
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.680
it's the, the official office of civil rights is about protecting the, um,

459
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.220
the rights of white Christians, um,

460
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.330
who shouldn't be in and trying to erase the separation of church and state,

461
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:52.100
and some of the men who are most influential and are now, uh,

462
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.660
colluding with this power grab like William Barr and Mike Pompeo, uh,

463
00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.080
BARR is a Catholic with, uh, links to Opus, DEI,

464
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.010
and Pompei was an evangelical Christian, but they both, uh,

465
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:08.150
see the ideal form of government as one that, uh,

466
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.300
doesn't have much room for separation of church and state.

467
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.600
So I think that we underestimate Trump at our peril.

468
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.610
<v 0>So thinking especially about the independence of the judiciary,</v>

469
00:29:19.611 --> 00:29:21.380
which I suppose is kind of a question,

470
00:29:21.381 --> 00:29:23.850
which has never been more important normal rather than,

471
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:25.880
than really just about now. Um,

472
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.890
how confident are you that the kind of mechanisms of government and the

473
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:34.760
judiciary will eventually, and not eventually, I mean,

474
00:29:34.761 --> 00:29:39.170
really quite soon kind of actually cause Trump to leave power.

475
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.490
Well, you know, that there's.

476
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.750
<v 1>Various, you can gain this out in various ways. And one, uh,</v>

477
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.610
one end point is the Supreme court gets involved and that's exactly why they

478
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:56.230
rushed through the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett, uh,

479
00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.760
to have this majority. So, so in that, if it goes to that,

480
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.930
and then, um, he may be successful.

481
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.380
I'm not one of the people who were talking about coups.

482
00:30:08.381 --> 00:30:12.820
I like to be as somebody who immersed themselves in coups for years and has the

483
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:15.640
whole third of the book is on cue, the era of cruise.

484
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.150
I like to be careful with my language, um,

485
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.370
but there is definitely an attempt to, uh,

486
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.860
illegally stay in power with, with the help of the judiciary.

487
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.420
And so now, um,

488
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:35.980
just as Trump's propaganda machine is waging psychological warfare on

489
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:38.830
Americans telling them that the election was illegitimate.

490
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.410
The judicial mechanism with bar at the head is trying to reopen

491
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:48.580
vote counts and claim that, uh, the other day he,

492
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.360
the DOJ said that, Oh, well, we can't decide the election.

493
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.160
I forgot what state it was because the votes are now under audit. So this,

494
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.760
this is where you go back to crisis, this creation of the,

495
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.800
of a period of prolonged crisis. Um, and, and then we'll,

496
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:07.300
we have civil unrest,

497
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.740
and then you have this parallel process of being able to use the

498
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:13.060
state, um,

499
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.750
to label protesters in the streets as terrorists and arrest them.

500
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.560
So there are many outcomes. I can't tell you where it's going to go,

501
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:26.170
but we can say that they've set up for every eventuality. Um,

502
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.040
and there's nothing that they won't do to try and remain in power.

503
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.580
<v 0>Okay. Well, Ruth, my last question is about healing. Um, so,</v>

504
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:40.590
so let's kind of assume that Trump is eventually ousted from

505
00:31:40.591 --> 00:31:44.910
the white house, um, whether he admits the loss or not. Um,

506
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:49.800
of course the kind of rhetoric is kind of beginning to shift now towards trying

507
00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:54.140
to begin to heal the kind of partisan chasms, which have opened up over,

508
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.750
over the law. Well, I mean, for, for, well, over a decade now,

509
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.000
how, how,

510
00:32:03.001 --> 00:32:07.710
how do we begin if we are to see Trump as a strong man and therefore his

511
00:32:07.711 --> 00:32:11.880
agenda is essentially being anti-democratic by its very nature.

512
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.720
How do we begin to kind of find common ground, I suppose,

513
00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:18.840
with the 70 odd million Americans,

514
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.880
not to mention the many other people around the world,

515
00:32:20.881 --> 00:32:25.380
but saw something in his message or something in his agenda. Um,

516
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.341
cause I,

517
00:32:26.341 --> 00:32:30.870
I guess my worry is that if you see simply portraying him as a strong man

518
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.400
for any kind of small D Democrat kind of just creates basically a message that

519
00:32:35.401 --> 00:32:39.470
we just have to resist and fight. Like there's no art, there's no other option.

520
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.840
So, so what other options are there for us to, to,

521
00:32:42.841 --> 00:32:44.840
to try and find some kind of way of,

522
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.300
of moving closer to people on the other side of the aisle.

523
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.530
<v 1>So I'm assuming he leaves and then we can have</v>

524
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:57.580
turn the page. And of course, the way that Biden is being,

525
00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:02.530
which is kind of low key, decent, not giving into this panic,

526
00:33:02.531 --> 00:33:05.140
not embracing the crisis, we fight you,

527
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.940
but being a common assurances that he will be C, C,

528
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.860
he will be in government, you know,

529
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.710
and at the end of January are just what we need.

530
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.680
Cause people are very exhausted, but I actually,

531
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.620
I end the book on a really hopeful note, um,

532
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.860
that could even seem Pollyannish to some, uh,

533
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:29.200
about the importance of love and the various platforms

534
00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.910
of, uh, uh, in, in [inaudible] Turkey, uh, emo blue, who,

535
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.660
who ran, who successfully won, uh, as mayor of Istanbul,

536
00:33:37.661 --> 00:33:42.220
had a platform of radical love to combat populist polarization

537
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.020
and reaching out to the other side has never been more important.

538
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.480
And I'm an admirer of, uh,

539
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.920
Pete [inaudible] who goes on Fox news every single day

540
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.450
and talks to them. And he is able in his way,

541
00:33:58.451 --> 00:34:01.150
he is a veteran, um,

542
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.740
he's able to reach them and we don't really have another choice.

543
00:34:05.741 --> 00:34:08.980
I think one of the last sentences of the books that if,

544
00:34:08.981 --> 00:34:13.270
when you're at a crossroads, you either turn away from each other,

545
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.400
which is what men like Trump want,

546
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.490
or you try and build bridges.

547
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.970
And if you're going to be a functioning nation,

548
00:34:21.971 --> 00:34:26.440
a productive nation and you're going to heal, uh, and again,

549
00:34:26.441 --> 00:34:28.900
this polarization started well before Trump.

550
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:32.590
He just weaponized it there's really no other option. Um,

551
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.730
so that's how I conclude the book with examples of people from, uh,

552
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:42.280
Edwin's Turkey and Putin's Russia who are coming around to the same

553
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.860
way of thinking. And I think that we need to, uh,

554
00:34:45.861 --> 00:34:47.740
apply this in the States as well.

555
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.450
<v 0>Well, uh,</v>

556
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:53.680
radical of what better place than that to leave such a great discussion. Ruth,

557
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:57.460
thank you so much. Um, this has been so eyeopening and,

558
00:34:57.461 --> 00:34:59.140
and truly revolutionary, um,

559
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.290
I'm commenter and you've been listening to intelligence squared.
