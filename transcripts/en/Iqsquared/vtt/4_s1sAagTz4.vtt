00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.020
<v 1>Is George Monbiot. He's a guardian journalist and author.</v>

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.340
His best-selling books include captive state, the corporate takeover of Britain,

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.820
the age of consent and manifesto for a new world order.

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.860
And most recently out of the wreckage, a new politics for an age of crisis,

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.940
George, over to you.

6
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.920
<v 2>Thanks very much wrestler.</v>

7
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.510
Now I realize that in calling for you to vote for this

8
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:39.260
motion,

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.760
I'm making quite a tough care to call for the end of capitalism

10
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.380
in the 21st century is like saying, God is dead in the 19th.

11
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.420
And perhaps it's a particularly tough ask for people who have paid 30 quid to

12
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.254
get in,

13
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.870
but I know you're a broad minded and intellectually curious bunch,

14
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.380
otherwise you wouldn't be here. So I'm going to ask you hard.

15
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:07.880
As I know it is to the greatest extent possible to put aside all prior

16
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:12.710
beliefs and judge the arguments to see evening on their merits,

17
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.840
which of course will inevitably mean that for a hundred, I win this vote.

18
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.980
Um, so what is capitalism?

19
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.730
It might be quite a useful starting point to agree on our terms. Well,

20
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.170
it's an economic system,

21
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.600
which is whose means where the means of production are privately owned

22
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.040
for the purpose of generating profits and accumulating wealth.

23
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.970
It can be distinguished from other forms of profit seeking by the general

24
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:43.730
commodification of land, labor,

25
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.860
and money as such its origins date back to about the mid 16th century

26
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.730
in England. And as a mature system, it's about 200 years old.

27
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:55.850
I hope we can all agree broadly on that. As a definition,

28
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.620
I hope we can also all agree on what climate collapses climate collapses,

29
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:05.240
what happened somewhere North of 1.5 degrees of global

30
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.550
heating above pre-industrial levels.

31
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.960
This is why the Paris agreement calls on the governments,

32
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:16.520
which have signed it including our own to keep temperature levels

33
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.890
well below two degrees and to seek,

34
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:23.780
to keep them at 1.5 degrees at two degrees,

35
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.500
we see the loss of almost all the world's coral reefs.

36
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.660
We see ice-free sea at the Arctic becoming a regular event with

37
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.890
devastating consequences as runaway feedbacks,

38
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.620
kick in the dark water, absorbing more heat.

39
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.230
The permafrost releasing its carbon.

40
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.000
We've seen recent papers suggesting what they call multiple

41
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:48.780
breadbasket failures.

42
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.420
The world's crucial food production regions being taken out at the

43
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:56.960
same time by simile tenuous heat waves.

44
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.050
We see major cities threatened by inundation. I hope too. We can all agree.

45
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.480
That is climate collapse.

46
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.640
Now I ain't going to argue that capitalism has three essential and intrinsic

47
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:14.110
features without which it would not be capitalism that drive us

48
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.360
inexorably towards climate collapse.

49
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.460
And the first of these is growth growth.

50
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.910
Essential to capitalism without growth.

51
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.060
Capitalism is deemed to fail.

52
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.860
The rising growth in consumption is the aggregate

53
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.310
impact of profit seeking activities. In other words,

54
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:42.960
it's the inevitable result of capitalism successfully

55
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.853
practiced.

56
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.130
And this leads to a slight problem that prepared the actual growth,

57
00:03:50.131 --> 00:03:53.850
which is what capitalism seeks on a finite planet.

58
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.870
It leads inexorably to environmental disaster.

59
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.590
Now, those who seek to justify the system will say, well,

60
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.570
hang on a moment that growth can be decoupled from its environmental

61
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:10.740
impact. So you can have rising growth and falling environmental impacts.

62
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.160
Now we know that where material resource consumption,

63
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:18.870
the consumption of stuff is concerned that has never been

64
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:21.120
demonstrated. However,

65
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.190
it does appear to be the case in some nations where greenhouse gas emissions

66
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.450
are concerned. There's a famous study by the world resources Institute,

67
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.690
which said that across developed nations,

68
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.710
the richest nations in the world, 35 richest nations,

69
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.970
we saw between 2020 14,

70
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.120
a general reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,

71
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.220
even as economic growth Rose in those places.

72
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.210
And for instance, in the UK,

73
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.230
we saw a 24% reduction across that period,

74
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.860
even while there was a 27% increase in consumption in, in,

75
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:07.860
in economics growth. But it's not quite as it seems,

76
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.600
because what that study was looking at is what's called territorial emissions.

77
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.730
The greenhouse gases you produce within your own nation when

78
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.280
carbon brief reanalyzed the figures,

79
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.660
it looked at consumption emissions, greenhouse gases,

80
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:29.580
for which you're responsible in the goods that your nation imports embodied

81
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.930
in those goods.

82
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.330
And that reduced the 24% to 9% across the 15 years,

83
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:40.230
about 0.6% a year reductions in greenhouse gases.

84
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.060
When you then take an account take account of flying and shipping,

85
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.370
which are not included in those figures,

86
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.460
it comes out more or less at zero.

87
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.110
Now a recent study by the UN environment program says that to stand a good

88
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:59.240
chance of preventing more than 1.5 degrees of global,

89
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.050
we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6%

90
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.990
per year for the next 10 years,

91
00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:12.190
not zero or not as it may now be minus two minus

92
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:15.340
7.6%. Well, hang on a minute.

93
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.420
During this entire period of the study, 2000 to 2014,

94
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.960
the British government and the British people in general were making massive

95
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:26.140
efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

96
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.170
We are past the climate change act.

97
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.300
The government spent billions on subsidizing renewables.

98
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.430
We'd got out of coal largely and into gas, a really important transition,

99
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.720
boom, you know, not important enough, but it should have made a huge difference.

100
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.330
We insulated our homes. We changed our light bulbs.

101
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.690
So how come we were flat lining? Well,

102
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:54.340
the answer is that those efforts were counteracted by economic growth

103
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.500
that trying to cut your impacts while your economy is growing.

104
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:04.450
While resource consumption is growing means running down the rising escalator,

105
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.680
it makes it difficult if not impossible.

106
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.410
And the same applies to the next two intrinsic features of capitalism.

107
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.940
The second one is feature,

108
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:22.150
which has been there since John Locke's second treaties of government and

109
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:24.370
absolutely central feature of capitalism,

110
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.260
which is the assumption that the money in your bank account equates to your

111
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:31.870
right to own natural wealth.

112
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.930
You can own as much land as much gold as much.

113
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.140
You can eat as much meat or fish as you want. You can have,

114
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.160
you can create as much burn as much carbon as you like,

115
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:46.210
as long as you've got the money for that. And because of that,

116
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.280
capitalism is a really lousy way of solving our problems because it

117
00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:55.690
means that those were the money, take the lion's share depriving other people.

118
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.040
And however hard we pursue growth, we cannot solve them.

119
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.530
So one study, for instance,

120
00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:05.980
shows that to reduce poverty by $1,

121
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.690
you need to generate $111 of economic growth

122
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.880
on the current trajectory to ensure that everybody through growth gets

123
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:20.770
$5 a day. We would, it would take 200 years.

124
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:25.690
We would need to raise the size of the global economy 170

125
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:29.680
times. But even at current levels of economic growth,

126
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.100
we are bursting through environmental limits.

127
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.180
170 times is not the end of poverty.

128
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.370
It's the end of life on earth. And then there's the third feature,

129
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.500
which is a promise central to capitalism that everyone can aspire

130
00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:50.650
to private luxury. We can all become rich. Now,

131
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.520
even if it weren't for that distributional problem, which I mentioned,

132
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.490
there's another issue there there's simply not enough environmental space for

133
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:02.160
everybody to aspire to private luxury.

134
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.020
The only reason that some people can do it is that other people don't

135
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.210
otherwise we end up just cooking ourselves in very short order.

136
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.850
The richest 1% in the world use 175 times

137
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.770
as much carbon as the poorest 10% is everyone's supposed to use the

138
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:26.490
same amount. These three features of capitalism,

139
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.090
turn it into a gun pointed at the living world.

140
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:34.950
We cannot sustain a habitable climate and sustain capitalism.

141
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.510
Instead,

142
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.430
we need a system based on a different principle of private sufficiency and

143
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:44.550
public luxury. There's enough for everyone.

144
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.910
As long as we share it, there is not enough.

145
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.920
As long as we seek to accumulate it and to keep raising our aggregate

146
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.660
and individual consumption,

147
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.550
you cannot make those changes while still calling it capitalism.

148
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.270
There's an old and vaguely attributed saying,

149
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.490
which is that it's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine

150
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:11.520
the end of capitalism, my friends.

151
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:14.250
I want you to mobilize your imaginations tonight.

152
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.010
The question that faces us is do we stop capitalism

153
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.790
to allow life, to continue or stop life,

154
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.940
to allow capitalism to continue? Thank you.

155
