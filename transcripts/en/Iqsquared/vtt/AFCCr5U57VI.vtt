00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 0>Hello, and welcome to this intelligence squared podcast with me Cole Miller.</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.710
I'm delighted today to introduce our guest Phillip Rowley futures,

3
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.060
director of Omnicom,

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:16.830
who joins me to discuss how COVID-19 will shape the next decade of culture

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.730
and entertainment. A quick reminder, of course,

let us know what you think in the comment section below. So feel hi. Hello.

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:37.440
How are you? Very good. So let's, let's begin Phil, um, with, um,

11
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.370
what what's a features director actually is. Um,

12
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.800
what do you actually spend your day actually doing.

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.890
<v 1>Well? I work for Omnicom media group. Uh, and so my role ultimately is to, uh,</v>

14
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:53.060
use, uh, insight and turn it into foresight about where, um,

15
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.900
where things are headed over the next decade and specifically how that pertains

16
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.330
to brands and businesses. Um, and really sort of effectively, not just,

17
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.420
um, uh, casting forward to a distant intangible future,

18
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.690
but understanding the route to that future so that we can make things, um,

19
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.760
actionable and tangible in the now, um,

20
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:13.970
so that they don't either take us by surprise or we don't position them in such

21
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.120
a fashion that seems so distant that, that,

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.440
that brands and business don't feel they have to worry about it.

23
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.380
So we always say that the future isn't a pin in the map, it is the map.

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.460
And so it's really helping navigate towards, uh, the,

25
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.930
the technological developments, um,

26
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.470
and societal and cultural developments we think, uh, we'll see over the next,

27
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:31.190
say five or.

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.600
<v 0>10 Years. And what's your kind of compass then on this map,</v>

29
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:36.434
like kind of what, what,

30
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.760
what's your actual way of thinking about this in terms of like evidence or data,

31
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:45.230
or how do you kind of pull things together to start to start actually drawing it

32
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.190
all? Yeah.

33
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.180
<v 1>That's a great question. I mean, I think that the, the, one of the, our key,</v>

34
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:50.781
I suppose,

35
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:54.680
approaches is to imagine a futurism as a discipline that can be learned and

36
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.000
taught, um,

37
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.530
rather than just a series of random overbearing prognostications.

38
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.390
Um, our chief, um, our compass, I suppose, is to, uh,

39
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.640
look at the broad territories, which we think that we will,

40
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.250
that we'll be developing over the next sort of five, 10 years,

41
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.700
but then find the entry point, um, in, in the here and now. Uh,

42
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.560
and one of the things that we hear from, you know,

43
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.560
a lot of brands and businesses is that they think that innovation is distant or

44
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:20.210
expensive or too difficult to do.

45
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.510
And our job really is to teach futurism is disciplined by showing them where the

46
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:27.500
entry door is to all of those territories in the now or showing where the bottom

47
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.190
rung of the ladder is. And, and,

48
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.780
and effectively plan out that route in incremental improvements.

49
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.160
I think people tend to forget that innovation is something that happens

50
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:42.080
incrementally, um, and, and evolves rather than a sort of spontaneous,

51
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.980
um, disruptive moment, which everybody seems to, to, to,

52
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.560
to glom on to in, in, in the press.

53
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.670
So it's really about talking that route to the future and teaching futurism as

54
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.553
it is.

55
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.880
<v 0>Well talking of disruptive moments,</v>

56
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.460
let's drag ourselves back into those kinds of fateful of kind of February and

57
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:02.080
March. I dunno what you were doing. I mean,

58
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:06.430
I was barricading myself into my home writing panic, shopping lists,

59
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.820
sundries, and frozen foods to buy. But, um, in,

60
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.570
in those kinds of early weeks where you, was,

61
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.380
it really apparent to you that that actually thinking about the future and

62
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:18.214
especially the,

63
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.800
the further future was going to be a really important thing to do?

64
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.580
<v 1>Absolutely. I mean, just on a personal level, um,</v>

65
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.610
I find my mind turning to things like, how can I,

66
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.400
what do I actually need if I need to hunker down, you know,

67
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.070
what can I get online? What's loaded up into the cloud,

68
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:35.910
what files can I access if I don't have to go buy, uh, go back to work.

69
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.560
So there was that sort of idea of, you know,

70
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:41.460
developing a remote life strategy or a strategy for remote life,

71
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.560
but on a broader level and a business level.

72
00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:46.620
When you work in media marketing and communications,

73
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.150
you also start immediately thinking of the implications for the clients that you

74
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:55.680
work on and trying to understand how that business can be conducted remotely

75
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.480
and using sort of the, the, the hyper-connectivity, uh, of, of the modern era.

76
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.700
And those are the things that I started thinking about.

77
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:06.270
But of course the other thing I started to think about is, um, you know,

78
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.600
what are they short-term and long-term implications about what we're about to

79
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:11.640
say, how is society going to change?

80
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.840
What behaviors are going to stick long after this is, this is a distant memory.

81
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.100
And I find myself filtering those in to the conversations that we're having on a

82
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:23.130
day-to-day basis. And realizing that a strategy, um,

83
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.730
was going to have to emerge from this, for us to advise our clients accordingly.

84
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.650
<v 0>And I suppose exactly that,</v>

85
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.070
that kind of discussion around what the implications of all of this really are,

86
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.790
is, has probably been more discussed and Moldova and, and, and,

87
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.370
and argued over, over this time, we spent locked down in our,

88
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.910
in our houses and almost anything else I can think of, um, as a,

89
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:49.740
as a kind of professional, um, how, uh, how, where people,

90
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:51.120
firstly kind of got it wrong,

91
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.090
where what the kind of like Phantom trends that maybe we're,

92
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.320
we're obsessing too much over an unthink gloom, uh,

93
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.390
two large Overwatch futures that like.

94
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.330
<v 1>Yeah. Um, I don't think anybody's, uh,</v>

95
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.360
identified any trends that necessarily won't come true.

96
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.630
I would turn it back the other way and say, I think people are confusing,

97
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.110
the short-term with the long-term. Um, and that's the Phantom trend.

98
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.010
This idea that whatever's happening right now is the new normal.

99
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:19.800
We keep hearing this phrase, the new normal as if, um, you know,

100
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:23.250
a lot of the trends that we are seeing a lot of the changes and impacts that we

101
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:27.090
are seeing, uh, when now irreversible, well, we know that's not true. You know,

102
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.500
it's certainly in our line of business,

103
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.910
we were told that cinema's cinema advertising is down outdoor advertising is

104
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:37.290
down, um, TV viewing is up and streaming is up. And of course those things, um,

105
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.150
we're not going to remain high forever.

106
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:42.960
Of course they were always going to fall back down to more natural levels when

107
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:45.750
the sort of inline with the peak actually. Um,

108
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.340
I think people are getting confused,

109
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:52.080
the short term aspects of those sort of peaks with the sort of along, um,

110
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.310
the long tail or,

111
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:57.380
or perhaps the slow climb of those trends wants to have bedded in and stick and

112
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.230
feel more integrated into society effectively. Now,

113
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:04.400
I think COVID-19 like a giant sampling campaign for certain technologies and

114
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.320
technologic driven behaviors.

115
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.590
And it's not that everyone will now all of a sudden be living a life like ready

116
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:11.120
player one internal,

117
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.650
but it is those people who have simpled certain things have tried delivering for

118
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:16.484
the first time,

119
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.840
have signed up to Netflix for the first time that they may continue to use

120
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.990
those, or it might be an option for the first time when it hasn't been before.

121
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.370
And so therefore it's that sort of much more subtle weaving in of these

122
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:30.770
behavioral changes that we'll see maybe, um, um,

123
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.370
take root in the next decade rather than this peak of, Oh my goodness,

124
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.400
this is happening, you know, um, this is happening now and will,

125
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.570
and will always be this way.

126
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:40.700
And that's the thing that people are getting confused, I think.

127
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.530
<v 0>And w w what are to, to boil it down, let let's,</v>

128
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:47.770
let's kind of go through some of the, kind of, uh,

129
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.790
like a long-term trend that really is a short-term trend. So is that,

130
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.570
is that things like kind of office working, um, or, um,

131
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.250
the death of the high street, you know, there's a lot,

132
00:06:57.251 --> 00:07:01.180
there's lots of extremely exaggerated prognostications happening at the moment

133
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:03.550
about, about how it changed things would be,

134
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.890
which of those do you think really we'll actually,

135
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.260
we'll learn lean more towards no matter. See, again.

136
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.160
<v 1>I think that's, that's a great question. I think that when you take a trend,</v>

137
00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:14.860
which is being prophesied in the extreme short term,

138
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:16.900
like it's sh like it's a long-term trend.

139
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.540
What you have to do is just take it down a couple of notches.

140
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:23.080
I'm not saying that that trend will never happen. So instead of saying,

141
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.540
everybody will work from home in the future, and of course, we've all seen, uh,

142
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.750
reports of Silicon Valley companies saying, you know, what,

143
00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:30.670
you don't even need to come in again. Um,

144
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.910
I think if you just downgrade that three or four notches,

145
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.780
I think flexibility is something that we'll see moving in the future,

146
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:39.820
inherent flexibility in our working partners.

147
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.150
So the idea that everybody will work for home forevermore is of course,

148
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.900
a Phantom trend, but it's less a cousin it's smaller, more,

149
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.190
perhaps more modest,

150
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:51.490
more nuanced version of that trend is the thing that will take root over the

151
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.130
longterm, which, which is indeed flexibility. Same goes for the,

152
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:56.920
the trend that you've, that you also named there,

153
00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:00.190
which I think is a great example, which is the high street. Now, of course,

154
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.160
everyone's saying the high street is dead, or, you know, there are lots of,

155
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.540
you know, terrible, uh, apocalyptic predictions. Um, again, it's,

156
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.710
it's perhaps in the short term, that might be true, but over the long-term,

157
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.850
the high street does have a role to play. And, you know,

158
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:15.820
we've been doing a lot of thinking about what a future high street might look

159
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:18.970
like coming off the back of COVID in five to 10 years. And again,

160
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.140
that lesser cost that more modest version of that perhaps doom Laden

161
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.570
prognostication is ultimately that, you know,

162
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.900
the high street will be much more digitally driven and much more digitally

163
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:33.190
integrated into its, into its offline, excuse me, into its online equivalent.

164
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.150
Um, and again, that's, I think that's the way we see things unfolding. Rather,

165
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.240
nothing is binary, nothing is doom Laden, or, you know,

166
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.000
perfectly utopian and optimistic.

167
00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:46.570
It will in fact be a sort of subtle mesh of both really over a longer period.

168
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.370
<v 0>Okay, well, let's go to the kind of mirror image of the Phantom trend,</v>

169
00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:54.160
which I haven't managed to find a good word for yet, but the,

170
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.760
because let, let, let's, let's talk about the, the, the longer term Jensen,

171
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.460
the genuine, you know, um, trajectories, which,

172
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.200
which you see all wrapped up in society.

173
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:07.680
And I I'd like to begin with the ones which, um,

174
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.100
are least visible to us. So, um,

175
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:14.070
w w what are the kind of bubbling kind of, um,

176
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.890
kind of changes in society that you see that, that probably, uh,

177
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:20.580
furthest away from people's kind of recommending and, and, and kind of, um,

178
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.580
conscious kind of a thought at the moment? Yeah.

179
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.220
<v 1>Yeah. I think that my first answer to that would be one that may be seemingly</v>

180
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:31.280
counter-intuitive or potentially mildly controversial.

181
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.770
And that is that I think we may be able to,

182
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.340
or we might be at bounce to enter into an age of innovation. Um,

183
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.930
one of the things that I was listening to commentators talk about prior to

184
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.150
COVID, uh, was, uh,

185
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.020
the fact that there was a lot of VC cash washing around at the moment.

186
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.220
And there was a lot of very,

187
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:54.110
very historically low interest rates and a sort of coming proxy war,

188
00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:55.400
almost like the cold war, but,

189
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.880
but in innovation war between superpowers that wanted to demonstrate their

190
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.990
prowess, um, through technological and innovative accomplishment.

191
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.820
And that was sort of prior now, um, I think that that is something that again,

192
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:11.600
will be accelerated and ramped up the learnings from 2008.

193
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.380
The crash was that you can't cut your way out of these situations.

194
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.330
You have to kind of grow and innovate your way out.

195
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.340
I never a better proving or testing field than this pandemic for

196
00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:24.950
large tech companies and businesses and brands,

197
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.150
and everyday people to see this as an opportunity to innovate their way out.

198
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:29.991
And of course,

199
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:34.700
maybe some of that VC cash is not floating around as much as it was. Um,

200
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.020
but, um,

201
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.370
the interest rates are still low and we are still in an extremely sort of,

202
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.180
what's the word I'm looking for, um, uh, software company competition,

203
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.630
maybe not so subtle competition with some of our global competitors for

204
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.810
innovation prowess. And I think, again, over the longer term, the, the,

205
00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:55.280
the invisible trend that we're not talking about is that we potentially are

206
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:58.100
about to reap the benefits of this, uh,

207
00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:02.510
of people with admittedly egos like Bezos and Musk and all the rest of it who

208
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.530
think this is a fantastic challenge for me to answer for me to leave my imprint

209
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.610
on society,

210
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.910
for me to demonstrate that we have the solution to everything and bring all

211
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:13.940
those forces to bear, whether it be Silicon Valley or VC cash,

212
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.520
or this ability to, um, uh, to,

213
00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:21.470
to sort of solve the global issues is the thing that may give us a real boost

214
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.350
and, and bring us into this potentially an area of innovation.

215
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.350
<v 0>Are we, are we likely, that's so interesting.</v>

216
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.790
So are we likely to see innovation happening in like unfamiliar places?

217
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.930
So we, you know, we've got the kind of digital services, we've got AI,

218
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:39.380
emerging technology. Um, I presumably, you know,

219
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.630
in medicine and pharmaceuticals,

220
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.230
but I bet kind of other areas where you see kind of innovation,

221
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.840
maybe coming slightly kind of more out of left field.

222
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:54.250
<v 1>I think that the area of innovation that we're most likely to, uh,</v>

223
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.540
that's most likely to have blindsided us because it's not within common parlance

224
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:02.050
of most everyday people is this idea of deep tech, uh,

225
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.220
which I'm not sure if you're aware of which again is tech technology,

226
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:11.020
which is designed to solve really big existentialist issues that costs

227
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.460
hundreds of millions and billions of, uh, of pounds to solve,

228
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.760
because it's not on the radar of most people. And when I'm talking about that,

229
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:23.350
I'm talking about things like the lab grown meat, um, and, uh, and,

230
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.690
um, artificial intelligence as well. Now,

231
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.960
now I know that they are not a direct response to the pandemic,

232
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.801
and you could say, well,

233
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.190
how is the lab grown meat going to get us out of the problem with the pandemic?

234
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.460
It's really just a series of dominoes knocking against one another.

235
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.220
So the answer is, you know,

236
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.300
I think that we're about to see some profound existential it's life-changing

237
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:48.220
technologies accelerated as a result of COVID not as a direct

238
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:51.160
response, but more as a sort of knock on effect of,

239
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.090
because of this sort of time of innovation as a response to, uh,

240
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.680
almost a restate of humanity's genius and its ability to solve problems.

241
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.990
<v 0>Use the word accelerated there, which was a brilliant cue for my,</v>

242
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.470
for my next question. So, um, that,

243
00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:10.440
that is the word that's often being used, um, kind of, um, to,

244
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.760
to describe what's happening, you know,

245
00:13:11.761 --> 00:13:16.440
the idea that the coronavirus and the lockdown has accelerated a

246
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:19.640
series of trends that are happening already. What do you think about that? Is,

247
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.020
is that really true or are there kind of actual,

248
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:25.590
genuine new directions rather than just accelerations that have happened over

249
00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:26.424
the last year?

250
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.130
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, we've looked at quite closely at this and,</v>

251
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.840
and I'm not going to be as arrogant enough to assume that there are no examples

252
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:37.200
of new trends, but we've certainly not found any compelling, new trends,

253
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.460
rather everything that we feel that will be accelerated over the long-term as a

254
00:13:41.461 --> 00:13:44.460
result of COVID were trends that were bubbling under the surface. Anyway,

255
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.350
they had had prior discussion that had been predicted prior. Um, and so,

256
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:52.860
yeah, I, I'm not sure, uh, unless anyone who wants to countermand my example,

257
00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:55.890
that we've seen anything new, rather we see that, uh, you know,

258
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.760
effectively the escalator has been turned to double speed and everything that

259
00:13:59.761 --> 00:14:03.740
was going to happen as happening a lot quicker. The analogy I use is,

260
00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:05.940
is it's a bit like the scene in back to the future,

261
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.280
to where doc Brown says that we've been the,

262
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.610
that Marty's been knocked on onto to an alternative 1985.

263
00:14:11.611 --> 00:14:13.560
And he draws a diagram on the Blackboard.

264
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.380
I think of that everything that was going to happen,

265
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:21.060
we are now in an alternative 20, 25 or on routes to an alternative 20, 25,

266
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:23.550
where everything that would've happened will now happen sooner,

267
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.800
had COVID not happened. If that makes sense.

268
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.030
<v 0>Are there any trends that we're accelerating,</v>

269
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.800
but were really important that kind of have that have driven into a wall as a

270
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.130
there? So are there any kind of like stopped trends?

271
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.160
<v 1>Wow. Um, uh,</v>

272
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.580
the only way that I can think of that a trend would be stocked in the short term

273
00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:46.650
is due to a lack of funding. Um, you know,

274
00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:49.500
when we talked to our clients about the fact that they should be innovating,

275
00:14:49.501 --> 00:14:51.650
naturally, they want to tell us, um,

276
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.260
how they restricted budgets or their budgets are restricted.

277
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.780
So you could take all the trends that we predict coming down the line.

278
00:14:56.781 --> 00:15:00.530
And we can go into more detail about specifically what those trends are. Um,

279
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.690
all I'd say is, I don't think any will be stopped,

280
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:04.450
but many potentially may have an,

281
00:15:04.451 --> 00:15:08.780
an initial sort of hump to go over whilst people attempt to save money.

282
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.700
But again, you know, my, my,

283
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.100
my statement on that is that I think that's a mistake.

284
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:15.590
I know it's easy for me to sit here and tell them to spend money when,

285
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:17.810
of course they need cutbacks. But one of the learnings,

286
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.000
as I mentioned from 2008, is that, you know,

287
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:23.000
these trends can only be stopped by people assuming that money is not the

288
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:23.510
answer,

289
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.230
but in many cases spending and innovating the way out of the situation is

290
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.210
exactly the answer. And that's what we've seen.

291
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.690
<v 0>Okay. Well, so let's, let's dig into some of these trends, a little deeper. Um,</v>

292
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.680
and the first one I want to begin with is one that I know an enormous number of

293
00:15:38.681 --> 00:15:42.050
people are thinking about, worried about it's the, it's the right, you know,

294
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.150
the, the rise and rise and rise and rise and rise of the tech giants. Um,

295
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:51.020
how much more powerful have they become over the lockdown and,

296
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:54.460
and what do you think the kind of implications of that really are?

297
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.310
<v 1>Okay. So I think they've, of course,</v>

298
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.700
due to the fact that we're just all using them, um, considerably more,

299
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.360
or they have, uh, seen a considerable rise in their power. However,

300
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.910
what I also think is, um,

301
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.200
I think that there is increasing awareness of how much power that they have over

302
00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:15.640
us. This is not some kind of invisible or Wesleyan, uh, um, oversight.

303
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:19.300
I think people are increasingly aware of how much they're being tracked and how

304
00:16:19.301 --> 00:16:23.770
much more they are using the services of the tech giants. Um,

305
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.420
and as a result, um,

306
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.800
one potential sort of knock on effect might be counter intuitive,

307
00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:31.910
and it might be counterproductive to the, to, to, to,

308
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:36.400
to the tech giants is that we may see, uh, potentially a privacy fight Mack,

309
00:16:36.401 --> 00:16:37.540
which again, to, to,

310
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.600
to the earlier point is something that was bubbling under the surface. Anyway,

311
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.290
um, we have seen, um, not just tech giants actually,

312
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:47.920
but governments as well use contact tracing. And in certain countries,

313
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:50.170
this is used as, almost as a method of enforcement.

314
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.940
We've seen smart city control rooms pop up. Um, in India, we have seen, uh,

315
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.310
drones, um, where I'm from in,

316
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.350
Darbyshire trying to tell people to go home and, and, and even if people,

317
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.220
even if people aren't more monitored than before they at least feel that they're

318
00:17:06.221 --> 00:17:08.890
being more monitored before they feel, uh,

319
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.880
that you know that Facebook and Google and Amazon know more about them before,

320
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.690
and that might lead them to seek out private privacy solutions.

321
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.770
Now you can actually see VPNs versatile virtual personal networks advertised in

322
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:23.710
the middle of coronation street on ITV now. And I,

323
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.450
and this is something that you can download effectively to, to,

324
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.310
to sort of make your,

325
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.040
make your life a lot easier and make you feel more comfortable that you're not

326
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:34.420
being tracked. And also at a startup conference last year in Finland, I saw, um,

327
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.090
the introduction of something called data anonymizes,

328
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.660
which effectively is something that you can download onto your computer,

329
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.180
whether it be an app or a small, um, uh,

330
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.170
computer program running in the background that effectively covers your tracks

331
00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:48.190
in the snow. Um,

332
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:53.240
or another way of saying it would be to scribble out selected letters on a,

333
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:58.050
on a P on a piece of writing metaphorically so that people can't piece together

334
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.450
who you are or what you've done. Um,

335
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.780
and the way that works instantly is by spamming the algorithm with something

336
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:05.070
called synthetic data.

337
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.120
So it gives the algorithm so much contradictory information to, to, to,

338
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.450
to calculate that it sort of loses any sense of who you are.

339
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.230
And so when they become common, common use,

340
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.880
that means that the tech giants may have a challenge to their ability to apply

341
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:22.620
their trade with so much efficiency,

342
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.190
because effectively they're selling or they're buying your attention,

343
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:29.400
but they're also in return buying certain pieces of information in order to sell

344
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.440
you goods and services. And there's not a problem with that,

345
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:34.350
as long as people know that they are being tracked accordingly,

346
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.160
but you might see, um, that sort of a, you know, a set of tools,

347
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:42.750
which allow citizens to counteract that fact as a result of the pandemic.

348
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.980
<v 0>So what about kind of decentralization, um, um, data unions.</v>

349
00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:49.180
Do,

350
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.700
do you think there's this kind of whole other kind of countervailing trend in a

351
00:18:52.701 --> 00:18:52.970
way,

352
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.900
which at some point it's going to kind of smash into the kind of centralizing

353
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.350
data, aggregating data, hungry,

354
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.410
insatiable appetite of the, of the platforms that,

355
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.510
that themselves are getting so much bigger.

356
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.670
<v 1>Potentially. Um, I mean,</v>

357
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.350
I hate to mention the B and the C word blockchain and crypto coin, but,

358
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.960
um, because it's sort of had a bit of a bad rap recently,

359
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:16.190
certainly as an investment,

360
00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:19.760
but I think one of the underlying principles about those technologies and what's

361
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:23.510
interesting is it allows people to sort of play their trade on a decentralized

362
00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:25.850
and an anonymous basis. And if nothing else,

363
00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:29.360
the learnings from those two technologies might be once they become available to

364
00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:31.220
the general public and understandable,

365
00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:34.610
and usable and functional to the general public, they may, as you say,

366
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.530
be the direct counter trends to this idea of, uh, of, of, uh,

367
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.130
of collecting data together. Um, and in which case, you know,

368
00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:47.330
we ha we have strategies Omnicom for sort of getting round and circumventing

369
00:19:47.331 --> 00:19:50.210
that in. And I don't mean legally, I mean, in the sense that, you know,

370
00:19:50.211 --> 00:19:53.540
there are other ways for brands and businesses to talk to their customers

371
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.460
without necessarily having to, you know,

372
00:19:55.461 --> 00:20:00.260
store huge amounts of information about them. But, um, that is, uh, yeah,

373
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.190
I agree there, there, there is potentially a tension point between those two,

374
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.473
um, on the horizon.

375
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.750
<v 0>Let's go to, um,</v>

376
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.010
let's go away from data and over to decision-making. So,

377
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:15.160
so you mentioned governments a bit already do,

378
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.700
is that another kind of focal or principle trend that you see that almost is

379
00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:23.060
kind of changing relationship between governments and the governments?

380
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:24.800
<v 1>I think so. Um,</v>

381
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.340
and I think that's typified by the fact that we see a lot of big governments.

382
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.860
Um, we, we see a lot of big government,

383
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:34.160
so governments taking top-down control of their societies during a crisis,

384
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.900
but we see it from conservative governments,

385
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:39.050
which have traditionally have been the parties of, um, of small government.

386
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.620
And of course, they've had to do that as a result of, um, uh, of, uh,

387
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:45.740
of the crisis. But I think the way that they've done that, um,

388
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.880
partially is through the use technology in the way we've just discussed with the

389
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.990
tech giants, but also through the use of connectivity. Uh, and, and, and,

390
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:56.350
you know, it's really interesting that, um, many of the, uh,

391
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:01.330
five government led 5g programs around the world have been accelerated as a

392
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:05.920
result of this crisis. Um, in order to, um, ensure equality of access,

393
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:08.260
you would say, um, uh, on the face of it,

394
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:12.250
but actually to your point is to ensure that they can govern their citizens

395
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:14.050
better. I mean, a couple of examples,

396
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.160
Telstra in Australia who are the Australian telecommunications company have

397
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:22.180
brought forward their 5g development and invested an extra $500 million.

398
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.310
They was provisioned in the $10 billion FCC bailout that Trump signed off for,

399
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.690
um, addressing, um,

400
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.280
rural communities that don't have a proper connectivity so that they can't be

401
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.580
governed to. I suppose, to, to a certain extent,

402
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:39.490
they had 10 million people fall into what they call the homework gap.

403
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:42.490
So kids couldn't do their homework because their internet was too slow.

404
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.220
And then in this country, of course, we have 5g, uh,

405
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.440
mass being put up all over the place. And,

406
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.370
and then we have quad away in the mix, which might obfuscate, uh, um, the,

407
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.060
that the development of that that's all part and parcel that 5g development of

408
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:58.270
governments wanting to ensure equality of access and to govern their citizens

409
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.650
through these technological systems off the back of what we've seen, um,

410
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.900
during the pandemic, even conservative governments,

411
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.510
which you could argue are not into spending big.

412
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.290
<v 0>What do you think is going to happen to trust? Um, cause one of the, I mean,</v>

413
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.000
I, I mean trusting kind of, of individuals in kind of all big institutions,

414
00:22:18.001 --> 00:22:20.460
so be that a corporate or a government, because I mean,

415
00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.690
it's hard to talk about futures around coronavirus, but of course,

416
00:22:24.691 --> 00:22:29.120
mentioning conspiracy theories, the info dynamic, you know, and the, uh,

417
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.500
basically they're kind of organized mobilized resistance to the

418
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.760
epidemiologically driven consensus around, around the lockdown.

419
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.100
And how significant do you think that que and on conspiracy theories in

420
00:22:44.101 --> 00:22:47.160
general are kind of as a, as a new cultural force?

421
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.120
<v 1>I think they're incredibly significant. Um, I think that we've seen trust,</v>

422
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.700
take an absolute nosedive. Um, uh, again,

423
00:22:53.701 --> 00:22:57.980
this is not something that is new during the new there's new as a result of

424
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.020
pandemic, but something that's been accelerated where, um,

425
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.600
effectively propaganda has been democratized,

426
00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:06.630
anybody that who has access to a keyboard can, can state something without,

427
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.230
without recourse ultimately, or certainly, uh, can say something without,

428
00:23:10.231 --> 00:23:13.650
without, um, being sued so easily. Um,

429
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.010
I think that we are going to have to, this sort of keeps me awake at night.

430
00:23:17.011 --> 00:23:20.880
Actually. I think we are going to have to find a better functioning system for

431
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.610
establishing trust. Um, and I don't know what that looks like.

432
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:25.300
I don't know where for it's used, if,

433
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:28.140
if we use some kind of certification to demonstrate, um,

434
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.180
the provenance and Providence of information,

435
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.640
I don't know if it contains something that's built around something like a

436
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.720
digital watermark, which ultimately, uh, um, uh,

437
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.590
signifies the veracity of the origin of a piece of information. Again,

438
00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:43.530
going back to the, sort of the, the, the blockchain, um,

439
00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:47.870
argument that might be a way of somehow ensuring that something is, um,

440
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.970
for one of a better word, um, uncorruptable to a certain extent, but this is,

441
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:56.810
I think that trust is the biggest issue facing society today,

442
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.980
particularly given the decentralization of truth, if you like. Um,

443
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.570
and the fact that anyone can, anyone with a computer can, can, uh,

444
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.510
make proclamations, which don't, which don't have to be backed up.

445
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.280
And that has real implications for government.

446
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.410
It has real implications for brands and businesses,

447
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.000
and it has real implications for citizens,

448
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:16.760
and it's something that somebody really needs to solve.

449
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:19.310
And I'm afraid I don't have the answer to it in the short term.

450
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.830
<v 0>Because at least to me, it kind of really feels like there's,</v>

451
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.400
there's something of an earthquake rumbling under lots of our kind of pillows,

452
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.510
institutional pillars,

453
00:24:28.511 --> 00:24:32.350
like they're going to BBC or professional journalists or government,

454
00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:36.040
or the police service, you know, where there's this kind of, you know,

455
00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:41.020
Morris of locked down plus online influence operations and someone is

456
00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:44.170
really shaking it. What would say, say,

457
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.480
just to go pessimistic for a second feel,

458
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.800
we don't manage to kind of engineer ourselves to kind of trust solution, um,

459
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.340
to say trust continues to decline and in the kind of slightly longer time,

460
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.620
kind of what,

461
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.440
w what does a society with very low levels of trust actually look like?

462
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.460
And is that something that say, you know, corporates companies and so on,

463
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.630
really have to start thinking about that?

464
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.290
<v 1>I think so. I think my view is,</v>

465
00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:12.280
is that we will descend into a series of extremely discreet network tribes so

466
00:25:12.281 --> 00:25:15.070
that, you know, the national borders will break down and we'll actually,

467
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.640
we will seek to disassociate ourselves with those that we feel are

468
00:25:18.641 --> 00:25:19.474
untrustworthy.

469
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:23.110
And what you'll get is this sort of atomization or a virtual optimization,

470
00:25:23.111 --> 00:25:27.400
because it won't be a long street lines or national lines, or even cross lines.

471
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:30.910
It will be sort of networked across borders with people who you feel you have

472
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.570
shared with common values. And so I think that we'll see us sort of,

473
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.480
kind of a multi-layered thing of society,

474
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.940
which is based on people with shared values,

475
00:25:39.941 --> 00:25:44.080
rather than any other kind of social construct that for business and brands

476
00:25:44.081 --> 00:25:48.880
means that they have a sort of new set of target markets rather than, you know,

477
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.200
um, you know, uh,

478
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.850
should we say men 16 to 34 it's attitude and all target markets or

479
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.700
attitudes or sets where they feel that they can, uh,

480
00:25:57.701 --> 00:26:01.660
cover off quite a few people with a particular messaging opportunity by

481
00:26:01.661 --> 00:26:05.830
appealing to a, you know, a disparate but connected group of people,

482
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.880
rather than a vertical cohort based on any kind of usual

483
00:26:09.881 --> 00:26:14.650
socioeconomic demographics. Um, and that we don't want to get to that situation,

484
00:26:14.651 --> 00:26:15.790
because that means that it's very,

485
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:18.370
very difficult to build bridges between those disparate, uh,

486
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:22.480
and discrete targets, but it is something that I think might come out of, um,

487
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.470
a situation where we don't solve that trust issue using potentially a

488
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:28.990
technological solution that you, as the way you just mentioned.

489
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.490
<v 0>Well, to turn to something a little lighter, I think for our, I lost,</v>

490
00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:36.250
I lost kind of big trends to dig into as,

491
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.180
as everyone else was doing wholesome things like baking banana bread.

492
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:44.790
I was getting my PS4 back out and I can't imagine I'm alone in kind of turning

493
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.700
back to gaming. Um, during the lockdown what's happened there,

494
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.900
what's happening in gaming.

495
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.440
<v 1>We've seen a massive increase in gaming. Um,</v>

496
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.110
and this is a piece of work that we're doing at the moment, um,

497
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.280
which we think that there's going to be,

498
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.060
this is one of the perfect examples of how long-term change will come out of the

499
00:26:59.061 --> 00:27:02.120
pandemic. And a couple of things to say on this. First of all,

500
00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:06.860
more people are gaming than ever before, or were more gaming than ever before,

501
00:27:06.861 --> 00:27:10.520
before the pandemic. And now, of course, that has rocketed, not least because,

502
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.910
um, um, obviously people have been at home,

503
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.290
but also because people are taking up at the same time, um, hyper casual gaming,

504
00:27:18.291 --> 00:27:21.710
which is the, just using it on your phone or using it on an app,

505
00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:23.540
and people don't even consider themselves gamers,

506
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.300
but they're just sort of playing a quick round of Scrabble whilst they're,

507
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.130
whilst they're waiting for the kettle to boil or whatever.

508
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:32.840
So there are more people gaming than ever before that comes at the same time.

509
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.140
As more people are sort of static and stationary than ever before,

510
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.980
but it also comes at a time when the gaming companies themselves

511
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.960
are developing the technology to such a point that you can now have,

512
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.640
um, other media ensconced within gaming environments.

513
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.230
So on animal crossing, we've seen TV chat shows within animal crossing.

514
00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.550
We have seen Travis Scott perform a concert within fortnight and achieved

515
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.610
27.7 million views. Um,

516
00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.240
we have seen people learning, um, within gaming environments.

517
00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:07.880
There are minor lessons in Minecraft now,

518
00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:10.910
a science lessons and history lessons in Minecraft. Um,

519
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.020
and what we actually think that we will see is that gaming will swallow all of

520
00:28:15.021 --> 00:28:16.400
the media. Um,

521
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:20.600
emotional influence said that every new media swallows the previous media,

522
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:24.740
so there was originally writing and then radio came along and added audio and

523
00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:27.290
took stories within it within its purview.

524
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.140
And then TV came along and swallowed radio and added visuals.

525
00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:32.900
And the internet came along and swallowed TV,

526
00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:36.920
which contained radio and writing, and now gaming will swallow everything.

527
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.190
Not because that it would be necessarily be bigger than all of those things,

528
00:28:40.191 --> 00:28:43.250
but because it can contain all of those things. And soon,

529
00:28:43.251 --> 00:28:47.330
I don't think that we will need the word gaming anymore because that just refers

530
00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:50.750
to computerized competition. We'll need a different word for it. Um,

531
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.260
spatial computing is one that's been used or virtual media is another,

532
00:28:54.261 --> 00:28:57.320
but that sort of has connotations again of VR headsets,

533
00:28:57.321 --> 00:29:00.560
which I think is inaccurate. But the biggest change,

534
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.600
I think from a media perspective to come out of COVID is that, that,

535
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:08.000
that this idea is gaming will morph into a channel of channels that will contain

536
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:11.270
all the, all the channels inside it and be the glue between them.

537
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.660
And that's going to have enormous significance just as quick example,

538
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.940
if anybody under the age of, sorry, excuse me.

539
00:29:16.941 --> 00:29:19.490
If anyone over the age of 40 has never been on Twitch,

540
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:24.830
go and watch Twitch for half an hour. It is bewildering and confusing.

541
00:29:24.831 --> 00:29:26.270
And yet at the same time, you know,

542
00:29:26.271 --> 00:29:29.590
that that's what the future of media will look like. Everything is on there,

543
00:29:29.591 --> 00:29:31.940
there is people spectating, other people watching games.

544
00:29:31.941 --> 00:29:34.850
There's a social layer over the top there's music on there.

545
00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:38.120
There's celebrities on there, they're sporting fixtures on there.

546
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.100
That's what the future of media looks like.

547
00:29:40.101 --> 00:29:44.830
It's confusing and has multiple parts and contains all of the media with

548
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.290
inside its platform. And that's what I think we'll see.

549
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.410
<v 0>A really compelling. And when, when you, when you put it so eloquently,</v>

550
00:29:52.411 --> 00:29:54.900
it's hard to see how it's not going to happen. Um,

551
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.360
w w what would the implications,

552
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:02.490
so imagining a society 10 years from hence where we are maybe all

553
00:30:02.491 --> 00:30:05.550
gamers without even really thinking we are gamers anymore,

554
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.520
because it's so ubiquitous, what are the implications of that for all of us,

555
00:30:08.521 --> 00:30:09.750
do you think, um,

556
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.380
is that going to change the kind of society and who we know is going to change?

557
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.900
Well, we all become much better. Problem-solvers.

558
00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:19.860
Are there any kind of personal consequences of all of this that people might

559
00:30:19.861 --> 00:30:20.694
start to think about?

560
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:25.050
<v 1>Yes. I think the danger is actually going back to my, to my previous point,</v>

561
00:30:25.051 --> 00:30:26.940
is that when we can associate, um,

562
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.460
virtually with anybody that we wish to associate with,

563
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.200
and you don't have to rub shoulders with the person on the side, on, on,

564
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:34.380
on the boss, that's speaking loudly on his phone.

565
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:39.150
I think it will just compound the echo chamber effect that we see are going on,

566
00:30:39.151 --> 00:30:42.810
on social media during the pandemic, and before and after I think that,

567
00:30:42.811 --> 00:30:43.021
you know,

568
00:30:43.021 --> 00:30:47.520
when you can spend time interacting with people of your choice in a way of your

569
00:30:47.521 --> 00:30:50.730
choosing and avail yourselves of entertainment, uh,

570
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.360
auctions and educational options, uh,

571
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.180
and almost be ultimately selective about your audience,

572
00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:01.170
it may mean that we don't come into contact with any kind of people with any

573
00:31:01.171 --> 00:31:04.890
kind of media with any kind of messaging or communication or thinking that we

574
00:31:04.891 --> 00:31:07.050
wouldn't have ordinarily come into contact with.

575
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.660
So it could potentially compound that, um,

576
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.250
atomization and compartmentalization and science, social siloing, um,

577
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.820
and I don't know what we do about that. Um, but that is something that, uh,

578
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.360
it could be a potential consequence when we have ultimate choice when we can

579
00:31:21.361 --> 00:31:24.840
draw any picture or painting that we want when we can listen to any sound that

580
00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:29.010
we, that we wish to when we can, um, occupy any location, uh,

581
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.120
virtually that we want to, um, we may find that we, uh,

582
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.230
that we filter out the things that we didn't know were good for us, um,

583
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.140
that we were being exposed to against our choice. Um,

584
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.790
and that could be a potential.

585
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.100
<v 0>How far away,</v>

586
00:31:44.101 --> 00:31:48.300
away from a major political party running a campaign on a,

587
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.740
within a virtual space?

588
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.500
<v 1>Well, given</v>

589
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.890
given that most political parties are perhaps a little bit slow to the punch,

590
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.770
uh, in, in, in my view, certainly in this country,

591
00:32:01.771 --> 00:32:04.230
I don't think that it's going to be in the immediate,

592
00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:08.010
I don't think it will be by the next election, I wouldn't imagine. Um,

593
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.000
but I think that certainly it will become part of a standard political

594
00:32:12.001 --> 00:32:15.450
vocabulary, certainly within the next couple of decades.

595
00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:20.310
I think Obama was one of the first people to embrace, um, micro-targeting,

596
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.310
uh, in the 2008 election. And,

597
00:32:22.311 --> 00:32:24.870
and it wasn't really talked about very much because it wasn't very well

598
00:32:24.871 --> 00:32:27.720
understood, but then of course, fast forward to Trump's election,

599
00:32:27.721 --> 00:32:30.570
and then people were using it as an excuse to say that this is,

600
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.880
this is the reason why the election has been manipulated.

601
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.330
If there are any experiments in virtual spaces in politics at the moment.

602
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.560
I think that they're certainly not prominent enough to be part of the, uh,

603
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:41.870
of the discourse, uh, for a little while yet.

604
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.140
<v 0>So Phil, in this kind of last kind of mini sections of talk,</v>

605
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.460
I'm keen to kind of bring it, um, kind of back home to, to, to people,

606
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.060
um, people listening to this that I'm sure, um,

607
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.450
have found like lots to be optimistic about and maybe some things to be

608
00:32:58.451 --> 00:33:01.660
pessimistic about in all the different trends that you've kind of woven together

609
00:33:01.661 --> 00:33:05.410
and described. Um, is there any,

610
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.990
are there any trends amongst all that you see that first off,

611
00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.110
it's kind of worth warning people about, you know,

612
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.590
the might impact them the most in a, in a way which will be negative,

613
00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.530
but they really need to start planning and thinking about now?

614
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.870
<v 1>Well, the exact point, I think that for many companies and for many, many, uh,</v>

615
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.700
citizens that are sort of a plan B or a contingency plan may become a

616
00:33:30.701 --> 00:33:35.170
standard practice or should it become a standard practice? Um, you know, when,

617
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:40.330
when I went to the supermarket on the first night that the pandemic looked like

618
00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:41.440
it was going to get serious,

619
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:45.460
I went about eight 30 and all the shelves were empty and I started to get a

620
00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:48.610
little bit panicked. And I think that if Penn,

621
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.550
if there was a pandemic came along again, or maybe not pandemic,

622
00:33:51.551 --> 00:33:55.750
maybe another event of equal import, that was just as globally significant.

623
00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.820
I would hope that supermarkets and businesses and people may have

624
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:05.740
developed, um, a contingency plan or a plan B, and that might involve, uh,

625
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.700
you know, um, stores of cash or stores of food, not sort of prepper standard,

626
00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:13.660
but, you know, just knowing, knowing what they would do in a crisis,

627
00:34:13.661 --> 00:34:17.080
because part of the panic that was driven that during those first week is people

628
00:34:17.081 --> 00:34:21.600
had not had the experience of this before. Um, and so, yeah, I,

629
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:24.790
I would advise people in the same way as they take out insurance or,

630
00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:28.600
or get fire alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, or, you know,

631
00:34:28.601 --> 00:34:33.460
work out how to save for something that they have a sort of a mandated, um,

632
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.790
escape route and a backup plan for such situations in future,

633
00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:40.690
because we have been found wanting, um, in this situation.

634
00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:46.660
<v 0>How about, um, how about jobs? So, so, you know, sadly of course,</v>

635
00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:51.040
you know, the, the furlough scheme winding down redundancies winding up,

636
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.900
there's probably people listening to this now that had a job a couple of months

637
00:34:55.901 --> 00:34:59.050
ago that don't now, um, in, in the trends,

638
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.010
how can people react in the trends that you see to maybe think about new

639
00:35:03.011 --> 00:35:07.660
industries or new sectors or new skills, um, you know, to,

640
00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.190
to move into or acquire.

641
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.820
<v 1>That's difficult to predict. I think, um, I've,</v>

642
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.390
I think off the back of the pandemic,

643
00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.740
obviously there are people who have lost their jobs, but again,

644
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.650
sort of in that longer term, I think that, you know,

645
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:24.520
that they will be found again, hopefully, um, as a result of things,

646
00:35:24.521 --> 00:35:28.710
getting back to normal, but further down the line, I think just,

647
00:35:28.711 --> 00:35:33.070
just the general, uh, efficiency drive and automation,

648
00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:37.980
and robotization that we see of industry in general is something that is more

649
00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:42.720
of more concern rather than the sort of post pandemic, uh, implications of, uh,

650
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:47.520
of the job market. And the things that I've read about in the past, um,

651
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.130
is really to try and move into, uh,

652
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.390
into work that doesn't age doesn't involve any kind of repetitive pattern,

653
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.650
because that's something that machine learning could pick up and repeat and,

654
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.240
and be a job that requires emotional intelligence is something that won't be,

655
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.960
um, that won't be a replicable in the short term.

656
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.320
So if you are an artist or a nurse, um,

657
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.140
or somebody that does something that isn't on a production line,

658
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:17.870
this is something that will hold you in good stead over time. Um, and,

659
00:36:17.871 --> 00:36:22.440
and I think that's more keen to keep front of mind rather than anything that's

660
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:26.100
come out of the pandemic, which I think jobs will slowly recovering the midterm.

661
00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.830
<v 0>How about kind of other key life choices fill for people? So, you know,</v>

662
00:36:30.831 --> 00:36:34.610
I'm sure people are gonna try to sell their house, move to the country,

663
00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.230
get away from, you know, I, I,

664
00:36:36.231 --> 00:36:39.590
is there a danger that kind of people are actually making life choices based,

665
00:36:39.591 --> 00:36:43.190
as you said on the kind of short term impression of how societies can change

666
00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.070
actually, rather than what's going to look like two years from now.

667
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.840
<v 1>I think there is it's the opposite.</v>

668
00:36:47.841 --> 00:36:51.560
I think there's a danger that they are not making decisions based on the short

669
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:52.431
term. So in other words,

670
00:36:52.431 --> 00:36:55.340
people are holding off on things they're holding off on selling the house.

671
00:36:55.341 --> 00:36:59.000
They're holding off on going on holiday, they're holding off on, uh, on a,

672
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.760
on an, on a new car. Uh,

673
00:37:00.761 --> 00:37:04.040
and I'm not advocating necessarily that they go out and do all of these things

674
00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:05.090
and throw caution to the wind,

675
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.550
not least because we have a set of instructions where it says, you know,

676
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.100
for the most part, trying to limit yourself to, to,

677
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.670
to congregating with less than six people. Um, so,

678
00:37:13.671 --> 00:37:16.160
so I think that's more likely to have the short term is that everything's on

679
00:37:16.161 --> 00:37:19.130
pause. So people it's not that people are making the wrong decisions.

680
00:37:19.131 --> 00:37:22.400
I think people are taking no decisions because there's a whole wait and see

681
00:37:22.401 --> 00:37:25.970
policy, uh, that is sort of embedded in our, in our, in our,

682
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.530
in our public consciousness in the moment.

683
00:37:27.531 --> 00:37:29.570
And that has more impact on the economy.

684
00:37:29.571 --> 00:37:31.760
And it has more impact on jobs as you've just mentioned,

685
00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.700
the question you just mentioned then than anything else in my view.

686
00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.830
<v 0>Okay. Um, well, final question then, is this I suppose for what,</v>

687
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.980
how can everyone be a bit more like you, um,

688
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:48.170
what ha how can people adopt a bit of a kind of future minded mentality or way

689
00:37:48.171 --> 00:37:52.370
of thinking about these kinds of, um, these kinds of issues, because, um,

690
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.210
I'm sure we're all having to scan our own horizons at the moment and,

691
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.550
and any ways of doing that better, of course,

692
00:37:58.551 --> 00:38:00.380
hugely hugely valuable for all of us.

693
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.390
<v 1>I think it's, again,</v>

694
00:38:02.391 --> 00:38:05.360
separating that short-term from the long-term and understanding, you know,

695
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:08.840
predicting where you would like to be in five to 10 years and understanding the

696
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.960
needs States that you may have in those 10 years,

697
00:38:11.961 --> 00:38:16.430
and then incrementally building towards those rather than reacting in the now or

698
00:38:16.431 --> 00:38:19.820
not reacting in the now is as we've just said. So that's the first thing,

699
00:38:19.821 --> 00:38:22.520
understanding the difference between long-term and short-term change.

700
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:26.390
The second thing is to search for smart solutions. Um,

701
00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.110
there are plenty of smart solutions that have bubbled up zoom has,

702
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.750
has gone gangbusters since, since, uh, you know,

703
00:38:32.751 --> 00:38:36.760
that the pandemic I was working on an interactive whiteboard program the other

704
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:39.490
day as well, which is really interesting as well. So, you know,

705
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.790
feel free to avail yourself as smart solutions, um,

706
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.390
which have been brought to the fore have been sampled or demonstrated, uh,

707
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:49.960
and make use of them and continue to make use of them if they work for you after

708
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:51.190
the pandemic is long gone.

709
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.820
And the third thing which I mentioned is have a plan is have a plan B,

710
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.850
a contingency plan, a backup escape route as well.

711
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.930
So if this did come along again, ensure that you have almost like, um,

712
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.500
in the way that a computer has safe mode, and it goes to a set of presets,

713
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.260
which allows the computer to keep functioning while you solve the problem,

714
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.330
have a set of your own presets,

715
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.440
which allow you to sort of fall back into a really sort of a position that

716
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:18.400
allows you to continue to function, um, last, um, was preparing for,

717
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:19.360
for what comes next.

718
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.240
<v 0>Um, and then lastly, um, what about companies? So of course,</v>

719
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:28.650
like lots of companies are trying to call themselves back into the pattern of

720
00:39:28.651 --> 00:39:33.030
the business model, which, you know, has been so disrupted and undermined. Um,

721
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.920
is there a kind of other ways of thinking for companies and their leadership

722
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.820
at the moment, which you think in the kind of long term will allow, will,

723
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.840
will allow them to survive and to flourish in ways which other companies won't.

724
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.131
<v 1>Yes. I think it's,</v>

725
00:39:47.131 --> 00:39:51.750
if you sell a physical product that people need to come and see,

726
00:39:51.751 --> 00:39:55.590
or people pick off the shelf, or people want to smell touch, um,

727
00:39:55.710 --> 00:40:00.600
it's it's to do two things, think about how that product looks in. Um, uh,

728
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.060
again, that sort of spatial environment,

729
00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:06.990
how do you get your brand and your brand values, um, into, down,

730
00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.270
down a broadband cable, um, effectively,

731
00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:12.690
how can people use your product simply get a feel for it and learn as much about

732
00:40:12.691 --> 00:40:13.950
it as possible? Um,

733
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:17.640
other than just sort of standard website when people aren't leaving the house as

734
00:40:17.641 --> 00:40:20.880
much in the short or in, in indeed, indeed the midterm.

735
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.210
And the second thing is as well is when people do start move,

736
00:40:24.211 --> 00:40:26.820
coming back to the high street and start physically moving around,

737
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.360
how can you can make it worth their while that they've actually got off their

738
00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.890
sofas and come into your store,

739
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:36.090
what else can you offer them an experiential point of view, um,

740
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.640
that you think that will make metric worthwhile?

741
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.310
I think increasingly we'll see shops again, off the longterm,

742
00:40:41.311 --> 00:40:44.790
off the back of this, um, that don't necessarily resemble shops. You know,

743
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:48.210
shops don't have to be shelves and shelves of items. Um,

744
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.610
they can look like chill out zones, even light laboratories.

745
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.940
They can look like gardens in order to make it so much more different, um,

746
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.550
for you to, you know, to, to, to,

747
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.220
to not choose this sort of dry functional e-commerce option.

748
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.760
And those are the things that I think companies can do virtualize the products,

749
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.400
but also make the physical, um, uh,

750
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.940
display and positioning of it compelling enough to make people to want to come

751
00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:11.010
into store and see it and feel it and touch it and smell it.

752
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.900
<v 0>Amazing. Well, Philip, thank you so much what a great discussion. Um,</v>

753
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.950
and it's been,

754
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.940
it's been a real journey and I hope we've transported everyone into, into,

755
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.800
into this vision of 10 years, hence,

756
00:41:22.801 --> 00:41:26.610
and everyone's now a little better forearmed and forewarned. Um,

757
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.470
thanks very much, everyone for listening.

758
00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:30.600
You've been listening to intelligence squad and I'm Camila.
