00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.080
<v 0>Hello, and welcome to this intelligence squared election special with me, Linda,</v>

2
00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:08.750
you were recording on November the fifth,

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.020
just two days after the 2020 U S election.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.360
It looks like there's a record turnout by voters and it unprecedented over a

5
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:20.210
hundred million people cast their ballots early.

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.710
Those are still being counted in key States as we speak and to help us

7
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:29.450
understand what the last 48 hours mean and what to expect in the

8
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:33.950
coming days. I'm delighted to introduce our guest today. Danielle [inaudible],

9
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.090
she's a former vice president and current senior fellow informed the fence

10
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:42.020
policy studies at the American enterprise Institute.

11
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:46.370
She teaches us middle East policy at Georgetown university and is a regular

12
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.700
contributor to NBC news is meet the press.

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.650
We're also joined by Josh Clancy, Washington Bureau, chief of the Sunday times,

14
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:57.500
and previously the papers, New York correspondent,

15
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.910
where he wrote an entertaining weekly column for the Sunday times

16
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.860
magazine. I think that isn't,

17
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:08.810
that the sentiment for the entire election

18
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.180
is probably the word of the day. Yeah, yeah. And uncertainty.

19
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.280
So as of today we have news outlets, um, which are putting,

20
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.520
uh,

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.500
Joe Biden ahead on around two and 64 electoral college votes and Trump

22
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.030
on around 214, but there are lawsuits and challenges,

23
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:33.170
including whether it's too early to call some of the swing States.

24
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:36.410
So here is the big question. Uh,

25
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.270
when do you think we'll know who the next us president will be?

26
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.920
Danielle you first? Oh, geez. Thanks for throwing me under the bus.

27
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.360
Um, look, I don't know. Um, I think there are a couple of,

28
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.530
there are a couple of shoes to drop for, for all of us. Um, uh,

29
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.340
the first is the first is whether, um, the first is whether, uh,

30
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.630
Arizona is going to go the president's way. Um,

31
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.760
I looking obsessively at the numbers and pretending to have any

32
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.900
inside knowledge is probably puts me,

33
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.470
makes me have something in common with, uh, with lots and lots of Americans.

34
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.900
But, uh, it doesn't make me any more knowledgeable.

35
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.190
It looks like it looks like Donald Trump is on track.

36
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.210
I think to,

37
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:27.890
to get Arizona the real question then for him will end up being

38
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:31.880
Pennsylvania. Um, and he's ahead.

39
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.090
Um, but you know,

40
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:39.380
Arizona is not going to make any announcements before Thursday night. Um,

41
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.860
Pennsylvania has been unbelievably slow. I mean, you know,

42
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:46.220
everybody's sort of focused on the fact that we had all these early votes cast,

43
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.170
but what's staggering is how long it's taken to actually count these

44
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.200
votes. And then of course, as you rightly note, there are these,

45
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.071
these challenges.

46
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:58.720
Although I suspect the challenges are actually going to be a little bit of a,

47
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.740
of a, of a, you know, a flat, uh,

48
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.240
effort because you need a basis to challenge all of these, uh,

49
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.570
all of these election results. And while in Wisconsin,

50
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.330
the president can ask for a recount in other States,

51
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.510
it's unclear what his basis for challenging is. So,

52
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.690
so short story long.

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.320
I don't think we're going to know at least till Friday. Um,

54
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.820
but maybe not even them. Thank you, Josh.

55
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:28.840
Same question to you.

56
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.620
<v 1>Uh, yeah, I mean, I broadly agree.</v>

57
00:03:31.621 --> 00:03:36.450
I think it's looking like a real up in Arizona, um,

58
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.790
which does that bring us to Pennsylvania and obviously,

59
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.960
and Georgia is still in play too. And actually the remaining,

60
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.190
whatever is 50,000 votes in Georgia, which are being counted with astonishing,

61
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.300
uh, lack of alacrity, shall we say? Um, I think my,

62
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.980
my friend compared it to an Indian wedding reception in its, uh, in its pacing,

63
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.080
um, the Georgia state and play Pennsylvania Democrats are confident about,

64
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.210
I mean, obviously everyone's trying to project confidence at the moment,

65
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.930
but they do think that those votes that remain are breaking very heavily for

66
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:08.310
them. It's the mail-in ballots,

67
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:11.340
which we would expect to vote to break democratic. Um,

68
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.270
and they think Pennsylvania will end up being actually quite comprehensive

69
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:19.140
victory, um, more so than say Wisconsin. Um,

70
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.240
but it's like pulling teeth at the moment.

71
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.680
We just have to wait for them to count it. And every hour that goes by,

72
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.730
uh, becomes a little bit more fraught. And, you know,

73
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:33.630
the Trump campaign is obviously launching these lawsuits. And I agree with, um,

74
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.070
Danielle that I think some of them are possibly a little bit frivolous. Um,

75
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.930
but they're also hosting press conferences.

76
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.780
You have Trump on Twitter saying stop the count. Um,

77
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.500
so this is a little bit of a somewhat volatile situation. Um,

78
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.460
fortunately we haven't seen any major unrest of discord at the moment.

79
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.240
Um, but yeah, Democrats do seem confident about,

80
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.400
about Pennsylvania and if they get parents of any, uh,

81
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.590
comfortably that's the ball game. Um,

82
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.090
but unfortunately we have to all sit here in purgatory until, until the,

83
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:04.050
until the count is done.

84
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.710
<v 0>All right, what can I hold you to, to this Friday? Um,</v>

85
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:10.560
announcement typically

86
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.870
we don't find out until the weekend, we're going to come back to you.

87
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.640
<v 1>And for me is that I need to know by the time I write my copy for Sunday's</v>

88
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.600
newspaper. So it has to be decided by Saturday afternoon. Yeah.

89
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.340
<v 0>I think that has to be determined</v>

90
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.130
pretty much every American election so far. Yeah, absolutely.

91
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.100
Um, I guess next question I'd like to get your take on is how has the election

92
00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:42.330
played out like you thought or have the results and surprised you,

93
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.260
including the congressional races obviously. And the Senate was at one point,

94
00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:50.550
I think very much being watched as well. So at Danielle,

95
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.650
you face your own, um, how's the election and surprise me. Um,

96
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.890
it doesn't surprise me that Donald Trump did much better than people expected.

97
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.380
Um, I mean, you know, again, the problem for anybody, uh,

98
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.360
is that, is that you want to,

99
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.620
you want to believe the data that you see the problem is that polling isn't

100
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:13.940
really data, right?

101
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.800
It's it's because you don't actually know what the inputs are

102
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.240
and that's, that's the problem. And so, you know,

103
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.200
one thing I think we can be absolutely certain walking out of this election with

104
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.050
is that the biggest losers in America are pollsters other,

105
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.200
the Republicans, all the Democrats, but these pollsters who, who, you know,

106
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.650
imbued the public with this sort of superior sense,

107
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.760
that things are going to happen a particular way and they're just wrong.

108
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.960
They're wrong. And it's, and it's actually a little bit in my line. Um,

109
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.460
so am I surprised, um, I'm surprised that Susan Collins in Maine pulled it out.

110
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.800
Um, but you know, that's terrific. Um, because she's, uh,

111
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.300
she's a good Senator and she's a moderate and she deserves to be reelected. So,

112
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.890
um,

113
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.620
am I surprised that that the Republicans are going to keep the majority in the

114
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:10.940
Senate, which I think is likely to be the case? Um, a little, yeah, actually,

115
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:14.960
because, um, because that was great. Um,

116
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.070
but it was a really rough election for Republicans. So it's a big achievement.

117
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.990
My surprised about the results for Donald Trump. Again, same thing, you know,

118
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.183
um, a little bit,

119
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.560
but the problem for us in America now is that we can't be honest about what we

120
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.780
think if you're a conservative, you're not allowed to say,

121
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:36.950
so what you have is a lot of people who are very vocally anti Republican,

122
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.630
and there's this whole sort of shadow group of people who are either Republicans

123
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:45.860
or conservatives, or just Trump voters, who you don't hear from. Uh,

124
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.800
I think everybody's, I think everybody's a little bit surprised,

125
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.950
but what's the most surprising thing, not the Senate,

126
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.530
not how it went in any of these States.

127
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.120
What the most surprising thing is that for four years, um,

128
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.120
Republicans have been labeled racist. Donald Trump has been labeled a hater and,

129
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:06.710
and he's contributed a great deal to those labels.

130
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:09.890
This isn't something that came out of the blue to, to, to smear him.

131
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:11.840
He has helped in that regard.

132
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.550
And yet his performance with minorities is nothing short

133
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.090
for a Republican. And particularly for a man of Donald Trump's Delt,

134
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.810
this performance is nothing short of spectacular and a great,

135
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:28.700
great opportunity for the right to actually understand that its coalition

136
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.440
isn't based on color. It is, it is based much more on ideas,

137
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.220
rather a longer answer than you wanted. Sorry, I apologize.

138
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.190
No interesting stuff. I think once we see how the various, um,

139
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.370
votes in terms of demographics, um, play out,

140
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.450
I think there's quite a few trends there that we'll need to, to keep an eye on.

141
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.780
Um, but Josh, same question to you, you know, um,

142
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.390
have the results surprised you has it out, like you thought. Um,

143
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.880
and of course, you know, beyond the presidency,

144
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.550
anything around the Congress and Senate, Hmm.

145
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.890
<v 1>This is the first American lecture I've properly covered.</v>

146
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.060
And so it was interesting experience in that I did a lot of reporting on the

147
00:09:11.061 --> 00:09:15.500
ground, um, which was somewhat, uh, hazardous in COVID terms,

148
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.820
but I sort of went through it anyway.

149
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.680
And a lot of American reporters didn't a lot of the American news organizations

150
00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:24.680
actually were pretty cautious around that. And there was the kind of some,

151
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.660
something of a politicization around it too.

152
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.610
And the things I kept seeing on the ground were really significant enthusiasm

153
00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:34.430
for Trump. I was out with boaters for Trump and was constant.

154
00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:37.640
I was at car rallies for Trump, with the Cubans in Miami.

155
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.560
And I kept seeing like big, big numbers and big passion for Trump.

156
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.220
And then I would come back to the state and I'd look at the polls and I would

157
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:49.340
talk to the posters and they would tell me, that's lovely,

158
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.480
ain't going to matter. And it may not, but it was that,

159
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.790
and it was underreported. Um,

160
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.730
and it seems like the media and the post has made a lot of the same mistakes

161
00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.900
that they made in 2016,

162
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:03.860
despite the fact that there were supposed to be a great place more of most of

163
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:07.550
2016 and everyone sort of walked around with kind of hair shuts for six months.

164
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.730
Um, so to my mind,

165
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.790
I wasn't that surprised I noticed is it's to say that in hindsight,

166
00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:16.040
but I did think Trump would out before his polls,

167
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.640
I did think I was going to Israelis in the last couple of weeks.

168
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.880
They were impressive. I mean, they were energetic. He was on,

169
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.890
he was on comic form. He had great, um, charisma.

170
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.070
They were decent numbers that and Biden was doing nothing. I mean,

171
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:34.580
he was doing these kind of staged speeches and I understand that he wanted to

172
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:38.090
message about the gravity of the pandemic and he's right to do so,

173
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.710
but just in terms of the, the, the, the power of the campaign, uh,

174
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.180
I think it did make a difference with Trump.

175
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.710
And I do think the posters are just bad at reaching media skeptic,

176
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.440
rural white conservative voters. I just don't think they're waiting.

177
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.800
It's not just their education. They're just not reaching them.

178
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.490
I don't think these people want to speak to pollsters from Sienna college or

179
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:02.840
Monmouth college or wherever it is. Um, so I wasn't shocked,

180
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.200
um, gun to my head before the election, and I said, Biden close.

181
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.300
And that is probably where we're going to end up. Um, and you know,

182
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:12.680
I definitely wasn't surprised by Florida.

183
00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:14.960
I really always thought Trump would win forward it just from when I went down

184
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:17.250
there and saw the way, uh,

185
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.180
the Latinos in Miami were feeling about socialism.

186
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.680
And I don't think the Democrats realized how damage it and the kind of Bernie

187
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:29.570
AOC self-proclaimed socialist movement had been

188
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.570
in certain courses. It actually did well for them in other courses.

189
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.820
And actually we shouldn't forget that they did very well with their teenagers in

190
00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:39.050
Arizona, for example, at 10 good numbers out there. Um,

191
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.400
so yeah, not surprising. Um, the Senate seems really kind of, uh, you know,

192
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.250
I think it's important to realize that Joe Biden didn't have coattails.

193
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.480
He was not a, someone who built a real movement.

194
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.980
People voted for him primarily because they to get rid of Trump.

195
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.080
And so he didn't create this kind of mass momentum behind the party and bring

196
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.460
other candidates along with him. So it's a pretty, uh, if he does win,

197
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.780
you know, he doesn't have a great mandate. He doesn't have the Senate, uh,

198
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:11.050
is going to be pretty, pretty tough, four years full. It might say.

199
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.730
<v 0>And Danielle could president Trump still win the election and given where</v>

200
00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:20.640
we stand now. And if so, what is his path to victory?

201
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.120
So, um, could he still win the election? Uh, yes.

202
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.750
Arizona has to turn around, uh, for him. Uh,

203
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.040
I do think that's going to happen. Um, I agree that, um, I sort of,

204
00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:37.830
I agree with, with, uh, with Josh that, um,

205
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.230
that the Democrats are confident about Pennsylvania. Um, dunno.

206
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.680
Honestly, I just, I just don't know. Um, and you know,

207
00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:51.450
my pre election skepticism has only been enhanced, um,

208
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.510
because, uh, because you know, it's hard to believe.

209
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.980
It's hard to believe the press.

210
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.020
It's hard to believe the reporting and it's hard to know. And, uh, and you know,

211
00:13:01.021 --> 00:13:04.080
everybody keeps saying, well, let every vote count. And the answer is, yes,

212
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.770
every vote has to count if he wins Arizona and Pennsylvania,

213
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.600
then he's got a path. Um, if he doesn't, then he doesn't because,

214
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.010
uh, Scott Walker,

215
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.720
former governor of Wisconsin has warmed that he's not going to get the votes.

216
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.570
It's only 20,000 in Wisconsin,

217
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.540
but that he's not going to get the votes he needs from a recount. I mean,

218
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.350
you know, anything can happen. And w what is,

219
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.060
what is frankly weirder to me is this

220
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.590
trend of the last 20 years for these split decision or elections

221
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.880
that are, you know, 5,000 votes, a thousand votes,

222
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.600
10,000 votes apart in a country, the size of America. And yes,

223
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:47.700
of course we're only going on a state by state basis,

224
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.100
but even then we're a bloody big country, you know, it is, it is,

225
00:13:52.101 --> 00:13:56.460
is quite remarkable. Um, so, you know,

226
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:01.080
that's his path forward. It, I think it's, I think it's doubtful.

227
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.260
Um, but, but, uh,

228
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.550
you know, it's 2020, you know, I mean, immediate right to hit all of us.

229
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.380
And frankly, it wouldn't be that surprising

230
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.640
2020 has been sent here just very quickly. Josh,

231
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.710
do you think Trump could still win the election?

232
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.320
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, if you look at the betting markets now, and there's a lot of data,</v>

233
00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:28.290
they have to make their heads, not just polling they're looking at anymore.

234
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.470
Uh he's I think he's about 85% Biden,

235
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.040
and I put myself around there as well. Um,

236
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.590
there is a very narrow path for Trump here.

237
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.970
I don't quite see all the votes that come in in Pennsylvania.

238
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.100
He would have to utterly defy expectations, um,

239
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.620
in terms of that partisan leanings, uh, think, yeah,

240
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.731
Arizona's hopeful for him,

241
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:54.590
but I don't think Pennsylvania is that hopeful for him.

242
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:58.370
And therefore neither is the whole ball game. So, uh,

243
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.690
we have seen miracles and Trump and, you know, they it's possible Pennsylvania.

244
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:06.770
So close. There is a lawsuit in Pennsylvania about, um,

245
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.330
votes that come in postmark after election day itself that went to the Supreme

246
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:16.130
court and got stayed and could go back to the Supreme court if it's

247
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:20.480
really, really, really, really close. And those votes matter, the newly, uh,

248
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.010
enhanced conservative majority on the Supreme court could theoretically rule

249
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:28.310
against those ballots. Now, uh, it was full four previously.

250
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:33.290
So like there are dilemmas of light if you're Trump and the Trump campaign,

251
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.210
but it's glimmers, I would say it's a long shot.

252
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:37.870
<v 0>Danielle.</v>

253
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.670
And I think you mentioned before that the legal challenges may not and selves

254
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:47.050
amount to a significant, uh, um, and a, uh,

255
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.600
an impact. Um, but you know,

256
00:15:49.601 --> 00:15:54.070
Josh has mentioned this could go to the Supreme court. Um, do you think,

257
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.820
uh, you know, what would your take on an equal challenge in the Supreme court?

258
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.400
Which of course we saw, um, in a Bush versus Gore, right? So the, the,

259
00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:05.290
the Pennsylvania situation is different and here I'm not a lawyer,

260
00:16:05.291 --> 00:16:10.030
I'm parroting a very good piece by Andy McCarthy, who is a lawyer, um,

261
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.020
over at national review who just really laid out, um,

262
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.600
exactly what the Supreme court situation is.

263
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.980
So it's important for people to understand there's one question about a legal

264
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.450
challenge to the vote that's, um, you know, that's,

265
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.040
that's, uh,

266
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.410
something that is a post election filing about the

267
00:16:32.411 --> 00:16:36.070
propriety of the electoral process of, uh,

268
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:40.450
of the count of the legitimacy of the count or in the case of a very close race

269
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.980
or recount that's one thing. Okay. And that's actually,

270
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.400
you know, that's not based on what we all think on Twitter, or, you know,

271
00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:51.070
what you heard from your neighbor who read it down the street. You know,

272
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.730
it's not that I, and so much of our politics is that,

273
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.170
but this is,

274
00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.520
this requires actual legal grounds in order to challenge

275
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.490
and lawyers and judges are actually serious people.

276
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.990
So that's one question on the Supreme court question, which Josh mentioned,

277
00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:10.810
which is, is rather complex. Um, there,

278
00:17:10.811 --> 00:17:15.550
you have a situation where actually Trump does correctly have a glimmer of hope

279
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.950
because the court, um,

280
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.480
the court addressed a challenge to the extension

281
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.560
of, um,

282
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:28.480
the extension of voting in Pennsylvania prior to

283
00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:33.160
the vote and the court didn't decide the court basically sent it back

284
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.810
to Pennsylvania,

285
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.850
but that challenge still stands and what the court did. And again,

286
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:42.460
you know, more detail than most people want, but what the court did,

287
00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:47.260
which Josh alluded to is that they separated out the ballots that were

288
00:17:47.261 --> 00:17:52.200
received according to previous system and the ones according to

289
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:55.320
the new system. And, and again, he's completely right.

290
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.630
If it is a slim lead,

291
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.760
then that may actually make a difference. Uh, if people voted very late,

292
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.810
if, um, if, if people voted, um, if people voted late,

293
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:10.980
if their votes came in late, and it's not a, um,

294
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.420
it's not a partisan issue,

295
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.350
it's a question of who has the right to change the rules. And when,

296
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.980
and so the Supreme court could actually come back and John Roberts,

297
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:22.680
doesn't like these sorts of votes, as we've seen repeatedly,

298
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.760
he will actually vote with, with, with the liberal side of the court,

299
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:30.210
in order to ensure that the court doesn't get stuck in the middle of

300
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.190
politicking, but in some ways, those days are done, right,

301
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.980
because he's no longer the deciding vote. Now,

302
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:41.070
the court has a majority with Amy Coney Barrett there,

303
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.450
the conservatives have a majority with any Coney Barrett, but, you know, unlike,

304
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:47.310
I would say that the liberals on the court,

305
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.940
the conservatives on the court are actually conservative. In other words,

306
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.200
they're not going to want to interfere here either. So again,

307
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.150
a pathway, a glimmer, perhaps a little more than a glimmer, but yeah.

308
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.450
Thank you. Um, Josh, the, you know, you mentioned, um,

309
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.390
president Trump is challenging the process, um, as unfair, um, and, you know,

310
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.590
think we have seen, um, protests outside of polling booths, you know,

311
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.390
just say a bit more about what you, your take on his comments.

312
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:23.910
And also, do you think that these protests could escalate?

313
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.030
<v 1>Why is coming ridiculous? I mean, he's, he's tweeting to stop the count, uh,</v>

314
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.040
which isn't even what he's advocating. I mean,

315
00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:34.760
they want to stop the count in Pennsylvania, but finished the count in Arizona,

316
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.940
uh, which is farcical. So, you know, while the, the,

317
00:19:39.941 --> 00:19:43.880
some of the actually going to have, it just may have some, uh, legal merit,

318
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.960
his tweeting it's ridiculous, and it's dangerous. It is dangerous. I mean,

319
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.740
so far the system has, has creaked, but not cracked.

320
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.480
And in some ways we were helped by how much Trump and the Democrats

321
00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:58.280
Telegraph, this, we were prepared in advance.

322
00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.870
We knew Trump was going to do this.

323
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.760
And we knew that there might be this blue shift we'd been talked about in a

324
00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:06.680
thousand articles that actually,

325
00:20:06.681 --> 00:20:08.180
it might look like Trump who had won on the night,

326
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:10.910
but actually if you count all the and votes, it could shift.

327
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.870
And so we were quite well prepared for this Democrats message very hard on this.

328
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.160
And what's been interesting is that key Republican and conservative

329
00:20:19.161 --> 00:20:19.971
institutions,

330
00:20:19.971 --> 00:20:24.800
whether it be at Mitch McConnell leader of the Senate or Fox news have not

331
00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:29.090
gone along with Trump in his more absurd pronouncements,

332
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.870
they obviously are giving the challenge of time of day,

333
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.880
but they haven't got on board with Trump and Rudy Giuliani and Eric Trump

334
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.870
saying, well,

335
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.890
this is all kind of Chicago politics and people sort of stealing ballot boxes in

336
00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:46.570
the night and whatever. There's no real evidence of that. Uh,

337
00:20:46.571 --> 00:20:51.370
and until find some, they should stop alleging it, frankly. And it is dangerous.

338
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.140
We haven't seen you. You're right. There has been,

339
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:56.740
there was a incident at a Detroit polling station. There's been some,

340
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.680
some unrest in Arizona it's really worrying, right. I mean,

341
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:01.660
we may never want to see that. Um,

342
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.460
but I think the fact that we've prepared for it by the media,

343
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.050
by the Democrats, w we've been expecting this weeks, we've been expecting.

344
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:11.201
I mean,

345
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:15.400
I could've told you six months ago that Trump would tweet something about fraud

346
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.870
on hourly while we were waiting for the result. And you just know he's going to,

347
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.390
and it almost feels sort of strangely performative on one level,

348
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:24.910
but it is dangerous. And the longer this goes on,

349
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:29.470
I guess the more potential for from rests, um,

350
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.300
emerges. So, yeah, we definitely want a result by, uh, Danielle said Friday,

351
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.500
um, in time for my paper and the rest of the savior of American democracy.

352
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.970
So fingers crossed for that.

353
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.090
<v 0>And Danielle,</v>

354
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.380
is there a real threat that we won't see a peaceful transfer of power if Joe

355
00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:51.300
Biden wins? You know, um,

356
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.650
I, first of all, I don't think that we should put all of the blame, uh, on, on,

357
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.460
on, uh, on Trump, uh, disgruntled Trump voters here, uh, you know,

358
00:21:59.461 --> 00:22:01.560
there are riots going on in Portland right now.

359
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:06.150
I can't quite figure out why or what about since it's Oregon,

360
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.160
but perhaps it's the fact that it didn't,

361
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:12.000
they legalize all drugs drug use.

362
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.680
Maybe it's just, uh, maybe it's just drugs. Um, but

363
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.780
I don't think, I don't think that's very realistic.

364
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.520
The problem is while I think Donald Trump could be enthusiastic

365
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:30.710
about, uh, about resisting. Um, if,

366
00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:35.400
if there's some question of, uh, of the legitimacy of the victory,

367
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.200
um, uh, of a Biden victory,

368
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.260
I don't think there's anyone around him who will enable that.

369
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.070
And that includes vice president pants. That includes, um,

370
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.680
the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.

371
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.240
It includes really most of the president's cabinet. Um, and so,

372
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.240
you know, that's number one, number two, if Biden wins, I think Donald Trump,

373
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.600
the first thing he's going to do is start thinking about 20 to 24.

374
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.110
And he doesn't want to put himself in super curious,

375
00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:06.780
a position that he's simply not credible.

376
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.260
So I guess I'm a little bit less worried about that. Then,

377
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.020
then people say also, you know, Trump has a lot of stories, a lot of Twitter,

378
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:21.300
but when it comes down to what he does, this is a lot less risk.

379
00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:25.170
He's really a lot of buck and not as much bite in terms of,

380
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.370
in terms of the threats he makes and the, and the emotions he says up.

381
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.400
And Josh, you talked earlier about how the polls, um,

382
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.920
at this point, um, it's a closer race than, um,

383
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:42.030
some of the polls had suggested many of the polls suggested. Um,

384
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:47.000
do you give us your take on whether Trump is, is the, of the Republican party,

385
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.550
regardless of whether he wins or loses?

386
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.640
<v 1>Yeah, I, I think it is. Um,</v>

387
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.700
I think he's turned out the highest, uh,

388
00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.160
the highest election propo, uh, population, uh, you know,

389
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.350
it was at 68 million people that voted for him.

390
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.850
That's more than voted for Obama in Oh eight. That's a lot of Americans. Um,

391
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.350
so yes, I think Trumpism is here to stay. What that means,

392
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.760
uh, is quite contingent. It's contingent on. Obviously if he, if he, if he wins,

393
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.370
then you know, Trump's Trumpism and said to stay. If he loses,

394
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:27.010
then the process of, of reinterpreting Trump after Trump,

395
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.260
um, begins.

396
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:33.730
And there is an interesting cohort of people in position to do that.

397
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.260
People like Mark, a Rubio who has pivoted somewhat politically in the Trump era,

398
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.290
people like Josh Hawley from Missouri, a young Senator,

399
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.010
people like Tucker Carlson, the Fox news presenter who's enormously influential.

400
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:49.240
Um, and then there are other sort of more traditional Republicans.

401
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.220
Mitch McConnell loves still be enormously powerful.

402
00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:53.590
You have Nikki Haley down in South Carolina,

403
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.040
who's probably more corporate friendly Republican. So there,

404
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.000
there will be a process of working out what is Trumpism without Trump.

405
00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:04.000
What happens when you take away the Twitter feed and you take away this

406
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.540
enormously charismatic figure at the center, though,

407
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.430
he will still be on the sidelines.

408
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.550
Will there have power wielding his Twitter feed, uh,

409
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.670
possibly starting a TV network, possibly planning to run again? I mean,

410
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.370
I don't truly think he would have become president again,

411
00:25:18.371 --> 00:25:22.690
but I certainly could see him floating it for some period of time.

412
00:25:22.691 --> 00:25:27.580
So it's a kind of messy rebuilding process. What they have going for them.

413
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.680
The Republican party is they will have control of the Senate.

414
00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.950
They have remade the judiciary. So they still have a lot of power,

415
00:25:32.951 --> 00:25:35.920
even if Trump loses. And they're in a position, I guess,

416
00:25:35.921 --> 00:25:40.630
to try and triangulate between what Trump has been and what their

417
00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:42.250
future will be. And Danielle points out, you know,

418
00:25:42.251 --> 00:25:46.510
that they did better than expected among ethnic

419
00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:47.344
minorities.

420
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:52.120
There is the sort of seedlings of a multi-racial more working class coalition

421
00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:56.530
there, but it is still a party of plutocrats, of magnates,

422
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.650
of people who, um, you know,

423
00:25:59.651 --> 00:26:04.210
like very low taxes and free business enterprise. So there are,

424
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.460
you know, co CA there are different influences in the party and they will,

425
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.430
they will have to sort of work out who they are. post-Trump.

426
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:18.070
<v 0>Yeah. You want it to come in plutocrats? I'm sorry. Jeff Bezos,</v>

427
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.460
Mark Zuckerberg. Oh,

428
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.880
I'm sorry. Democrats.

429
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.230
All of them beyond say Democrats,

430
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.880
not just, not just,

431
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.820
not just plutocrats,

432
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:41.620
but the potty of the filthy rich and Hollywood,

433
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.690
you know? No, your, your assertion is not, uh,

434
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.190
is not backed up by the facts.

435
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.660
<v 1>I didn't say that Democrats weren't run by Patriots.</v>

436
00:26:50.661 --> 00:26:54.350
I'm just saying that there is still a huge talk about like the mining industry,

437
00:26:54.351 --> 00:26:56.870
the oil industry, the sort of captains of,

438
00:26:56.871 --> 00:27:00.890
of middle American industry in the Heartland are still firmly Republican and

439
00:27:00.891 --> 00:27:03.770
still tie a lot of the bills. So it's not like.

440
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.110
<v 0>But what about wall street? What about those,</v>

441
00:27:09.111 --> 00:27:12.320
those labels? Get you in trouble though. You know that that's,

442
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.370
that's why people don't,

443
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.660
this is why people don't trust the press is because when you call.

444
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.400
<v 1>What would you say, Sheldon Adelson? Isn't a polluted Pratt.</v>

445
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.680
<v 0>I would say, I would say Sheldon Adelson would love to be called a plutocrat.</v>

446
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.130
The point here is that you didn't mention the plutocrats of the left.

447
00:27:28.131 --> 00:27:30.830
And I would say then probably you have numerous on the left.

448
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.220
<v 1>Yeah. And that's why they raised one reason. They raised so much more money,</v>

449
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.540
but we were talking about this.

450
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.570
<v 0>It all and wasted it all.</v>

451
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:41.323
I could let this go.

452
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.990
[inaudible] okay. Let's talk about the Democrats some more,

453
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.420
which is I'm Danielle, how significant is a Joe Biden win for the Democrats.

454
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.400
Um, and, um, some have described Biden as a return,

455
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.460
as a vote day, the return at,

456
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.470
for the return to normalcy in America. Um, do you think that's the case?

457
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.650
Um, I think we're really going to have to see, you know,

458
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:18.470
what a lot of people fear is the Joe Biden is just the friendly face

459
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.240
of the new democratic party.

460
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.960
And I think it's going to be up to if he,

461
00:28:23.961 --> 00:28:27.230
if he is ultimately crowned the winner,

462
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.780
it is going to be up to him if he's up to

463
00:28:32.781 --> 00:28:34.340
it, uh,

464
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.570
to actually prove that because all things being equal,

465
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.080
the democratic party is not Joe Biden's democratic party.

466
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.640
The democratic party is much more the party of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie

467
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:51.530
Sanders. It's much more the party of the elites than it is the party of,

468
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:56.360
you know, the, the grassroots, at least in my perception. Um,

469
00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:01.160
and so it's going to be an uphill and uphill battle. I think, you know, again,

470
00:29:01.161 --> 00:29:02.100
a lot of his, if,

471
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:06.230
if Biden is ultimately the Victor who he chooses

472
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.450
for his cabinet, who he, um, how he chooses to govern,

473
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.410
um, what he embraces as, as appropriate policies, you know,

474
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.450
that his, his plans were very far left,

475
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:28.490
but he kind of execute them with a Republican Senate. Will that help him?

476
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.980
Will that further isolate him? You know, I don't know. I really don't. Um,

477
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.790
the only thing I can say is that, uh,

478
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.150
is that it will be in for many, many people,

479
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.730
a welcome return to just a little bit less drama in

480
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:49.210
American politics. And that I do feel sure of.

481
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.710
Thank you, Dan. Now, final question to you, Josh. Um,

482
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.710
what does this election mean for the rest of the world?

483
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.060
Could we see a shift away from America first, um,

484
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:05.290
and return to the United States playing a more active role in the international

485
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:07.390
system? What does it mean for democracy?

486
00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:09.400
So just a really small question to finish out.

487
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.830
<v 1>What obviously yeah, it depends who wins. If we, if we see if Trump wins,</v>

488
00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:18.450
then we will have more of the same on foreign policy. Um,

489
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.380
and we know what that is tough on Iran, uh,

490
00:30:22.381 --> 00:30:25.470
adversarial towards China. Um,

491
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.900
if Biden wins that then, you know,

492
00:30:30.901 --> 00:30:33.570
w they've laid out a lot of what they want to do. They want to,

493
00:30:33.571 --> 00:30:36.300
or at least conceptually, they want to rebuild alliances.

494
00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:39.060
They say they possibly want to end the Iran deal.

495
00:30:39.061 --> 00:30:42.300
Although they might have a tricky job doing that.

496
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.810
They want to focus on climate change. And once we enter the Paris climate cords,

497
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.570
they will do that. Um,

498
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.170
and they want to refocus on Europe.

499
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.060
They want to rebuild relations with Germany and the EU. Um,

500
00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.910
and they will probably remain quite adversarial to pause, trying to,

501
00:30:59.911 --> 00:31:03.930
because that has been a really a big shift across Washington, you know,

502
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.470
across American foreign policy and which 10 years somewhat precipitated by

503
00:31:07.471 --> 00:31:09.000
Trump. Um,

504
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:13.200
but I don't think they will be as adversarial or they will look for different

505
00:31:13.201 --> 00:31:17.190
ways to manage China. Um,

506
00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:20.580
and there are still some sort of Obama era restorationists, uh,

507
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.320
in the Biden camp that maybe don't maybe want to work with turn a little bit

508
00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.330
more. They see China as someone they need to work with on climate change,

509
00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:31.830
for example. Um, so, and foreign policy, you know, if he doesn't,

510
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.890
if he's president Biden and he doesn't have their product and he doesn't have

511
00:31:34.891 --> 00:31:36.990
the Senate and foreign policy is pretty one of the only areas you can do

512
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:41.790
anything. Um, it would be interesting to see what they do with the middle East,

513
00:31:41.791 --> 00:31:46.140
the peace deals that have been signed between Israel and some of its neighbors,

514
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.260
um, which are Trump Herrera, achievement.

515
00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.790
I don't know that they will necessarily support more of that.

516
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.960
Um, so that's sort of interesting, um,

517
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.150
foreign policy is gonna be an interesting area.

518
00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:04.020
I think a lot of people will initially breathe a sigh of relief because Trump's

519
00:32:04.021 --> 00:32:08.310
just so stressful. Um, but then perhaps realize that truly

520
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.320
the welds will remain Nazi and complex and Biden may not have that many

521
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.460
solutions for it.

522
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.730
<v 0>All right. Danielle, same final question to you. Um,</v>

523
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.810
what this election mean for America's role in the world and democracy and et

524
00:32:21.811 --> 00:32:23.220
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

525
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:31.290
Well, I think it just means that our democracy works and, uh, and, and, uh,

526
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.650
what does it mean for foreign policy? A lot will remain the same. Um,

527
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:42.920
I think, uh, as Josh said correctly, um, on Iran, you know, I think again,

528
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:46.610
that depends the running stuff to play ball. Um,

529
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.440
they've got their own election next year, uh, and, uh,

530
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.110
that I think is going to make it difficult for them to play ball right now.

531
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:58.820
So we'll have to see, uh, as much as, uh,

532
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.410
some of the figures,

533
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:05.240
the sort of Obama era retreads lurking in Biden's circle are desperate

534
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:10.010
to rekindle their friendship with their Iranian buddies. Um,

535
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.630
it might be a little tough on China, Russia, you know,

536
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.680
all I think we really can expect. So, you know, I, one I,

537
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.940
a good thing and a bad thing, a good thing is we can expect a change in style,

538
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.310
you know, less rudeness, uh, what my,

539
00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:30.560
my former boss used to call making the world safe for cocktail parties.

540
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.100
There's going to be a lot more comfortable cocktail parties and abide in the

541
00:33:34.101 --> 00:33:35.630
Euro and the Biden foreign policy.

542
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.910
The things that I worry about are that contrary to what many people think the

543
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:42.950
Trump administration has actually been really,

544
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:46.430
really solid on a lot of human rights, human freedom issues. Okay.

545
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.060
Gone after the Chinese, on the wiggles gone after them on Hong Kong,

546
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.120
gone after the Russians on their, uh, on their activities,

547
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.520
particularly in Europe, but also in their near abroad.

548
00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.380
Something that the Obama administration was terrible about. Um, frankly,

549
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.610
and, uh,

550
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.870
so I worry that we're not going to be as forthright in defense of,

551
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.290
in defense of those values, which I know sounds funny. Um,

552
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.410
but that actually is the reality. And so, you know,

553
00:34:12.411 --> 00:34:15.080
when Josh says something like, yeah, you know, it's been a really,

554
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:16.940
or a peace in the middle East under Trump,

555
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:18.680
but I'm not sure that's going to continue on there,

556
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.690
but that's actually bad news. Um, but on the whole,

557
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:28.010
I think we shouldn't expect any real seismic changes in foreign policy

558
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.270
and, uh, and, uh, uh, that's not,

559
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.730
not to the bad, thank you both very much. We're out of time. Um,

560
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.660
it's been a fantastic discussion and I think I'm going to take away, um,

561
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:46.640
one phrase in particular making the world safer for cocktail parties. I mean,

562
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:51.260
that's, that's going to be a priority along with Josh, his column for this week,

563
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:54.890
Sunday times. I mean, clearly these are, yeah, absolutely. Exactly.

564
00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.620
No you to have an absolutely brilliant Danielle Pletka and Josh Glancy,

565
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.180
what a wonderful discussion.

566
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.980
