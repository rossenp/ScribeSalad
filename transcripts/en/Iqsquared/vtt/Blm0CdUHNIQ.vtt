00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.090
<v 0>First full,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.390
the motion is will self.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
And so will self is not going to be walking over to the podium while

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
this is being said about him. In case you've never had a will self.

5
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:22.440
He is a very tool, uh, walks in a very strange way.

6
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.580
He's also when he's not walking in a strange way and novelists the broadcaster,

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.940
a political commentator and a literary critic,

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.050
his most recent novels are not that I need to tell you,

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.400
cause you read them all umbrella, shock and phone.

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.120
And his memoir will was published in

11
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.430
November,

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.290
2019 and will holds the chair in contemporary thought at

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.760
Brunel university no less. And the clock will has started.

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.380
<v 1>Men and women.</v>

15
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.550
Let's not talk about ladies and gentlemen this evening.

16
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.740
The agile motion is there's not much great about Britain,

17
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.660
but it's a pretty coy way of alluding to what we're going to be discussing,

18
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.523
which is,

19
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.690
does great Britain as an entity have any psychic

20
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:20.090
purchase on this anymore.

21
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.610
Do we think in terms of great Britain, what's meant by great Britain?

22
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.720
Well,

23
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.620
we're obviously not going to sort of look into the etymology of the term and

24
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:35.240
tell you that after the Romans left Britain and some ancient

25
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.610
Britains went to Brittany,

26
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.830
they started alluding to the place from which they had come as groaned.

27
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.830
Brittany, we're not going to refer to that.

28
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.510
I think we all know from the front of our passports,

29
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:55.400
if we're subjects of the queen, that it says there, great Britain,

30
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.000
a union of great Britain and Northern Ireland.

31
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.710
So that draws our attention to the union of 1707 with

32
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:07.970
Scotland. I'm not really much concerned with Wales.

33
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.470
I like Christopher lobes, Clara Hugh,

34
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.580
when all else fails, try Wales.

35
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.190
So I'm not going to concentrate on that nor do I want to particularly get bogged

36
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.630
down in issues of,

37
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370
of patriotism and nationalism and attitudes

38
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:32.390
towards belonging to the nation in part.

39
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.250
And Anthony was right about this.

40
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.260
We were all getting on famously in the green room, uh,

41
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.570
very, very cuddly and there a lot of snap chatting and stuff like that. And,

42
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.670
uh, it it's really out of respect for the opposing team who, uh, you know,

43
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.010
Syeda bossy, very distinguished politician and Kate Hoey, my own,

44
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.400
uh, former MP a little bit D more Pappy possibly.

45
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:02.860
Now she's the house of commons, but between them many,

46
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.000
many years of exemplary public service

47
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.560
service for what I presume they think of as,

48
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.210
as great Britain. And I don't wish to impugn that personally.

49
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.070
Uh, of course you might think that that, uh, Ms. Hoey,

50
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.480
who is often been a strong advocate of the right

51
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.650
to hunt Fox is somewhat strange in a,

52
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.330
in a labor MP is in a way hearkening back with her

53
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:39.070
championing of this pursuit to a sightly medieval conception of our

54
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.970
nation and its culture and malls, uh,

55
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:45.980
a slightly feudal conception, a conception that,

56
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.770
that the belongs, uh, as well with that idea. So,

57
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.750
so fond, uh, to which, uh, the medieval monarchs and,

58
00:03:55.751 --> 00:04:00.670
and the Baron Ray was so fond of which is that might is right.

59
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.500
Might is right. And I think that that idea is bound up in,

60
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:08.830
in great Britain. The idea of might being right.

61
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.210
So it could be that Ms. Hoey is, is a poet, is,

62
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.080
is opposing this motion because of that, uh, because of the Fox hunting,

63
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.240
uh, and as for, uh,

64
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.690
for Baroness Wasi barrenness,

65
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.870
what's that about Baroness? Uh, you know,

66
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.350
I mean, does she go hunting or Hawking?

67
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.690
She got some sort of a state to she occasionally clip clop around it and look at

68
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:41.460
some peasants groveling in the mud and say, get on with it. You peasants.

69
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.680
Uh, because I would say that if you style yourself as a barrenness,

70
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.540
you probably also have a looking belief in the idea that might

71
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.470
is right.

72
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.640
So I don't want to impugn them or their reasons for supporting the motion.

73
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.810
I simply want to draw everybody's attention to what the focus is here.

74
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.950
Great Britain, great Britain stalled itself. Great.

75
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.440
When it was the Hagerman,

76
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.100
the most powerful nation in the world.

77
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.130
And like all hegemonic,

78
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.510
great Britain believed that its value system wasn't objective

79
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:26.040
system of morality it's mite was indeed

80
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.200
right. Okay.

81
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.340
Do we still live in that country?

82
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.880
Manifestly? We do not.

83
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.680
We do not just think for example of the longest

84
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:44.550
deployment, the British army has ever been engaged in.

85
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:49.320
I refer to the deployment in Afghanistan following nine 11 in

86
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:53.790
14 years in theater. I think I'm right on this.

87
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.580
The British army suffered 500 fatalities. Okay.

88
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.760
The British army suffered that many fatalities in five minutes

89
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.690
during the first four hours of the battle of the Somme,

90
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.670
the willingness of the British to sacrifice the young men.

91
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.940
And it was mostly young men, but some young men,

92
00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:20.930
men as well upon the altar of being the Hagan Mon is

93
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.210
manifestly no longer the case.

94
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.250
And indeed to hear the public conversation about the losses of those 500

95
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:33.020
service people you'd think that you lived in a very, very small touchy, feely,

96
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:36.380
Scandinavian country, not in a hegemonic tool.

97
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.650
The other thing is I I've recently I've been working,

98
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.960
they would name check before on a trilogy of novels that focus on Britain's Wars

99
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.570
over the past century. And as part of that research,

100
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:52.550
I interviewed senior British army officers who told me that

101
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:54.500
they now regard themselves.

102
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:59.090
This is the command of the British army as an echelon of the

103
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.410
American army, a bit like the United States Marine Corps.

104
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.270
They have to be interoperable with the American forces and they cannot

105
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:13.190
deploy, uh, by themselves, not what you think of in a Hagerman.

106
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.010
I put it to you that the reason we're even debating this tonight is the

107
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:23.930
Britain has a kind of hecka Mon hangover that leads it to believe

108
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.320
it still has hegemonic attributes. All we,

109
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.810
as powerful as our status,

110
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:34.700
as one of the world's six biggest economies would really suggest what

111
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:38.240
does our economy consistent? What do we in fact take?

112
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.890
Well, we export some death metal.

113
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.690
That's true often to quite unpleasant regimes like Bahrain or

114
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.960
Israel. Cool, well done, Britain gray,

115
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.270
but the other thing we tend to do and make a great deal of money out

116
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:58.780
of is a kind of financial Ponzi scheme.

117
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.760
It's the city of London,

118
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.410
the equivalent in economic terms of taking money out of the cash point with your

119
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:09.670
own cash card and running around to the bank to put in your own account.

120
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.810
That's what we're engaged in. That's what makes Britain great.

121
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.980
Is that kind of economics? Oh yeah. And exporting things like, you know,

122
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.660
great famous British brands like Burberry and Baba, you know,

123
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:27.310
they're normally showcased in things like the queen, right?

124
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.500
The, the, a Netflix series,

125
00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:33.430
which bears absolutely no relation to our Royal family

126
00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:34.510
whatsoever.

127
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:40.150
I am indeed a concerned citizen of this country.

128
00:08:40.151 --> 00:08:44.170
And as such, I am a foil list rather than a royalist.

129
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.270
I liked Claire Foy and the role of the queen notch better than I like

130
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.000
Olivia Coleman and much better than I liked the actual queen who has

131
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.300
Paul Shaw for her thickest friend of Peter file's son.

132
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.210
So not much there to look to in terms of

133
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:08.310
greatness and then there's culture.

134
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.390
To what extent is British culture still great. After all,

135
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.530
I hold a British passport, I'm a writer I operate in that culture.

136
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.140
It may surprise you to hear this from me,

137
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.040
who you may think of as a sort of touchy, feely lefty typee person.

138
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.720
But my way of thinking is one of the problems that British culture has is a

139
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:30.420
problem in a lot of Western cultures have, which is,

140
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:33.030
it tries to embrace multiculturalism,

141
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.130
but there's a contradiction in terms there a culture is a vector that

142
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:41.820
carries forward a set of values. In this case,

143
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:46.020
it would have to be carrying forward if we're to be still be this great Britain,

144
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.240
those hegemonic values that we had when the sun never set on our empire.

145
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.740
But on the other hand,

146
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.600
we want to acknowledge the values of all these other diverse minorities in our

147
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:01.320
culture. There's an inherent contradict contradiction there.

148
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.000
I would like this country to respect the rights of all minorities,

149
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.440
but I don't think that that necessarily involves it in having the kind of great

150
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.590
British culture that it used to have.

151
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.050
We can see therefore that Britain might not

152
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.520
be as great as it was.

153
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:24.870
I haven't spoken much about the thing that is happening on Friday.

154
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.890
I myself was a Brexit agnostic.

155
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.140
We will see what's happened, but the damage was done ages ago,

156
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.850
the flotilla of Britishness was hold below the water line.

157
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.530
The thing about the British was unlike other nations and national cultures.

158
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:48.030
They never believed in utopia, but they did believe in Ukrainia.

159
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.920
They believed in a time that never was a marrying England

160
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.350
one in which Kate could hunt foxes and Syeda could

161
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.030
style a self-awareness and everything was just cushty.

162
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.703
Thank you.

163
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:14.660
