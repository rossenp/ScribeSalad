1
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.460
<v 1>Thank you SIDA.</v>

2
00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:08.990
So the only thing that's a rubbish about great Britain is our rubbish rubbish.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.300
And thank you for making that clear.

4
00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:16.250
I'm going to tell you now the result of the vote, and again,

5
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:19.040
the reminder of this motion,

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.780
there's not much great about Britain and 36% of

7
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:25.550
you agreed with that.

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.870
And 35% of you were against,

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.030
uh, which means, um, based on the logic of the referendum result.

10
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.780
But it's a massive factory bar is Doug Smith and Dominic Cummings,

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.250
a massive factory for, and you should just feel, I mean,

12
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:46.690
why don't you just die? I, I,

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.190
I'm 29. Uh, Mimsy people,

14
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:56.630
29% of you utterly Mims. You don't even know what you think. Uh,

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.560
I'd be ashamed if I was one of you. Now we're going to have some questions,

16
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.710
get some lights up. Um, and while we're just doing that,

17
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.430
I want will tell us why he hasn't salted 3 million,

18
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.390
139,462 Welsh. Uh, by saying that they are failures.

19
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.980
How many Wells here in the audience has up? I'd miss it.

20
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.300
What are you going to say too? Are you going to be like Boris and go to Wales?

21
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.080
I think you should go to Cardiff now and apologize.

22
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.290
Like Boris had the decency to do, to go deliverable.

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.130
<v 0>Well, it's, I'm moving to Wales myself. Actually. It's not about that.</v>

24
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.780
It's about the fact that

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.140
Wales isn't relevant to this question. That's all.

26
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.450
<v 1>That's a Weasley way out of that one. Now, Kate, do you love Britain?</v>

27
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.820
<v 2>I love the United Kingdom.</v>

28
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.180
<v 1>And do you love sport? I love sport.</v>

29
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.620
And where you sports minister between 1999 and 2001.

30
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.920
And if you love great Britain,

31
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.580
and if you love your country and you love sport and you were sports minister,

32
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.020
how come under you?

33
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.650
The England football team and the wealth of the Scottish and Northern line

34
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:13.040
didn't even figure had their worst ever two years

35
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.340
does not make you just a little bit of time.

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.150
<v 2>Um, funny enough, what a good question. Um, I,</v>

37
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:27.020
if only this sports ministers could actually make the England team

38
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.490
win. Um, they would be prime minister and Tony Blair tried,

39
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.400
but he didn't win. Do you remember who the captain was?

40
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.300
<v 1>Um, no, I didn't hide this. Let's move on rapidly. Uh,</v>

41
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:42.440
where was John of Gordon born? Our hero. John of gone.

42
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:46.370
Where was he born again for, I think what I,

43
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:51.080
and how can you possibly think that it's all been down here?

44
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:53.180
What were the dates of John of Gordon, your hero?

45
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.320
<v 0>I wouldn't say it was my hero quoted his dying speech or Shakespeare play.</v>

46
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.180
<v 1>We were moved to work that one side.</v>

47
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.330
<v 3>I also don't.</v>

48
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.050
I don't know who the capsule of the English football team ever was.

49
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.390
And I don't care either.

50
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.270
<v 1>Well, we do that. You didn't love your country.</v>

51
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.080
<v 3>You were stuck. Cause I knew where he was born. A man,</v>

52
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.410
he takes games or a woman who takes games too seriously.

53
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.850
It means they don't take life.

54
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.580
<v 1>I do picking out women, picking out women.</v>

55
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.240
<v 3>It's not about sport. It's got nothing to do with this at all.</v>

56
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.010
<v 1>Sorry. Is that a slightly sexist statement there about women and what's that</v>

57
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.280
sexist statement about women take from well,

58
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:45.030
is that what you would expect from someone on that side? No, I think he, I look,

59
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.290
I really feel sorry for these guys, right? They're clearly scared of Britain.

60
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.560
They're scared of the new people that have arrived here. They're scared of

61
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.713
[inaudible]

62
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.610
you see what modern Britain represents for me is vibrancy.

63
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:10.560
And forward-looking unfortunately we have two men who are just looking back

64
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:15.480
and Hawking to a Britain that, so what was it like to be sad? Have the votes,

65
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.850
uh, when women are you sad?

66
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.100
<v 3>I, I I'm, I'm deeply sad. Yes, obviously, but, uh, but it's Salida has spoiled.</v>

67
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.550
What was extraordinarily good speech by this, this allegation,

68
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.500
which I think is quite wrong and it might be low as the tone of the discussion.

69
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.790
I'm very concerned about the future. Uh, the,

70
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:38.820
the past is gone and dead. You can't get it back, even if you wanted to. And,

71
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.380
uh, I have no yearning for it ticketing the 1950s, an age of gristle,

72
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.410
ashtrays and chilblains, but I done,

73
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.870
I w what we really do need to be very careful not to choose the

74
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:55.140
wrong future again. And honestly, I,

75
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.180
the question of sport, I,

76
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.800
the old Soviet union and the Warsaw pact countries spend an awful lot of time

77
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.160
and effort trying to Excel at sport and where that got them.

78
00:05:05.161 --> 00:05:09.720
And they had very similar illusions about, uh, their importance, uh,

79
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.880
in the Soviet union. So the ones that we have now,

80
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:14.280
and that's one of the reasons why I take the position I do.

81
00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:17.850
I saw what the results of those illusions was.

82
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.500
It's terrible collapse after living for many years in a fool's

83
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.790
paradise, which is what we are.

84
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.220
<v 1>Well is looking at you with the look of a,</v>

85
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:30.930
kind of a golden Labrador looking lovingly at his,

86
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.790
uh, Oh no. Are you laughing at.

87
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.590
<v 3>Well on holiday together? People didn't realize that I love pizza.</v>

88
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.920
<v 1>Uh, are you happy to be sad? Huh? As, as they're saying.</v>

89
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.040
<v 3>No, I don't think we assigned at all on this side of things. I mean,</v>

90
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:48.300
I think the problem is that what we heard from that end is,

91
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.790
um, basically we had a lot of extolling of a lot of patriotic

92
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.070
stuff and I think pizza, and I really tried to move debate onto some.

93
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.720
<v 0>Serious questions here. And not just anybody, you know, Dr. Johnson said,</v>

94
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.270
you know, patriotism, patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.

95
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.541
Well,

96
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.720
I'm not suggesting there's something because he thought Patrick's ism was bad.

97
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.860
What he was drawing our attention to is that people who make their arguments on

98
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.370
the basis of patriotism are appealing to sentiment.

99
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.110
And that's not what Peter and I.

100
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.570
<v 1>Okay. So we've got that. So your fantasies and scoundrels,</v>

101
00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:28.960
and those were just two of the nicer, I just, how does that feel?

102
00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:30.100
Does that make you proud?

103
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.090
<v 4>Yeah, I think, um, look, I liked lined a whole series of fact, you know,</v>

104
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:38.170
these writers are fat. These musicians are fact these,

105
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.510
these, these, these,

106
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.770
the fact that a children's book,

107
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.140
the fact that it is the third most successful international

108
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.370
film franchise is fact and therefore what we have to,

109
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.810
we have to. Yeah,

110
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.820
but we have to celebrate those in our nation who are achieving

111
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:01.930
in all these fields.

112
00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:05.920
It is fact that we are the sixth largest economy in the world. You know,

113
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:09.220
this is fact, and I think it is also fact, as I said,

114
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:13.330
and I gave my own real life example. There are many,

115
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:17.200
many people who start right at the bottom of the ladder.

116
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.120
And there are very few countries in the world which allowed the opportunities.

117
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.920
And we see the success of people who rise to play their

118
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:31.360
part at the top of finance art politics.

119
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.400
And we've of course, got to celebrate that.

120
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.460
<v 1>Comment from a fantasy.</v>

121
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.720
<v 4>Oh, I can't, I can't understand how two people can sit there.</v>

122
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.250
Having been educated in this country, gone to university.

123
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:48.610
I think both of you probably quite good universities, Oxford or Cambridge,

124
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:50.200
I imagine. Um,

125
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.720
and yet can't find a single thing to say will looks good

126
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.710
about this country.

127
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.780
<v 0>Well, we're all we're arguing. We're arguing a case. That is,</v>

128
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.813
who's not much.

129
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.070
<v 1>Okay. Enough enough.</v>

130
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.840
<v 0>You wouldn't find the prosecution saying much for the defense either,</v>

131
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.530
but it doesn't mean he doesn't know.

132
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.860
<v 1>Well, if they got them slicing, that's marvelous.</v>

133
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.890
I couldn't say sickly the love Fest in the room before.

134
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.490
Can we have the lights on and come? You have the first question, please? Yes,

135
00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:27.580
we have questions. Why isn't a Christian number one? I could see two on three,

136
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.470
one. Let's have a question one here, please. A question one.

137
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:35.950
I'm going to take one, two and three. Yes. Let's go.

138
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.200
Let's take the rest of them. Question two then. Okay.

139
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.540
Can we have a question to commit the questions three that some of the hands up

140
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.690
someone? Yes. We got a question one. Let's go for question one. Yes. Good.

141
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.100
Sounds like a yes, sir.

142
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.220
<v 0>Um, thanks everyone. Uh, for the, my question is.</v>

143
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.670
<v 5>At first, like you could find, um, flaws and faults in,</v>

144
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.960
in any nation or anything, and it's kind of quite easy to be negative sometimes.

145
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.400
So are there any countries out there that you believe can truly claim to be

146
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:11.490
great? And if so, what makes them any different to us?

147
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.310
<v 1>Uh, very good. Uh, clearly Belgium for Peter Hitchens,</v>

148
00:09:16.311 --> 00:09:20.180
where John and Gordon came from, or was it Holland? Um,

149
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.400
literally number two there, gentlemen, standing up.

150
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.010
Can we have some women to please?

151
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.180
Why is it nobody mentioned art glorious,

152
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.980
an attribute, gorgeous future under our pastiche prime minister.

153
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.240
Why is

154
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.660
nobody talked about our future one nationhood or our

155
00:09:41.661 --> 00:09:46.160
global breadth, but because the two phrases,

156
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.580
all the references were backward looking,

157
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.590
everything was backward, looking, everything was utterly retrospective,

158
00:09:54.591 --> 00:09:56.810
even the bad things were respite retrospect.

159
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.110
Nobody has any real competence in the confidence

160
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:07.700
trick currently being played on us by

161
00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:11.210
ourselves as the look of a speech. Yes. Thank you very much, indeed.

162
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.950
I think that does can be,

163
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.230
we just had notation that from Peter York for the next debate. Ah,

164
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.050
thank you very much question please. Number three.

165
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.600
<v 6>Hi. Um, so I'm um, with the ladies against the motion,</v>

166
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.990
but I found Peter's comments very interesting.

167
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.210
And I would be interested in the panel's perception of how far

168
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.800
this, um,

169
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.600
I guess degration of our greatness has been because we've spent the

170
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:46.370
last few years being so critical of

171
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:50.960
ourselves and being very anti British as British and whether we're actually

172
00:10:50.961 --> 00:10:55.490
devaluing ourselves through frankly wokeness

173
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.593
ultimately.

174
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.510
<v 1>Well, I wrote Nass.</v>

175
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.540
And does that mean you found didn't find well interesting.

176
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:03.980
You found pizza interesting.

177
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.170
<v 6>Well, the most entertaining, but no,</v>

178
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.530
I didn't find his views as interesting is

179
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.373
right.

180
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.810
<v 1>Um, let's have a comment, uh, from Wil, uh, did you find that question?</v>

181
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:20.570
Interesting and wokeness? Yes.

182
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.640
<v 0>Well, I was making a technical point.</v>

183
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.220
It's not a question of right or left or anything else.

184
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:27.980
It's just a technical point about cultures,

185
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:31.460
which is what we associate with hegemonic nations,

186
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.230
which is what's implied by great Britain in our, my argument was quite careful.

187
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:39.290
The gentleman who made the point about it all being about the past.

188
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.850
Peter said that the British army lost to the IRA in Northern Ireland,

189
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.800
the British army lost to the sadrist militia in Iraq only a few short

190
00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:53.800
years ago and had to hang this to hands in shame as they were school cheat

191
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.750
back to the air point of disembarkation by the malicious defeated them.

192
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.580
So I'm not interested in the past.

193
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.050
I'm interested in right now on the point of wokeness. Yeah.

194
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.790
It's very difficult to imagine a hegemonic nation that is

195
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:13.270
truly multicultural. It's a contradiction in terms.

196
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.400
Look at the way that the current tag them on America gets its knickers in a

197
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:23.320
gigantic twist over trying to beat up people in foreign

198
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.710
countries while respecting the rights of its own minorities.

199
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.160
It's a pathetic spectacle. It's pathetic here as well.

200
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.330
<v 2>Well, so self-hatred yep.</v>

201
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.800
Well, I was going to talk about, um, I think the, the lady who,

202
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.790
even though she thought Chris Peter was interesting. Um,

203
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.000
I'm glad to hear that you think he was interesting.

204
00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:52.590
She did the GSI thought Peter was interesting. Yes. Very interesting. Very,

205
00:12:52.591 --> 00:12:54.270
very interesting. However, um,

206
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.740
I just wonder about her question because I think she's quite right. You know,

207
00:12:58.741 --> 00:13:02.850
there's been a kind of bash Britain bash, British, uh,

208
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.580
feeling around in the country for some time now. And,

209
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.260
and I think eat no matter how much you support, um,

210
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.860
the motion tonight, I can't again understand how anyone,

211
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.850
if you travel around and go to other countries, yes, it's great to travel.

212
00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:21.000
It's lovely to see other countries and there's some great things in them, but I,

213
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.920
I really cannot see any other country that combines the

214
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:28.650
kind of way that we have got our history.

215
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.000
And yet our history now is being moved forward in a direction that we're

216
00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:37.170
becoming a country that is going to have to now rely on itself. Again,

217
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.760
is going to have to be, uh,

218
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.500
looking out globally and internationally and not relying on 26 other

219
00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:46.950
countries to actually be along with what we're doing.

220
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.100
So I'm very optimistic and I think we should all stop, you know,

221
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.550
doing our country down and standing up for it the way other countries

222
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.440
populations do. And we seem to always want to be negative. Thank you very much.

223
00:13:58.441 --> 00:13:58.800
Indeed.

224
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.300
I would like people to come to these microphones on the Vulcan is pleased to

225
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.910
have questions. I'd like to see a forest to people up there.

226
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.310
I'd like to see more questions coming out of the audience,

227
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:10.320
but while yes you can.

228
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.090
<v 0>So I know I was only interesting, but I,</v>

229
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.390
there was a point a point made about where we might want to look for an example

230
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:22.520
of somewhere that all suffers better. Well, this isn't anyway making any cases,

231
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.880
any other countries perfect,

232
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.580
or indeed that I would want to go and live in any other country,

233
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:29.820
but I can think of at least two countries where they all the things a lot better

234
00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:33.480
than we do Switzerland seems to me, uh, to be extremely welded,

235
00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:37.710
to have a much better, a much better arrangement of, um, uh,

236
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.130
of education of transport. It defends itself.

237
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:44.160
It doesn't go around invading other people's countries, uh,

238
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.870
as a whim for nurses in militia for no good reason. Uh, and it's,

239
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.040
it is extremely free and has an extraordinarily.

240
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.930
<v 3>Democratic system. It's not the same as ours,</v>

241
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:55.610
but it has much to recommend it to my role.

242
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.370
So I spent a lot of my life traveling through other countries.

243
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.670
And one of the things that I learned during that trial was to stop looking at

244
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:04.580
them and wondering why they couldn't be more like Britain and seeing if I could

245
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:05.510
learn things from them,

246
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.350
another country from which we could learn a great deal is Japan, uh,

247
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:12.620
which has many of the characteristics, which we admire and ourselves,

248
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:17.300
which we no longer really possess such as the politeness and

249
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:22.070
civility, which it seems to me that in many cases we are losing, uh,

250
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:25.970
that it's all very well saying that people say, sorry to each other,

251
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.500
that you should try riding a bicycle in London and see if anybody says, sorry,

252
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.820
see you a lot of them too. So I think that, yes,

253
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:36.170
there are places we could look to,

254
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:38.420
but one of the things that we really do need to do and any,

255
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.430
any real Patriot is his country's most severe critic because then

256
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.370
he real Patrick truly cares about all

257
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.930
those pants, a, a ridiculous technical, a tourist boarding Lin swings,

258
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:57.050
like a pendulum do picture of the kind of bodies on bicycles,

259
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.010
two by two rubbish about what it's really like here, because it isn't, uh,

260
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.840
the police may not be corrupted in this country,

261
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.800
but they are almost totally absent, uh, which is a much bigger problem.

262
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.680
<v 4>Peter moved to Japan, which is he thinks is a great country. No,</v>

263
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.200
I don't think he should, because as everybody keeps saying,

264
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:19.660
he's very interesting. Um, and we need,

265
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.500
we need to have interesting

266
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.360
to have interesting people in this country, but I think it's also important.

267
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.440
I mean, when I do agree with, with both, uh, the, the, uh,

268
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:37.480
panelists opposite is that I think it is important for us to be a realistic and

269
00:16:37.481 --> 00:16:38.650
for us to challenge,

270
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.570
but to do it in a way where we do accurately measure ourselves against other

271
00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.610
countries, you know, as foreign office minister,

272
00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:50.500
I spent a lot of my time traveling around meeting and getting to know

273
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:55.180
countries incredibly deeply and what we

274
00:16:55.181 --> 00:17:00.100
just take for granted, which I, you know, I, let me speak very personally,

275
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.930
I, as a woman take for granted about how I travel,

276
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.220
where I travel, what I can say, which I, as a politician say,

277
00:17:09.221 --> 00:17:12.280
in terms of what I can say, how I can say it,

278
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.380
these things are just not even available in many, many nations around the world.

279
00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:18.820
So what I'm saying is, um,

280
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.410
we're not arguing here about whether we are the greatest nation in the world.

281
00:17:23.411 --> 00:17:28.120
What we are arguing is that, that motion, there's not much great about Britain.

282
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.060
I tell you that is a lot. That is great.

283
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.730
<v 3>So when you do me a favor,</v>

284
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.500
ask Kate now what you saw at East Croydon on her way back from,

285
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.620
from Gatwick airport, Oscar, what.

286
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.720
<v 4>I saw a stabbing. Yes, of course.</v>

287
00:17:46.721 --> 00:17:51.390
But does that really say Chris or Peter that this is not going on elsewhere?

288
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:55.020
I was in Frankfurt recently at a football match actually. Um, I,

289
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.610
Ryan Frankfort station,

290
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.990
it was absolutely impossible to walk with our gangs of young people,

291
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:04.680
mainly not Germans all hanging around or taking drugs,

292
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:07.920
which I know some people think is fine. And then, um,

293
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.880
there was a real feeling of fear, not, I don't think,

294
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:15.000
no matter how terrible things are in London at the moment with was with

295
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:15.571
stabbings.

296
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:20.430
And it was a very frightening experience that people walk around in fear.

297
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.900
And I do think that you can't judge a country by, can I just come back on this?

298
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:28.260
And you know, th the kind of time that you described, uh, you know,

299
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:32.520
when we could build railways in seven days and we could kind of build ships in

300
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:37.020
five days and we could go around the world, defeating the world in world Wars.

301
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.130
Do you think that it was any safer to walk around the East end of London then,

302
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.910
but we still thought we were, if you, if we would a great country then,

303
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.810
and we had crime in London, just having crime in London today.

304
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.510
<v 0>Actually. Yes, actually. Yes, it was. And all the accounts at the time,</v>

305
00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:54.344
there was a huge

306
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.990
[inaudible] if you asked the question and he was listened to the answer,

307
00:18:59.991 --> 00:19:04.430
there was a, there was a huge defeat of crime and disorder in this country,

308
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.840
uh, brought about by water. Now,

309
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.860
the geodesic Victorian values at the end of the 19th century,

310
00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:13.860
which we continue to benefit from to some extent even now, but we are losing.

311
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.010
<v 1>Okay. I wanted to get, move into more questions.</v>

312
00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:20.510
Now you can ask questions of the fantasy or the optimist. Well,

313
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.370
before we do that, can you just name please?

314
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.700
Your one country that you think is great because.

315
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.980
<v 0>I don't think any, uh,</v>

316
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.460
arm's going to end on my point about status and nation States,

317
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.100
and I'd like to keep my powder dry, right?

318
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.360
<v 1>How to dry up powder dry. Well, you're going to have a question out. Yeah,</v>

319
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.940
please. Yes. From the balcony, an excellent question coming on.

320
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.880
I wondered if you could touch upon.

321
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.130
<v 7>How English and Welsh law is the governing law for most international</v>

322
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:51.890
contracts and how you feel that relates to this motion.

323
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.130
<v 1>Well, that's going to get them on the edge of their seat. Uh,</v>

324
00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.870
thank you very much in Pete. If you want us to the question.

325
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.760
Thank you very much for that. Um, and the question about waving over there. Yes.

326
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.840
Let's go for this one here.

327
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.170
<v 7>Well, this is for you. Hi there. Where are you? Here? Are there you are. Hi,</v>

328
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.370
listen, you were hilariously. I wateringly depressing,

329
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.630
but I have to say there was one thing you said that it was Hagerman that the

330
00:20:20.631 --> 00:20:24.650
great came into Britain because we were a big empire. Well,

331
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.750
when Kate was talking about what makes her move, it was the United Kingdom.

332
00:20:29.751 --> 00:20:32.960
It was James F. I was blown away when I found out that James,

333
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:36.740
the first of Scotland was the first person to put the great into Britain.

334
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.750
That's in 60, no three.

335
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.100
<v 1>Okay. And the question is, does he know?</v>

336
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.030
<v 7>And is that the greatness has the great,</v>

337
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.370
these tiny.

338
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.540
<v 6>Islands have grown exponentially in their influence.</v>

339
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:55.150
And when Syeda talked about the Commonwealth,

340
00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.340
I would love her to expand a little bit more about how she sees the future with

341
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:05.140
all those 53 countries who genuinely

342
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.550
have a Goodwill.

343
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.460
<v 1>Right. Okay. Um, I'm just gonna remind you here again.</v>

344
00:21:11.461 --> 00:21:14.970
You should be voting if you haven't already done so either yes or no.

345
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:19.710
If you can't make your, uh, if you were in the Mimsy brigade, right.

346
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:24.120
And question it down here and you don't know question yes. Question here. I'll,

347
00:21:24.121 --> 00:21:28.230
let's have other, there is a lady in the third row back.

348
00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:32.580
Let's give lady in the second row back. And there you are question a up,

349
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.020
you Stan. This is the question now, please. Nothing about contracts.

350
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.320
No, I don't understand it all. Hello.

351
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.060
<v 6>Um, this is the question to say,</v>

352
00:21:42.061 --> 00:21:46.800
either you do mention about all the facilities that people enjoy, you know,

353
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.420
being British, you know, like the free schooling, the NHS, the transport,

354
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.830
but would you not say that the quality of the services have fallen over the

355
00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.050
years in order to remain great?

356
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.470
Should not the quality of the services be better?

357
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.090
<v 1>Yeah. And do you think that your,</v>

358
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.490
the conservative leader of your party,

359
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.960
Boris Johnson is going to really put the G back into great.

360
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.030
Well, because this is clearly being filmed and there's going to be a podcast.

361
00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:22.890
Yes, of course. I believe that, Anthony, what would you expect me to say?

362
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.320
Well, I didn't know whether he wanted a job in the cabinet.

363
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:31.080
<v 0>Proving out how fantastically English you are by being a massive hypocrite.</v>

364
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.300
<v 1>But I I've probably followed Peter's advice and decided that civility has to</v>

365
00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:44.140
prevail. And what is your view about, about the, the,

366
00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.970
the contract point, but I didn't hear that question. We didn't,

367
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.150
it doesn't normally affect you. Whether you hear the question,

368
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.780
I'm going to just give the answer that I'm, you're a politician. Uh,

369
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.560
I think hearing the question is a profoundly relevance. Uh, well,

370
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.940
let's hear your views about.

371
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.250
<v 0>This on contract law. Yes.</v>

372
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.570
<v 1>On the three questions. Really? Yes. Well, I think a lot of people.</v>

373
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.170
<v 0>One of the things the city sells, it's a financial jiggery.</v>

374
00:23:10.171 --> 00:23:14.640
Pokery on his due diligence and their idea of the rule of law in this

375
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:17.490
country. And that that's an extremely important thing.

376
00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:20.910
And one of the things that makes Britain great,

377
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.980
isn't it great that really dodgy finances and business

378
00:23:25.981 --> 00:23:30.270
people from other countries can come here and we'll be an honest broker for

379
00:23:30.271 --> 00:23:33.630
their deals. So what a great country.

380
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.590
<v 1>On the subject to that S word haven't you got an S word you're going to share</v>

381
00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:43.640
with us tonight. Say that I shared it right at the beginning. This,

382
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.280
hear it again.

383
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.220
I said that two guys were here telling everybody that we lived in a

384
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.810
hole and I don't agree with it.

385
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.880
Do you think that's a fair summary of that intelligence?

386
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.341
<v 3>Well,</v>

387
00:23:57.341 --> 00:24:01.480
I do think this is not the first summary and anybody listening with a fair mind

388
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:04.840
knows that it's not what I do think. And I rebuke both will.

389
00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:08.950
And or is that the use of words like that in public places is a sign of the

390
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:09.784
decline of our.

391
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.013
<v 1>Cool.</v>

392
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:14.933
<v 3>If you can't,</v>

393
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.310
you can't express yourself without resourcing to the language of the lavatory

394
00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:22.430
wall, then you can't express yourself. And I.

395
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.820
<v 1>Uh, w w w what about</v>

396
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.390
[inaudible]?

397
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.710
<v 0>So, Peter, because it's just not true.</v>

398
00:24:32.711 --> 00:24:34.870
I've expressed myself in many, many,

399
00:24:34.871 --> 00:24:37.480
many volumes and can use lots of other words,

400
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.340
but I don't think that the use of the word,

401
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.460
the S word in this context was not inappropriate.

402
00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:46.840
I appreciate inside you using it. She's used it with conviction,

403
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.700
and I used it as well with some convention to after all we'll produce it,

404
00:24:51.701 --> 00:24:54.460
Peter, or perhaps you're in a different stage of development.

405
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:56.343
You're now you're looking at.

406
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.000
<v 1>But the point is we produce as well as we used to,</v>

407
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.290
or it's the going down the plug hole too.

408
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.570
<v 3>Well, that's our next holiday gone? I don't, I think it is important.</v>

409
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.890
Civility is important.

410
00:25:11.891 --> 00:25:15.940
The use of language is important and the language is what separates us from the

411
00:25:15.941 --> 00:25:19.060
animals. And if we don't use it with care and thought, uh,

412
00:25:19.061 --> 00:25:23.080
then w with throwing away an important gift.

413
00:25:23.081 --> 00:25:26.800
And I think this descent into, for lesser language, uh,

414
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:31.750
which is common to politics and to journalism and to even into literature and

415
00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:35.950
on television has been a lowering of our culture.

416
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.710
And the, the whole point I was.

417
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:42.880
So when I went to live in the Soviet union in 1990,

418
00:25:42.881 --> 00:25:46.120
I was taught by my by teacher, uh,

419
00:25:46.121 --> 00:25:48.560
the extremely elaborates, uh,

420
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:53.350
filthy language of Russia. And at the end of it,

421
00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:56.260
my teacher said a name was promised me never to use any of this.

422
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.470
You must know what it means. It's tremendously dangerous to use it,

423
00:25:59.471 --> 00:26:04.090
because this is the line between normal life and violence. This is this,

424
00:26:04.091 --> 00:26:07.570
this is a very tight, be coded, very subtle form of language. And if you,

425
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.820
if you use it wrongly, you might well be killed,

426
00:26:09.821 --> 00:26:12.250
but you need to know what it means, but I'm telling you this for that reason.

427
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.640
And that is the purpose of this language. Is there are moments.

428
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:20.350
I've no doubt that when my father was going on to and between Murmansk and

429
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.850
scarper flow in his Majesty's ships in the 1940s was of this kind.

430
00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:27.610
We used on the bridge from time to time, perhaps with good reason,

431
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.330
but those on people, don't coal mines. And in trawlers,

432
00:26:31.331 --> 00:26:33.370
might've used them as well, because they were justified.

433
00:26:33.371 --> 00:26:38.080
They're not justified here. And I don't think people should lightly use them.

434
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:39.790
And I think they should constrain themselves.

435
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.220
And by doing so express themselves better, we, the tremendously rich.

436
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.190
<v 1>Language always offers who saw you to list it</v>

437
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.490
that time, struggling to find any possible relevance to what this

438
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.770
[inaudible] has got about the title of this debate. Kate,

439
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.520
do you disagree with sight as use of the S word very briefly?

440
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:03.750
Or are you going to fall out like.

441
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.200
<v 2>Well, I personally would not,</v>

442
00:27:06.201 --> 00:27:10.970
I never have used what would be called words like that in

443
00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:15.640
public. I think I haven't, and I don't see why people laugh with that.

444
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.010
There is a, there is a problem with our society,

445
00:27:19.011 --> 00:27:21.470
and it doesn't mean that I don't think this motion is nonsense,

446
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.450
but there is a problem with our society that we are actually devaluing a lot

447
00:27:26.451 --> 00:27:27.284
of the kind of

448
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:33.470
ways that people behaved and that we were taught to behave have now been

449
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.500
kind of almost thrown out the window. And it's almost laughed at now.

450
00:27:36.501 --> 00:27:41.030
If people are, are, are polite. If people actually say, thank you.

451
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.100
If people give up their seat, I'm very delighted.

452
00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:45.710
If a man gives me a seat or a woman gives me a seat as well,

453
00:27:45.711 --> 00:27:49.130
if they want to on a tube and all of these things we alert and we saw in

454
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:52.370
parliament, what was wrong in the last couple of years?

455
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.540
Not just because we had an appalling speaker who allowed things to completely

456
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:57.380
get out of control,

457
00:27:57.381 --> 00:28:00.590
but we have lost all respect and no wonder people are losing respect and

458
00:28:00.591 --> 00:28:01.424
politicians.

459
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.250
<v 1>Very good. Okay. Thank you very much, indeed. For that. Kate,</v>

460
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.930
we're going to just take three final questions that I'm trying to

461
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.550
get a fair cross section. Uh, there is a gentleman here.

462
00:28:13.551 --> 00:28:16.310
There's a lady in the third row there,

463
00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:19.790
and I'm going to go for a lady. Um,

464
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.430
who's got her hand up there. So let's go one, two, three short snappy questions.

465
00:28:25.431 --> 00:28:28.820
No S words. Um.

466
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.780
<v 6>Now Anthony, I know you're on a education list, um,</v>

467
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:37.460
but I have to disagree with the Baroness about your

468
00:28:37.461 --> 00:28:41.270
idea about social movement in the UK.

469
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.280
And this is because I agree with Peter,

470
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.120
the educational system in this country is deeply unfair.

471
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.160
The same people rise to the top,

472
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.920
the same people get all the privileged positions.

473
00:28:51.921 --> 00:28:56.540
That is the worst thing about Britain, the lack of social movement,

474
00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.160
the lack of opportunity for the majority of our children, young people,

475
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.370
it's holding us back. And it's very, very.

476
00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.110
<v 1>And does that detract from this being great, right. Okay. Significant, uh,</v>

477
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.890
a very significant point. Let's take this question there. Yes, please.

478
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.900
<v 6>Uh, my questions to Kate, um, well, you touched on it at the beginning, um,</v>

479
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.240
your historics poor of the Fox hunting and in your speech

480
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.900
side, uh,

481
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.580
you mentioned our ability as a nation to be really forward thinking and how

482
00:29:28.581 --> 00:29:31.160
we're consistently behind revolutionary thought.

483
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.700
And I just wondered how Kate feels that fits in one,

484
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:37.370
her attitudes to animal rights,

485
00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:41.560
which is arguably at the forefront of revolutionary thinking and particularly

486
00:29:41.561 --> 00:29:42.160
amongst.

487
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.060
<v 8>Kind of the younger population of this country,</v>

488
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.070
why it's very antithetical to our advancement in that area of evolution.

489
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.980
<v 1>Okay. Thank you very much. And then the final question here, gentlemen,</v>

490
00:29:55.981 --> 00:29:59.100
at the end, and these will be the last set of questions.

491
00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.810
<v 8>Um, my questions were K and it's a simple question regarding Brexit</v>

492
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.300
where isn't Brexit, one of the gross,

493
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.330
most grandiose displays of Britain bashing,

494
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:14.640
and you supported it yourself and isn't that kind of a Mark of hypocrisy

495
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.810
because you mobilize and engage with Britain bashing.

496
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:23.550
And now you're coming out and saying that we shouldn't bash Britain and we live

497
00:30:23.551 --> 00:30:26.790
in some sort of Panglossian grip best of all worlds.

498
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:31.230
<v 1>Right. Okay. Um, thank you very much, indeed. Uh,</v>

499
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.800
that I'm going to ask you to bear in mind, uh,

500
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.460
those questions and in your final summative comments,

501
00:30:38.461 --> 00:30:41.280
which will be 90 seconds, uh, each,

502
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.410
and we're going to go in reverse what it means.

503
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.820
It's going to begin with Syeda said picking up those three points and any other

504
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:53.070
summative points that you want to make. I now have the score here,

505
00:30:53.071 --> 00:30:55.890
which I'm going to announce at the end, but, uh,

506
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.380
off from work from your day.

507
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.820
<v 4>Okay. Um, so I think the question that you asked me, uh,</v>

508
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:07.380
really goes to the heart of this debate and that is that, uh,

509
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.000
can Britain be better?

510
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.440
Social mobility is definitely on the decline and there are countries around the

511
00:31:13.441 --> 00:31:17.730
world that have better social mobility, and that leads to better community,

512
00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:22.020
a more integrated nation. Canada is one example, the bigger,

513
00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:26.760
the divide between the rich and poor, the more, less cohesive the country is,

514
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:31.830
but just because we can do better and we absolutely can do better in all of the

515
00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:34.830
areas that I mentioned we can do better.

516
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.850
That does not mean that we are still not a great country,

517
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.390
a great nation. And therefore, what I would ask you tonight,

518
00:31:42.391 --> 00:31:47.160
ladies and gentlemen is to choose hope over despair.

519
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.020
I would choose you, ask you to choose optimism over pessimism.

520
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:57.240
And I would ask you to vote against this motion to vote for team

521
00:31:57.241 --> 00:32:01.740
burgundy, team Britain and not to vote for team gray,

522
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.830
team pessimistic, man, flu. Thank you.

523
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.680
<v 1>Well, um,</v>

524
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.530
pizza, how would you respond in the final?

525
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.420
<v 3>Well, I'm not going to do that because I know all the votes being counted.</v>

526
00:32:18.421 --> 00:32:22.980
Anyway, I take out, I take advantage of the, a,

527
00:32:22.981 --> 00:32:25.530
of the question from the lady down there on the, on,

528
00:32:25.531 --> 00:32:27.780
on our education system until the throne,

529
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:32.130
even war news was brought to even war that his old friend Randolph Churchill,

530
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.470
uh, had been taken into hospital for an operation to remove a non-malignant

531
00:32:37.471 --> 00:32:38.130
growth.

532
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.540
And even in war responded by saying how extraordinary the medical profession to

533
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:44.990
rummage through the whole body of Randolph Churchill and find the only thing

534
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:47.780
which is not malignant and remove it.

535
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:52.190
And this sums up the education policy of this country, which in 1965,

536
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:55.280
found that it had some tremendous state ground schools,

537
00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.410
which had lifted tens of thousands of people out of, out of poverty into,

538
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.850
into totally new lives, benefited the country immensely by their talents.

539
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.410
And it had bad secondary modern schools, which were failing to do this.

540
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.401
And so what did you do?

541
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:12.890
It closed the grammar schools and turned them all into secondary moderns.

542
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.440
And this is one of the reasons why we are a country,

543
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:17.120
which is in serious need of, uh,

544
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.390
how shall I put it something close to the approaching cultural revolution.

545
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:25.010
And I very much hope that that's what we have, but if we don't,

546
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:28.190
then maybe it'd be some of you will go away from this evening thinking that

547
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.210
things are not quite as great as you thought they were. And as a result,

548
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:36.710
we might conceivably survive as a country rather than sink giggling into the

549
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:37.544
sea.

550
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.210
<v 2>Thank you very much, PISA Kate.</v>

551
00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.880
And can you particularly pick up the boys on animal rights?

552
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.940
I am amazed this whole thing about Fox hunting. I mean,

553
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.720
I think it's because we're lives in lumbers and there's so many foxes.

554
00:33:55.721 --> 00:33:58.870
You actually spend half your life watching them don't you will,

555
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.440
but Fox hunting for me was something that as far as I'm concerned,

556
00:34:02.441 --> 00:34:04.180
there has to be wildlife management.

557
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.390
Anyone who doesn't think that doesn't know anything about the countryside.

558
00:34:07.391 --> 00:34:10.390
And as far as I was concerned, hunting was as, as,

559
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.330
as good and as better away than shooting foxes,

560
00:34:13.331 --> 00:34:16.750
who then die and misery and all of that, it was a libertarian issue to me.

561
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.510
I don't know why it's been such a big issue tonight.

562
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.270
I'm fed up with people going on about animal rights.

563
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.690
What I want is to see animal welfare and I want to Pete,

564
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:30.610
and I just think we've become very woke using that term when it comes to

565
00:34:30.611 --> 00:34:31.444
animals. Nobody,

566
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:34.270
I was brought up on a farm where there was absolutely no cruelty,

567
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.160
but I'm fed up with people.

568
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.270
Assuming somehow that animals have got some kind of special status that we have

569
00:34:40.271 --> 00:34:44.100
to, uh, behave in that way. Um, on, on the question, just going,

570
00:34:44.101 --> 00:34:47.350
I must say that I don't understand where you got the word hypocrite.

571
00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:50.080
I haven't bashed Britain ever in terms of the Brexit,

572
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:54.340
the bit I've bashed the European union and will continue to do so. Uh,

573
00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:58.870
only now we're not going to be part of it anymore. Um, I have never bashed the,

574
00:34:58.871 --> 00:35:00.970
our country. I thought that we would want it.

575
00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:04.000
I wanted to see us being independent. It wasn't about trading for me.

576
00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:08.950
It was about actually having a country that could very much be independent again

577
00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:13.480
and making its own in charge of its own destiny and not responsible and working

578
00:35:13.481 --> 00:35:16.330
towards the European union, but just on this overall, the debate,

579
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.910
this really is, as Aida has said,

580
00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.800
it's about whether you actually think that this country has got

581
00:35:23.801 --> 00:35:27.430
things in it that you know, would not be happening in other countries.

582
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.180
And that what is great about our country is that we can actually have these

583
00:35:31.181 --> 00:35:34.990
kinds of debates that people on the whole are quite nice to each other

584
00:35:34.991 --> 00:35:38.190
afterwards. And before, um, that in the end.

585
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.720
<v 1>We know that our country is, is going now into it and exciting fears.</v>

586
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.130
And what I would like to see is that everybody gets behind that and makes the

587
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:49.350
country really grit. And for me,

588
00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:52.620
grit does not mean that you agree with everything that it does,

589
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.910
but it certainly means that it's,

590
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.820
it's a lot better than many of the countries I've visited nights.

591
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.490
Why so many of us are living here and could move,

592
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.060
but don't move because we love our country. Thank you very much. Kate Hoey

593
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.660
and lifting the whole debate. Anna, who knows,

594
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.490
who knows maybe even changing the result that I have written down on this paper

595
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:17.880
by the sheer magnetism and power of your speech.

596
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.770
<v 0>Thank you, Nancy, for that belt. I don't, I don't know where to begin.</v>

597
00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:23.960
Just on a sidebar Oliver Rakim,

598
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.210
the preeminent historian of the English countryside writes that the Fox would

599
00:36:29.211 --> 00:36:32.900
have been eradicated in this country several hundred years ago,

600
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.700
written not for the desire of certain group of the Gentry to hunted.

601
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.870
So it's been artificially kept alive in order to be hunted.

602
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.850
And you best hope that animals do have some rights because you're an animal

603
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.090
and you don't have any human rights if you don't have any animal rights,

604
00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.490
but that's just a side bar.

605
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.290
What I wanted to talk about really was you it's too late.

606
00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.290
You voted I've shame on you. If you voted for them,

607
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.990
really the baronesses speech was the nearest sort of Hovis advert

608
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.190
winsy. Uh,

609
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.640
and as for my Quando men P that she Rose to the rhetorical

610
00:37:13.641 --> 00:37:16.790
Heights that as I said before, you know, mistrust,

611
00:37:16.791 --> 00:37:20.690
a woman who takes games to seriously mean she doesn't take games seriously

612
00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:25.430
enough, but both of them attacked us really on the line of patriotism.

613
00:37:25.431 --> 00:37:29.000
And that's not what Peter and I were really talking about, but, you know,

614
00:37:29.001 --> 00:37:31.640
I got a little time. So I'll tell you a joke.

615
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.920
My mother was an immigrant to this country from the States, a Jewish American.

616
00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:40.670
So I can tell a Jewish joke. She used to say, by the way,

617
00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:44.390
the difference between the States and here was an America,

618
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.770
they hate you because you're a woman or because you're black or because you're a

619
00:37:48.771 --> 00:37:52.760
Jew and here in England, they just hate you personally.

620
00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:56.683
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

621
00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.280
<v 0>Totally happened to be a woman black or a Jew. Great,</v>

622
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.510
great country.

623
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.480
<v 1>Thank you well, very much. And, um,</v>

624
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.700
for that, uh, elevating, uh, very elevating, uh, joke,

625
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.570
uh, which is going to leave, everyone's going to be leaving, uh,

626
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.880
with a spring in their heels. I thought that was,

627
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:24.440
I thought they did incredibly well. They've managed to be very insulting, uh,

628
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:29.300
to each other are between the teams and even within the team on my right hand

629
00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.270
side. Um,

630
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.650
we got rid of that sheer hypocrisy of that comradery at the beginning.

631
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.980
And I don't want to see any of it up in the green room afterwards. Uh,

632
00:38:39.981 --> 00:38:44.560
I want you just to walk off in a half, um, that will mean it's been a really,

633
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:49.180
even better debate. Now look, it was so, um, uh, it's so,

634
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:54.550
uh, significant the vote before 29% didn't know what to

635
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:58.840
think or who they were, uh, 36% voted for the motion.

636
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:01.660
There's not much great about, uh,

637
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.720
Britain and 35%. Uh,

638
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.700
now the 29% undecided have gone down to

639
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:14.620
3% of variance. It tells me of minus 26. So,

640
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.410
uh, that is saying something for the education system, uh,

641
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.460
will that it could be enormously, uh, better. Uh,

642
00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:25.990
the variance was 13% on the others and by, uh,

643
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:27.160
a, uh,

644
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.660
massive overwhelming and triumphant margin,

645
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.440
uh, the motion has been lost

646
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.400
Yes by you. How does that feel?

647
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.250
You're losing you lose it and it's been won by the

648
00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:50.790
depressing [inaudible].

649
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:56.640
I got your throat. Well,

650
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.140
thank you very much. That was 49,

651
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:06.360
49 to 48. Eat your heart out. Dominic Cummings.

652
00:40:06.361 --> 00:40:08.910
They says massive, massive factory.

653
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.080
I'm can ask all of you for coming and being a fantastic audience,

654
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.610
possibly the best audience ever for an intelligent spread debate and can thank

655
00:40:17.611 --> 00:40:20.160
intelligence squared and the speakers. One more time. Thanks.
