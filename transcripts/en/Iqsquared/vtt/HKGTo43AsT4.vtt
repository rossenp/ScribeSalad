<v 0>Hello, I'm Linda you and you kind of missed that author of the great economists.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.850
Welcome to this special video episode of the intelligence squared podcast.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.330
I'm here with Mark [inaudible] professor of international economics at Brown

6
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:26.310
university and Eric Lonergan, a London-based macro hedge fund manager.

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.640
Their new book is angry Nomics,

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320
and I'm delighted to explore the stimulate you book with them in this

9
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:38.760
podcast. So I'm just going to kick off and start. I'm going to ask each of you,

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.860
why did you write the book and see if your answers match up Mark

11
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:44.694
first.

12
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.460
<v 1>We wrote the book because Eric and I used to hang out at a finance conferences.</v>

13
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.240
The reason I was hanging out the finance for instance was because I was writing

14
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.620
like prior book on austerity and I wanted to meet bond market

15
00:00:57.621 --> 00:00:58.454
vigilantes.

16
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.470
Eric is the least likely vigilante I've ever met and we hit it off and we

17
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:05.720
decided it would be fun at some point to write a book,

18
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.310
but we could never find the time.

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.750
And then we came up with an elegant technological solution, Eric, over to you.

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.870
<v 2>Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think there's no doubt our sort of friendship,</v>

21
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.110
um, was a big part, no two ways about it.

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.860
And it's a very interesting exercise in collaboration.

23
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.020
I find working with Mark because I think, and this will,

24
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.880
hopefully this will come through and it comes through in the book.

25
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.820
We all very different in many ways. Um,

26
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.280
not just because he supports football teams that aren't going anywhere. Um,

27
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.320
I I'm kidding, but, uh, yeah, w we're very different,

28
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.390
but we work really well together, you know,

29
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920
and one thing that's great about Mark as a collaborator is there's,

30
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.580
there's very little ego, so we've, I think we've got a nice mix. I mean,

31
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.650
you'll notice Linda when you're trying to collaborate with people,

32
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:58.161
it's really hard.

33
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:02.690
If people are very precious about what they say or possess and we just really

34
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.780
hit it off. Well, I think that's the sort of, you know,

35
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.480
the personal case for it. The idea,

36
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.030
I think we just really felt that, that we,

37
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.440
we had an insight into what was happening in the world.

38
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.290
That was one key thing from a kind of political economy perspective,

39
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.960
even though our starting points in some respects are different.

40
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.220
And then the crux was, was a discovery that anger,

41
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.900
this very strange emotion that everybody is familiar with,

42
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.080
but nobody really understands, um,

43
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.320
is the arc that brings it all together. Um,

44
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.290
I think that was really the Genesis of this book,

45
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.410
friendship and anger.

46
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.870
<v 1>But you're missing one point.</v>

47
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:48.200
It also makes things theory because we recorded the book.

48
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.010
The reason it's dialogues is because we actually sat down and did it with a

49
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:55.700
couple of iPhones. So that's why it has that unusual structure.

50
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:59.230
And then what was fascinating is we took it out of the dialogue and couldn't

51
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
enter text.

52
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.180
<v 2>And when we read at market value and read exactly like all these other books</v>

53
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.980
were pointy-headed geeky,

54
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:08.920
50 year old Rex white men tell the world what's wrong with us.

55
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.030
We thought this is awful. This is the right tablet.

56
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.030
So we put it back into dialogue and suddenly it was much better.

57
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.790
So from that point on, we knew what we had and it was a dialogue.

58
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.150
<v 0>You just answered. My second question, which is, it's a really unusual format.</v>

59
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:27.510
It's a series of dialogues and between the two of you,

60
00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:30.060
which I think really brings the issues to life.

61
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.070
So I'm just going to delve now into the issue. So you define and green omics,

62
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.840
um, as any kind of,

63
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.130
of heightened uncertainty and anger were faith in the workings of markets and

64
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:45.810
politicians has been undermined you both set out to explain and

65
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:50.370
propose what to do about it. So just tell us a bit more about the premise.

66
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.540
I'll start with you, Eric.

67
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.990
<v 2>I think that's important to understanding the thesis and then Mark can sort of</v>

68
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.430
pick this up is, is the, the concept of anger itself. So,

69
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.260
so one of the things that's intriguing about anger is it's so

70
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:10.950
prevalent, you know, eat children, know what anger is.

71
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:14.640
Every human being has experienced or felt anger at some point in time.

72
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.260
And yet we're very inarticulate when it comes to, I guess. So if I said to you,

73
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.830
what are the different types of anger? What function does anger serve?

74
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.980
Why do we get angry? Is there good anger? Is there bad?

75
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:29.010
Anger is private anger, the same as public anger.

76
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.090
We don't have a given vocabulary for making sense of this.

77
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.720
It's just sort of assumed that we understand it. Um,

78
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.920
and so the first part of the thesis was to try and make sense of anger, right?

79
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.700
And, and we did a load of reading and anger is covered in so many disciplines.

80
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.790
There's neuroscience, there's moral philosophy, the social psychology,

81
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:50.940
the psychology, the self-help books, all covering anger,

82
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.710
but nowhere really did we find a satisfactory typology or synthesis

83
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.420
out. We kind of through a very, through an interesting process,

84
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.560
we came up with this type apology, which is there, it's almost like there's, Oh,

85
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.940
there's an angelic and a devilish form of anger, right? And,

86
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:11.370
and the first kind of binary form is this between public and private.

87
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.630
So what's really interesting is when you see private public expressions of

88
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:18.960
anger, like extinction rebellion, protestors,

89
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.700
or re the righteous anger of, of black lives matter, um,

90
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.710
it's, it's actually argued, justify, um,

91
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.940
there's almost pride in the anger because it's righteous anger.

92
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.520
Let's put it like that in the private sphere.

93
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:37.620
It's typically associated with shame, right?

94
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:40.290
If you had a colleague who was suddenly getting angry,

95
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.780
you'd take them to one side and say, is everything okay at home?

96
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.740
It tells us about an internal stress or anxiety. So again,

97
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:49.560
you have this sort of duality where they seem like opposites,

98
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.420
and then the second component.

99
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:53.400
So you have private and public have very different,

100
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:56.550
but then the two faces of public anger, right? We have this,

101
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.430
this moral we've described.

102
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.840
<v 1>But also, and this is the football reference. We've we came upon this,</v>

103
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.850
this idea of the angry fam,

104
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.590
which anybody who's gone to a sort of big sporting event will identify with.

105
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.980
And they're a very curious phenomenon and why do they exist?

106
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.660
And we sort of identified this as, as they become identity regulators.

107
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.150
Um, so this is the type apology that kind of is a starting point for,

108
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:25.520
for setting us up to understand angry Nomics.

109
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.380
<v 3>Mark, did you want to say something about, well,</v>

110
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.260
you will come to your proposals for the way forward,

111
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.840
but is there anything about the premise you want to tease out at this point?

112
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.340
<v 1>I'll just add a little bit on of gloss on what Eric said in terms of the two</v>

113
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.360
content guys. So let's take Trump's in his, the mind's all was in the news,

114
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:43.960
right?

115
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.490
So what did Trump do to surprise so many people in 2016,

116
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.690
he listened to what many people consider was what

117
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.890
was, um, just knowledge. There was no signal.

118
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.920
And what he had was exactly that model overage,

119
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.500
that Midwestern distress,

120
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.010
the 20 years of the industrialization, the neglect,

121
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.310
the abomination effect in cities, that means all the, it was,

122
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:13.690
they are supply chains and the popped in the communities, and that was there,

123
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:15.850
but the Democrats were not able to receive the signal.

124
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.980
They just were completely deaf towards it.

125
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.140
And Trump intuitively knew that it was there.

126
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:23.320
So he went down and he did the most important thing you can do when there are

127
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:26.110
claims of model outreach, which is, he gave recognition.

128
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.440
He recognized that he said, I am your voice. I hear you.

129
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.910
Then he effortlessly pivots travels down to Arizona or East Texas,

130
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.840
and started going on about Mexicans being rapists. So what is he doing there?

131
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.440
He's using the other side of this, which is a non-regular,

132
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.810
which is using that type of outreach to weaponize it and to what we call

133
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:48.100
the energy of tribes.

134
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.550
And that's basically what politicians do with that type of anger.

135
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:55.180
You can push it in a direction where there's information from the model

136
00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:57.970
outreach, which is legitimate and needs to be listened to,

137
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:03.130
or you can weaponize it by identifying another and creating your own

138
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:06.940
tribe in that sense. And you can jump very quickly from football finds,

139
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:09.700
policing their own to essentially the Trump call,

140
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:11.830
if you're not a lot of form of right wing populism.

141
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.923
<v 3>Mm Hmm.</v>

142
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.790
And I want to talk about the quote that you start the book with. Um,

143
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.910
you quote, Winston Churchill, quote,

144
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.960
a man is about as big as the things that make him angry.

145
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.860
Why did you choose that to open the book? Um,

146
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.570
Eric sure.

147
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.340
<v 1>Well, it's a very astute observation, um, as a quote,</v>

148
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.680
because the, we kind of,

149
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.940
if you take this idea of public anger, having these two faces,

150
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.760
um, and indeed private anger, what makes you angry? Uh,

151
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.110
tell us something about your character, right. Um, and,

152
00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:56.040
and so this whole point of the, the functioning as human beings.

153
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.800
<v 2>That anger serves anger serves multiple functions.</v>

154
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.380
And one of the important functions is this whole point about recognition of an

155
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:05.220
injustice.

156
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.580
And this dates all the way back to Aristotle the Greek Greek philosophers

157
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.140
thought anger was an appropriate emotion because it identified an

158
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:14.370
ethical wrongdoing.

159
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.870
And what I find so interesting about this and why it's such a perceptive concept

160
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.850
is there's a great YouTube video at the moment with Cornell West, um,

161
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.730
who I think, I think he's at Princeton now anyway, but sort of,

162
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.840
who's been a long time intellectual advocate of the civil rights movement.

163
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.370
And he, he actually says he's being interviewed on CNN and he pretty much says,

164
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:39.750
what would it say about our society if people weren't protesting.

165
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.610
Right. And that's exactly that, that, that Greek idea,

166
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.190
which is you're supposed to get our anger angry.

167
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.290
So in the ways that Churchill said it,

168
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.920
ironically in this context that it should be a Churchill quote, um,

169
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.700
it's appropriate that people are affronted, uh,

170
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.090
by these acts of injustice and violence. Um,

171
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.600
but having said that in the sense that it's the measure of your character, the,

172
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.910
the, the anger of tribes, and this is really, really important. I mean, again,

173
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:12.360
if you read some of the social psychology literature on the history of this,

174
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.950
you know, sporting events in the ancient times, and,

175
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:20.790
and in recent events as well, can turn very quickly to violence,

176
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.900
brutal violence. And that is indicative. We have to be really,

177
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:28.230
really careful about this tribal rage. You know, it is,

178
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:30.870
it is an age old evolved instinct,

179
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.550
which is a precursor to violence. And that's why the bit that we are very,

180
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:40.110
very concerned about is how politicians are exploiting this to

181
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.000
motivate what are minorities,

182
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.710
but a minority identity regulators in order to tactically win elections.

183
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.960
And that's a very important strain and dimension to what we're,

184
00:10:50.961 --> 00:10:52.650
we're trying to analyze and understand.

185
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.940
<v 3>Hmm. So Mike, is that why you chose the quote?</v>

186
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.780
<v 1>And it shows the quote.</v>

187
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.250
I saw the quote when he put it up and I thought that works. Let's go.

188
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.110
<v 3>I can already tell why you QR success. So coauthors, okay. Let me move into,</v>

189
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.580
um, some of the analysis of the, um,

190
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.210
the anger that you are very well articulate in the book.

191
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.160
Let me just ask you what makes this anger that you described different. Now,

192
00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:28.430
you say there has been long discontent with politicians.

193
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.690
It reminds me of a joke. How do you know a politician is lying?

194
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.980
His lips are moving.

195
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:39.740
So what causes angry male mix to recur from time to time and why

196
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:40.730
now, Mark?

197
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.610
<v 1>So the middle of the book is basically structured as macro angry autonomics and</v>

198
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.640
micro genomics. And there's lots of people,

199
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.380
the sort of the causal story in the book, if you want to use that language. Um,

200
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.410
basically what we see is there's been a kind of train wreck,

201
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.480
which has been suppressed. All right.

202
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.410
And let me briefly explain what I mean by that. We use this analogy as you know,

203
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:05.890
in the book of capitalism, as hardware and software, just like a computer.

204
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.671
And over time,

205
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:10.660
basically incompatibilities build up between the economic ideas and rules

206
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:13.420
governing the system and the name of the system itself.

207
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:16.000
And it crushes and periodically we've seen that.

208
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:19.240
So the very first big crash was the end of the gold standard for the great

209
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:20.074
depression.

210
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.110
Then there was the crash of the seven days of the crisis of inflation and

211
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:26.920
profitability. And both of those times there were systematic reset.

212
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:31.450
So if we think about all of the activity done by humans and the thought is it

213
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.930
was everything from the new deal in Swedish, social democracy,

214
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.260
the German fascism, huge attempts to institutionally re-engineer the economist.

215
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.890
When you get to the seven is it's less romantic, but it's just this fundamental,

216
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.850
it's the whole tunnel towards the market, privatized integrate liberalized,

217
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.580
globalize, the whole thing, and write a whole new software code.

218
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.230
The big hardware,

219
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.870
most of the generation of the seventies and eighties was of course,

220
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.800
independent central box and not becomes crucial because the bug in the software

221
00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:01.000
for the 1980s is inequality, which is largely filled in by credit.

222
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.850
We have an enormous credit crunch in 2008. That should have been like the 1970s,

223
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.680
or should it be been a fundamental hardware and software reset,

224
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.610
but there wasn't the central banks just poured liquidity into the service,

225
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.220
then brought it back to life. Well, when you do that,

226
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:19.480
particularly with started this based upon boosting asset values and an already

227
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:23.110
highly unequal skewed society of asset holders,

228
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.440
then there are tons of the asset holders increases and everyone else gets

229
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:27.490
increasingly squeezed.

230
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.600
Then you bought them with a couple of years of austerity and variable growth

231
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.940
building on top of wage stagnation,

232
00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:36.160
which has been going on in some cases for a generation.

233
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.290
And you finally get to a cracking point.

234
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:41.860
You get to a point where the volatility constraint of just adding more credit to

235
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:43.750
the system begins to crack.

236
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.040
And this is why we describe populous in a sense is called writer's albeit quote

237
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.080
on quote, quote writers,

238
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.690
because they are trying to write a new UI for the system.

239
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:54.460
They realize the system is broken,

240
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.970
but they're unable to articulate a coherent if you will,

241
00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.440
software pockets to fix it.

242
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.820
So that's basically why now it's a series of outer as buffer outliers that have

243
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:07.870
been building up over time. There was a crash, there was a bot fix,

244
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.730
and now that bad fix is coming apart.

245
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.820
<v 3>And Eric, I'm gonna ask you, um,</v>

246
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.970
the you've already done this already in terms of differentiation

247
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.440
differentiating, um, some of the different types of anger. Um,

248
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.990
can you just say that more about tribalism?

249
00:14:24.991 --> 00:14:29.940
So in the book you described tribalism as the reason why football fans will

250
00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:34.830
travel and watch their team play regardless of the weather. Um, you,

251
00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:39.330
then you also see the nationalism is the modern national form of

252
00:14:39.331 --> 00:14:41.130
political tribalism,

253
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.510
what causes tribal identity, um,

254
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.180
which can become quite an angry Nomics.

255
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.070
<v 1>I mean, this is, it's really fascinating, Linda. I mean, if you.</v>

256
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.870
<v 2>Look at the literature in social psychology,</v>

257
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:55.610
there was research that's been done.

258
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.840
That's very well established now in the 1960s, which was effectively the,

259
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.111
the,

260
00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:06.020
the minimum groups paradigm and which was looking at this whole issue about

261
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.550
what caused tribal identities and what forms, what,

262
00:15:09.551 --> 00:15:12.800
what triggers could cause human beings to form groups.

263
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.690
And it is frightening our propensity to break into groups

264
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.820
and that we will make groups based on utterly trivial distinctions,

265
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.620
um, and our sense of group identity and our behavior as a group,

266
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:32.030
even based on really spurious premises. Okay. So for example, they took,

267
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.640
um, classrooms of children and divided them into which one preferred the

268
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.670
two abstract expression is play and Kandinsky, you know,

269
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:44.870
which are two too abstract expressionists, Russian artists.

270
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.440
And you separate in a room full of children based on which their preferences.

271
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.293
Um, and,

272
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.290
and you would literally get both group identity and potentially even wrongdoing

273
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:55.460
towards the other group.

274
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.910
And these studies have been reinforced now where they've even done it with

275
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:03.140
neuroscience where, um, they've done experiments,

276
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:06.560
which based on, they will just say you are part of group a,

277
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.910
you are parts of group B where it has no character juristics,

278
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.470
but your sense of allegiance affects you. And it affects our decision-making.

279
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.820
I mean, it, it, it is, it is a very,

280
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:21.250
very interesting let's put it like that.

281
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.010
Now it's clearly functional because groups are,

282
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.220
are more successful than individuals ultimately. Um,

283
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.580
but it has very dangerous dimensions to it quite clearly as well.

284
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:35.390
So our propensity, our willingness to create the other as it were, uh,

285
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.970
appears to be very, very deeply hardwired.

286
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.270
And the innovation I think in,

287
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.500
in our book is to identify the role that anger pays in this, because that, to,

288
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.980
to my knowledge in the literature, we don't find identification of this.

289
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.450
So people are aware in the literature angle that angry fat that fans get angry,

290
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.180
but they haven't made this link that says,

291
00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.310
actually it appears to be the case that most of us don't wander around

292
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:05.450
obsessing about our national identity all the time. But you can,

293
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.570
you can switch on this little minority of, of,

294
00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:12.170
of individuals who can kind of trigger a very strong sense.

295
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.540
And once it's brought to our attention,

296
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.700
it's like everybody turns a certain color or shade. Um,

297
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.750
and as, so this propensity is a hard wire. It's a very,

298
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.280
very powerful propensity.

299
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.940
<v 1>Yeah. I just thought to that two things,</v>

300
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.820
one of them is a great example that not seeing to lab [inaudible],

301
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.630
which is why is all orange juice in the U S culture?

302
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.610
And this is basically the point about the intense preferences of minorities.

303
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.080
You could go to the pro, you could go and make another plant, just do kosher,

304
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.930
but that would be prohibitively expensive, given the numbers.

305
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.400
So you might as well just make like all kosher, right? So in a sense,

306
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.340
my knowledge intense minority preferences tend to win out.

307
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:56.070
So that's built into it too, but the other side of it,

308
00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:59.970
and this is what I want to talk about. The micro decided this micro economics,

309
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.290
we basically talk about humans dealing with uncertainty. Now, you know,

310
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:08.100
as economists, we'd all taught to think that Rusk is uncertainty singularly,

311
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:09.900
not, and by uncertainty,

312
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:13.440
we mean that basically the state of the probability distribution is no guidance.

313
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.300
So you can have plans. You can think, you know, we can do it.

314
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.220
It's about like Basta investing in an accounting degree,

315
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.940
and then waking up in the world of turbo tax, right? Suddenly you're redundant.

316
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.290
And what the case we make in the book is the combination of aging societies on

317
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.040
more and more advanced technologies, digital technologies, platforming,

318
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:35.040
et cetera, has made people more uncertain about the future.

319
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:38.580
And in a fundamental sense, they feel that they cannot control their lives.

320
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.140
So if you are in these very real economic stresses generated by macro crashes,

321
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.900
and then you add these micro stresses to this,

322
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.150
then put in what addicts been talking about.

323
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.260
That's that whole nexus that generates an angry response.

324
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.670
That's how that comes about.

325
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.830
And basically we find ourselves defaulting into tribalism or Klein or

326
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:00.450
whatever electric, if you want to use for it,

327
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.190
because that gives us the sense of stability that the world denies us,

328
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.740
we'll live in a world. We can increasingly not control,

329
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.820
but we have this illusion that we can control through these not attempts that we

330
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:16.020
construct about Trump or, or, or, you know, I'm a Bernie I,

331
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:20.040
or I am a fortune conspiracy theorist or whatever, an anti-vaxxer,

332
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.630
whatever floats your boat,

333
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.920
but we're kind of subjectively trying to create through these groups.

334
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.130
Do these value in tanks groups are very much based upon everybody else being

335
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.800
wrong, a sense of control in our own lives.

336
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.640
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. In terms of your micro stressors, that really, I think helps, um,</v>

337
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:43.250
just kind of fill out, um, how that feeds into, um, the macro picture,

338
00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:47.480
especially around private anger. Now you differentiate, um,

339
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.750
tribalism from legitimate anger. Uh,

340
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.350
you define that as moral outrage. So in that chapter,

341
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.150
you two discuss referendums as a chance for the Electra to show their anger and

342
00:19:59.151 --> 00:20:01.460
vote against those in charge.

343
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.440
So why do we also see more moral anger now? Um,

344
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.970
by the way, I love that to coding and crushing explanation, which,

345
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.070
which I'm sure you just about to mention just now.

346
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.840
<v 1>Not only that we have, we're going to release a cartoon that explains it.</v>

347
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:22.040
So you can, I'll send that to you and pass that around. That's in crashes,

348
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.620
I guess it's our claim would not really be that it's not like we're measuring

349
00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:29.120
the frequency and quantity of,

350
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.600
of moral outrage and trying to say there's more now than there has been

351
00:20:32.601 --> 00:20:35.420
historically I don't, we wouldn't be really making that claim.

352
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.620
What we're intrigued rather is,

353
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.390
is trying to understand the form of moral outrage that we're observing

354
00:20:44.391 --> 00:20:48.100
currently. Um, because as, as Mark describes.

355
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.100
<v 2>This kind of history of forms of capitalism,</v>

356
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:55.810
and we should get them to talk through it where you you've kind of had three

357
00:20:55.811 --> 00:21:00.190
types of capitalism, and whenever we've had these crashes in the economy,

358
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:04.780
we've had manifestations of moral outrage. Um, but, but if you think about it,

359
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:06.460
it becomes, you know,

360
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:09.520
in many ways it's really clear to us what's happening in the current

361
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:13.120
environment. And I think this is the kind of optimistic element of the book.

362
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.860
So one really important theme that we have is part of the

363
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:22.060
reason that we're seeing tribalism exploited by the political elite elites is

364
00:21:22.061 --> 00:21:26.340
that we lack motivating ethical ideology. So,

365
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.730
so we lack, uh, political ideologies that people can be motivated by,

366
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.220
by which they think are going to positively change their societies.

367
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.540
And, and th the moral questions that we're all concerned about are about the

368
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:41.980
sustainability of the planet.

369
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.680
<v 3>Uh.</v>

370
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.220
<v 2>Out the scale of inequality. I think, whatever your perspective</v>

371
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.910
have you sit on a political [inaudible] as well,

372
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.050
concentrated in the hands of the population is clearly not very functional.

373
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.380
So we have, we have moral outrage over the climate.

374
00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:03.300
We have moral outrage over inequality,

375
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.550
and I think the other very important factor,

376
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.990
which is pertinent to current economic environment is recessions.

377
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.150
So what we're really trying to say is we need real solutions to the

378
00:22:15.151 --> 00:22:19.530
problem of recession, global sustainability, um,

379
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.590
and these, and these really need to be addressed.

380
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:26.850
And that's the source of moral outrage that we're currently experiencing.

381
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.610
<v 3>Mark. Before I start to ask you, why don't you give sort of, um,</v>

382
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.740
uh, the kind of, uh, overview as it were, um,

383
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.630
about how you want to kind of tie this together with these big picture items

384
00:22:42.631 --> 00:22:46.770
before we move to your proposals for how to change.

385
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:48.061
<v 1>I mean,</v>

386
00:22:48.061 --> 00:22:51.570
essentially we have three versions of carbon Elysium kind of gold standard

387
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:53.640
capitalism based upon openness.

388
00:22:53.641 --> 00:22:58.080
And then we had a much more restricted national form of capitalism where people

389
00:22:58.081 --> 00:23:00.270
made cars and their kids, and at least swap them.

390
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.440
And then that created an inflationary crisis. I think I'd rather go back.

391
00:23:04.441 --> 00:23:07.200
If I may though, to what Alec was just talking about, about, you know,

392
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:10.200
legitimate, I'm going to let's put something very concrete and recent and give,

393
00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:12.510
so we can solidify in people's minds, right?

394
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.970
Let's think about what's happened in the COVID crisis.

395
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.780
So under the COVID crisis, basically the world central bank,

396
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.140
which is the fed for better or worse has come out and said,

397
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.380
don't worry if you're an asset holder, we've got your back, right?

398
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.850
If you a company and you spent billions, literally billions by button on shares,

399
00:23:29.851 --> 00:23:34.740
and you have no cash, we've got your back, you've got ETFs,

400
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.380
we'll buy them, but at least we'll make a commitment to,

401
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.980
we will cut every falling knife because you're our constituents,

402
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.010
your normal worker screw year, you might get a check every three months.

403
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.140
So what's behind the model.

404
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:52.100
Outrage is the cemetery of the perk there's been put upon people,

405
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.320
and this is increasing through time.

406
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.890
So just as prices are getting by to be time and more expensive,

407
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:02.030
every time there's more and more re-insurance for those that can best weather

408
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:05.660
the crisis. Whereas those who actually are the least protected,

409
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:09.950
think 18 million Americans who are hourly workers with no

410
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:13.250
statutory sick pay, valuable or rights art,

411
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.990
well hire and fire possession mainly concentrated in high touch,

412
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.250
low productivity, low skill, low paid jobs. That's,

413
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:23.840
who's really paying the brunt of this.

414
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.490
So when they watch Boeing get 50 billion like this,

415
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.290
when they watch banks have taken bets on mortgages, get billed out like this,

416
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.460
when they're constantly told there's no money to relieve student loans or for

417
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.620
raising minimum wages and the fed can magic trillions and an afternoon,

418
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.620
why would you not be modeling outraged by that?

419
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.850
<v 3>Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Um,</v>

420
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.410
and that's a good point for us to think about what do we do about it because you

421
00:24:56.411 --> 00:25:01.030
do spend, um, the last part of your book with some really interesting, uh,

422
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.500
propose though. So, um, on the proposals to make us less angry,

423
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.770
let's go through some of them. We won't get through all of them. Um,

424
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.860
but I'm intrigued by this national wealth fund,

425
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:17.050
which provides assets to those who, um, who have none. Um,

426
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.790
Eric, do you want to, uh, talk us through that? So what, so.

427
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.110
<v 2>I have identified these three legitimate areas of concern,</v>

428
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.780
which are relevant to all of us in our societies

429
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.470
and where there is a very, very strong cross-party consensus,

430
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.340
which is we have to do something about the sustainability of our planet.

431
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.780
We have to tackle wealth inequality, and we have to try and bring recessions,

432
00:25:43.781 --> 00:25:47.890
keep recessions as, as short, um,

433
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.540
as possible causing as least damage as possible. So inequality,

434
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.670
there is a very, very strong consensus,

435
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.120
but there is no real consensus about what to do about it, right?

436
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.530
And one of the kind of benchmarks we gave ourselves is we said, right,

437
00:26:02.531 --> 00:26:06.100
we need real policies that can tackle these problems quickly,

438
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:11.890
that will be effective. Um, and that are simple to explain, right?

439
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:12.610
Um,

440
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.570
now the idea of a national and we want to national wealth fund significantly to

441
00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:20.020
try and tackle wealth inequality. And the challenge there is,

442
00:26:20.021 --> 00:26:21.790
there is a very simple one, which is to say,

443
00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:26.170
how can we give ownership of assets to the

444
00:26:26.171 --> 00:26:30.280
large majority of our population were very insignificant levels of asset

445
00:26:30.281 --> 00:26:33.340
ownership because in an increasingly uncertain world,

446
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.400
asset ownership helps you in terms of the quality of your life.

447
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.550
And so one of the interesting things,

448
00:26:39.551 --> 00:26:41.200
and we have to get into a bit of economics here,

449
00:26:41.201 --> 00:26:44.250
but one of the most defining of our current.

450
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.350
<v 4>Economy, and you will as an economist,</v>

451
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:50.760
but we'll be aware well aware of this lender is how low the real cost of capital

452
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:55.170
is to the State right now. What does that mean?

453
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.230
It means that the British government today, for example,

454
00:26:58.231 --> 00:27:00.780
can borrow for 30 years at negative real interest rates.

455
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:04.680
That means the private sector is paying the government to borrow right now,

456
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.890
all of us economists are pulling out our hair because we're tearing our hair

457
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:10.890
out, going, why on earth? Aren't we doing lots of investment spending,

458
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.610
because all you need to do is generate a positive return on your investment.

459
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.520
And that actually strengthens the state balance sheet, right?

460
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:21.030
So there's no issue about the net assets of the state go up.

461
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.690
If you borrow negative real, and you invest the positive way, right?

462
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:27.870
That's just finance. That's just arithmetic. It's the law of arithmetic.

463
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:31.170
You can't disagree with. So what Mark and I are saying is, well,

464
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.580
if the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund can generate a 6% return, uh,

465
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.500
over 20 years or Harvard's endowment can, or the welcome trust in the UK,

466
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.940
we have all of these charities, independent organizations,

467
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.110
sovereign wealth funds. Why can the British government, the Irish government,

468
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.180
the German government, the American government,

469
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:53.430
why can't we all do this as a state? You know,

470
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.680
and the answer is we could easily do it.

471
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.690
We could issue 15% of GDP tomorrow in the bond market,

472
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.550
we could buy a diversified, diversified basket of global assets.

473
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.600
And then by virtue of the arithmetic over 15 or 20 years,

474
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:12.780
you can repay the debt and you've got the assets and we could,

475
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.630
we could distribute within within 18 months,

476
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:20.310
we could distribute 15% of GDP to people in the economy who have no assets

477
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:21.144
currently.

478
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.960
And then they would be able to participate in share in the creation of national

479
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:29.700
wealth. The idea really is that simple. And it's very difficult,

480
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:32.340
actually. I don't think we've heard a compelling counter argument.

481
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:38.630
<v 3>Hm Hm. Mm. And I think one, uh,</v>

482
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.470
maybe Michael,

483
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.110
pick this out and maybe you could pick that up the line with your second

484
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:45.830
proposal, which is to revise the fiscal rules to financing like the green,

485
00:28:45.831 --> 00:28:50.660
new deal. One objection. People always have is you're adding to the debt,

486
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.620
um, for both of those things. So Mark, I'll just let you handle that.

487
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.940
<v 4>Sure. I mean, you don't have to go full modern monetary theory,</v>

488
00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.630
but they do make a very bad again, test and in simple point about this,

489
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.120
and then I I'll give you an example of this. I,

490
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.660
I occasionally talked to the U S Navy. I can't tell you why it stops.

491
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.890
I occasionally talk to you as Navy and I have a room full of officers.

492
00:29:12.891 --> 00:29:17.510
And I said to them who fixed the national debt? And I said,

493
00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:20.510
if you could, at the stroke of a pen console, the national debt tomato,

494
00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:23.360
would you do it? And everyone said, yes, is that congratulations, gentlemen,

495
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.910
you've just destroyed. America's national savings.

496
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.840
It's the other side of the balance sheet.

497
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.060
We only have a focus on one side of the balance sheet.

498
00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.520
If you're in a negative real environment,

499
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.680
you're able to generate savings assets. That should be a good thing.

500
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.190
And a world of uncertainty, no one.

501
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.950
<v 1>Ever forces anyone to buy bonds.</v>

502
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.190
The auctions never fail. And yet,

503
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:52.720
somehow this is the terrible burden that we're giving interest, bearing assets,

504
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.760
the people and the negative real and bottom.

505
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.180
So I just think that that's nonsense to stuff, right.

506
00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.320
Let me say a little bit more though, and see if this is useful.

507
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.250
I started to think about the backend of the book, not as policies,

508
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.790
cause I hate that word because it's too technocratic and it doesn't sound to a

509
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:12.090
politics. It's not under the old view. We're not saying mine,

510
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.400
antibiotic agent follow out. I can Mark. At least not yet. Um,

511
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.640
I think of these things I was following at show, and here's what I mean by this.

512
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.480
If you have a group of people in a room, how you arrange the furniture,

513
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.120
but arguably determine what type of evening they're going to have.

514
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.400
So if I think of what we're arguing for, independent fiscal councils,

515
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.260
the technical very techie stuff,

516
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:34.870
like negative rates and the fuel rates that I can talk about.

517
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.830
But this is simple to understand stuff like a data dividend that forms the basis

518
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:41.710
of a kind of quasi UBI. If we do this as well,

519
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.910
fund and margin will happens if you just have that in the economy, right?

520
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:49.660
Basically every election then changes its dynamics in terms of,

521
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.620
we now have new bits of furniture there, which shape our politics.

522
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.850
And that's what I think is actually really important,

523
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.640
but it's proposal beyond what they do.

524
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.660
The hopefully are able to be supported by both the left thumb,

525
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.010
the right and the by others, and will be seen as assets for society as a whole.

526
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:06.761
And if you do that,

527
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:09.790
you change the furniture in the room and you change the type of party you can

528
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:12.640
have. And I think that that's really important.

529
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.150
<v 0>Mm. Yeah. It's just a great way of sort of capturing, um,</v>

530
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.750
so much of what you mean, uh, furniture, coding, computers,

531
00:31:21.751 --> 00:31:23.030
crashing cell phones.

532
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.921
<v 1>[Inaudible] this is true.</v>

533
00:31:28.921 --> 00:31:31.530
My wife often says that I really shouldn't have been in academic.

534
00:31:31.531 --> 00:31:34.550
I should have been an advertising copywriter. Got it. So maybe she's right.

535
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.100
<v 0>Your wife of course is always right. Yeah.</v>

536
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.100
<v 1>Yes, of course. Once she gets [inaudible].</v>

537
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.490
<v 0>Excellent. Um, we, um,</v>

538
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.950
we wanted to have to go through all the proposals,

539
00:31:46.951 --> 00:31:49.380
but I just want to pick out a few that I thought, um,

540
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.790
just to spend a few moments on, um, towards the end of our discussion.

541
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:58.500
So Mark mentioned there, the data dividend. Um, alright.

542
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.260
What is the daily Ted dividend? Um.

543
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.640
<v 2>Well the data dividend here is, I mean, again,</v>

544
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.840
so a common theme amongst all of the policies really is to try and

545
00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:15.840
either broaden distribution or access to income and cash flows in

546
00:32:15.841 --> 00:32:20.520
different situations for households and also to try and change due to broaden

547
00:32:20.521 --> 00:32:24.380
the distribution of, of, of wealth to give people more protection. Um,

548
00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:29.130
and the data dividend is a really simple idea, which is we have the,

549
00:32:29.131 --> 00:32:33.990
these huge technology companies who are making incredibly profitable.

550
00:32:33.991 --> 00:32:36.600
They have monopolistic characteristics. Um,

551
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.800
they're not simple monopolies in the old sense because a lot of what they

552
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.250
provide.

553
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.190
<v 4>Is free, but they certainly have monopolistic characteristics.</v>

554
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.360
The interesting thing is that almost their acid base,

555
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.740
what gives them this value is in fact ours, which is it's our data.

556
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.010
And all we're really suggesting is, um,

557
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:59.930
why don't we enforce some of our property rights over that data and we could

558
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:04.130
effectively auction our data. So if we recognize that as a community,

559
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.840
we have a huge amount of valuable data.

560
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:10.460
And so we're going to auction it in the same way that we auction spectrum to

561
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.940
mobile telephony companies. Um, and as a consequence of that,

562
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:16.610
that then gives us an asset that we can distribute.

563
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.100
And this is a way of trying to, you know,

564
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:22.220
we've thought an awful lot about these ideas of universal basic income.

565
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.860
And we've thought that this is a way which a lot of this is about framing and

566
00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:30.800
economic policy and the criticism of universal basic income is it's kind of

567
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:32.810
something for nothing. Well, this is a

568
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.700
which people are resistant to something that you own and just getting paid for

569
00:33:39.701 --> 00:33:43.180
it, um, which lands very differently in terms of how people perceive it.

570
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.480
I would just add onto that again,

571
00:33:46.481 --> 00:33:49.300
let's bring it into the current moment because I think this proposal is suddenly

572
00:33:49.301 --> 00:33:53.380
become more relevant. Um, obviously you both know, um,

573
00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:58.060
there's an effort to try and get a global minimum corporate tax and also to

574
00:33:58.061 --> 00:34:02.470
basically move on from base erosion to basically taxing sales,

575
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.520
rather than declared profits to have all the double Irish and all this nonsense

576
00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.030
and the Americans last week pulled the plugs on it and they pulled the plug on

577
00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:12.220
it because guess what? It's their tech company.

578
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.220
So there's basically said to them, you don't get to talk so tech,

579
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:18.100
but you get to use Octa. So if you try and talk,

580
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.240
saw tech companies will put tarps on you. This is where we are. All right.

581
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:24.220
So that's a tough one, but how about the following?

582
00:34:24.221 --> 00:34:27.400
Then we refuse to give you the data, right?

583
00:34:27.401 --> 00:34:29.380
You basically know we'll talk to you another way.

584
00:34:29.381 --> 00:34:32.410
If you want pay a tax for what you provide as a service,

585
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.720
then we will not allow you input data for your profit and you need

586
00:34:37.721 --> 00:34:41.410
to buy it from us. So you can get the team. The effect is that always see detox,

587
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.220
but do it in such a way that you're actually benefiting your citizens at the

588
00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:47.770
same time, rather than just raising a bundle of revenue.

589
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:54.820
<v 0>And Eric, you've got a number of other fascinating proposals in there, um,</v>

590
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.000
that, um, Mark has already touched upon. Um,

591
00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.040
I'm actually just going to give you free reign.

592
00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:02.350
Is there another one that you want to highlight?

593
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.790
<v 4>Can I, can I go with this one that I really care about a lot? Well,</v>

594
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.130
which is related to a green new deal, you know,

595
00:35:09.131 --> 00:35:13.690
and this is where I really really think, uh, you know, we,

596
00:35:13.691 --> 00:35:18.340
we all have a moral obligation to do something about this, right? Um,

597
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.290
so because I actually think that the whole challenge of sustainability

598
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.220
is solves our economic problem. It's been presented the other way around, right?

599
00:35:27.221 --> 00:35:29.860
People go, Oh my God, we've got this huge challenge of climate change.

600
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.020
What are we going to do? It's going to require huge sacrifices.

601
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.060
I viewed completely the other way round,

602
00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.850
which is thank God we have this great to do loads and loads of

603
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:40.800
investments spending because I actually,

604
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:44.870
our economic system is crying out for investment spending. You know, what,

605
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.710
what now? What do I mean by that? Well, I mean,

606
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.050
it goes back to this point about where interest rates are.

607
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.300
We seem to be concerned by the fact that central banks have zero interest rates,

608
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.220
and we show how to do this in the book. But if you use Juul interest rates,

609
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.470
which the European central bank has started to do,

610
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.800
which is if you leave the interest rate on deposits on chain for you to even

611
00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:09.270
raise it, and you cut the rate of interest on lending and targeted lending,

612
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.410
this is rocket fuel. But the key point is nobody is onto this.

613
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:17.940
And nobody is saying, how do we target this, these loans? Now, if you said,

614
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.560
I'm going to give the private sector 15 year loans at

615
00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:26.820
minus 2% to finance green energy investment,

616
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.450
you will make our economy sustainable within 15 years. I mean, that is just,

617
00:36:31.451 --> 00:36:35.220
that is as close a thing in economics to a certainty and we can do it

618
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.450
if he likes to deal with interest rates. There you go.

619
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.480
<v 0>I got that sense, Mark. I'm going to give you the same, open-ended um,</v>

620
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.380
kind of final question before I sort of wrap up, um, which is.

621
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:51.830
<v 4>What do you want us to take away.</v>

622
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.190
<v 0>Um, to become less angry about the world.</v>

623
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.130
<v 4>I want to go back to the formal, external knowledge.</v>

624
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.130
As soon as that seem to work with everyone, you know, we need,

625
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.060
we need to change.

626
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:05.300
The farmer turned around and we need to change not just the outcomes out our

627
00:37:05.301 --> 00:37:05.810
economy,

628
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:10.430
but the things that actually generate economic plans and what we are

629
00:37:10.431 --> 00:37:13.480
proposing, basically taking the tech giants on the,

630
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.660
by basically claiming property in the first place on data.

631
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:22.220
And at the same time, as you use the volatility in markets to issue debt,

632
00:37:22.221 --> 00:37:26.780
to buy off equities, to build a wealth fund, I think that parties that do this,

633
00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:28.790
particularly we can get across part of your agreement on this.

634
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.030
We will change the way that the economy operates,

635
00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.160
not just in terms of the outcomes of producers,

636
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.300
but it will create something that's more transparent.

637
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.810
It's fair that people feel that they have a stake in,

638
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.430
and that they don't volume to go back to the whole thing of honor.

639
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.250
So much of honor is about recognition.

640
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.220
And basically if you're recognized as a citizen,

641
00:37:46.221 --> 00:37:49.940
who's making a contribution by virtue of the fact that you are a citizen,

642
00:37:49.941 --> 00:37:51.500
you have a claim to a stock of wealth,

643
00:37:51.501 --> 00:37:55.370
and you also generate assets which create an income. Then, you know,

644
00:37:55.371 --> 00:37:59.340
that's a very different one from sort of hire and fire or resent,

645
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:00.561
realize neoliberal,

646
00:38:00.561 --> 00:38:03.320
capitalism that people seem to have gotten to the end of the capital.

647
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.490
<v 0>Same question to you, Eric. Um,</v>

648
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.610
in addition to [inaudible].

649
00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.093
<v 4>What is yours?</v>

650
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.860
<v 0>Oh, I got plenty more.</v>

651
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.020
<v 4>The other thing, you know, I, I w I studied economics,</v>

652
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.690
not because it's fascinating, right? I mean, it is costing me,

653
00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:28.370
but I realized that I mainly, but it, it started with moral outrage, which is,

654
00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.870
you know, recessions are extraordinarily damaging phenomenon, right?

655
00:38:32.871 --> 00:38:37.840
If we look at so many social traumas are caused by with session, um,

656
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.210
it causes huge, huge human suffering.

657
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.310
And I find that absolutely on forgivable that the economics profession hasn't

658
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:50.260
got an agreed kind of. So, you know, COVID hits, you can't predict a pandemic,

659
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.290
but we're not surprised that there's a recession. We get, we,

660
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.460
we typically get one at least once a decade on average. Um,

661
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:01.570
so why weren't we prepared? Right? And I find this infuriating,

662
00:39:01.571 --> 00:39:05.350
and I find that also infuriating that the system we've become reliant on,

663
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:06.370
which is central banks,

664
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:09.790
cutting interest rates is an accident of institutional history.

665
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:13.290
The only reason we have central banks cutting interest rates in response to

666
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.830
recession is because central banks were set up in the 17 and 18 hundreds to

667
00:39:17.831 --> 00:39:20.530
provide liquidity to the banking system and the finance government.

668
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.050
That's why they do asset purchases and good interest rates.

669
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.260
It is clearly not the optimal way to run monetary policy.

670
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.840
And one of the proposals we make in the book, which is,

671
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:33.040
is becoming acceptable as an idea,

672
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.550
is let's give central banks the power to transfer directly to your bank account.

673
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.420
So when there's a recession, it's really simple, you support everybody's income.

674
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.460
And then when the recession goes away,

675
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:45.730
you stop supporting their income and wages pick up on the rest of the economy.

676
00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:50.150
The private sector takes over. It's really simple. And it,

677
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.650
all of the evidence we have is that it works because it's,

678
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.820
it's actually not empirically any different to doing a combination of

679
00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:01.420
quantitative easing and tax and tax rebates.

680
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.630
And if you look at the empirical evidence on it, that is a much,

681
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:09.190
much better supporter of our consumption and spending in our economy,

682
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:13.210
then all of this quantitative easing and all of these other, you know,

683
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.590
pyrotechnics that, that central banks from engaging.

684
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.830
So I think we need to start messing around and set up a system where the bank of

685
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:22.750
England, the fed the bank of Japan,

686
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.790
European central bank can have a meeting tomorrow.

687
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:29.560
And the day after every adult, citizen has a thousand euros, you know,

688
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:32.620
or thousand dollars pounds in their bank account.

689
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:36.100
And you do that whilst unemployment persists, and you do more,

690
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.050
if you need to get the economy going,

691
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.860
and then you stop it when the economy is booming, it's as simple as that.

692
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.030
<v 0>Um, we could go on, but we are out of time. Um,</v>

693
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.610
but I'm going to squeeze in one final question to Mark,

694
00:40:50.611 --> 00:40:53.880
because I really contrast this. So, um, Eric,

695
00:40:53.881 --> 00:40:57.270
you gave a lovely acknowledgement to your family and friends,

696
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:05.520
Mark, uh, Mark acknowledge, Mark.

697
00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:10.500
You acknowledge your wife's steadfast refusal to engage with anything that you

698
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.840
write. And perhaps this book may prove to be the exception. Was it?

699
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.760
Yes. It wants you read the book. He's not alone either.

700
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.340
I ignored.

701
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.990
<v 4>Everything he says until this book came out.</v>

702
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.650
<v 0>Pretty much just ignored. So</v>

703
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.070
reflecting on life more than anything else.

704
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.310
<v 1>I mean, it's one of those things I said to him. I was like,</v>

705
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:40.760
how can I acknowledge in the book when you never read that as well? You know,

706
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:44.480
I listened to you all day, do I have to acknowledge nonsense? He talk all day.

707
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:48.500
It's a fair enough point. So that was the acknowledgement. But no,

708
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:49.334
she actually did.

709
00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:55.420
<v 0>I have to say that's probably the best endorsement for a book I have heard in a</v>

710
00:41:55.421 --> 00:41:59.410
very long time. Thank you very much to,

711
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:04.120
to Mark and to Eric for your thought provoking book and green now mix.

712
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.340
Now I urge everyone to pick up a copy because the title is angry and I'll

713
00:42:09.341 --> 00:42:09.611
mix,

714
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:14.380
but after you read it and you will feel less angry because are creative ideas

715
00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.510
for moving forward. So thank you to, uh, for the stimulating book, um,

716
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.760
enjoyed the discussion. Um,

717
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:26.230
