WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.370
<v 1>So after depressive for yest, well,</v>

2
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:14.150
we've had emotional foil bullish Kate,

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.440
and now we're going to go on to Peter Hitchins

4
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.860
member of the international socialists,

5
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.050
not now until 1975 columnist

6
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.030
for the mail I throw.

7
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:32.780
He thought you were extremely a Trotskyite

8
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.280
colonists for do walk up. As I'm talking on the mail on Sunday,

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.630
occasional broadcaster and author of several books,

10
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:46.280
most recently the phony victory and, uh,

11
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.190
attracted to both parties, uh,

12
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.860
but now belongs to none at all.

13
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.070
Peter Hitchins lift our spirits.

14
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.710
<v 2>Yeah. Uh, good evening. Uh,</v>

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.800
I I'm here actually swayed you to the virtues of gloom

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.180
and this, this, this, this, this, uh, Kate's, uh,

17
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.700
optimism is a SOC optimism is a,

18
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.200
is a terrible code for living and one's always ended on happiness.

19
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:16.310
It's being pessimistic. That keeps me so cheerful. Uh,

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.890
I want to, I want to, first of all,

21
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.270
explain to you exactly why it is you should adopt gloom. Um,

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.520
by saying it was a brief story about, uh,

23
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.680
a welder working late at night in one of the old shipyards we used to have in

24
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:35.030
Clydebank and no longer do working so late that he was probably the last person

25
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.350
in the dark working on our other precarious piece of scaffolding on the side of

26
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.010
perhaps an ocean liner. And as he prepared to leave,

27
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.840
suddenly the scaffolding gave way beneath him. And he fell many,

28
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:52.280
many fees until eventually he grabbed onto the side of the dock and below him,

29
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.780
perhaps 200 feet of concrete and then a puddle of oily water

30
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.010
and nobody to be seen. So he called out,

31
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.800
is there anybody out there?

32
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.340
I know Voss subcultural voice came from very, very far about saying,

33
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.390
I am here my son. And he said,

34
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.590
what shall I do? And the voice said,

35
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.990
let go. And he said, is there anybody else up there?

36
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.400
I am the Sapulpa voice. I am telling you, let go,

37
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.310
let go of your illusions. Uh,

38
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.180
let go of the ridiculous fantasy that we have, that we are a rich, powerful,

39
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:40.460
important country. Uh, many years ago,

40
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:44.390
Dennis Healey said that we should probably get used to being an Island. Austria.

41
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.010
I wish that we could not look forward to anything as stable and prosperous as

42
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.230
that, but even so it might be wise if we began to understand just

43
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:57.230
how precipitous our full has been.

44
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.150
I grew up at the very of the empire. I was born in the empire.

45
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.730
I was a subject of his majesty King, George, the sixth.

46
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.480
And I was born in Malta than the headquarters of the now non-existent

47
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.790
Mediterranean fleet of the Royal Navy.

48
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.920
And I saw that the concentrates slightly in the next few minutes on two things,

49
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.990
one of them railways and the other, the Navy,

50
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.940
because they dominated so much in my childhood.

51
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.510
The Britain of those days was full of wheezing, clanking, panting,

52
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.010
steam engines with names like six Oh one squadron and Winston Churchill.

53
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.560
I've saw of much of my life,

54
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.070
great gray warships gliding in and house of Naval bases.

55
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:34.380
So I was moved by these things.

56
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.290
I would just tell a couple of brief stories here about how these things have

57
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.270
changed in not in my lifetime,

58
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:44.350
but in what you might call the recent lifetime of the country in 1,906,

59
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.910
the greatest advance in military technology of the era,

60
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.460
the construction of HMS Dreadnought,

61
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.150
the first really heavily armored heavily gun battleship,

62
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.100
which completely changed the Naval arms race.

63
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.550
And the balance of power in the world was completed in one year.

64
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.970
And one day in Portsmouth, dockyard from the laying of the keel.

65
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.040
So the finishing and launching of the ship,

66
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.810
it took 14 months before she was actually steaming in

67
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.210
19, in 2007,

68
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.560
the then labor government ordered the construction of atrium as queen Elizabeth,

69
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.790
the new aircraft carrier looking very much like a multistory carpark afloat,

70
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.040
which will be obsolete by the time, uh, sometime next year,

71
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.860
14 years after it's the United States of its construction.

72
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.250
By the time it actually obtains an aircraft,

73
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.600
that's one example and 1836,

74
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:41.470
the bill or run the act authorizing the construction of the great Western

75
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:45.970
railway from London to Bristol was passed by parliament offered longest stroll

76
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.340
immediately without any aid of JCBS or any kind of modern technology or

77
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.780
electronics in bought kingdom,

78
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.830
ruined L coop commenced to construct what was then the most advanced.

79
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:00.250
And in some ways still is the most advanced piece of railway line from London to

80
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:04.420
Bristol. It took him five years by contrast,

81
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.220
what is known to travelers like me on that line as firstly Western, uh,

82
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:12.010
began to electrify it so many years ago,

83
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:16.810
that I'd forgotten how long ago it was ran over budget to a colossal extent

84
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.520
and never finished it. These seem to me to sum up in many ways,

85
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.670
the contrast between the Britain that was and the Britain,

86
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.550
which many of us still fondly imagine we still are.

87
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.800
And the Britain that is one which was competent, effective, capable,

88
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.020
and efficient, and one which is not sloppy in capable of, of,

89
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.530
of completing or indeed devising anything worth doing this

90
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:45.490
extends into so many things. And Kate spoke of our freedom.

91
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.860
I don't know why she spoke of it in such,

92
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.160
in such how should I put it in a few sort of terms? I,

93
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.200
I took some time studying this apart from Michael how's the salt on the rights

94
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.480
of silence, uh,

95
00:05:58.481 --> 00:06:02.900
and William Hague's and Anthony Blair's assault on the

96
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.780
laws against double jeopardy and prosecution.

97
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.620
We have in my lifetime pretty much dismantled jury trial.

98
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.940
Majority verdict means that the independent jury is really no longer in

99
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:18.530
existence. I make ceaseless attacks on civil Liberty,

100
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.230
on every conceivable occasion on the weakest possible excuse. I was,

101
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.620
we used the other day and he wants to take him out to think about this.

102
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.540
When I saw a headline prisons to introduce

103
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.450
airport style security,

104
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.650
this means that people who've been convicted of quite serious crimes, murder,

105
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:42.610
theft, armed robbery, that kind of thing. Uh, finally now on arrival in prison,

106
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.170
going to be subjected to what you innocent persons have to undergo when you want

107
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:51.940
to fly to Paris, is this the right way round on the country?

108
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.090
It's an indication. And when you, when you fly anyway, which I try not to do,

109
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:58.540
and you have to have your testicles scanned by a revolving machine and your

110
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:00.850
luggage search and be treated as if you were a guilty person.

111
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.850
This is a country in which the presumption of guilt is now pretty much

112
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:07.570
universal. And that is where we live. And the idea that we're still a,

113
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.590
a beacon of freedom seems to me to be fanciful, begin to freedom. Well,

114
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:13.900
I was at school, it was generally Stacey,

115
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.450
the deceptive English a levels were equivalent to an,

116
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.940
to an American university degree.

117
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.880
And this is one of the reasons why there was then a thing called the brain

118
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:22.271
drain,

119
00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:26.410
where the United States spent an awful lot of money scooping up the Prolex laws,

120
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:26.680
the,

121
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.180
of our extremely effective and excellent state grammar schools to go and work

122
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:33.370
there. So what did we do?

123
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.860
We abolished the of schools and it created in the name of equality,

124
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.840
probably the worst state education system in the advanced world

125
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.820
whose certificates are multiple and many people have large piles

126
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:50.740
of them, but which are in relation to the,

127
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.430
to the education available in this country 50 years ago,

128
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.860
much as a 10 billion Martin note was in relation to a golden silver.

129
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.630
They are spectacular, but worthless.

130
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:04.930
And our education system isn't national discretion is one of the reasons for

131
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:08.110
many of the deep problems that she had, um, which,

132
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.580
which we have been unable to face and have attempted to overcome with amongst

133
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:14.140
other things, massive immigration.

134
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.970
Most of the other vainglorious statistics about, uh,

135
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.940
being the, what is it, the sixth or seventh largest economy, ah,

136
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.680
actually based on, on, on more fantasies. Um,

137
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.840
our actual position in GDP per capita is roundabout 26th in the

138
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:32.980
world. Uh,

139
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.300
our current account deficit is pulling, uh,

140
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.950
levels of public and private debt are pretty much unprecedented in peace time

141
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.720
and are simply unrepairable to imagine for a moment that this couldn't

142
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.680
possibly end well is to be self diluting.

143
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.460
And the ultimate symbol of this hubris is a

144
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:58.650
ridiculous pretense of being a great power.

145
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.130
We are a country which could not defeat a collection of gangsters and

146
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:05.640
protection, racketeers, and surrendered to them in 1998 in Northern Ireland,

147
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.920
still pretend to be a world power and maintain and propose to extend and

148
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.870
renew the Trident nuclear weapon, a gigantic cold war,

149
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.160
superpower weapon, totally useless to us, which we cannot afford.

150
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.990
This is the symbol of all the hubris, which we possess.

151
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.690
It is absolutely everything that is wrong with this country.

152
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:30.900
The fantasy that we are more important than we are the fantasy that we are

153
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:34.590
richer than we are the fantasy that we stand for anything much anymore,

154
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.461
all things,

155
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:40.140
which we'll never let his death will never under any circumstances be put right,

156
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.450
as long as we entertain these delusions.

157
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.560
And that is why it is so important to say the things that I'm saying.

158
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.730
I'm not just saying them because, because I've been invited to say them.

159
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.770
I am saying that because I believe them to be true.

160
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.650
I'm saying that because if there is to be any future for this country,

161
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:57.240
which I frankly, seriously doubt,

162
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.410
then it has to be achieved by recognition of reality.

163
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.960
I love every field in hydro of this country.

164
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.160
I was brought up to believe that it was a beacon of all kinds of wonderful

165
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:10.200
things, which I see rotting away.

166
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.970
I was brought up pretty much to know by heart John of Gornstein speech,

167
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.990
but what do I see, uh, th th th this country,

168
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:23.490
