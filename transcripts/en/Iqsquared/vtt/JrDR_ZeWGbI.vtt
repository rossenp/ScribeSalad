00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.300
<v 1>Our first speaker against the motion identity politics is tearing society.</v>

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.200
Apart is Dawn foster Dawn. Please take to the podium, guardian columnist,

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.010
who writes on politics, social affairs and economics,

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.390
and also a staff writer for Jacobin magazine Dawn.

5
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.140
<v 2>Some of you might've noticed I am a woman, I'm white.</v>

6
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.390
I have a disability.

7
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.500
And when I think about politics and when I talk about politics,

8
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.990
a lot of those identities come into it. So when I think about austerity,

9
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.920
I look at how austerity affects certain groups more than others.

10
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:53.570
So in particular, austerity affects women, uh,

11
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.580
82% of all cuts that the government have made impact women.

12
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.720
If you look at the, if you look at the pay gap, for instance,

13
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.200
women are paid less than men, but if you narrow it down,

14
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.340
black women are paid a lot less than, than other than other people.

15
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.790
Um, so when you think about politics,

16
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.690
identity does have to come into it because everybody experiences things

17
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:22.070
differently personally, but also in terms of economics,

18
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:25.490
in terms of how it affects the community, et cetera,

19
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.990
I'm want to think about the people will want to come across the people who

20
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:34.550
complain about this. It always seems to be exclusively boomers,

21
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.473
sorry.

22
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.950
I am closer in age to Carl's daughter and Como.

23
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.900
So I, um,

24
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.790
I am of the generation that is part partly interested in

25
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.150
identity politics. I don't think it,

26
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.690
I don't think it deflates things. I think, you know,

27
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.370
people live their life in a normal way and obviously your

28
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.820
identity is part of that. So everything that affects you,

29
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:06.800
everything that makes you makes up makes it the person that is you include

30
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.800
in your likes, your hobbies or dislikes, et cetera,

31
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.560
it all comes together to form a whole person.

32
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.960
And I don't think that talking to people and understanding that people

33
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.190
have different views,

34
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.870
different experiences of life because of different identities.

35
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.510
I don't think it actually like deflates things.

36
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.250
I don't think it puts people in a box.

37
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.540
I think it allows us to be more expensive with policy.

38
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.700
I think it allows us to look at political policy and think

39
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.690
about how different groups will be affected by it and that, you know,

40
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:46.580
and therefore stop discrimination within that kind of thing.

41
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.180
Um, there's a lot,

42
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.210
there was a huge amount of concern about universities,

43
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.590
about people being no platformed about people not being allowed to speak,

44
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:00.560
et cetera. And I always find it really,

45
00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:05.140
really fascinating that so many people get upset by a small number of students

46
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.180
in the student union when almost nobody else will have heard of

47
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.470
these little, the small society, Z small groups. Um,

48
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.360
and I think it's,

49
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.380
I think the big problem is that we have older people who have

50
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.110
columns in big magazines,

51
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.910
huge access to the media constantly say that they are being silenced.

52
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.080
I know this because they write constantly that they are being silenced.

53
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.470
They go on TV to talk about the fact that they have been silenced.

54
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.410
And, you know, I think if they were,

55
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:45.130
I wouldn't be constantly hearing about them. And I think,

56
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.540
you know,

57
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.290
I think actually identity politics helps those people because it allows them to

58
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.580
constantly place articles in the spectator in

59
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.850
spiked magazine, in all sorts of places,

60
00:03:56.851 --> 00:04:01.140
talking about the fact that they have been silenced and that identity politics

61
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:05.640
is ruining their life, et cetera. And you know,

62
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.560
thinking about Lionel speech,

63
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.540
I have a lot of friends who are white men and I don't look at them and think,

64
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.100
good Lord. You're so privileged. It's disgusting because they are my friends.

65
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.290
And I don't think of people in small, you know, I,

66
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:23.010
I don't put people in a small boxes.

67
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.700
I don't look at them as having a tick box on their chest.

68
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:31.260
That explains things about them. Um, I think that, you know, for instance,

69
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:32.010
me having, uh,

70
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.820
having a disability changes my life than what I'm in the hospital. A lot,

71
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:38.070
my friends know that and come and see me,

72
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.470
but it doesn't really change anything else. I might need some things like,

73
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:45.870
for instance, if we decide to have strobe lighting here,

74
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.980
I wouldn't be able to sit on stage, but that's about it.

75
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.160
Don't do that. And I find it really,

76
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:59.940
really fascinating that the big panic comes from older people are very,

77
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:03.060
very small number of older people who, you know,

78
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.730
who has, you know,

79
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.350
Lionel was saying that the people who are into internet politics are

80
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:13.710
relatively wealthy, tend to be white, et cetera. Um,

81
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.670
but whenever I read articles about people being silent so that people being

82
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.350
kicked out by identity politics, it's always homeowners in their fifties.

83
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.400
It's always people who are relatively comfortable. Haven't lived through, uh,

84
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.240
the, you know, the global financial crash. It didn't really affect them.

85
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.030
I, it seems, it seems such an obsession with,

86
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.010
with those people. Um,

87
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.750
I've met people who were absolutely desperate to get removed from panels just

88
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.810
because they wanted to talk about the backlash that came with it.

89
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.010
And they knew that if they were removed from a small panel in student union,

90
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.040
they can make a huge amount of money talking about it, you know,

91
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:54.120
going on the BBC,

92
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:57.410
talking about how they were silent writing as a spectator about they were

93
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.490
silence and absolutely nobody at any point thinking why

94
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.980
clearly aren't clearly this, this person's being published everywhere. Um,

95
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.980
I think identity politics is actually really,

96
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:14.690
really helpful in terms of making sure that we think more

97
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:19.610
deeply about how policy affects people about how we can stop, kind of get,

98
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.240
you know, gaps in admission to university,

99
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.240
how we can stop people being paid less,

100
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.910
how we can look at the fact that if you are disabled,

101
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.800
you are less likely to get a job and how we can change things to bring

102
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.150
other people in. Um, and I think that,

103
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.510
I think that we have to move past the terrifying fear that a lot of boomers

104
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:47.950
have around this, uh, you know, people, when I look at my friends,

105
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.910
I don't, I, you know, tick box in my head that appears like,

106
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.430
like some kind of scifi thing that breaks down what they are and who they are.

107
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.760
We might have conversations about kind of, you know,

108
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.330
so I was having a conversation with my friend the other day about the fact that

109
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:07.870
they had been the victim of a homophobic attack. Um,

110
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.550
but identity doesn't always come up and sometimes it does. And it's very,

111
00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:16.840
I think it's a lot more useful to talk about it and think about how

112
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.200
discrimination happens and how we can stop that from happening.

113
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.550
One, one really, really key bit. Uh,

114
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.110
I think David will talk about this is university admissions.

115
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.300
So for instance, Oxford had a huge race problem. They have a huge class problem.

116
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.490
Um, and you know,

117
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.140
bringing that up and talking about it means that they will actually take some,

118
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.030
some action and think about that.

119
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.250
There have been some court cases where people have looked at the fact that,

120
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.590
you know, certain policies are bound to affect women.

121
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.370
Therefore they are discriminatory, uh, other policies, for instance,

122
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.160
like exclusively seems to hit disabled people.

123
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.570
And those people have gone to court and talked about the fact they'd been

124
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.050
discriminated against and often won the cases and changed the policy.

125
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.160
So I think that, you know, if we want to have a more equal society,

126
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:12.280
there is no way we can do that without thinking about identity,

127
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.230
without thinking about how certain things mean that other people find it

128
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:20.110
harder to get into certain jobs,

129
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.490
find it harder to reach certain things or even, you know,

130
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.150
come into a building because there isn't a wheelchair ramp. Um,

131
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.500
so I think that identity politics is not about deciding who,

132
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.350
who is the villain, who is the most privileged,

133
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.560
who we should never ever talk about and,

134
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.170
and attack and be talking about their privilege.

135
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.150
I think it's much more about making sure that our society is more welcoming to

136
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:50.560
people and that political policy doesn't discriminate against

137
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.050
individuals and big groups.

138
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.810
It doesn't moment austerity massively affects women. And it massively,

139
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.240
if you are a woman and you are disabled,

140
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:04.740
you're doubly discriminated against by certain policies that is identity

141
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.540
politics. And, you know,

142
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.400
I think we need to remember that if we are making policy,

143
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:15.870
it needs to be more equal. It needs to make sure that for instance,

144
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.020
if you are a young black person and you're applying for a certain job

145
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.140
or a placement university,

146
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:29.910
you weren't discriminated against by the way that the interview takes place.

147
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.500
And so I think identity politics is about equality.

148
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.360
It's about making sure that everybody has the same access and that access might

149
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:42.480
be slightly different based on their identity. Um,

150
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.340
and I think that it's led to a lot of people thinking more deeply about how they

151
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:49.770
act and how society should be built.

152
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.310
So I am against emotion.

153
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.980
I think that we should be more equal.

154
00:09:55.981 --> 00:10:00.060
And I think that identity politics is key to that. We can't move past identity.

155
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:01.470
We can't ignore identity.

156
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.480
And I think that maybe at some point, the boomers will understand that.

157
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.050
