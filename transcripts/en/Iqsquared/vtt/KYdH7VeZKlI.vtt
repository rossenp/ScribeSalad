2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.940
<v 1>It's here now, though, from our second speaker for the motion for Hina yummy,</v>

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.480
she's an international environmental lawyer and activist with extinction

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:12.290
rebellion.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.460
She was a negotiator on the Paris agreement with the small Island States in

6
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:20.810
April last year, she was arrested after gluing herself to Shell's headquarters.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.790
And she's a co-author of, this is not a drill and extinction rebellion handbook.

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.633
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.770
<v 2>Well, thank you very much.</v>

10
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.970
There's a lot in what Adair Turner has said that I agree with.

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.770
And we must accept that the solutions to

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.660
preventing climate chaos,

13
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.070
preventing climate carnage actually exist. They exist today.

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.690
Most of the technologies that we need to use to bring emissions under

15
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.190
control exists today.

16
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.530
I think what capitalism doesn't do is deal with the social injustices

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.340
that are already happening with the global warming that we've committed to,

18
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.200
and that will continue to rise.

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.060
Should we also miss the 1.5 degree target and go

20
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.560
overshooting beyond that?

21
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.480
At the moment we have a kind of capitalism that does not

22
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.250
look after any of us. It doesn't look after the people in the UK.

23
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.090
It doesn't look after the people overseas. It doesn't look after the planet.

24
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.100
It does not look after nature.

25
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.050
So I feel that maybe to add to George's definition of

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.093
capitalism,

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.080
a simple way is maybe to see capitalism as a pyramid of

28
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.260
extraction. That's what capitalism is.

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.180
It's a pyramid where people and nature are at the bottom and

30
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.310
profits and wealth and power accumulate towards the top.

31
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.650
They've accumulated in such obscene quantities that they threaten the very

32
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:03.020
nature of our Democrat democracies.

33
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.940
They used to be a tenuous kind of link between capitalism and

34
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:12.170
democracy, but actually that link isn't really true. And if anything,

35
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:14.930
that link is going in the reverse direction.

36
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.700
So why did I choose to speak for this motion?

37
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:22.910
Why did I choose to join the rebels back in April?

38
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.450
I've got two books here and it's not because I want you to buy them and sell

39
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.850
them and buy this one by the way, because all the profits go.

40
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.860
I want you to climate change and carbon markets book that I wrote

41
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.590
and came out in 2005,

42
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.390
when he spent the first decade of my life as a climate change, lawyer,

43
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.560
negotiating the UNF to see the climate convention.

44
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.450
And then the Kyoto protocol and Kyoto protocol gave rise to carbon markets,

45
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:52.820
which were also developed in the European union.

46
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.320
So I've got quite a lot of history of being

47
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.140
into the very of regulations. The very kinds of incentives,

48
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:07.090
the very kinds of market mechanisms that Adair has said can constrain

49
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.920
capitalism can constrain and control pollution. And 20,

50
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.780
30 years later, I have to say, those mechanisms do not work.

51
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.370
They don't work.

52
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.800
All of the experts now agree that using emissions trading for a

53
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.300
structural problem like climate change does not work.

54
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.350
We're not talking about an end of pipe. What we call, you know, fix it,

55
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.310
solution a technology that we can just use and ask

56
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.690
power, power stations, for example, to bolt on in the way they did with sulfur.

57
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.060
We're asking for an entire rejigging of the global economy

58
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.350
of every country's energy system of every countries,

59
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.790
agricultural system of every country's transport system of every

60
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.430
citizens, aspirational desires.

61
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.280
That is what we call a systemic challenge.

62
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.460
That is the carbon economy that we need to change.

63
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:07.780
And we cannot regulate it simply by looking at all the technologies that are

64
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:11.380
available and saying somehow magically the system will adopt them.

65
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.080
I think the, the, my disillusion slightly, you know,

66
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:21.730
intellectual as it was with the kinds of mechanisms that we were

67
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.010
being, uh, urged to, to, to,

68
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:28.900
to put forward as solutions really came to a head as it became more

69
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.230
and more clear that the influence, the power,

70
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.150
the preponderance political power of the biggest corporations in the world,

71
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.040
all of which trade in, in carbon intensive products,

72
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.450
oil, gas, coal, you name it. Those are the biggest ones.

73
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.700
Those companies, whether they're state owned or privately owned,

74
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.980
those were lobbying and, uh,

75
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.200
controlling the sort of narrative and greenwashing and actually

76
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.220
heavily influencing the way in which elections take place.

77
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.240
You see that very clearly behind the scenes. If you're a day-to-day lawyer,

78
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.880
as I have been in the, in the climate regime,

79
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:16.900
you see regulations being vetoed, water down,

80
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.090
you see permits that were meant to be constrained given out for free, uh,

81
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.830
being given out in access,

82
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.270
which means that none of these mechanisms really worked. Um, my final

83
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.840
trigger for gluing myself to shell was really a report that

84
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:35.674
came out,

85
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.690
which said that since the signing of the Paris agreement in 2015,

86
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.700
$1 billion had been spent by the top five oil

87
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:50.080
companies in the world on lobbying and marketing and greenwashing.

88
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.360
That was for me,

89
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:56.980
a really important sense of outrage that I felt, I don't know,

90
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.210
he can see this here, but this is like a,

91
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.600
I don't know if he could see this tiny sliver, you know,

92
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.370
someone served you that as a cake slice, it wouldn't be a slice.

93
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.780
It would be a sliver that little tiny grip or in sliver is the slice

94
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.970
of funding by the oil majors that goes into low carbon

95
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.150
and green sources of energy. All of the rest.

96
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:22.100
This is a 2019 figures goes into still digging

97
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:26.360
out, exploring and producing yet more. Fossil fuels.

98
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.500
The scale of this destruction is immense

99
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.760
Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco, which is the largest,

100
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.470
most profitable company in the entire world produces

101
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.120
profits of around $3,000 per

102
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:48.890
second, around 300 million per day.

103
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.190
So trying to control and regulate companies as large

104
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:58.210
as that, essentially sleep is a geopolitical challenge.

105
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.400
It is not a technological challenge.

106
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:04.090
We have to find a different system for constraining,

107
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.830
these sorts of dynamics. And I feel that's what we haven't really understood.

108
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.290
I want very much to say that there is a level playing field and somehow the new

109
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:17.590
technologies that are there has talked about, which are there most of them,

110
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:19.810
by the way, will they won't,

111
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.100
they won't because the largest share of government handout,

112
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.950
what we call fossil fuel subsidies. You just call them for what they are.

113
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.630
Government handouts are being paid to fossil fuel companies still

114
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.170
because they have political power and control.

115
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.890
The scale of those subsidies is mind boggling.

116
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.480
So there's two ways of counting these subsidies. If you include the,

117
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.430
the cost of actual damage,

118
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.630
they come to like $5 trillion.

119
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.480
That's an obscene. The huge amount means that these companies are being

120
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.270
supported by governments and they have taken control

121
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.310
of the economy in ways that does not lend itself to a sort of

122
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:07.900
reformist mindset.

123
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:13.330
That's why I think the young people and people who

124
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:17.740
are really active in politics are coming up with much

125
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.840
more radical solutions.

126
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.130
So I don't want to leave you with a lack of hope and lack of alternatives.

127
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.940
I think big business, especially big business and finance Ks,

128
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.090
the heart of the global finance industry are need to

129
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:36.640
be absolutely controlled with regulation.

130
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.590
We need to say stop funding and financing these activities.

131
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.900
We need to say to our governments very clearly stop using taxpayers money

132
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.560
to support and subsidize these same industries.

133
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.270
We need to say to the CEOs of these companies and the finance

134
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.200
industry, you are failing humanity.

135
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.480
We have to make very clear that what they're leaving us with is the challenge,

136
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.430
especially to younger people of reversing this cup cataclysmic

137
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.710
breakdown, they're leaving the burden of coping emotionally,

138
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:15.000
physically, mentally,

139
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:20.160
and rebuilding institutions of trust because young people and people

140
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.930
all over this country, especially those who have not gained from globalization,

141
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.340
not gained from capitalism,

142
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.420
no longer trust governments and no longer believe that we can

143
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.050
bring prosperity in the way that they have been led to expect.

144
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.850
I think it's very important to accept that the public actually have a visceral

145
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:45.870
understanding of the failings of capitalism and have already rejected it.

146
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.800
That's what's happening it up and down the world.

147
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:53.850
Whether you look at the Chilean miners who have

148
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.210
rejected, and the people in Chile who turned out in their millions,

149
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.830
there's Malaysians, you know,

150
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:02.670
there's a student strikers everywhere you look,

151
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.290
there is an outcry and a desire and an appetite for huge amounts of change.

152
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.080
I think what would really help is a structural 10 year

153
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.760
plan. You can call it the green new deal, the nature, new deal,

154
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.560
something like the Marshall plan that was done after the second world war

155
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.890
to bring together, to bring societies together,

156
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.030
to look globally and to make sure that we put in place a system,

157
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.390
which is a kin to the natural national health service.

158
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.850
And I would call it the natural health services,

159
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:37.560
what we now need for the whole planet.

160
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:49.580
