00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>Hi to you and welcome to this intelligence squared podcast,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.130
which is being hosted by me, uh, Sonya soda,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.540
I'm chief leader writer at the observer and an observer and guardian columnists.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.030
And I'm really excited to be hosting this conversation today with Laura Bates,

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.970
who is funneled through the everyday sexism project.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.110
She's the author of many books on feminism, including the burning,

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
her latest book. It just, just out is called men who hate women.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.080
I've got a copy of it here. Um, I've read it. I've written about it.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.130
I would highly recommend it to all of you. If you enjoy this conversation.

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.020
I think it's a very important book and the more people that read it the better.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.780
So do go and get a copy. Um,

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.530
a quick mindset before we kick off the conversation with Laura.

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.660
If you do enjoy today's podcast,

14
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.920
we'd really appreciate you pressing the like button and subscribing to the

15
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.220
channel. And if you've got thoughts on our discussion,

16
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:03.360
do you feel free to leave a comment in the comments section for that?

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.490
So without further ado, we will kick off with Nora. Um, Laura,

18
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.120
I guess, first of all, it'd be just great to hear the backstory to this,

19
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:15.660
but how did you come to write a book about men who hate women?

20
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.060
<v 1>Well, I've been aware of these communities for some time. Um,</v>

21
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.200
and I think I started thinking about this around the time that we saw the

22
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:26.090
resurgence of the me too movement.

23
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.480
And it felt like we were in a very positive place in many ways.

24
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.800
And that thanks to the courage and the bravery of millions of survivors,

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.670
we were finally becoming more comfortable as a society,

26
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.960
having a conversation about sexual violence, about sexual harassment,

27
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.970
and yet still we were comfortable talking about women as victims,

28
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.470
but very uncomfortable,

29
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:53.270
even then with the idea of a conversation about groups of men as perpetrators.

30
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.410
And I started to think about the existence of these communities,

31
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:00.410
which are actively inciting and carrying out hate,

32
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:05.390
fueled violent attacks on women and how we could tackle something like that.

33
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:09.800
If people didn't even know it existed for me, the tipping point was, um,

34
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.690
recognizing the extent to which these communities were grooming and radicalizing

35
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:15.524
school boys.

36
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.850
So in my work in schools where I regularly speak in perhaps two schools a week

37
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.930
suddenly started hearing perhaps two years ago,

38
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.670
increasing numbers of boys regurgitating false facts

39
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.800
and identical quotes in schools from rural Scotland to inner city London,

40
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.480
where it was very clear that they had been groomed online by the same groups and

41
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:39.440
the same people.

42
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.860
So they were saying things like they believed that the vast majority of rape

43
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
allegations are false men everywhere were losing their jobs because of a

44
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:55.520
wave of totally fake stories made up by women to undermine them, um,

45
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.850
that the gender pay gap is a feminist myth that there's a feminist conspiracy at

46
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:02.680
the heart of our government, um,

47
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.120
set on undermining and attacking white men who are the real victims of the vast

48
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.640
majority of inequality in today's society.

49
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.780
And there was a real intolerance of any opposing views or,

50
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:16.150
or different facts or figures,

51
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.320
even though I knew that the figures in the statistics that they gained from

52
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.830
these online movements were false and quite startlingly. So, you know,

53
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.550
things like 90% of rape allegations are false, that kind of thing.

54
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.200
<v 0>And how would you respond when you got boys sort of,</v>

55
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.690
and young men standing up in sort of, you know,

56
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:37.080
assembly halls or classrooms putting these things to you?

57
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.520
<v 1>Well, as gently as possible, because I think the problem with radicalization,</v>

58
00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.580
which is what this is, and if it were any other group doing it,

59
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.840
we would be using that terminology is that they've already been very cleverly

60
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.910
primed to, um,

61
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.200
understand that you have been brainwashed and anybody that tries to talk them

62
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.000
out a bit is a kind of feminine artsy, left-wing PC warrior,

63
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:04.890
snowflake, whatever. So going in hard with this is nonsense. It doesn't help.

64
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.680
You have to listen. You have to be prepared to, um,

65
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.550
listen to their fears and their anxieties. Um, for me,

66
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.970
I found that one of the most useful things was to talk in detail about the

67
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:19.380
impact of gender inequality, gender stereotyping, um,

68
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.760
masculinity, and a kind of societal version of how that should play out on boys,

69
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:27.930
themselves to talk about male crises, the male mental health crisis,

70
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.520
to talk about body image impacting on young men to really make it clear that

71
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.490
this isn't about one group against another,

72
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:40.350
but that actually all the issues that feminists are fighting have a massive

73
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:44.400
positive knock-on impact and also about lifting up and supporting boys and men

74
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.930
and their experiences as well.

75
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.420
<v 0>I want to come back to this issue of kind of radicalization, um, very soon,</v>

76
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.440
um, what you saw happening in schools and why you think that is.

77
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.380
But first of all, I'd like to just get you to sort of,

78
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.910
you sort of look at a number of different online socialistic

79
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:05.010
movements. And I wonder if first of all,

80
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:09.420
you could just give our listeners a bit of a summary in a nutshell,

81
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:11.580
what those movements in that tap work.

82
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.650
<v 1>Absolutely. So this is a group of communities and movements loosely, um,</v>

83
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.620
under the umbrella term of the manosphere. It's not my term.

84
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.470
I don't think it's a particularly useful term because it's not.

85
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.660
<v 0>Minimized. Yeah, it's.</v>

86
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.140
<v 1>A little sad. It makes it sound like a joke. And like it's kind of pathetic,</v>

87
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.250
which is how many people react to these movements when they hear about them

88
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.440
mistakenly in my view. Um,

89
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.020
but the individual communities within the magnetosphere,

90
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:41.730
which I looked at include at the most extreme and in cells also called

91
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.290
involuntary celibates. These are men who are not having sex and want it to be.

92
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.430
And instead of looking at their own hatred of women as being part of the

93
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:52.170
potential reason for that, um,

94
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.180
they focus on the idea that evil inhuman women are denying,

95
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.120
what is their birthright as men.

96
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.220
And they fantasize about raping women about keeping them as sex slaves and about

97
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.770
a day of retribution. And in cell rebellion,

98
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.090
when these men will rise up and slaughter, the stuck-up spoiled,

99
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.950
beautiful women who have refused to sleep with them and the men who are managing

100
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.200
to have sex with those women in some cases.

101
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.330
So these sound like very extreme and probably very small group of people.

102
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:27.290
But the reality I discovered was actually a really sprawling community and

103
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:32.180
hundreds of thousands across blogs websites, um, online chat rooms,

104
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.850
support groups, forums message boards.

105
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.930
And these are men who have gone offline and acted on this ideology.

106
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:43.550
These are men who have committed massacres offline of women in the name of this

107
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:47.230
ideology, but it hasn't been called terrorism, whether by the police,

108
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.760
the justice system or the media,

109
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.010
and what sort of massacres are we talking about?

110
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.820
So we're talking about the Santa Barbara massacre where Elliot Rodger,

111
00:06:55.821 --> 00:07:00.800
for example, killed six people and injured another 14 or the Toronto van attack,

112
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.000
which many people may have heard of where Alec Manassian deliberately drove a

113
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:08.210
speeding rental van into pedestrians, um,

114
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.810
killing 10 people in during another 16, most of them women, um,

115
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.160
but more cases as well,

116
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:17.360
a teenage boy named Ben Moynihan in the UK who attempted to murder three

117
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:22.160
separate women over a two month period by stabbing them a case in Canada earlier

118
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:26.480
this year where a teenage boy took a machete into a massage parlor and murdered

119
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:30.980
a woman. Um, another man in Canada this year who attempted to, um,

120
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.480
murder a woman and her toddler girl had female baby, um,

121
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.480
in the parking lot of a, of a shop. Um,

122
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.150
these are not the only cases in the book.

123
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.650
I've traced this ideology directly to over a hundred deaths or serious injuries

124
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.670
in the last 10 years.

125
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.680
And these are men who have explicitly carried out these acts in the name of a

126
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:56.480
hate fueled vitriolic ideology of a misogynistic extremism.

127
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.760
So it meets every definition,

128
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.780
every level of what's required to define it as terrorism internationally.

129
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.100
And yet that isn't a definition that's brought to bear on almost any of the

130
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:08.660
cases with one exception,

131
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:12.050
the boy with the machete who has been charged with a terror offense.

132
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.890
<v 0>Um, so we will come back again to this idea of terrorism and why you seem so</v>

133
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:21.700
reluctant as a society to put these sorts of attacks into the category of

134
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.770
terrorism. But just before we do that,

135
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.050
tell me about the other online communities you laptop.

136
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.810
<v 1>So then there are men going their own way.</v>

137
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:33.730
These are men who believe that women are so dangerous and toxic with their false

138
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:37.780
rape allegations with their tendency to, um,

139
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.530
cheat on their husbands and secretly have babies,

140
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.640
and then force men to bring up those children that aren't actually their own,

141
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.260
um, with their false workplace, sexual harassment allegations that strict men,

142
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:54.460
if they're jobs that they believe the safest possible course of action is simply

143
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:57.870
to cut out of your life altogether, to have nothing to do with them,

144
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:02.280
no sexual or romantic relationships, if possible, no contact at all.

145
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.210
Again, sounds very extreme and ridiculous,

146
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:11.130
and it's easy to dismiss as a kind of a internet cul-de-sac with a few

147
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.630
men. But the reality is that this is becoming an incredibly popular ideology.

148
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.030
There was a recent study, for example,

149
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.890
found that 27% of American men now refuse to have one-on-one meetings with

150
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.990
female colleagues in the workplace.

151
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.900
And of course the vice president of the United States,

152
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:31.710
Mike Pence famously refuses to have dinner alone with any woman other than his

153
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.620
wife. So this is another good example, I think,

154
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:38.460
of a community easily dismissed, but in reality, you know,

155
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:42.750
some of the bigger leaders of this community, which is very active on YouTube,

156
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.660
um, they have views and followers and views of their videos in,

157
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:50.490
in the tens or even hundreds of millions.

158
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.180
So we are talking about something more pervasive than you might think.

159
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.000
And then there are pickup artists. Um, again,

160
00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:00.210
this is a kind of related community because like in sales,

161
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.660
they view women very much as sex objects there, um,

162
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.780
for the sole purpose of providing sex to men. Um,

163
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.490
but if you think of in and pickup artists by saying women as kind of sexual slot

164
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:12.324
machines,

165
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.930
and so think that the machines are rigged and we'll never pay out to them,

166
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.063
pick up artists,

167
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.270
believe that anybody anywhere can be taught the secret combination of buttons to

168
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:24.690
press and leavers to pull to force any woman to have sex with them almost

169
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:28.770
against her. Well, they talk about women in terms of training Labradors,

170
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:31.890
essentially. Um, they talk about using, um,

171
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.190
verbal ticks to kind of trick and only hitting the ties women.

172
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.480
They talk about deliberately sexually harassing women in the street or in public

173
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:41.790
space when women don't want to talk to them.

174
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.950
And at the more extreme end they talk about overcoming last minute resistance,

175
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.580
which means forcing a woman to have sex with you when she changed her mind

176
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.290
essentially. Right? Absolutely.

177
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.660
And these are men who have sometimes boasted about rape in their kind of guru

178
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:02.400
classes that they're providing to other men they're gurus and leading lights of

179
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:06.630
this industry who had training of the men in these so-called techniques have

180
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:09.540
uploaded videos of themselves online, sexually assaulting,

181
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:13.530
strange women in the street. Um, they've made arguments for example,

182
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:15.900
that rape should be illegalized on public property.

183
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.210
So it's much darker and much bigger phenomenon than our kind of pop

184
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:25.260
culture representation of sort of Bonnie Stinson and how I met your mother or

185
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:27.300
Joey and friends might suggest.

186
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.790
<v 0>I mean, so we, as feminists are supposed to kind of be feeling positive,</v>

187
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:35.030
especially in the wake of kind of me too, as you mentioned, you know,

188
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.070
attitudes are supposed to be changing,

189
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:41.420
particularly amongst the generation younger generation of girls and boys growing

190
00:11:41.421 --> 00:11:43.430
up to be young men and women. Um,

191
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.110
but this really sounds horribly kind of dark ages. So I guess,

192
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.490
what is it that's attracting men to these communities?

193
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:53.860
How are they building themselves?

194
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.440
<v 1>Well, it's complicated. Um,</v>

195
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.640
I think early sort of superficial analyses of these communities tend to suggest

196
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.490
that perhaps there is a big class element that it's as a,

197
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.520
kind of about poor white boys being left behind.

198
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.780
But if you look at the demographics of these communities while that is evidence

199
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:13.600
to suggest that they're predominantly white, um,

200
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.280
there are also large numbers of men within them who seem to be, um, uh,

201
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.840
middle-class um, fairly independently wealthy, um,

202
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.520
white men college educated who sort of believe that that sense of

203
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:32.110
entitlement to certain positions in society is being challenged and threatened,

204
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.360
um, by progress towards equality.

205
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:39.340
So certainly you could say that one aspect of this is a backlash to a burgeoning

206
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.420
feminist movement.

207
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.440
There is certainly evidence to suggest that this movement has exploded as the

208
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:48.820
current wave of feminism has gained in kind of, um, public awareness.

209
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.720
Um, I'd say, for example, if you look at four Chan,

210
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:55.330
which is one of the communities where we knew that, um,

211
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.230
often people start their journeys into the manosphere where you'll see trolls

212
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.520
gathering. For example,

213
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.840
that's a website that gets 28 million unique monthly video, uh, visitors,

214
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.090
and by far its most popular, um, board sort of area on the website is,

215
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.440
um, the random one,

216
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:16.120
which is the one my trolls tend to congregate that demographic is overwhelmingly

217
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:20.730
white college educated men between the ages of about 18 and 34.

218
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.080
So that kind of backs up that theory.

219
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.520
<v 0>I would say the college-educated thing it's really surprising to me because you</v>

220
00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:30.480
would expect maybe you've been to university to be a bit more liberal.

221
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:31.981
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

222
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:35.850
I think we have to be careful with the idea that younger men are kind of coming

223
00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:39.480
up with different attitudes and that things are sort of generally getting better

224
00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:41.820
if we just sit back and wait every year,

225
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:45.570
the British attitude survey asks people whether they think a woman was fully or

226
00:13:45.571 --> 00:13:50.460
partly to blame for being raped if she had been flirting or if she was drunk and

227
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.900
every year very depressing.

228
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.500
The answer comes back that a culture of the British public thinks she was to

229
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:58.530
blame if she'd been drinking. And the third, if she'd been flirting,

230
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.490
but every year amongst younger people, amongst 18 year olds,

231
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.290
that figure is much higher.

232
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.740
So there is evidence to suggest that young people's attitudes might actually be

233
00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:11.910
more extreme when it comes to misogyny and victim blaming than we might like to

234
00:14:11.911 --> 00:14:13.950
think. But it's also the case.

235
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.490
I think that a lot of the people drawn into these communities have very real

236
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.900
problems and vulnerabilities because we're talking about communities in the

237
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:26.130
hundreds of thousands. Obviously it's a very complex and nuanced picture.

238
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.610
Obviously not all of these men are going out and killing women offline.

239
00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:33.270
Obviously not all of them were even talking about that or inciting that.

240
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.780
And there's certainly evidence that some of the people in these communities are

241
00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:39.420
men who have had very difficult, personal experiences,

242
00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:43.500
offline men who are affected by social isolation,

243
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.480
by mental health problems and vulnerable teenagers who are anxious.

244
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:52.250
You have understandable questions and anxieties about ghosts,

245
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.720
and I've been kind of sucked into this vortex by their very deliberate kind of

246
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:58.310
recruitment strategies.

247
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.350
So one problem I think is that we're not tackling these kinds of issues offline.

248
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:06.890
We've seen 600 youth centers closed in the last few years.

249
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:11.780
We've seen huge slashes to funding for youth workers and all of this affects

250
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:12.441
young people.

251
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:17.300
And in particular young men's mental health and makes them ripe targets for

252
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:19.280
this kind of online radicalization.

253
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.810
<v 0>Yes, you, that, there's that word again, radicalization.</v>

254
00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:27.400
So I wonder if you could just talk me through what you mean by that word and

255
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:31.480
what it looks like for kids. You know, these are boys who probably sort of,

256
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.900
you know, Googling in cell movement, uh, when they're looking for stuff.

257
00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:39.730
So explain to me how they come across this and in you actually post didn't you

258
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.950
as a sort of young man as part of your research.

259
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.180
So I'd just be interested in hearing more about that and the role that

260
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:47.290
technology plays in it.

261
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.010
<v 1>Yeah, of course. So I saw firsthand how this happens.</v>

262
00:15:51.011 --> 00:15:53.770
These communities are extremely tech savvy.

263
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.840
They're extremely adept at using the internet and using the kind of terminology

264
00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:02.980
of the internet to very slowly and carefully groomed boys.

265
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.270
So absolutely boys that have been affected by this kind of ideology might never

266
00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:10.150
have actually heard the term in cell by and large.

267
00:16:10.151 --> 00:16:12.160
The boys I come into contact with in schools,

268
00:16:12.161 --> 00:16:16.810
aren't necessarily members of individual in sale or pickup artistry communities.

269
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.290
They're coming into contact with the material in the ideology of these

270
00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:21.124
communities,

271
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:26.110
but sort of smuggled further downstream and very easily accessible. Um,

272
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.840
uh, mint means, for example,

273
00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:33.490
Instagram comedy means cultural touch points and references

274
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.760
viral videos. And this isn't a coincidence,

275
00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:40.960
so that it's been deliberately written by members of these extremist communities

276
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.790
that they see these viral comedy names and jokes and images and

277
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:50.650
videos and direct links to popular culture as a way of what they describe as

278
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.120
adding cherry flavor to children's medicine in order to target boys as young as

279
00:16:55.121 --> 00:16:57.580
11 and with a very gradual drip, drip,

280
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.530
drip of desensitization to mysogeny then slowly dragging them down

281
00:17:02.531 --> 00:17:03.790
further towards jokes,

282
00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:07.690
about rape until eventually get to the point where the joke isn't necessarily a

283
00:17:07.691 --> 00:17:08.560
joke anymore.

284
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.000
And they very much see it as well as a slipway to other forms of radicalization.

285
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.440
That's really important to note,

286
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.970
I think this is very much tied up with the alt-right with white

287
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:23.680
supremacy and may not see as him and neo-Nazis are deliberately seeing

288
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.780
extreme mysogeny and anti-feminist rhetoric as a kind of way to

289
00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:32.530
open the door to those other forms of white supremacist ideologies.

290
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.480
And they're able to do it because social media platforms have the most enormous

291
00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:41.020
influence. YouTube, for example, has 1.5 billion users,

292
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.340
which is bigger than the number of households that own a TV and their impact on

293
00:17:45.341 --> 00:17:48.640
young people's particularly extreme. I think for adults,

294
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:53.040
we think YouTube as the home of movie trailers and from B cat videos.

295
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.060
So it's easy to kind of dismiss it in terms of the influence it has as a

296
00:17:57.061 --> 00:17:57.894
platform,

297
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.620
but we know it's the most popular social media platform amongst young people.

298
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.130
We know that the majority of young people say that YouTube is where they get

299
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:08.340
their news from. And if you look at the numbers,

300
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.590
it's absolutely mind-boggling.

301
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:15.150
So we know that 37% of all global internet traffic

302
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.610
is accounted for by YouTube alone.

303
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.290
And we know that 70% of the videos people watch on YouTube are the ones

304
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:24.150
recommended to them by the algorithm,

305
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.790
after they finished watching what they went looking for.

306
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.480
It's important because the algorithm directs people towards videos that will

307
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:34.440
serve YouTube.

308
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.950
Basically all YouTube wants is to keep you watching for as long as it can.

309
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.600
So whistleblowers who have left the engineering team of YouTube have come out

310
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:46.620
and said, listen, this algorithm isn't directing you to the best content,

311
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.150
the highest quality or the most relevant it's is absolutely focusing on

312
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.120
directing you towards increasingly extreme content,

313
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.160
because that's what keeps people watching.

314
00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.870
So if you're watching a video about picnics and suddenly you're watching an all,

315
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:03.630
you can eat challenge, that's not such a big deal.

316
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:07.020
If you're watching a video about jogging and it takes you to extreme marathon

317
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.790
runners, that's not such a big deal,

318
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.110
but if you started out asking something quite insipid, like what is feminism?

319
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.330
And suddenly within a couple of videos,

320
00:19:15.331 --> 00:19:18.360
you're being told that evil women are ruining the world and whiteness.

321
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.730
<v 0>That literally what happens in the us sort of question into YouTube.</v>

322
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.890
<v 1>Yes. So in the book specifically,</v>

323
00:19:24.891 --> 00:19:29.120
I kind of take you through this as I did it myself and I started with the

324
00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:30.830
question, what is feminism?

325
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.360
And it came up with a really innocuous video of Emma Watson speaking at the UN,

326
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:40.160
but the next 10 videos that came up that were recommended by the algorithm

327
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.360
started off with talking about how the gender pay gap is a myth and how the

328
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:47.960
modern feminist movement is very bitter and angry and lesbian.

329
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.830
That was Milo Yiannopoulos being interviewed saying that that was his word,

330
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.300
not mine. Um,

331
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.860
and then gradually on to more and more kind of conspiracy theories until you

332
00:19:57.861 --> 00:20:00.020
reach a point of being told that women hate men,

333
00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:03.440
that feminists are taking over the world, that white men are under attack,

334
00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:07.520
that rape allegations are false within literally just a few videos without even

335
00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:11.270
having to click anything. So it matters then at that point,

336
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.280
if you put those two stats together from earlier and you realize 25% of all

337
00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:20.930
mobile internet traffic globally is just accounted for by people

338
00:20:20.931 --> 00:20:25.520
watching the videos, YouTube has chosen for them to watch. At that point,

339
00:20:25.521 --> 00:20:30.290
it really matters that the YouTube algorithm has essentially been hijacked

340
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.180
by a vast influence,

341
00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:35.960
a network of extreme misogynistic and alt-right figures.

342
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.430
And that is very much taking young people down a kind of algorithmic rabbit

343
00:20:40.431 --> 00:20:41.264
hole.

344
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.530
<v 0>So you sort of set out in your book, how, you know,</v>

345
00:20:45.531 --> 00:20:50.350
extreme misogynistic ideology has actually led to real world

346
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.760
massacres, um, women and men losing their lives. Um,

347
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.920
when you talk about radicalization, it,

348
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.560
it feels to me like they were real and grooming.

349
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:03.250
It feels to me that there are real parallels there with how we see young people

350
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:07.300
kind of indoctrinated into far right. Or Islamist ideology, for example.

351
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.470
So I guess my, you know, and,

352
00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:13.720
and then you've talked as well about the links between online extreme

353
00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:16.180
misogyny and far right ideology.

354
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.820
So why do you think we're struggling as a society to see this as

355
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:25.300
terrorism and to take counter-terrorist approaches to it?

356
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.450
<v 1>I think there are two reasons.</v>

357
00:21:27.451 --> 00:21:31.620
I think the first is that people have very little idea of the existence of these

358
00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:34.830
communities, a tool, or if they do know about them,

359
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.030
of the extent of them, of how vitriolic and hate field they are,

360
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.770
if the extent to which they are inciting and acting on incitement to offline

361
00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:47.370
violence, um, and of the sheer numbers of people involved.

362
00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:50.730
So the first thing is people don't know these communities even exist,

363
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.690
which makes it very difficult to protect boys from being radicalized by them.

364
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.070
But the second problem I think, is that even where we do talk about it,

365
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.390
even where men who have committed massacres have outright said in their police

366
00:22:03.391 --> 00:22:06.300
interviews, that they were radicalized online, that they hated women,

367
00:22:06.301 --> 00:22:08.970
that they were murdering these women for not having sex with them.

368
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.750
Police chiefs will still come out and give an interview to the international

369
00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:15.900
media saying there is no evidence that this is linked to terrorism.

370
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:16.951
What that means,

371
00:22:16.951 --> 00:22:21.810
I think is that we have a very specific idea as a society of what we consider to

372
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:23.310
be terrorism.

373
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.000
And we see this already in the way in which we deal very differently in the

374
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:30.720
media with terrorists, who are acting in the name of, for example,

375
00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:35.460
extreme Islamist ideology or white supremacy, we tend to see headlines.

376
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.480
Well, first of all,

377
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:40.470
they're much more likely to be reported on a tool if the perpetrator is Muslim.

378
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.910
Secondly, the headlines tend to emphasize evil terrorists.

379
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.590
In one of those cases, when we talk about kind of the baby face child,

380
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.490
you turned out to be a killer. If it's a white man, we talk about lone wolves.

381
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.440
We talk about outliers.

382
00:22:55.441 --> 00:23:00.240
We talk about isolated incidents and freak accidents and mental health problems.

383
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.080
So already, when we're talking about white men as perpetrators,

384
00:23:04.081 --> 00:23:08.490
we are much less likely to see them as part of an extremist ideology,

385
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.650
but then go even one step further when that extremist ideology is

386
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.840
extremist misogyny, I think it fits into a pattern that we consider normal.

387
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.370
We are so used to seeing women losing their lives to men,

388
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.180
leave it to women every week. It killed by a current or former partner.

389
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.840
One in three women on the planet will be raped or beaten at some point in her

390
00:23:30.841 --> 00:23:33.960
lifetime. So the phenomenon of male,

391
00:23:33.961 --> 00:23:37.560
hatred and violence against women is normal to us.

392
00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:40.830
It is very much part of the wallpaper and that makes it more difficult for

393
00:23:40.831 --> 00:23:45.200
people to recognize this as an extremist hate movement, right?

394
00:23:45.201 --> 00:23:46.190
And it's not just.

395
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.760
<v 0>Terrorism where we see that minimize this. I'm thinking of, you know,</v>

396
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.320
for years,

397
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.360
women have been pointing out newspaper headlines that minimize domestic abuse

398
00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:01.340
and murder that happens in the home or the so-called private sphere,

399
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.560
uh, where women are, as you say, killed or killed by former or current partners.

400
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:11.300
Uh, yeah, the story is all on, you know, how a mom was provoked for example.

401
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.360
<v 1>Yes, exactly. So in the book I highlight recent headlines, for example,</v>

402
00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:20.890
that described men who have massacred their families as one was described as a

403
00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:25.510
henpecked husband and the headline one was described as a BBQ dad,

404
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.770
um, who was desperately sad about the fact that his marriage had broken down.

405
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:34.360
We tend to excuse and minimize and seek to understand these men.

406
00:24:34.361 --> 00:24:38.440
There was even an article in very recently and one of our biggest read national

407
00:24:38.441 --> 00:24:43.030
newspapers that used the word understandable in describing a man who had

408
00:24:43.031 --> 00:24:47.410
massacred, not only his wife, but also his teenage daughter. Um,

409
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.100
it's,

410
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.210
it's so common to try and look for justification and excuses for these men.

411
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.200
And the real tragedy is that they are directly linked to terrorism.

412
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.580
So there was for example,

413
00:24:57.581 --> 00:25:01.000
a big study by the every town group in the United States of, um,

414
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.220
massacres that had occurred mass killings,

415
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:08.230
terror attacks between 2009 and 2018 during which period and

416
00:25:08.231 --> 00:25:12.940
54% of the cases, um, an intimate family member, um,

417
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.470
had been killed as part of the massacre and around a third of the perpetrators

418
00:25:17.471 --> 00:25:21.760
of mass attacks in the U S have a history of domestic violence, abuse, stalking,

419
00:25:21.761 --> 00:25:22.840
or peace of women.

420
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.940
So the connections are that if we were to take domestic violence, seriously,

421
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:32.560
the red flags that they provide could have a massive impact in helping us to

422
00:25:32.561 --> 00:25:36.610
prevent other atrocities. But as always for generations,

423
00:25:36.611 --> 00:25:39.640
women have been canaries singing in coal mines,

424
00:25:39.641 --> 00:25:42.040
dying quietly and going completely unheard.

425
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.400
<v 0>What is the impact of this on women and indeed men on</v>

426
00:25:48.401 --> 00:25:51.520
society? I mean, obviously there's a very extreme end,

427
00:25:51.521 --> 00:25:54.310
what you talk about the sort of massacres that we've seen by themselves,

428
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:57.040
but how else has this mode testing itself?

429
00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.830
<v 1>Well, that's what I'm really interested in. Actually,</v>

430
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:03.490
obviously we can talk about and define the incidents.

431
00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:07.090
We can pinpoint the incidents where men have murdered in the name of these

432
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:08.080
ideologies.

433
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.300
What we don't know is the sheer extent of the impact these ideologies might be

434
00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:17.650
having as they sort of slid the offline into schools into classrooms,

435
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.110
there is strong into homes.

436
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.460
There's strong evidence that members of a men's rights activist groups,

437
00:26:24.461 --> 00:26:28.630
which is another one of the communities that I look at in the book, um, have,

438
00:26:28.631 --> 00:26:32.800
for example, caught the ear of policy makers in the United States,

439
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.970
in Australia, in the UK, we have currently serving politicians.

440
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:41.050
One of them on our women in equality committee who have spoken,

441
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.590
who's spoken at men's rights conferences and,

442
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.050
and openly whilst holding important positions in our government relating to

443
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:49.561
justice.

444
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:54.180
For example said that the justice system is horribly stacked against men and

445
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.130
boys and advantages women and girls.

446
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:00.840
So actually the impact of these groups is potentially quite massive

447
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.120
and at a personal level as well.

448
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.110
If we have tens of thousands of men on websites,

449
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.610
learning a woman really wants to be raped. You're just playing into her fantasy,

450
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.390
for example, which is a very normal quote from a pickup website,

451
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.890
how many women in their everyday lives may have come into contact with perhaps

452
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.400
been sexually assaulted by a man whose ideology has been influenced by the

453
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:26.670
manosphere. There's a horrible case in the book, for example,

454
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.080
of a rape victim who found her rape in chilling

455
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:35.670
detail on a pickup artist dream website where her rapists had

456
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.870
detailed everything that had happened as a kind of triumphant report to their

457
00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:44.430
peers. Um, so I think the potential impact is,

458
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.560
is much greater than the size of the communities and certainly if

459
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.330
their size might suggest.

460
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.690
<v 0>And I'm also thinking that, you know,</v>

461
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.800
if you're a boy coming into contact with this stuff,

462
00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.410
and you're quite formative years when you're sort of thinking about, you know,

463
00:28:00.411 --> 00:28:04.010
your relationships with girls and young women, um,

464
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.870
you don't have to become an incell for this to impact on how you interact with

465
00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:13.310
women, your first few girlfriends, how you treat them. And I, I, you know,

466
00:28:13.311 --> 00:28:15.950
I can imagine it'd be very difficult to measure,

467
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.220
but I would be worried about some of the stuff that I read in your book,

468
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.610
even if it's quite low level being associated, for example,

469
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.790
with coercive control and domestic abuse.

470
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.170
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

471
00:28:27.171 --> 00:28:31.100
And I think that's where it comes down to recognizing that this is a form of

472
00:28:31.101 --> 00:28:34.100
radicalization because if it's able to happen silently,

473
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.720
then there are generation of boys coming into contact with this ideology without

474
00:28:38.721 --> 00:28:40.910
any kind of offsetting information,

475
00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:45.770
without any attempt to give them alternative facts and information.

476
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.350
And the impact of that could be really massive. I mean,

477
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:52.010
an example that Springs to mind immediately as a young woman who wrote to me,

478
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.760
um,

479
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.930
in one of her first weeks at university to say that she'd had sex with a boy,

480
00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.860
a boyfriend for the first time, um, they were both 18.

481
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.540
And she said that halfway through,

482
00:29:02.541 --> 00:29:05.870
he suddenly started trying to choke her completely out of the blue and

483
00:29:05.871 --> 00:29:09.170
unexpectedly. And she managed to push him off.

484
00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:11.690
And afterwards he broke down in tears and said,

485
00:29:11.691 --> 00:29:14.930
I thought that was what you'd be expecting. So there is,

486
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.380
it is very extreme and it very much overlaps, I think,

487
00:29:18.381 --> 00:29:21.860
with the impact of online pornography, the fact that, you know,

488
00:29:21.861 --> 00:29:26.660
we knew that 60% of young people have seen online form by the age of 14 and a

489
00:29:26.661 --> 00:29:28.910
quarter to 12 or younger when they first see it.

490
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.910
So we're talking about ideas which, um,

491
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.830
contribute to the kind of dehumanization of their female peers to the idea that

492
00:29:36.831 --> 00:29:41.000
the way to be a man is to have power and sexual control over,

493
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.380
to be dominant, to be an alpha male, to be strong.

494
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.660
And all of this is kind of fed into,

495
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:50.230
and these aren't just my own anecdotal observations for the book.

496
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.230
I interviewed the lead facilitator of the good lad initiative,

497
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:56.950
which is probably the biggest UK organization on the ground talking to young

498
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:58.750
boys about this regularly.

499
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.880
And he estimated that 70% of the young people he worked with in schools across

500
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:07.840
the UK had come into contact with these ideologies in some form.

501
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.570
So this isn't a small minor problem.

502
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.380
<v 0>I think, you know, so I said at the start, this is a really important,</v>

503
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.930
but in some ways it's also quite a scary book. Um, you know,

504
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:23.280
and I've talked to a lot of friends about it, my friends with children,

505
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:26.730
because I think if you've got a young boy,

506
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.920
it's quite an added young girl, to be honest,

507
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.810
it's very important to kind of be aware of this,

508
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.240
but I guess what would your message,

509
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.270
what would your message be to parents who are really worried about some

510
00:30:36.271 --> 00:30:37.740
teachers? What can they do?

511
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.780
<v 1>I think there is a lot they can do, and that's quite reassuring to hear, um,</v>

512
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.950
I also want to say that this isn't an attempt at scaremongering, you know,

513
00:30:46.951 --> 00:30:50.700
although I do think this is impacting boys to a great degree.

514
00:30:50.701 --> 00:30:55.080
I also know that I'm meeting boys across the country who are really interested

515
00:30:55.081 --> 00:30:59.490
in feminism and advancing equality who are really keen to be part of the

516
00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:00.570
solution as well.

517
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.620
So that's important to say there are all sorts of positive signs about teenage

518
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.620
boys today, as well as teachers and parents.

519
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.640
I think the first thing and the most important thing is to familiarize yourself

520
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:15.810
with the reality of young people's online worlds and the territory that they

521
00:31:15.811 --> 00:31:17.160
frequent on a daily basis,

522
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.210
because that can be a big gap between adult perceptions of what that looks like

523
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.510
and the reality of the wallpaper of young people's online lives.

524
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.090
So I'd recommend getting stuck in, you know,

525
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.010
type in feminism or feminist gets destroyed on YouTube and just see the kind of

526
00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:34.290
string of what the algorithm presents.

527
00:31:34.291 --> 00:31:39.000
You have a look at some of the bigger red pill sites on Reddit, even sign up,

528
00:31:39.001 --> 00:31:40.380
perhaps for some of the big comments.

529
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.040
<v 0>Red pill just brought our lessons. You may not be familiar with that.</v>

530
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.730
<v 1>Say red pill is a term used by almost all of these manners,</v>

531
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:52.620
fear groups to, um, describe the moment of taking the red pill,

532
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:55.110
which is borrowed from the matrix. Ironically,

533
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:59.190
a film by two trans women with these communities being very transphobic.

534
00:31:59.191 --> 00:32:00.780
They don't seem to know the irony of that.

535
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.450
The idea is that when you take the red pill,

536
00:32:03.451 --> 00:32:06.900
it's the moment when you see the reality of the world for how it really is the

537
00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:08.040
scales fall away,

538
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.400
and you realize you've been lied to your whole life and that the world,

539
00:32:11.401 --> 00:32:15.720
which you've been told discriminates against women or against people of color is

540
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.430
actually desperately stacked against poor white men who are the real victims of

541
00:32:20.431 --> 00:32:21.300
our society.

542
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.860
So looking at kind of Reddit red pill websites is a good way to get an idea of

543
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:27.930
the kind of baseline of this kind of stuff.

544
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.830
Then you can look out for particular words that teenagers might use.

545
00:32:31.831 --> 00:32:36.480
That would be a good indication that they've come across this content normies,

546
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.010
which is the word that they use for kind of members of society outside the

547
00:32:40.011 --> 00:32:44.750
manosphere, um, words like based or triggered or butters,

548
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.670
which are what they use to describe people.

549
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:51.500
Who've been kind of offended by Monas fare rhetoric or ideology. Um,

550
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.110
anybody who's kind of had a Sutton recent change in views and particularly

551
00:32:57.111 --> 00:33:00.500
marked by a real intolerance to alternative use.

552
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:04.790
That can be a really big red flag for radicalization. And for me,

553
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:08.600
communication is the single most important way to tackle this young people.

554
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.880
If they don't have anywhere else to talk,

555
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:14.930
to add these kinds of grievances and anxieties and fears,

556
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.780
then the manifests we'll welcome them with open arms.

557
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:22.370
So it's not about judging them or making them feel punished or that

558
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:27.110
they are going to be sort of, um, you know, held in contempt for this.

559
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.050
It's very much about giving them space to communicate.

560
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.390
And I'd really recommend for schools and parents to think about possibly looking

561
00:33:35.391 --> 00:33:38.930
at an initiative like the good lad initiative coming into talk to peoples.

562
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.260
They are fantastic because they send cool men,

563
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:47.090
young guys into schools to talk to boys and guys that they'll be able to look up

564
00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:51.590
to and relate to hit knew exactly who won't make them feel judged or

565
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:53.720
punished, or that they're about to get in trouble,

566
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:58.250
but who will give them space to interrogate some of this stuff and helping them

567
00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:02.540
to question online sources and to realize that they can't necessarily trust

568
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:03.980
everything that they read online,

569
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:08.300
helping them to interrogate it for themselves rather than just telling them that

570
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:09.770
they're wrong is key, I think.

571
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.890
<v 0>And is there any evidence about what works once sort of a young man has kind of</v>

572
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.540
got quite drawn into this race and the process of radicalization is

573
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.040
well underway. Is there any evidence about what works in on doing that?

574
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.330
<v 1>So sadly we have to draw the evidence from this, um,</v>

575
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.930
from other forms of 50 radicalization, because as far as I'm aware,

576
00:34:31.931 --> 00:34:36.730
there is nothing dedicated in terms of deescalation or de-radicalization

577
00:34:36.731 --> 00:34:41.140
organizations focusing specifically on these extremist forms of misogyny.

578
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.430
But if you look at some of the de radicalization projects that are targeting

579
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.800
neo-Nazis and white supremacists,

580
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:52.750
they often focus on demolishing the idea of the other as a kind of

581
00:34:52.751 --> 00:34:57.250
monstrous character chore. So for example, um,

582
00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.820
there's one expert who recently gave an interview in the Atlantic where he

583
00:35:00.821 --> 00:35:05.620
talked about, um, introducing a white supremacist, Neo Nazi, um,

584
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.550
to an mm.

585
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.830
And them actually striking up this great friendship and creating

586
00:35:11.831 --> 00:35:15.970
this relationship that helped to dismantle a lot of the myths that have been fed

587
00:35:15.971 --> 00:35:18.350
to this man as he was radicalized, um,

588
00:35:18.351 --> 00:35:22.390
about what it meant to be a Muslim about what kind of person you would be. Now,

589
00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:26.080
whenever I apply this to what we're talking about, people immediately go,

590
00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:27.340
but that couldn't happen with,

591
00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.090
with boys and girls because they mix because they grow up together. So,

592
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.320
you know, why are you saying that?

593
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.240
But I really believe we have a problem with gender segregation and our society,

594
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.920
our schools from the age of being a toddler.

595
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.740
If two children sit down next to each other in a play group,

596
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.470
you'll hear people going, Oh no, they're on their first date.

597
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.770
Look up your dark daughters. She's going to be a heartbreaker.

598
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.710
We sexualize and thereby stigmatize,

599
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.510
mixed gender friendships amongst children from an incredibly young age and

600
00:35:57.511 --> 00:36:01.740
actually at a round table meeting recently about education and sexism.

601
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.080
I was sitting next to a young Muslim teacher. He said,

602
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:08.040
if the children in my classroom was segregated by religion or race,

603
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.320
I would consider it to be a huge problem.

604
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:14.460
And so with the school and we take action every day at lunchtime,

605
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:17.790
the six or seven year olds in my classroom separate themselves,

606
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.220
invariably every day by gender.

607
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.550
And it's not seen as a problem is even almost encouraged.

608
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:27.180
It seems as normal different views, its natural voice.

609
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.530
It interested in these feelings.

610
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.980
Girls are like this boys and girls are different. They have different interests.

611
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.310
Oh look, the party invitations are pink princess one.

612
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.830
So we won't invite any boys to your party this year.

613
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.390
And it just happens to such a degree that by the time these films are fragile,

614
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.210
highlight stations start to chip in.

615
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.070
They are able to avert and de-humanize female peers because boys don't

616
00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:53.280
necessarily have meaningful platonic relationships with them.

617
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.590
So although it seems very far away from the problem at a kind of broader level,

618
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.910
trying to dismantle some of these gender stereotypes and the way in which we

619
00:37:02.911 --> 00:37:07.290
treat relationships platonically between boys and girls could have a big impact

620
00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:08.124
as well, I think.

621
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.810
<v 0>And what are the social media companies doing?</v>

622
00:37:11.811 --> 00:37:15.290
I feel like I know the answer to this already, but are they doing enough?

623
00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.540
<v 1>I really don't think they're doing enough.</v>

624
00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:19.070
And I really think they could do more.

625
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.870
I just think we have to look at the relationship between the amount of power

626
00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:26.630
they have and the amount of accountability. And for me,

627
00:37:26.631 --> 00:37:29.330
that is a very unskewed balance at the moment. You know,

628
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:34.340
if you're talking about your choice of what your algorithm chooses

629
00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:37.040
representing us quarter of mobile internet traffic,

630
00:37:37.041 --> 00:37:40.850
that is enormous power that you're wielding.

631
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:45.650
And frankly, if you have an income, the size of several small countries,

632
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.220
you do have the money to fix this problem. If you wanted to,

633
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:53.420
what I suspect is that the will isn't there unless it affects their bottom line.

634
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.690
And because we're talking about such vast communities,

635
00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:01.790
the risk for them is that tackling it could alienate a number of their members,

636
00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.480
you know, so we hear them kind of holding up their hands and saying, Oh,

637
00:38:05.481 --> 00:38:08.630
it's really difficult to tackle this with algorithms. We're doing our best,

638
00:38:08.631 --> 00:38:09.680
but it's a real problem,

639
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.540
but I'm sorry you have multi-billion dollars worth of profits. So you could,

640
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:18.860
if you wanted to hire a hundred thousand human moderators tomorrow and train

641
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:23.030
them alongside civil society organizations to deal with this manually, um,

642
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.950
I think that they value the, um, perception of their sites.

643
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:31.880
I, some of them are extreme users above the safety,

644
00:38:31.881 --> 00:38:34.730
on their platforms of women and girls and other grades.

645
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.620
<v 0>And just to round up, um,</v>

646
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:43.420
well what are the reasons that you see to sort of be optimistic going forward?

647
00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:44.641
<v 1>Well,</v>

648
00:38:44.641 --> 00:38:48.480
I think that there is enormous room for improvement here and I'm hoping that

649
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.620
this starts a conversation because we can't fix it unless we can start to talk

650
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:54.120
about it. Um,

651
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:58.800
I feel that young people are really giving me a great deal of hope for the

652
00:38:58.801 --> 00:39:00.870
future. You know, the schools that I go into,

653
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.860
these are a generation of young people who have been labeled cowards and

654
00:39:04.861 --> 00:39:08.460
snowflakes and, and you know, PC warriors.

655
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.980
It really couldn't be further from the truth.

656
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.850
This is a generation of young people who are brave or courageous who are

657
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:19.080
standing up for themselves and fighting back in very difficult circumstances.

658
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.520
Um, you know,

659
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.300
there are girls being told to go home from school because their leggings might

660
00:39:24.301 --> 00:39:26.790
distract the boys who are coming up to school.

661
00:39:26.791 --> 00:39:31.020
The next day with placards protesting saying are my liking flare and you'll test

662
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.550
schools. Um,

663
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.030
these are schools where girls who've been told that they can't hold a feminist

664
00:39:36.031 --> 00:39:40.080
society because it might be considered controversial or divisive or going

665
00:39:40.081 --> 00:39:42.180
underground and holding one anyway, you know,

666
00:39:42.181 --> 00:39:46.020
there is so much going on there so many inspiring and people, um,

667
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.110
who are aware of their stuff and are fighting back against it.

668
00:39:49.111 --> 00:39:50.730
And that gives me hope for the future.

669
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:54.690
<v 0>Well, I think that's a great note to end on Laura.</v>

670
00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:59.640
Thank you so much for a fascinating discussion today. Uh I'm Sonia

671
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.200
[inaudible] and you've been listening to intelligence squared.
