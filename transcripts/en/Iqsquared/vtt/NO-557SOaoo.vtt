00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.833
<v 1>Tony Juniper.</v>

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.590
He's an environmentalist and former executive director of friends of the earth.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.230
He's the author of what has nature ever done for us?

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.150
How money really does grow on trees.

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.510
What nature does for Britain and rainforest dispatches from Earth's most vital

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.190
frontlines. He's also the co-author with the Prince of Wales of harmony,

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.900
a new way of looking at our world.

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.513
<v 0>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.770
<v 2>Thank you, Richard. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,</v>

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.340
I have to say that in my long career, as an environmentalist,

11
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:41.210
I reached the conclusion that the question we're debating this evening is the

12
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.580
most important of all. Namely,

13
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.590
what kind of economic system is going to enable us to navigate the climate

14
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.080
change and nature emergency.

15
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.440
And while many people talk about population growth,

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.320
and the fact that our numbers have tripled since 1950,

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.790
bear in mind that the size of the global economy has increased 10 fold.

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.470
And the consequences of that we can see in elevated greenhouse gas emissions,

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.570
the mass extinction of animals and plants and ecological degradation on a

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.620
global scale.

21
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.630
If you look at the way different economies have greeted these trends over the

22
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:18.464
decades,

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.030
it's largely been seen as the price of progress with both

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.790
socialist and capitalist systems,

25
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.530
both seeking to expand output as the means of achieving human

26
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.790
wellbeing,

27
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.740
both systems capitalist and socialist saw growth as their most vital

28
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.000
and essential objective. One promoted the process by a markets,

29
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.650
private property and corporations, the other via central planning,

30
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.470
state ownership of industry and workers,

31
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.750
managing the organizations that employed them,

32
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.090
both saw the rapid exploitation of natural resources as

33
00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:59.330
central to their plans to expand GDP.

34
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.680
They both wanted to expand the size of the pie with capitalists,

35
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:07.910
expecting the wealth to trickle down through society and socialists,

36
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.300
engaging in more or less active redistribution.

37
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.490
Looking at the last hundred years of economic experiments conducted under those

38
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:17.324
two banners.

39
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.430
It's fair to say that we have not yet invented a large scale economic

40
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:25.850
system that can be regarded as ecologically sustainable.

41
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.640
And as previous speakers have pointed out this evening,

42
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.940
this is now a matter of grave urgency.

43
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.050
We have to shift from where we are to a sustainable economy in a matter of

44
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:40.670
years. And as we consider the importance of urgency,

45
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.020
just bear in mind that pretty much all democracies across the world vote

46
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.870
for some kind of capitalist system,

47
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.380
whether it's the socially progressive form that you see in some of the

48
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:56.030
Scandinavian countries or the neoliberal accesses of the United States.

49
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.030
Broadly speaking, that is what citizens back.

50
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.380
If we are going to make this shift in time,

51
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.310
then we're going to need to find ways of getting citizens to back that economic

52
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.800
transformation in ways that they would like,

53
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.250
and looking at the world from where I see it at the moment is going to be most

54
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.910
likely to do that through some form of capitalist transformation,

55
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.050
changing the system that we have, rather than pushing it off a cliff.

56
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.780
And if we are to succeed,

57
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.280
then we need to harness the dynamic innovation of markets of competition and the

58
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:31.090
inventiveness that comes with the profit motive. If we're going to do that,

59
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.170
what kind of system might we envisage? So unlike the other side, this evening,

60
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:35.891
ladies and gentlemen,

61
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:39.610
I'm going to give you some solutions rather than simply a diagnosis of the

62
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:43.870
problem. And it's not going to be a five year Soviet plan.

63
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.770
It's going to be a five-point capitalist transformation program.

64
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.230
Point one in this transformation program is to adopt legal frameworks,

65
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.820
adopted by governments to embed hard caps, to reflect the need,

66
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.290
to reduce to zero greenhouse gas emissions and to restore the natural

67
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.160
environment that needs to be done globally through the convention on

68
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:10.240
biodiversity and the convention on climate change and domestically through

69
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:13.900
things like the climate change act and the environment act that was introduced

70
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.040
into parliament today,

71
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.050
we need targets set out in law that reflect the scale of the

72
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.460
ecological emergency. Once we've established the caps,

73
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.690
we need to put in place the tools and the policies to meet those new goals.

74
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.980
We can do this through the regulation on emission standards,

75
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.240
through the regulation of the financial markets, supportive trade policy.

76
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.750
And of course, in relation to climate change of price on carbon,

77
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.180
imagine what would happen if over the next 10 years we introduced a 100 pounds,

78
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:47.560
carbon tax per ton,

79
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.400
10 pounds a year rising between 2020 and 2030,

80
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.840
that would send a very clear signal that it's time to get out of fossil fuels.

81
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.370
It would be transformative,

82
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.260
and it could be part of a wider ecological tax reform program whereby

83
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.560
people on lower incomes at the income tax reduced.

84
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.680
And instead we levy taxation on pollution.

85
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.850
<v 3>Three. Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.990
<v 2>And this plan would be a shift of the subsidies regime been pointed out already.</v>

87
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:16.824
Quite rightly,

88
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.690
that hundreds of billions of pounds are awarded to fossil fuel corporations and

89
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:24.630
industrial agriculture across the globe. Every year,

90
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.070
we need to switch those subsidies into the cleaner and greener alternatives,

91
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.970
sustainable regenerative, agriculture, renewable energy amongst them.

92
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.660
These three steps, hard limits,

93
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.730
new regulatory tools and reoriented subsidies would ensure that the ultimate

94
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.410
means of economic activity,

95
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.420
namely a healthy biosphere would be better protected on top of this.

96
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:48.870
However,

97
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.130
it would also be necessary to correct the rather fundamental fact that Neo rib

98
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.040
neoliberal capitalism has lost sight of why it exists the first place.

99
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.050
This is why parts four and five of the transformation plan are about ensuring

100
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:06.020
that capitalism delivers longterm wellbeing for all,

101
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.430
rather than hoping that self-interested buyers and sellers will deliver that

102
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.070
automatically. We know that they won't do so.

103
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.050
Part four would be the adoption of new measures to judge economic

104
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.884
success,

105
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.720
embracing human wellbeing and ecological sustainability as central

106
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.370
measures of performance of the economy,

107
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.110
not simple crude GDP that would be put into the dustbin of

108
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:34.670
history where it belongs instead of measuring and celebrating increased,

109
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.180
consumption, and waste, which is basically what GDP growth does.

110
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.810
We would have economic measures to instead celebrate long,

111
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.390
happy and sustainable lives. For everybody.

112
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.210
Part five would focus on the private sector companies that at the very beating

113
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:52.010
heart of the capitalist system,

114
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.050
they would be subject to new laws requiring that they be driven by a purpose to

115
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:59.300
promote the wellbeing of people in society.

116
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.130
Not simply the interests of shareholders, companies would still harness markets,

117
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.300
profits, and innovation,

118
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.070
but they would do it against a new set of goals that were set out in new

119
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:13.820
company laws. They would still seek profits, but not,

120
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.790
not necessarily profit maximization,

121
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.310
nor profit via any legal route.

122
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.250
Their purpose would be sustainable development.

123
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.510
Governments can legislate for all of these things and in different parts of the

124
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:28.700
world in different ways. They're beginning to do it.

125
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.330
We need to put supercharges on that agenda. However,

126
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.790
my argument is evening is not predicated on the view that it's capitalism per

127
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.950
se, that has caused the mess we were in,

128
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.530
but rather the economic system more broadly,

129
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.580
whether it be capitalist socialist or anything else that we've invented,

130
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.190
we are very, very short of time.

131
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.180
People want positive alternatives that they can vote for looking around the

132
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.030
world where people presently past cast their votes.

133
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.290
I would say the best chance we've got is to change capitalism,

134
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.210
to invest in its transformation,

135
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.950
not to push it off a cliff because that will end an even more certain disaster.

136
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.813
Thank you very much.

137
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.210
<v 4>[Inaudible] well, thank you very much.</v>
