WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 0>I don't know about everyone else, but I am just,</v>

2
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.790
just bouncing around here with excitement.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.830
And I hoping now that Kate Hoey is going to bring us down to us.

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.800
Kate is going to be speaking against the motion.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.690
Kate former Labour and Pete 30 years distinguished service

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.920
born in Northern Ireland, served and Tony Blair's government,

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.990
independent minded, Kate. She defied the labor whip on,

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.670
as you heard banning books ending and against the Iraq war.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.650
And she was a leading campaigner for leave in the referendum.

10
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.513
Kate.

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.150
<v 1>Thank you. And it is a pleasure to be here,</v>

12
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.770
and I hope that I'm going to actually cheer you all up after that

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.960
slightly depressing speech by my ex constituent, um,

14
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.120
Mr. Self, uh, mind you,

15
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.690
he's never been so miserable that he had to come and see me about any problems.

16
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:00.950
So that's fine.

17
00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:05.810
And it's lovely to be on the same stages on the opposite side as, as,

18
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.900
um, Peter Hitchens, because Peter and I share,

19
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.630
I think I'll share a little secret that I think we both,

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.550
it's not really a secret. We were both trots in a long time ago and, uh,

21
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.960
we, we, um,

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.980
we have moved as you can see politically now it is a great pleasure to be here,

23
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:26.090
and I'm very proud tonight to speak up for my country and I'm making it very

24
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:26.361
clear.

25
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:30.800
I'm speaking up for the United Kingdom because great Britain excludes Northern

26
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:35.480
Ireland and Northern Ireland of course is one of the best parts of the United

27
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.930
Kingdom.

28
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.610
And I want to say just very clearly at the beginning,

29
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:45.470
I'm very patriotic. I love my country. I cherish being British.

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
I cherish being able to be a citizen of this country

31
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.350
and I get quite emotional. I'll be honest too.

32
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:58.910
When I see the union flag being raised and I hear

33
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.990
the national Anthem being played and I'm not ashamed of that.

34
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.960
And I don't think any of us should be, but of course tonight,

35
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.280
we don't have to prove on this side that the United Kingdom is the greatest

36
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:15.170
country in the world. The question really is, are we one of the great countries?

37
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.220
And it really isn't a value judgment either on,

38
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.010
regarding a country. I don't think there's any kind of, uh, nationalist,

39
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.960
uh, exaggeration to regard a country, which has had a profound influence,

40
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:34.760
whatever will may have said on the entire course of history as a great one.

41
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.680
And of course, importantly, grit is not a value judgment,

42
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.860
meaning good. Uh, China's a great country,

43
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:46.760
but I would very much detest its political system. Uh,

44
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.600
Russia could be considered to be a great country and we mustn't forget that it

45
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.810
was British people who wrote the constitution of one of the greatest countries

46
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:56.660
in the, in the world. And they certainly think they are anyway,

47
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.760
the United States of America.

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.310
And when we then go to look at this, to me,

49
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.020
absolutely fundamental to this whole debate is that we

50
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.760
are a great democracy from at least the

51
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.250
13th century, uh,

52
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.840
on there have been efforts and campaigns and Wars to reign in the powers

53
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.490
of government and to establish the primacy of the rule of law.

54
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.410
And our greatest claim to greatness I believe is that we have created a fiercely

55
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.340
democratic society that treasures the liberties,

56
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.290
our ancestors fought for and died for over many,

57
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.590
many centuries. And we have seen,

58
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.990
I know we probably don't want to talk about it,

59
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.300
but we have seen a great example of that.

60
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:50.740
Recently our political system delivered a

61
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:55.510
referendum result that most of our political leaders and the

62
00:03:55.511 --> 00:04:00.310
dominant intellectual academic and legal class have been

63
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.630
unable to stop. And they certainly tried to stop it.

64
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.570
And the people showed that they were prepared to actually give quite

65
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:14.980
a beating to a party that had tried to stop that

66
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.570
referendum result. Our country is one of the most free,

67
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.620
open and tolerant societies in the world and a welcoming country,

68
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.600
whatever anyone says to outsiders and perhaps that's why

69
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.780
people from all over the world, living in oppressed countries,

70
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:36.340
living under dictatorships, living as, as,

71
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.760
as in Wars torn countries,

72
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.140
dream of still coming to this country as a refuge.

73
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.700
And if we look at what's happening at the moment in the English channel,

74
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.350
why are all those little boats filled with migrants?

75
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.130
Most of them with no relatives here whatsoever,

76
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.350
why are they coming from a safe country, France to the British shore?

77
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.720
Our sense of freedom, fairness, and justice,

78
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.640
and of the opportunities our society offers of building a new life

79
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.500
free from fear that's,

80
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:18.430
what's bringing them British greatness extends of course,

81
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.760
far beyond the British eyes. And this is where I feel very strongly.

82
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:26.680
We belong to a global family of nations, unlike any other,

83
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.730
the Commonwealth,

84
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.100
a creation of genius expressing the sense of tolerance and shared

85
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:38.020
values championed by her majesty the queen throughout her

86
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.940
Rian, still countries with only slender connections to our,

87
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.050
to the United Kingdom are queuing up to join this remarkable

88
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.380
reinvention of a worldwide empire,

89
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:54.640
which we had as a free association of independent yet

90
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.060
interdependent nations committed to work together even more

91
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.120
closely than friends, but as family.

92
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.110
And I hope that we will win ti and I'm sure everyone on this platform,

93
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.950
hopefully we'll maintain friendship with all the EU countries,

94
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.050
but they're not our family,

95
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.910
our place at the head of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth,

96
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.280
nearly 3 billion people.

97
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.150
One third of the world's population is an asset.

98
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.190
We should be proudly celebrating and we tend to take it for granted yet these

99
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.240
days yet.

100
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:34.190
So many nations can only dream of such a wellspring of Goodwill and

101
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:38.900
positive engagement trading with countries that use our system of law,

102
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.590
our language, and base their institutions, professions,

103
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:47.330
their parliaments and systems of government on our model.

104
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.050
Other nations, look to the United Kingdom again,

105
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:54.740
whatever are the movers of this motion will say,

106
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:58.370
other nations do still look to us for leadership.

107
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.740
And of course with greatness comes that extra

108
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.850
responsibility,

109
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.710
but we have a soft power influence around the world that you could

110
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:14.210
not simply make up. It is there. And it dolls

111
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.320
ladies and gentlemen,

112
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.580
this so much great about the United Kingdom,

113
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.000
that it's impossible to get into it in such a short time.

114
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.840
And I know that side,

115
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.140
so deed Willie will be putting some of the other points,

116
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:37.030
but of course being a great country doesn't mean that we're always right

117
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.940
and that we do the right things. And of course,

118
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:44.110
one of them has been mentioned was when we went into the Iraq war,

119
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.450
but we have a democracy and we can oppose it.

120
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.330
We can oppose things like that that are wrong.

121
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.110
And we don't have to like some of the things that governments do.

122
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.820
We don't have to like governments, whatever their political ideas are,

123
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.390
but we are a country also.

124
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.710
And I think this is very important when we're talking to perhaps other

125
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:08.590
countries, we are a country of foibles.

126
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.840
We do have some strange, strange customs. Um,

127
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.840
one of those customs, which in tears,

128
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:19.720
I think visitors to us is our queuing habit.

129
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.790
Another one is the way we repeatedly say, sorry,

130
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.860
I walked from Victoria to Westminster the other day.

131
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.450
And I just deliberately counted the number of times that I actually said,

132
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:36.250
sorry on that walk.

133
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.120
And it's amazing how often we just automatically say, sorry,

134
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:44.750
and it's something that we, as a country, we can put ourselves down. We,

135
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:48.550
we never, actually, we always try to underestimate things.

136
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.720
We never exaggerate. We shouldn't exaggerate,

137
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.280
but politicians are always exaggerating. But I would say that we,

138
00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.840
we on the whole, our, our, our makeup is that we don't, we understand ourselves,

139
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.930
we don't blow enough of our own trumpet as a country.

140
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.710
And of course we have a Monarch that even will,

141
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:12.630
might agree with actually uses tubberware. So we, we have, we have,

142
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.100
uh, we have a way of showing that we are not too full of ourselves.

143
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.770
No other country can present such a long list of credentials.

144
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.200
Uh, but I, but I think still, uh,

145
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.540
that our best days are ahead.

146
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.530
And I want to just also to say very quickly as a former sports minister,

147
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.520
you know, sport has sole important in the world, particularly to young people.

148
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.650
And those many of the sports of that have been right across the

149
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:46.350
world. We put the rules there,

150
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.180
we set the boundaries and now, and again, we still actually win.

151
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.280
And one of the points that I actually think is just very interesting to point

152
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.540
out that of the 10 teams in formula one,

153
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.600
racing seven are based in the United Kingdom.

154
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.100
We have a premier league of football.

155
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.150
That's watched the biggest one watched by more people all over the world.

156
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.240
We came second in the, in the Olympics in Rio.

157
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.680
We came second in the Paralympics, which we started at stoke Mandeville.

158
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.460
And of course we've got wonderful golfers, like Rory McIlroy.

159
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.700
I would mention him. And then we've got Eddie, the Eagle.

160
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.810
And it's that contrast that shows what a great country we are.

161
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.880
So let us not be full of doom and gloom.

162
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.760
I want to see the next decade of one of hope,

163
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.930
optimism and ambition using the creativity of all our peoples.

164
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.940
So banish the two mongers throughout this motion and celebrate all that is

165
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.370
great about this grit country.

166
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

167
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.010
<v 0>So after depressive for yest, well,</v>

168
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:01.790
we've had emotional foil bullish Kate,

169
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.080
