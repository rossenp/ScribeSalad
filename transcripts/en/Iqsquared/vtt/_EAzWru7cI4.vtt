1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.840
<v 1>Our next speaker for the motion. Uh, Trevor Phillips to my rights, uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
was chair of the equality and human rights commission between 2003 and

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.660
2012.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.610
The co-founder of the diversity analytics consultancy Weber Phillips,

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.600
uh, and he is presently chairman of the index on censorship.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.130
He's a director of the Barbican art center and vice president of the

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.860
Royal television society general.

8
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.873
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.090
<v 2>Well, good evening. And thank you for inviting me to be part of this discussion.</v>

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.070
I didn't really to be actually honest with you.

11
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:47.120
I didn't really know what intelligence squared was before I was asked to be part

12
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:49.790
of this. It's a tribute to their organization,

13
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:54.770
that this number of people can turn out on a lovely evening where you could

14
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:59.240
be doing something much better to listen to us. Thank you. So thank you so much.

15
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.250
So let me introduce myself.

16
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.690
I'm the 10th of 10 children of an immigrant family came here in 1950,

17
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.920
were descendants of slaves, including a woman,

18
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.630
the earliest known member of our family. She was called happy,

19
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.880
presumably some slave owners idea of a great joke. Further back,

20
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.530
we would have come from the Mandinka or Fulani people of West Africa like David.

21
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.240
He also comes from Guyana. That's a whole other identity story to tell you,

22
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:33.650
but were great. My ancestors were for Muslims,

23
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.120
but of course we had all that whipped out of us, probably in our case,

24
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:42.140
by the biggest plantation owners in British Guyana, John Gladston. Yes,

25
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:44.810
the father of the liberal prime minister,

26
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:49.460
William Glen's Gladston and the largest single beneficiary of compensation after

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.990
abolition. I also have a professional identity. I used to do TV.

28
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.920
Don't do much these days.

29
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.780
I've only made three films in the last 20 years before that with my

30
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.360
brother, Mike, I wrote the book and made the series,

31
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.780
which told the Windrush story. First, today,

32
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.810
I occasionally write for newspapers and magazines,

33
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.000
but mostly I'm basically a boring businessman.

34
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.660
I chair a talent business called green park. And for the past four years,

35
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.470
I was president of the council of the John Lewis partnership.

36
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.440
I run a small data analytics businesses,

37
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.190
probably a legacy of my time as a chemist. When I was young,

38
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.860
I set all that out to try to explain why I come at this debate from the

39
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:35.150
way I do my background may explain some of what

40
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.610
I say.

41
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.850
I agree with some of what Don said, by the way,

42
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.870
identity is more important because it now represents some real interests.

43
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:52.340
That for the first time in many centuries has a voice

44
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.050
women. Obviously minorities.

45
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.580
When my father came here,

46
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.830
the family who lived across the road could afford to be friendly with us.

47
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.940
They knew that no matter how clever my dad was,

48
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.530
how hard he worked,

49
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.360
how ambitious he might be when it came to getting a job or a house or a

50
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:13.900
loan,

51
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.820
we would never be ahead of them in the cute that to divide it up from

52
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.810
them, not income, not the area we live, but that thing,

53
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.900
that thing, and by the way,

54
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.460
it's not just poor people of color who suffer because we're having an argument.

55
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.570
No doubt about class here.

56
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.050
When I was chairman of the commission for racial equality,

57
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.980
the people who were most effected,

58
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.960
who wept in my office were not young black men Harris by the police.

59
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.990
They were the teacher who knew that because he was

60
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:52.330
black oration. He would never become a department head.

61
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.400
The lawyer who knew that no matter how clever

62
00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:03.300
she was and how hard she worked, she was never going to take silk.

63
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.630
And the doctors who knew that they would always be junior

64
00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:11.610
doctors and never consultants.

65
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.390
They had done everything that this society after them, everything,

66
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.450
but the prison of their skin kept them in the place

67
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.940
that meant they would never,

68
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.820
never reap the rewards of their diligence.

69
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.610
So I understand all of that. And if that's all that the identity politics about

70
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.890
what's it be short debate, we can all say we agree.

71
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.030
Some other things that it shouldn't, it it's not about.

72
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.400
I'm senior vice president who wrote and moved

73
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:52.260
and persuaded the annual conference in 1973 to adopt the no

74
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.280
platform policy. We wanted to keep fascist of campus.

75
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.140
Nobody today thinks that Jermaine Greer or Julie bindle should be in that

76
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:03.000
category. We can agree about that.

77
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.780
Nobody today thinks that white men should continue staging the sit-in

78
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:14.010
they do in the boardrooms of our great companies, except them.

79
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.100
We don't have to have an argument about that.

80
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.070
And nobody believes that it's okay to abuse public

81
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:26.520
figures. I got my first bag full of hate mail.

82
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.740
When I became the NUS president in 1978,

83
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.400
I was 24 years old and I had a whole bag full of it,

84
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.320
including a charming cartoon, which drew my own lynching.

85
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.650
Nobody will argue that that should be part of our politics.

86
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.710
So I don't think we need to devote a lot of time to all of that,

87
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.940
nor should we spend a lot of time comforting ourselves with the thought that

88
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.601
we're virtuous.

89
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.230
And there are folks out there who want the fact that none of us is Nigel

90
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:57.830
Farrage. Doesn't let us off the, on this issue,

91
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.500
clever and nice people can be racist to Albert Einstein

92
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.600
Caldwell, the Chinese and industrious filthy opportunities. People.

93
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.060
One of my friends and somebody I admire in politics

94
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.730
once called on the government.

95
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.660
He led to ensure British jobs for British workers.

96
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.680
We may tonight talk about institutional racism or sexism.

97
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.220
Stokely Carmichael came up with that phrase for a very specific reason.

98
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.870
It was a critique of Martin Luther King Carmichael said that point,

99
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.820
where he was making was that racism was so baked into society that you

100
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:40.730
could have a police force full of black angels,

101
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.370
and they might still be shooting black people.

102
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.260
Everybody said that don't be ridiculous.

103
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.120
50 years on the killings of young black men all over the USA,

104
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.830
often by black police officers says that Carmichael was

105
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.780
right. So tonight this is really for me about politics and its place in society.

106
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.120
There's only one reason for politics to exist.

107
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.680
And that is to help us solve problems. Now for over a century and a half,

108
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:10.730
our political architectures followed economic and social divisions workers to

109
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:12.680
the left bosses, to the right,

110
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.020
but we're in an era of extreme, possibly unprecedented disruption.

111
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.180
And the real tribal divide in our society symbolize the deepest differences

112
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:24.950
about what kind of people we want to be.

113
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.970
I'm a remainer pro globalization,

114
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.490
massively pro immigration pro technology,

115
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:34.940
socially liberal London centric you'd expect that,

116
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.060
but I don't disrespect my many relatives who live in say Essex or Nottingham who

117
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:45.230
feel just as passionately, anti-globalization cautious about immigration.

118
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.490
And that includes my black relatives, anti digitization,

119
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.250
and who load London's arrogance,

120
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.100
a survey taken after the referendum asked about people's attitudes to

121
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.100
various topics on the economy on capitalism.

122
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.280
There was absolutely no difference between remainers and leavers.

123
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:07.880
51% thought capitalism was a force for ill,

124
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.200
49% force for good asked about multiculturalism

125
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.940
71% of remainers thought it was a force for good

126
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.150
81% of leavers thought it was a force for ill.

127
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.380
60% of remainers were pro feminism lower than I expect.

128
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.620
74% of leaders were against feminism.

129
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.080
My point is it is these issues of identity that are dividing

130
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:36.710
us. This debate is really about one thing.

131
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.610
Identity politics is a politics that is tearing our society

132
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:46.340
apart. I think that's objectively true,

133
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.710
but perhaps where I differ with the other panelists possibly including

134
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:55.890
Lionel, is that they will all lament this fat. I don't,

135
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.900
I think it is a wonderful thing.

136
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.180
Appellants confront the world with timidity and the hope that the existing

137
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:07.980
political architecture can be tweaked and twisted into coping Polly Toynbee

138
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:10.890
versus Richard Little John labor versus Tori.

139
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.300
None of that worked for me or for 60% of the British people who say there is

140
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:19.080
nobody I can vote for. If you really believe in liberation,

141
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.430
this is going to be a struggle.

142
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.650
What makes you think that the straight white propertied men are going to give it

143
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:26.880
up without a fight?

144
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.160
Our society will be torn apart in order to get justice.

145
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.190
We need a political map.

146
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.840
Now that allows us to represent the true divisions in our society.

147
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.340
One of my daughters said to me,

148
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:44.460
when I told her what it was going to say tonight, Oh,

149
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.410
I see you're channeling Samuel L. Jackson. What the hell do you mean?

150
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.690
Well, she said Sam would just get up and he'd say this everything's

151
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.420
changing. Politics has got to change too.

152
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.720
Let's just tear this mother down and start something new.

153
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

154
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.950
<v 2>Thank you very much, Trevor. Fortunately,</v>

155
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.650
this isn't being broadcast live on the BBC,

156
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.510
cause there's quite a lot of bad language. I feel.
