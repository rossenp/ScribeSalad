00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.383
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.590
<v 1>Well, thank you very much to all of you. There was so much to think about that.</v>

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.670
I want to begin by actually picking up that last point that Tony made.

4
00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:17.990
If I may with you for harder, you're in a hurry, the motion says it all.

5
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:22.400
We're talking about climate collapse. Why worry about overturning the system?

6
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:23.780
Why not work with what you've got?

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.910
Because we've been trying for 30 years to have legally binding targets and caps

8
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:31.790
and they haven't happened. So it's not like we've not,

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.950
not thought about any of these things. You know,

10
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:38.210
we've got to the point of rebellion because we've understood that the system

11
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:42.920
cannot create the solutions that are necessary for its own transformation in a

12
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.410
more sort of elegant way. Audrey Lord,

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.120
who is a feminist poet thinker, strategist, um, you know,

14
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.530
so said it very nicely.

15
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:55.430
Actually she said for the master's tools will never dismantle the master's

16
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:59.990
house. They may allow us to temporarily beat him as his own game,

17
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.140
but they will never enable us to buy genuine change.

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.700
That's my insight from the last 30 years, we've been banging our heads,

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.630
trying to do exactly these things and the very industries,

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.650
the very countries that are dependent then on these industries cause entire

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.510
countries are then dependent on some of the largest industries

22
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.670
are not making the change. I did want to add one more, very large subsidy,

23
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.740
which is the military. So fossil fuel, you know,

24
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:34.970
takes place now largely in hugely authoritarian regimes.

25
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:39.260
The destruction of nature is backed by a fist of force.

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.390
Nature, defenders are being killed and those regimes are held together.

27
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:47.270
That is an additional cost in the system.

28
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.870
And we don't talk about it and it requires radical change. It has had a,

29
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:53.960
you were a regulator in various different guises.

30
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.270
Why are we still having this conversation? Now,

31
00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.080
if it was possible to drive through the kind of change that that Tony was

32
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:00.914
talking about?

33
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.150
<v 2>Well, because we didn't win the argument, but we've got to win the argument.</v>

34
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:09.080
But I think the challenge for George and for Harner is they say we failed to win

35
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:11.600
these arguments in the past lobbying.

36
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.170
And the power of money has prevented having tight enough,

37
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.930
a rules and regulations.

38
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.420
So we're going to abolish capitalism,

39
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.630
but you're going to have to win the argument for bullishing capitalism.

40
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.770
Why is it going to be easier to win the argument for abolishing capitalism than

41
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:29.990
to win the argument for regulating capitalism?

42
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370
The point is we've got to win the argument and once we've won the argument and

43
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.130
got the legally binding targets that Tony talks about,

44
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.210
we will then find that having a market place,

45
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.740
which helps you work out the details of it will be better than having public

46
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.740
ownership of the means of production and distribution and exchange.

47
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.820
Because I do think it is incumbent on for Hannah and George to say what the

48
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:56.300
alternative is. It's very easy to say, we hate capitalism.

49
00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:00.130
It's not going to work. The alternative is public ownership of the means.

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.660
<v 3>Of production of distribution exchange.</v>

51
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.710
And we know that when that was applied in Eastern Europe and Russia,

52
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.680
the environmental impacts of that were far,

53
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.050
far worse than the impacts of capitalism.

54
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.900
You began to talk about a possible alternative.

55
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.080
Do you want to expand on this private sufficiency public luxury?

56
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.330
<v 4>Yeah, so, so the principle of it is it's not state control. I'm not a communist.</v>

57
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.700
You know, there's this assumption that if you're against capitalism,

58
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:26.070
you have to be a communism as if a communist is,

59
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:30.240
if there's only two options in this fascinating and complex world,

60
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.610
but the massively neglected sphere of the economy and the one

61
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:40.260
which delivers both equity and environmental protection is the one that no one

62
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.150
ever talks about, which is the commons.

63
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.900
We discuss this as if there's only two kinds of economy,

64
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.260
there's the market and there's the state, but actually the commons,

65
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.320
which is used to be huge is huge.

66
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:56.910
In some people's lives is a bit where we control what goes on around us.

67
00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:59.700
Neither. The state does it. Neither the market does it.

68
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.800
We can control public services. We can control land. Um, we,

69
00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:09.660
the local communities are able then to exercise far more power

70
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:13.830
in decision-making than we can under either of those other systems,

71
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.270
either capitalism or communism, both take power away from us.

72
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:22.350
I'm all for taking back control, but not in the way that Dominic Cummings here.

73
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.990
<v 3>Tony Juniper, come on. What's,</v>

74
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:27.540
what's wrong with that kind of regulation where it's not regulation,

75
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:30.600
it's real people running their own lives and making their own decisions.

76
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.860
<v 5>I've spent much of my career trying to correct a phenomenon called the tragedy</v>

77
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:39.070
of the commons, uh, whereby leaving people to have their own, uh,

78
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:41.460
agenda in terms of how they manage natural resources,

79
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:44.520
leads to them being trashed, whether that's the logging of forests,

80
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.430
the exploitation of fish stocks, or in this country,

81
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:51.270
the trashing of the uplands by sheep grazers who have Cominos rights.

82
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.530
So it's not necessarily a solution to this particular set of challenges.

83
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.850
It can go badly wrong.

84
00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:00.720
If it's not regulated that it's not under some kind of legal control based upon

85
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:04.380
some kind of ecological outcome that all of society subscribes to.

86
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.300
I would say that we're far better to have the imposition by governments of

87
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.140
legally binding caps on the missions, along the recovery of nature,

88
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.710
and to use a variety of tools, to be able to achieve those ends,

89
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.430
including some of those tools, which are at the center of the capitalist system.

90
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.190
I'm not against people having common rights,

91
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.160
but I just don't see that that would be a solution that would replace

92
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:26.994
capitalism.

93
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.330
<v 4>This is a completely discredited notion. I mean,</v>

94
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:34.710
it's been totally destroyed and ripped down. And what Garrett Hardin, who,

95
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.300
who proposed that idea did was to confuse an open access regime with a

96
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:43.290
genuine commons where there is control. There is regulation by the people,

97
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.820
the fundamental thing that both Tony and that air are fighting against all the

98
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:50.820
time. The question why this hasn't happened already.

99
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.010
<v 3>Despite decades and decades of efforts is that capitalism.</v>

100
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 4>Not only is an economic system. It becomes a political system as well.</v>

101
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.860
It empowers those politically.

102
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:08.360
It empowers people who gain the Pruett's of capitalism and they

103
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.910
prevent this change from taking place.

104
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.550
That's why we're in the fixed in Finland.

105
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.591
<v 2>Well,</v>

106
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:19.300
they presented it in Finland as a capitalist economy is a capitalistic economy

107
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:23.740
with a social democratic government now committed to zero carbon by 2035.

108
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.330
Why isn't that an attractive capitalist fund?

109
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.790
<v 1>Yeah, so we can, you know, there are many types of capitalism.</v>

110
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.140
It's not one thing or another, there are slightly better versions out there.

111
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:39.310
And I think the issue is that even the slightly better versions cannot really

112
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:43.810
get to grips with the scale and rapidity with which we need to

113
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:48.370
change. They're all locked in now. They can't do it even like nice, nice Norway.

114
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.110
Let's look at nice Norway, mice, Norway just had a legal ruling,

115
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.450
which said, which was, you know,

116
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.580
they were taken to court by the domestic NGOs for more drilling in the Arctic,

117
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.470
more drilling in the Arctic, nice Norway here saying, you know,

118
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.540
we're the better drillers cause we have higher standards than those baddie

119
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:13.870
ones. You know, out in Venice, they're still drilling.

120
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.230
They're still drilling like the one of the richest countries in the world.

121
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.270
Another example that I would love you to look up the Amazonian,

122
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.280
Amazon sacred headwaters,

123
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.800
an area larger than the size of the UK with a little bit of Wales added

124
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.960
a huge area, huge area, three different countries own it. Peru,

125
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.460
Ecuador, Brazil.

126
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.870
This area is pristine in his home to indigenous people,

127
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:44.140
many millions of them who have lived there in harmony,

128
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.300
looked after their forest.

129
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.470
And now it's being opened up to drilling and oil.

130
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.290
You tell me how you fix our system now,

131
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:56.980
because that says that entire area is about to go, uh, during,

132
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.960
unless we're talking about, there is no way to stop capitalism from doing that

133
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.480
[inaudible] to rip it out.

134
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.700
<v 2>Well, I mean, for Hannah, you said it,</v>

135
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.440
there are many different forms of capitalism and capitalism can have new

136
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:14.890
deals. Capitalism can have new ways of doing it,

137
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:18.970
which can involve significant roles for the state alongside the private sector.

138
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:21.580
You use this term new deal. We all use the term new deal.

139
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.640
The new deal was afraid of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

140
00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:28.720
who I think was the greatest American president of the last century.

141
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.070
Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not say he was anticapitalist indeed.

142
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:37.720
What he introduced by his policies was the absolute glory days of capitalism,

143
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.350
where it delivered what capitalism can deliver more effectively than ever

144
00:08:41.351 --> 00:08:45.880
before. And we can win these arguments and we have to because the alternative,

145
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.670
if you simply come forward in the political process and say,

146
00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:50.650
we're going to reject capitalism, frankly,

147
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:54.040
I think it will makes it less likely that we will get the tough measures

148
00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:56.070
required to the change we needed.

149
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.030
<v 6>Indeed.</v>

150
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.550
<v 3>Now we're going to, we're going to, there's so much to talk about.</v>

151
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.490
Everyone's bursting to talk. Uh,

152
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.060
we're going to open the debate up to all of you before we do that.

153
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.510
I just want to reveal the results of the pre vote.

154
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.400
That's how you voted when you came in.

155
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.110
So 38% of you are for the motion to stop climate collapse.

156
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:17.370
We missed an capitalism.

157
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.290
28% are against and 34% are undecided.

158
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:24.060
So you're the ones that, uh,

159
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.890
the panel has to persuade that we all have to watch. So we'll go to the floor.

160
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:30.570
This is your chance to take part.

161
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.713
<v 6>Hello.</v>

162
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.870
<v 2>My question really relates to some of the examples that have been given</v>

163
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.830
of the countries, whether it's Finland or Norway. I mean,

164
00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:47.120
frankly in the great scheme of things, rather small in terms of population.

165
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.280
If we look at the very large populous economies

166
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.720
of Asia,

167
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.550
of India and of Africa and ask the questions of

168
00:09:58.551 --> 00:10:02.720
how you end capitalism or end

169
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.260
consumerism in those societies,

170
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.180
some are democratic,

171
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:13.190
some are not democratic that just doesn't seem to be addressed.

172
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.160
We also have the other major economy of the United States,

173
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.320
which seems to have gone off on a sort of private and rather peculiar mission of

174
00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:22.154
its own.

175
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.670
<v 3>Okay, let's have the second question number two over there.</v>

176
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.050
<v 7>So I'm not entirely sure that I agree with either side of this question,</v>

177
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:37.410
but most of this is, is directed towards the pro side of the question. I mean,

178
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.580
it's, as it was, was sort of brought out, I mean,

179
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.140
is that a reasonable estimate of what

180
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.670
fossil fuels are subsidized for is 5.6 trillion? I mean, it's, I've seen that.

181
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.860
And it was also sort of brought out that the cost of renewable energy

182
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.690
has dropped enormously. And in fact, I mean, it's,

183
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.750
I think that the most reasonable conclusion is that renewable energy now

184
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.240
is less expensive than fossil energy. So given those two things,

185
00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:09.200
I mean, just that,

186
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.420
is this really a political question in the sense of just convincing people

187
00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:16.550
to withdraw these subsidies,

188
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.530
that and remove the restraints on allowing

189
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.360
renewable energy to come forward?

190
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.400
Or is it an economic question where you need to overturn the

191
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:29.450
entire system?

192
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.250
So I would think that that really comes down to something that's very

193
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:37.020
simple. Just you, you get out of the way. I mean,

194
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.640
just to end the problem solves itself. Okay. Thank you. And number three.

195
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.020
<v 6>So I had the question to both sides, which was, um,</v>

196
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.320
the pro side said that, uh, if we include,

197
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.560
continue with economic growth in order to let people out of poverty,

198
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:55.480
we're going to go straight into, uh, that's gonna huge heavy sheet and actually,

199
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.570
um, our resources and our environmental boundaries.

200
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.660
How do we practically bring beyond poverty while we'll say,

201
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.190
and while not having economic growth and then to the against side,

202
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.070
how do we bring back that poverty with economic growth,

203
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:13.330
with growth while not growing our current emissions in the global North?

204
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.620
<v 3>Thank you very much. So, uh,</v>

205
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.430
the comparisons with Finland and Norway not really relevant when you think about

206
00:12:20.431 --> 00:12:23.370
the populations of places like Asia and Africa, who, you know,

207
00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:26.610
how do you end capitalism when those people want to consume what the standards

208
00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:30.360
of living that perhaps we've enjoyed the cost of renewables has gone down.

209
00:12:30.361 --> 00:12:34.380
Is this a political question about convincing people to withdraw subsidies or an

210
00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:39.210
economic question about overturning the system and how do you bring down poverty

211
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.620
without growth or equally? How do you save the cloud? Save the environment,

212
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.230
uh, at the expense of, uh,

213
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:51.390
and yet actually allow people to move out of poverty. George,

214
00:12:51.391 --> 00:12:52.224
do you want to go first?

215
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.600
<v 4>Sure. I mean,</v>

216
00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:58.170
it's interesting picking up the contrast between the U S and Finland,

217
00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:01.890
as you say, the U S far more powerful. I mean, overall, globally,

218
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.680
capitalism's becoming more extreme, not less extreme.

219
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.640
We've moved away from the social democratic era of capitalism,

220
00:13:08.641 --> 00:13:13.110
the Keynesian version of capitalism towards this extreme neoliberal market

221
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:14.880
fundamentalist version of capitalism.

222
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:18.990
And the reason for that is that capitalism generates its own momentum.

223
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.600
People gain power under the system,

224
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.110
and they play the system with the use of that power.

225
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.060
Are we seeing any of the things we want to see happening? No, we're not,

226
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:34.260
not nothing nowhere near the scale that we need to see them on

227
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.650
because to go to the second question,

228
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.300
because of the sunk costs already invested by large capitalist

229
00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:45.750
enterprises, be it Exxon or BP or whoever it might be,

230
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.020
they have got their investments, which they are trying to protect.

231
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:54.120
And they use political means like funding Donald Trump or

232
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:58.800
Scott Morrison or Jaya both Sinero in order to protect those

233
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:03.150
investments. And they gain control over the system as a whole.

234
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.750
So for years and years, all four of us on this panel, you know,

235
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.380
and I applaud and salute at Aaron, Tony for all their efforts.

236
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.850
We've been trying to fight this system from within, are we winning? No,

237
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.100
we are failing spectacularly because you cannot fight it from within

238
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.240
because it generates its own power. This is why we need to be pressing.

239
00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:28.590
And with this, this is an effort of global persuasion to say,

240
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.550
we have to fight this from, without, by demanding and creating a new system.

241
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.220
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

242
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.000
<v 6>Pick up the point about small and large population countries. In fact,</v>

243
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.250
uh, the greatest part of my focus this year is on the de-carbonization of the

244
00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:52.010
Chinese economy. I'll be spending about.

245
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.230
<v 2>Six weeks in total in China,</v>

246
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.620
probably not in the next couple of weeks has been a little,

247
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.890
a little little delay in the launch of our next thing.

248
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.230
And what we are trying to do there is to persuade China that it

249
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:11.090
could be a zero carbon economy by 2050 Zetia ping

250
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:14.540
has a phrase, China 2050, a fully developed rich economy.

251
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.720
And we have recently produced a report called China 2050,

252
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:20.000
a fully developed rich zero carbon economy.

253
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.890
Now is China a capitalist or socialist country company economy it's called

254
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.390
locally a economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

255
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.220
Um, some people think it would be better to be called a capitalist economy with

256
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.920
Chinese characteristics. It's a funny mix,

257
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.050
but it has a very dynamic private sector. The solar PV panels,

258
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:44.900
the, the, uh, the batteries,

259
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.310
the EVs are all being developed by amazingly dynamic, uh,

260
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.660
Chinese entrepreneurs overlapping with a state sector.

261
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.800
Many of which of those state-owned companies almost act as if they were private

262
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:01.280
companies in the terms of the way they look after the managers of those.

263
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:04.070
So it's, it's a complicated thing to understand,

264
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:08.120
but it is certainly a form of market economy with many of the aspects of

265
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:11.300
capitalism to it. It's still building coal fire. And I have to say,

266
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.530
if I turned up, well, let me come back to that. If I turned up there and said,

267
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:20.240
okay, guys, what you have to do is to reject capitalism,

268
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.370
we'd get nowhere, right? What happens in China is fundamental.

269
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.680
Their emissions are now 10 gigatons of CO2, 12 gigatons,

270
00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:32.450
including the other greenhouse gases.

271
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.640
Ours are 450 and falling even on a per capita basis.

272
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.880
They are going above UK and European levels.

273
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.740
And to win the argument in China, there is only one way to do it,

274
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:51.200
which is to convince them that it is technologically possible for them to be

275
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.510
a proud, rich developed society.

276
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.480
In which Chinese people enjoy the opportunities,

277
00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:58.370
the economic opportunities that we enjoy,

278
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.110
that it's technologically possible to do that and be a zero carbon economy.

279
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.860
That's how you have to win it. And in order to deliver it,

280
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.630
you also have to use powerful market economy techniques involving

281
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.010
entrepreneurs competing with one another to drive down the cost of batteries,

282
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:18.470
to drive down the cost of electrolysis equipment,

283
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.840
to drive down the cost of solar PV.

284
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.590
So I think when you look at that large population country,

285
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:28.070
whereas I say that is where most of my focus is this year.

286
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.690
I would say the idea that we have to approach this issue by suggesting the

287
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:36.110
rejection of capitalism is just completely the wrong way to go.

288
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.560
<v 1>I'm going to pause you there. Cause for Honda wants to come in. Yeah.</v>

289
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.290
On the question of subsidies. So in 2009,

290
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:45.460
the biggest richest countries in the world that G seven came together and agreed

291
00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:49.470
to phase out fossil fuel subsidies 2009. Okay.

292
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:52.770
So that's why I'm convinced that coming together and trying to get these

293
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:53.401
agreements,

294
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:58.320
which then are negated is impossible in this system without

295
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:02.580
something else happening. And that's something else happening is first of all,

296
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:07.140
I think my opponents need to accept the failures of the system.

297
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.600
And that's why I'm here to convince you,

298
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:14.040
but also to convince them to have a little bit of a wake up

299
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:18.540
moment, a little bit of a tournament, a little bit of a yes,

300
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:23.310
we failed because we did not recognize the magnitude of the

301
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:28.230
political weight and the magnitude of the problems can not be fixed

302
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:30.090
with techno managerial solutions.

303
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.820
The second point I want to make is about populations.

304
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.980
So many of the countries that you suggested,

305
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:38.940
many of the continents that you suggested have extremely low per capita

306
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:43.020
emissions is not the size of the populations that matters.

307
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.580
It's their consumption,

308
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.290
whether they're doing it within their own countries or offshoring it

309
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.280
actually elsewhere.

310
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:53.850
So China's emissions are mainly coming from us and consumption by us.

311
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:59.720
<v 3>Is coming. You can't say something, which is just not true on a 10% off.</v>

312
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.620
Let me finish. Let me finish. Well, that's 10% is still allowable,

313
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.740
but it's not, it's not most, it's not.

314
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.400
<v 1>But it's the richest people in the,</v>

315
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:15.230
in this country that are responsible for the bulk of the UK is emissions.

316
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.270
So the bottom 75% remember the pyramid of

317
00:19:20.271 --> 00:19:23.900
extraction. They don't fly, they don't have cars,

318
00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:28.040
they don't have second homes. They don't have the kind of luxury lifestyles.

319
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:33.200
So I think we need to not keep looking at whether it's population that's the

320
00:19:33.201 --> 00:19:38.150
driver. And I think Tony's also very fixated on population as the driver of

321
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.090
destruction is actually this extractive system,

322
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.520
which accumulates for the benefit of.

323
00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.490
<v 3>There's a whole queue of people up there with questions. Tony,</v>

324
00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:49.460
I'm going to give you a last chance just to go back to the questions on some of

325
00:19:49.461 --> 00:19:49.910
the points.

326
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.840
<v 5>So I'm, I'm,</v>

327
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.770
I'm in total agreement with this idea that we need to change the system,

328
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.130
but there are two really important questions that you must answer.

329
00:19:58.131 --> 00:20:01.880
When you say that number one is change the system to what,

330
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.090
and then the second bit is how do you change the system?

331
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.080
And so we need a clear pathway between here and where we're going to go next.

332
00:20:09.081 --> 00:20:12.740
And if we're going to go somewhere where we're going to want to take 7.7 billion

333
00:20:12.741 --> 00:20:17.240
people with us, we have to have an offer that is both realistic and attractive,

334
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:22.250
and which has got some means of garnering political and democratic support for

335
00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:26.360
it. And so we have to be very clear. I have thought about this a fair bit.

336
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:31.130
And I think that probably our best chance in the 10 years that we've got left is

337
00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:35.000
to adapt the existing system into something that can start to look like it's

338
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:36.380
ecologically sustainable.

339
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.880
If we just push it into the margins,

340
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.430
what do we finish up with? We finish up with a lot of chaos.

341
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.440
We finish up probably was unemployment.

342
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.000
We finish up possibly people not having energy or food,

343
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:52.570
literally because all of those things are presently delivered by capitalist

344
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:57.160
organizations and without a pathway between here and what we want to change too.

345
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.450
I think we're going to be wasting our time far better to advocate the change in

346
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:05.050
the existing system. Let's change the hard caps in law.

347
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.800
Let's change the subsidy regime. Let's put a carbon tax in place.

348
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.760
Let's give capitalism of purpose and let's change the measure of GDP to

349
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:15.250
something which is more about what society needs.

350
00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:16.360
Let's take some more questions.

351
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:21.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

352
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.720
<v 5>I'm going to go, just to say the final vote is taking place.</v>

353
00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:28.200
So hopefully you've all put your cards in and if you're still undecided,

354
00:21:28.201 --> 00:21:30.210
you put the whole card in. If you're not, they're all there,

355
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.550
I'm going to go up to the balcony and take three from up there.

356
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.550
So go for it and be brief. Cause we're not a lot of time.

357
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:40.710
<v 6>Tony's five point plan seems precise and pragmatic.</v>

358
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.240
Please can Farhana and George respond in a meaningful,

359
00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:49.620
engaged way to those points and

360
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.930
clarify to what extent that plan could

361
00:21:54.931 --> 00:21:59.670
achieve your stated, uh, future goal. Thank you.

362
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.600
<v 8>Uh, I actually agree that Tony's plan sounds great.</v>

363
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.710
And I think both Tony and Adair have admitted that for capitalism to win this

364
00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:12.390
argument, capitalism needs to change.

365
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:16.620
The big challenge is who's going to change it. Who's going to force that change.

366
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.010
I mean, who here trusts the politicians of his country to run a bath,

367
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.730
nevermind change policy, the capitalists themselves,

368
00:22:23.731 --> 00:22:26.940
these companies that the Belmonts of capitalism have known the science,

369
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.893
not for 10 years,

370
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.740
don't known for 50 years and they've done nothing about it that she counteracted

371
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.790
what they need to do.

372
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.490
So who is going to actually realistically make that change?

373
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.890
That's what you need to convince us that we're going to come with you on this.

374
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.053
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

375
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.540
[inaudible].

376
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.120
<v 9>Um, so I'm a mum of three and, um,</v>

377
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.820
I think I'm going to ask a question that my kids would probably want to know the

378
00:22:50.821 --> 00:22:54.210
answer to, um, which is, so if 70,

379
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.600
if there's 100 companies that are responsible for 70% of CO2 emissions,

380
00:22:57.601 --> 00:23:01.500
since the 1980s, um, the people at the top of these companies,

381
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.800
why don't they care? Are they psychopaths?

382
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.550
And the government has said that they support. W yeah. And secondly, um,

383
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.030
I want to ask for a gut feeling here from you guys. Um,

384
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.660
maybe a little bit of hope for me please. Um, have we got this?

385
00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:22.650
Can we apply the brakes in time? Um, or, or my kids who are eight, six,

386
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:23.310
and four,

387
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.090
going to die prematurely in some kind of climate related war over resources.

388
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.003
Thank you.

389
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:33.960
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

390
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.140
<v 5>I'm going to start at this end of the table just for change Adair Turner.</v>

391
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.350
<v 6>Let me answer that final question. Um,</v>

392
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.030
Graham ski said you must be a pessimistic of the,

393
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.610
but optimistic.

394
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.443
<v 2>Of the will.</v>

395
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:52.310
You must carefully work out what your chances of success are with a

396
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:55.520
bias to pessimism so that you are realistic,

397
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.590
but then you must try and change those chances.

398
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.320
I am 100% convinced that if there were

399
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.430
a benign deity again above us,

400
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.440
and if she sent angels in the night to steal all our fossil fuels by

401
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:17.390
2050, that we would by then build a zero carbon economy.

402
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.680
And that we would hardly notice the cost of getting there on economic standards

403
00:24:21.681 --> 00:24:26.450
of living. I think there's about a 30% chance that we will do that.

404
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.471
And my frayed,

405
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:32.420
my blunt belief is that the 70% chance we're probably going to fail.

406
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.060
So my aim in life is to turn 30 to 31 to 32 to 33 in

407
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:42.230
Europe, particularly in India and in China where I work.

408
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.100
But in order to shift it from 31 to 32 to 33,

409
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.690
I think turning up and saying that the thing to do is to reject capitalism

410
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.070
rather than reform. It is likely to reduce the probabilities that will,

411
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.330
I will increase that from 31 to 32 to 33, rather than increase it.

412
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.130
But that I'm afraid is my honest assessment of the

413
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:05.630
odds as we face them.

414
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.400
<v 4>And what about the question about do those companies simply not care?</v>

415
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.833
I think it.

416
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.960
<v 2>I think, uh, they're all fossil fuel companies,</v>

417
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:17.890
which now take the science very seriously. Um,

418
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.100
and I think there are others and I'm not going to name which they are, uh,

419
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.810
which really don't at all. I think, uh, there isn't a,

420
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.870
a unified approach within the fossil fuel companies, the world.

421
00:25:28.871 --> 00:25:32.740
I think there's quite a spectrum of different points of view. No, no look,

422
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:34.000
they are fossil fuel companies,

423
00:25:34.001 --> 00:25:36.940
but some of them want to get out of fossil fuels and some don't, some are,

424
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.170
some of them are denying the science and others are not denying.

425
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.080
<v 4>Okay.</v>

426
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.050
So let's take the ones who aren't denying the science like shell and BP shell

427
00:25:47.051 --> 00:25:50.470
won't even tell me what its investments are in renewables.

428
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:54.370
They do not feature in its annual report because they are so tiny.

429
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.050
Instead it is trying to invest as much in fossil fuels this year,

430
00:25:59.051 --> 00:26:01.780
as it invested last year and the year before and the year before,

431
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.430
it's trying to maintain those investments because that's where the value of its

432
00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:07.900
capital is.

433
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.190
We asked why don't these people care that people might care.

434
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.470
The system does not care.

435
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.540
They have a fiduciary duty towards the investors in that system to maximize the

436
00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:23.590
value of their investment. That is the central premise of capitalism.

437
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.850
What are Aaron Tonio trying to do is to take a system, which has,

438
00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:30.850
I hope I demonstrated at the beginning is innate sleep.

439
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.290
Unsustainable innately drives us towards disaster and says,

440
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.460
let's turn it round and make it sustainable. It is innately,

441
00:26:39.461 --> 00:26:44.100
destined not to be, they are chasing unicorns and.

442
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.750
<v 2>I hope you haven't voted for them.</v>

443
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.430
<v 1>Hold on a very brief, one more question. Absolutely.</v>

444
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.850
You're absolutely right.

445
00:26:55.851 --> 00:27:00.830
That many of these companies knew they've known for 40 years and their

446
00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:04.490
strategy was to obfuscate, deny and delay.

447
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.590
Every month they delay is usually millions of pounds.

448
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.280
That's why I told you about what Saudi Aramco does. Its strategy,

449
00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:16.970
literally second per second, delay of the inevitable.

450
00:27:16.971 --> 00:27:21.740
And they have huge power. These industries to stop that they are on trial.

451
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.820
Lawyers are taking them. Citizens are taking them to court.

452
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.740
I hope as a lawyer,

453
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.400
those legal processes will deliver justice.

454
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:36.500
I hope that the opinions like this debate will show

455
00:27:36.501 --> 00:27:39.380
to those CEOs and everyone who's in touch with them,

456
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:44.390
that they are failing humanity and their legacy will be one of

457
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.920
destruction. Okay. So that's what I'm saying, but I, I feel,

458
00:27:48.921 --> 00:27:52.700
I want to say now eco side is what is happening.

459
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.020
It fits the facts.

460
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.170
I want to take one more question from the floor because as for Hannah rightly

461
00:27:57.171 --> 00:27:59.120
pointed out to me, we only heard from one woman.

462
00:27:59.121 --> 00:28:01.460
So I'm going to go to the woman in the yellow jumper there.

463
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.820
Wait for the microphones just behind you. Very briefly as you can, because,

464
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.880
sorry, I only said that because you wanted to women. Um, the question,

465
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:15.890
the question I have to stand, sorry. Um, the question I have, I, I think is,

466
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:20.870
you know, China has had a benevolent dictator for two and a half thousand years.

467
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.960
He's the man you have to persuade president.

468
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.730
She has a control of such a fast potential.

469
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.640
You know, when they wanted to reduce their population,

470
00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:34.820
they introduced a one child policy. They did it overnight.

471
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.140
They can create change overnight more or less.

472
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.290
So president she is the man that you have to talk to.

473
00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:45.710
I think there's an invitation to data.

474
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.050
<v 2>Let me just get out my mobile phone.</v>

475
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.750
<v 1>Is it fair to put it all at the, uh, the foot of president Xi?</v>

476
00:28:53.751 --> 00:28:56.060
This is a very middle-class conversation in some ways,

477
00:28:56.061 --> 00:28:59.000
isn't it about us just to bring it back here in the UK.

478
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.630
Is it fair for us to ask those countries over there to change their ways?

479
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.060
We're we're not prepared to change ours very briefly?

480
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.760
<v 2>Well, the answer is in this country,</v>

481
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.320
I raised issues about people's lifestyle, right?

482
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:20.270
About what I or other people have done in terms of their transport choices,

483
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.610
their diet choices. I mean, that's a legitimate here.

484
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:27.440
I don't raise those issues in China because at the moment they have a GDP per

485
00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:29.030
capita at about a third of us.

486
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.210
So I don't think it's appropriate to raise those issues when they're still at

487
00:29:32.211 --> 00:29:36.620
that level. I think you're broadly, right? That China is not a complete,

488
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.890
it's actually got more decentralized power structures. And you might think,

489
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.030
and it has some coal lobbies, which by the way,

490
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:48.160
aren't state owned coal lobbies preventing some of the

491
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:50.200
move towards renewable energy,

492
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.770
which is primarily driven by private entrepreneurs.

493
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:55.780
That happens to be the way round in China,

494
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.030
but we do have to try and influence the Chinese power structure.

495
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.400
The good news is there's lots of,

496
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.410
there's lots of bad news about the Chinese power structure,

497
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.330
but it is a technocratic scientific structure that believes in

498
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:14.770
experts. So when their scientific experts say climate change is for real,

499
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.570
the image glam glasses are going to melt.

500
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.710
This is going to do terrible things to our river flows. They take it seriously.

501
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.420
So one has to work with that and see whether one can get more aggressive targets

502
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.180
for decarbonisation than those that are in place already.

503
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.680
<v 1>George or Ivana, who would like to answer.</v>

504
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.810
<v 5>That's such an easy question, I'll leave it to them.</v>

505
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.270
<v 1>I think, you know, we're always waiting for the right leader to come along.</v>

506
00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:44.130
And I feel that one of the mistakes of the past has too has been that

507
00:30:44.131 --> 00:30:47.970
we didn't involve people. We really didn't involve people.

508
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:52.860
A lot of these technical plans, a lot of these solutions were never tested on,

509
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.060
you know, tested with people and were they willing to accept that? So yes,

510
00:30:57.061 --> 00:31:00.480
leaders matter, I'm not saying that Chinese leadership doesn't matter,

511
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.900
but the leadership of people, the voice of people matters even more.

512
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.010
And that's why, for example,

513
00:31:05.011 --> 00:31:09.630
extinction rebellion has been very vociferous in demanding citizens'

514
00:31:09.631 --> 00:31:11.220
assemblies and selections.

515
00:31:11.221 --> 00:31:14.610
And I would say in response to the question about what are your alternatives,

516
00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:17.640
actually, you know, all of the executive boards,

517
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.750
all of the decision-making structures should now have mandatory

518
00:31:21.751 --> 00:31:25.440
representation of every cohort and of population.

519
00:31:25.441 --> 00:31:29.970
So there are pragmatic ways in which we can fix governance without going to

520
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.000
nationalization and ownership. This isn't about that.

521
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.910
You can put three,

522
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.710
three young people who sit on all of the decisions. Why not?

523
00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:44.610
You can have an ombuds person who looks after the rights of

524
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.720
citizens. Those who are excluded from, from voting,

525
00:31:48.721 --> 00:31:52.380
who are literally not being seen and heard in the current voting system.

526
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.850
So there's lots of ways in which practically we can reform capitalism.

527
00:31:56.851 --> 00:31:58.170
But I think after that reform,

528
00:31:58.171 --> 00:32:02.850
it doesn't look like capitalism and it won't result in all of the egregious

529
00:32:02.851 --> 00:32:04.650
degradation that we've been talking about.

530
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.610
We're going to wrap up the questions there because as ever a time is short,

531
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.490
I think you've been taking part in the final vote.

532
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.570
There's some furious counting going on somewhere the motion,

533
00:32:15.571 --> 00:32:18.780
just to remind reminder, to stop climate collapse, we missed end capitalism.

534
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.370
We're going to hear final summing up speeches from our panel.

535
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.830
Tony Juniper, if I can ask you to go fast.

536
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.320
<v 5>Well, what I've heard this evening is not only a discussion about economics.</v>

537
00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:36.150
It's also been very much a discussion about politics and where power lies.

538
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:41.210
And if we are going to be able to change our in time to avoid climate

539
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:43.700
collapse and ecological catastrophe,

540
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.330
we are going to have to find ways of getting enough power behind the kinds of

541
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:52.010
alternatives that we think will work. The question was in the room this evening,

542
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.570
who will change it,

543
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.230
who was going to put in place the kinds of shifts that we need while I'm afraid.

544
00:32:57.231 --> 00:33:02.030
Ladies and gentlemen, the good news is that it's all of us through being voters,

545
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.450
through being activists, through being conveyors of ideas,

546
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.710
the fantastic work that George and Farhana have done over the years to raise

547
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:10.191
awareness,

548
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:14.270
to put inspiring ideas into the public space and then to demand action.

549
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.980
This is essential,

550
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.090
but at the same time as having increased citizen participation,

551
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.560
we have to have an idea of where we're going and what we're going to do.

552
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.080
We have 10 years remaining.

553
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.170
That's what the intergovernmental panel on climate change tells us,

554
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.160
nevermind the catastrophe that's unfolding in the tropical rainforests and the

555
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:38.060
coral reefs from parallel pressures being exerted on those places.

556
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.720
If we're going to be able to make the most of this small window of opportunity

557
00:33:41.721 --> 00:33:45.350
that remains, we have to work in the real world.

558
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.920
It's all very well condemning capitalism and saying it doesn't work.

559
00:33:48.921 --> 00:33:50.720
We all agree with its downsides.

560
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.680
What we have to have as a workable alternative that will get the backing of

561
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:58.790
voters is great. That China's got a more or less benevolent dictator,

562
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:03.740
but I really shutter to think of the idea of advocating dictatorship as a

563
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.730
solution to this.

564
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.090
There's some very bad experiences globally throughout the world.

565
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.870
As a result of that particular style of sorting problems out,

566
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:15.140
we have to educate citizens. We have to inspire them.

567
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.250
We have to get them to back. The kinds of policies that we know can work.

568
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.570
And those policies are embedded in the existing system that needs to change

569
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.560
fundamentally, but changing. It is going to work better than chucking it out.

570
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.110
<v 0>[Inaudible] over to you. So.</v>

571
00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:42.760
<v 1>I think there's so much agreement that the solutions are there and that a lot of</v>

572
00:34:42.761 --> 00:34:44.410
it is about political will,

573
00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.530
but I think the new system looks something like this.

574
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.700
I think land is massively taxed. Okay.

575
00:34:51.701 --> 00:34:54.940
Land isn't taxed at the moment what you do on it is taxed.

576
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.590
So land comes back into some kind of commonly held

577
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.540
concept. And I think British law, English law, common law has many,

578
00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:06.880
many brilliant ways in which we can do that.

579
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:11.440
Many of you live in flats where you have a lease and there's a

580
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.220
freehold. So we can construct many different ways in which we can,

581
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.660
all co-own things.

582
00:35:16.661 --> 00:35:21.220
And it's not all straight state-owned or owned for private profit.

583
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.040
We can put a young people,

584
00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:29.020
we can put lay people on all of the decision-making boards that there

585
00:35:29.021 --> 00:35:31.750
are in all forms of government. I live in Camden,

586
00:35:31.751 --> 00:35:33.430
we've already had a citizens assembly.

587
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.790
We've now experimenting with what we call a think and do.

588
00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.320
Pop-up where the community comes and collaborates.

589
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.770
They co-design and collaborate. That's what we're testing.

590
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:47.880
So it's far from a dictatorship it's far from this rather nasty model that

591
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:50.550
you're putting forward, which is, I think, you know,

592
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:55.020
we're still trapped in the mentality that we're all gonna go. If we, if we,

593
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:59.670
if we denounce capitalism that, you know, we're, we're pro Stalin or something,

594
00:35:59.671 --> 00:36:02.810
that's pretty much what people seem to think. And that's really not,

595
00:36:02.811 --> 00:36:03.644
not the case.

596
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.470
And we have a positive vision and that vision already exists and it's called the

597
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:11.460
sustainable development goals. And it's been adopted by every single country.

598
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:15.570
And it consists of interrelated 17 goals,

599
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.520
which all of society,

600
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.390
every human being means that they're not left behind from prosperity.

601
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:23.310
And it means that there's no competition,

602
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:28.290
no fake competition between people and nature between people in one country

603
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:31.860
or another we're working collaboratively together. All of that's been agreed.

604
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.380
The green economy is by and large already,

605
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:39.180
or already here actually generates more jobs. And you're not seeing it.

606
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:43.260
You're not hearing about it because they don't have the lobbying power to

607
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.020
influence, uh,

608
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:48.930
and pay for the kind of sophisticated ads for billions that you see from the

609
00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:50.790
fossil fuel industry, which is, you know,

610
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:54.210
faking it and doing greenwashing whilst doing business as usual.

611
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:59.190
So lots and lots of things to look forward to and nothing to lose

612
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:01.200
from stepping back from the edge.

613
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.100
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

614
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.710
<v 2>I think George posed the fundamental question.</v>

615
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:17.660
Is there something structural in the very definition of capitalism so

616
00:37:17.661 --> 00:37:20.840
that it is bound to be environmentally destructive?

617
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.800
And I think Tony put the argument very effectively against,

618
00:37:24.801 --> 00:37:29.750
because he set out a five point plan of believable things that you

619
00:37:29.751 --> 00:37:30.584
could do,

620
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:35.180
which if you put them in place would have a capitalist

621
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.640
economy, which would be environmentally sound,

622
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.780
a capitalist economy in the only meaningful sense of a capitalist economy,

623
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.780
which is that most firms would be privately owned.

624
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.550
There are restaurants would be privately owned.

625
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.120
All hotel companies privately owned our car manufacturers are battery

626
00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:50.954
manufacturers.

627
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:55.370
Our solar food manufacturers would be privately owned.

628
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.600
Now in order to get anything like Tony's program, we have to reform capitalism.

629
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.020
Absolutely fundamentally. And I absolutely agree with Farhana and George,

630
00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.280
that one of the problems is that the very process of capitalism produces

631
00:38:07.281 --> 00:38:11.060
concentrations of wealth that can have a political influence on policies,

632
00:38:11.061 --> 00:38:15.440
which are perverse. So we have got to win the argument against that,

633
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:19.520
but I think we are far more likely to win the argument against that.

634
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:24.590
If we are arguing for a reformed regulated and controlled capitalism,

635
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.300
rather than suggesting that we should reject capitalism in favor of some other

636
00:38:29.301 --> 00:38:32.870
model, which we're not really allowed to know what it is,

637
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.130
because I don't think you are clear what it, because you cut,

638
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.260
but not imposing.

639
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.730
That is a bit of an article of faith for us to accept that we'll just,

640
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:49.810
we'll find this thing, which we don't know what it is. And I would put it down.

641
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.340
If at the end of the day,

642
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.810
you're not saying that you want to nationalize restaurants and hotels and

643
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:58.990
battery companies and car companies and electrolysis companies.

644
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.400
Then you are accepting capitalism in any reasonable sense of the word

645
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.650
capitalism, George Mumbia.

646
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.780
<v 0>Nope.</v>

647
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.060
<v 4>Despite being our opponents, these are good people</v>

648
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.540
who I greatly admire, and it's a pleasure to debate with them.

649
00:39:24.541 --> 00:39:27.900
But the question they have repeatedly failed to answer.

650
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.730
<v 2>Is why haven't we won yet?</v>

651
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.400
<v 4>Everything I've been hearing them say,</v>

652
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.350
I've been hearing them and people like them.

653
00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:38.220
And people like us say for my entire working life,

654
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.880
35 years, we're all in the second blue review from this panel.

655
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.050
Tony's five point plan. Marvelous. Brilliant, fantastic.

656
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.070
I've seen it for 35 years. People putting this stuff forward,

657
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.110
why haven't we won yet?

658
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.850
And the reason we haven't won yet is we're up against a system which is innately

659
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.420
unreformable because of its intrinsic characteristics.

660
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.340
We would love to reform it. We would love to have everyone coming out,

661
00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:08.220
all the capitalists coming out of their boardroom, singing kumbaya.

662
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:13.140
It is not going to happen. It is not how capitalism works.

663
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:17.040
Capitalism is a system for accumulation. It accumulates profit,

664
00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:21.570
it accumulates power. It accumulates natural wealth at other people's expense.

665
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.990
And we are seeing the results of that. Now why,

666
00:40:24.991 --> 00:40:27.930
despite all these marvelous things we've been hearing,

667
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:33.060
are we not pulling back from catastrophe, but accelerating towards it?

668
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:37.560
It's because this is not a system that can be reformed from within.

669
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:41.910
This is a system that must be overthrown and changed.

670
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:46.920
This is a system whose days I sincerely hope are numbered. Thank you.

671
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:00.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

672
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.110
<v 3>We could go on for some time. This is fabulous. So I have, in my hand,</v>

673
00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:04.944
a piece of paper,

674
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.640
which is the final vote on the motion to stop climate collapse.

675
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.550
We missed an capitalism. Now, before the debate,

676
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.400
38% of you were in favor of the motion.

677
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.380
28% were against and 34% were undecided,

678
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:24.060
but now 35% of you are for the debate.

679
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:29.520
58% are against and 7% of you

680
00:41:29.521 --> 00:41:30.720
still don't know what you're saying.

681
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.453
<v 0>Really lovely.</v>

682
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.610
Thank you very much to this fantastic panel,

683
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.100
George, Tony. Thank you all very much.
