1
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.990
<v 1>I'm very pleased to announce that our first speaker tonight at our intelligence</v>

2
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:18.770
squared online plus first speaker for the motion is Medhi Hassan.

3
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:23.510
<v 4>He is a veteran of intelligence where it, of course, journalists and broadcast.</v>

4
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.620
He's the host of up-front and head-to-head on Al-Jazeera English.

5
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.450
He's also a columnist for the intercept and a contributing editor

6
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.650
for the new statesman. Many hats on the floor is yours.

7
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.840
<v 2>Thank you, Liz. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate. So before you vote,</v>

8
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:45.770
let's be clear what you're voting for, what this debate is actually about,

9
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.700
because we will hear a lot from the opposition today about Iran's awful human

10
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:54.320
rights record its lack of democracy, its sponsorship of terrorism and extremism.

11
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.500
<v 4>It's support for the brutal Asad regime in Syria.</v>

12
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.990
And I'm not here to dispute any of those things.

13
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.410
Iran has a lot to answer for I'm no fan of the Uranian government,

14
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.180
but that's not what we're here to debate today. Whether Iran is good or bad. No,

15
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.900
we here to debate very specifically whether Iran is our enemy,

16
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.190
not our adversary, not our arrival, not our opponent, but our enemy.

17
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.990
An enemy has a very specific meaning enemies on just those you compete with or

18
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.490
argue with their people. You have to hate, you have to want to fight.

19
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.600
<v 2>You have to eventually try and destroy. Is that really what we want another war?</v>

20
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.500
And does Iran even fit the definition of a real enemy?

21
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.170
Here are three very simple reasons in my view,

22
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.070
why Iran doesn't fit that definition and why you should support this motion? Uh,

23
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.660
tonight number one, um,

24
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.860
Iran is not our enemy because it's a strange sort of enemy that has worked with

25
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:49.670
the West to fight the West West enemies, often nine 11.

26
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.170
It was Iran that helped the U S and UK topple the Taliban in Afghanistan and the

27
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.530
Al Qaeda presence in that country in 2016 and 2017,

28
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.510
it was Iranian backed militias that helped the U S and UK defeat ISIS in Iraq.

29
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.030
<v 4>They were the much needed ground troops. Number two,</v>

30
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.750
Roman has done our enemy because it's a strange sort of enemy that spent two

31
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:13.010
years negotiating with us to limit its own nuclear program, uh,

32
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:17.960
that signed at historic unprecedented 159 page diplomatic agreements

33
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.020
in which they publicly pledged quote under no circumstances,

34
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.260
will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.

35
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.010
<v 2>And then according to every independent expert, every IAEA report,</v>

36
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.550
they stuck to the terms of that deal. They did not break that deal. In fact,

37
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.720
it was the United States on the Donald Trump that walked away from that violated

38
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.480
that historic nuclear agreement. Number three,

39
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.900
Iran is not our enemy because if the opposition want you to believe that

40
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.300
sponsoring terrorism, fermenting, extremism,

41
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.710
denying democracy to your people automatically makes you an enemy of the West.

42
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.650
<v 4>Then what on earth does that make Saudi Arabia?</v>

43
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.690
I can't wait to hear some on the sorry,

44
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:57.500
speech for the opposition on behalf of the Saudis today because it wasn't 15

45
00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:00.700
Iranians were on those planes on nine. It was 15 Saudis.

46
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.840
It wasn't a Iranian school curriculum that ice is borrowed from in Rocca.

47
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.580
It was the Saudi school curriculum.

48
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.810
It wasn't an Al Qaeda sponsored Iranian cadets who just six months ago,

49
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.080
shot and killed three U S Navy sailors at a military base in Florida.

50
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.640
<v 2>It was an Al-Qaeda sponsor, Saudi cadet. And yet, despite all of this,</v>

51
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.720
we're perfectly okay saying Saudi Arabia is not only not our enemy,

52
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.770
but it's our ally,

53
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:28.300
our friend BFF in the region while Iran is our mortal enemy.

54
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.310
Sorry. How does any of that make any sense? Uh, whatsoever?

55
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.880
Let me be very clear. Iran has done a lot of that. I think it has,

56
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.440
but try and put yourselves in Iranian shoes because the UK and us have done bad

57
00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:41.430
things to Iran too.

58
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.570
They helped overthrow a democratically elected or Indian government in a coup in

59
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:48.780
1953. They helped Saddam Hussein's Iraq, uh,

60
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.900
kill hundreds of thousands of Iranians during the Iran, Iraq war in the 1980s,

61
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:53.220
including with poison gas,

62
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.730
the U S also shut down in Iranian civilian airliner in 1988,

63
00:03:56.731 --> 00:04:01.080
killing 290 people on boat and never apologized. Now, of course,

64
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:02.700
many in Iran, the hardliners,

65
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.430
the extremists like our own hotline is an extremist.

66
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.640
John Bolton want us to be enemies with them forever.

67
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.300
They want a war at some point, but I'm not here to, to defend those hob liners,

68
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.340
all that rhetoric of, you know,

69
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:18.720
the great Satan and death to America and flat burning. It's done.

70
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.650
It's unhelpful. It's undeniably hostile and belligerent. I get that,

71
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.750
but we're not kids in a playground.

72
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:27.660
The point is not for us to respond with more hostility,

73
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:32.070
more belligerents more provocations, more deadly economic sanctions in return.

74
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.140
<v 4>No, the point is to ratchet down tensions in the region to deescalate,</v>

75
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.310
to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties and use things like trade,

76
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.070
which I often hear my good friend, Daniel Hannon, extol,

77
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:47.400
the virtues to transform hostility into harmony,

78
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:51.930
to promote democracy and freedom in Iran, not more paranoia and dictatorship,

79
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.340
and to do all of that by voting full by endorsing this motion,

80
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.600
our motion today.

81
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.400
<v 2>But I will say this. It's strange to see Daniel Hannan on the opposition side,</v>

82
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.310
Daniel who opposed George bushes invasion of Iraq,

83
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.750
who opposed Barack Obama's war in Libya now pushing for Donald Trump and his

84
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:14.130
deranged cohorts to attack it wrong. The mind Buggles.

85
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.430
This is what Daniel wrote in January about the Uranians and I quote,

86
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.530
they need to be confronted and defeated. That's a call for war.

87
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.620
It is. Is that really what you want to vote for today?

88
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.480
Another trillion dollar disastrous,

89
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.210
illegal middle East war that kills tens of thousands.

90
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:32.910
If not hundreds of thousands of innocent people. I mean,

91
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:35.880
don't forget a war with Iran would make the war with a look like a walk in the

92
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:38.520
park. And one final point before I wrap up,

93
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.620
think about the wording of this motion. Iran is not our enemy. Who is the ally?

94
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.820
Who is the implied wheat? Is it Saudi Arabia? Is it the UAE?

95
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.620
Is it Israel? Because it won't probably is an enemy of Saudi Arabia of Israel,

96
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:56.940
of the UA, but come on it poses no actual strategic.

97
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.950
It's not an enemy to the people of Europe or the U S several thousand miles away

98
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.800
from the U S or at least it shouldn't be treated as an enemy by us.

99
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.870
If you think it's an enemy of Saturday to fight, vote for them,

100
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.500
vote against the motion, but it's not an enemy of ours. I, for one,

101
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.910
I'm fed up with conflating,

102
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.730
the interests of foreign governments with those of our own iPhone,

103
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.200
I'm fed up with Western countries,

104
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.230
taking sides in the middle East regional conflict that we should really have

105
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.460
nothing to do with audio.

106
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:23.540
<v 4>For one I'm fed up with the never ending Wars that the U S and the UK keep</v>

107
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.330
starting in the middle East. And with those irresponsible people,

108
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:29.600
the unthinking holes who keep pushing for those attacks,

109
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.280
there should not be a war with Iran. There cannot be a war with Iran.

110
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.050
Iran is many, many things, but it is clearly not our enemy.

111
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.230
So I begged to propose this motion. Thank you very much for your time.

112
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.880
<v 3>Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Maybe Hassan for.</v>
