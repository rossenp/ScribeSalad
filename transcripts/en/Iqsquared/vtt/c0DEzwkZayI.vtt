00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.540
<v 0>Turner chair of the energy transitions commission and former chair of the</v>

2
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.040
financial services authority,

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.120
and first chair of the UK climate change committee and a former director general

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:12.954
of the CBI.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.230
And also I should point out he played a leading role in the redesign of global

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:19.650
banking regulation following the 2008 financial crisis.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.850
And he's author of between debt and the devil money credit and fixing global

8
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:28.380
finance. Let's hear from our first speaker against the motion Adair Turner.

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.930
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.340
<v 2>The debate this evening is not about whether climate change is a potentially</v>

11
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.160
catastrophic threat to humanity,

12
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.580
but about how we effectively deal with it.

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.710
George has described some of the reasons why we have to act fast.

14
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.960
He's talked about the Arctic sea ice,

15
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:58.250
the dangers of tipping points with the methane release, the loss of corals,

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.050
the danger to food supplies.

17
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.130
And I'm not going to repeat or expand on that further because Tony and I

18
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.470
completely agree with that point.

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.810
We are facing a potential disaster and we have left it dangerously

20
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:14.660
late to take the action that can deal with it.

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.180
The international panel on climate change says that we must limit global

22
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:24.980
warming to 1.5 degree centigrade above pre-industrial

23
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.840
levels. And to do that,

24
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:31.610
we will have to reduce the emissions from industry buildings,

25
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.420
transport,

26
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.890
and agriculture to zero by around mid century.

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.440
And I mean, real zero,

28
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.630
not a pretend zero in which we go on consuming large

29
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:46.130
amounts of fossil fuels,

30
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720
but tell ourselves that we've bought some offsets via some reforestation

31
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.440
somewhere else in the world. So the objective is clear,

32
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.100
get emissions to zero by around mid century.

33
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.440
The question is how to get there one way might be

34
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.660
to reject. So as George's has suggested the very idea of capitalist material

35
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:12.650
prosperity growth, and there's certainly a role for that,

36
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.250
at least in already developed rich countries,

37
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.780
all of us can.

38
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:22.520
And I think ideally should cut our carbon footprints by using public

39
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:23.240
transport,

40
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.100
by walking or bicycling by reducing avoidable flights or by reducing

41
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.440
or eliminating red meat consumption,

42
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.420
spending our income instead on the many forms of capitalist product

43
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.600
entertainment, high quality restaurant meals,

44
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.060
things which are intensive in design,

45
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.950
which do not require more material goods and energy

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.180
to support them.

47
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.890
But I think we have to be realistic about the limits of that change our

48
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:55.880
lifestyle approach in major city centers.

49
00:02:55.881 --> 00:03:00.820
We can largely live without cars and our cities will be much nicer places

50
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:01.690
when we do that.

51
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.940
But you can't do without a car in the small towns of rural France and the

52
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.020
GLA shown red,

53
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.460
yellow vest movement shows what happens if a government ignores that reality.

54
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.080
And in India,

55
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.910
where I have spent the last three days discussing how to decarbonize the Indian

56
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.130
economy, there are 1.3,

57
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.870
5 billion people currently using about one third of the

58
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.220
energy per capita,

59
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.990
which we use and who want in future to enjoy Western middle-class

60
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.010
standards of living.

61
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.230
And that will require more energy in their transport systems in air

62
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.460
conditioning systems,

63
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:44.140
which for understandable reasons are growing rapidly and embedded in the

64
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.930
consumer goods they buy. And I have to say to George,

65
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:51.820
that if I turned up on Monday and told the Indians people that I was

66
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:52.654
dealing with,

67
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.920
that was the answer was that they were not going to have the standards of living

68
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.940
that everybody in this room has, the conversation would have ended.

69
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.103
<v 3>At that point.</v>

70
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.320
<v 2>So while lifestyle change has a role,</v>

71
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.090
the main route to radical emissions reductions must be to use

72
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:14.890
energy more efficiently and to use only zero carbon forms of energy.

73
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.200
And the good news is that it is undoubtedly technically possible to get to

74
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:24.160
net zero by that route. And we broadly know how to do it.

75
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.170
We need to electrify as much of the economy as possible,

76
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.090
increasing total global electricity supply about four or

77
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:38.110
five times. And all of that electricity must be zero carbon.

78
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.420
And that's possible because the sun shines down on earth each

79
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:44.254
day,

80
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.180
8,000 times as much energy as total human

81
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.220
energy demand and the cost of solar electricity of taking

82
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:58.690
those photons and turn them into electricity has fallen over

83
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:01.450
85% in the last 10 years.

84
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.640
So while George talked about absolute limits to material supply,

85
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.020
actually in relation to clean energy, once we fixed the technology,

86
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.960
there is no limit to the amount of clean energy that we can capture and

87
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.530
enjoy. We also need to use hydrogen in multiple applications.

88
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.920
We can use it for instance, to decarbonize our steel production,

89
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:25.840
to decarbonize our shipping.

90
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.320
And we must make that hydrogen in a zero carbon fashion,

91
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:34.120
but you can do that by electrolysis using zero carbon electricity,

92
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.940
all of that will require investments,

93
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:40.720
which if you add them up and think about them in trillions of dollars or

94
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:43.690
trillions of pounds seem very large,

95
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.580
but actually as a percentage of the total global economy are relatively small

96
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:52.480
one or 2% and totally affordable. So let's be clear.

97
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:57.010
We can build a zero carbon economy while supporting growth still

98
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.140
countries, and the cost are surprisingly small.

99
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.520
And the best way to do that is not to reject capitalism,

100
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:09.200
but to regulate tax and direct capitalist activity while still using

101
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:13.960
private enterprise incentives and market competition help get there at

102
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:14.794
least cost.

103
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.940
And what that it means is that we need to have strong policies to force

104
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:23.140
capitalism, to do what we want it to do while leaving it,

105
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.800
to decide the details of how we get there. We could,

106
00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:31.450
and we should ban all sales of internal combustion engines from,

107
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.010
let us say 2030,

108
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.110
but we should lend leave it to competing capitalist firms driven by the profit

109
00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:43.030
motive to work out how to build electric vehicles in the most

110
00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:47.560
efficient fashion. And I believe that we should ban all plastic incineration,

111
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.490
all plastic exports and all plastic sent to landfill by,

112
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.170
at the very latest 2025 and impose a carbon price on fossil fuel

113
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:58.510
inputs into new plastics production.

114
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.580
But we should then leave it to private enterprise to determine the precise mix

115
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.630
of mechanical or chemical recycling technologies, which we know exist,

116
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.220
and which could enable us to continue using plastics in many applications,

117
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.170
but in a zero carbon fashion.

118
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.870
Now right-wing ideologues will of course argue that if you regulate and tax

119
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:21.610
capitalism in this fashion,

120
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.620
it's no longer capitalism at all that the only capitalism possible is the ultra

121
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:31.540
free market, totally unregulated capitalism beloved by people like Donald Trump.

122
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.970
But that is nonsense because capitalism can come in many different forms and we

123
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:40.180
can choose the form. We want capitalism.

124
00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:44.140
And here I agree with George means essentially a system in which most,

125
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.040
but not all,

126
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:49.450
not necessarily all of the means of production distribution exchange are owned

127
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.860
by private enterprise competing in markets to make profit and

128
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:58.300
capitalism can flourish and deliver benefits for humanity, even if,

129
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:02.800
and indeed precisely because it is tightly regulated and

130
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:04.030
appropriately taxed.

131
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.520
Indeed capitalism was most successful in delivering prosperity to the many,

132
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:13.390
not just the few when in the 1950s and sixties,

133
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.400
it was combined with very tight regulation of the financial sector with a

134
00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:22.660
significant role for state-owned enterprises in some specific sectors of the

135
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:26.800
economy. And with top marginal tax rates far above current levels,

136
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.950
but nobody doubted that Germany,

137
00:08:29.951 --> 00:08:34.450
Britain and America in the 1950s and sixties were capitalist economies

138
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.460
delivering both more rapid growth and far better environmental

139
00:08:39.461 --> 00:08:42.700
results than the non-capitalist economies of Russia.

140
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.550
Eastern Europe three weeks ago,

141
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.830
presented a fascinating TV documentary called apocalypse cow

142
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.830
in it. He argued that the stock climate collapse,

143
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:57.960
we must radically reduce the role of land intensive agriculture.

144
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.460
And I agreed almost entirely with his arguments like George.

145
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.880
I think we are probably on the cusp of a technological revolution,

146
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.410
which will enable us to continue if we want to enjoy the taste of red meat,

147
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.810
but produced in a synthetic fashion,

148
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.850
which does not involve destructive deforestation nor terrible lives for

149
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:18.990
sentient beings.

150
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.000
And to illustrate that exciting technological potential George flew,

151
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:26.400
and he admitted this was breaking his normal rules.

152
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.360
He flew to Finland to visit a company called solar foods,

153
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.470
which is developing synthetic ways of producing carbohydrates,

154
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.630
which we can then either consume directly or use as feed stock for synthetic

155
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:44.160
meats. So what type of company is solar foods?

156
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.181
Well,

157
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:50.100
it's a private capitalist company raising money from

158
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:54.660
private investors who will expect a good return on their risky investment.

159
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.160
And while saga foods managers, undoubtedly want to do good for the world,

160
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.750
they own their investors may well also be motivated by the fact that if they

161
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:06.180
succeed, they will make good money.

162
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.790
I think we must embrace the innovative potential of capitalism even while

163
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:13.560
constraining it, taxing it,

164
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.910
regulating it and pointing it in the right direction. And if, instead,

165
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:19.890
we try to abolish capitalism.

166
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.330
I fear we will not stop climate catastrophe, but make it more likely.

167
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.350
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
