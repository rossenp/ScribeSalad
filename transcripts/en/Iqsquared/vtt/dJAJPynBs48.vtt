00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>I'm Nick Cohen, I'm a journalist and the observer.</v>

2
00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:04.650
I write books and lots of other papers as well.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.320
<v 1>My name is Peter Gagan on I'm investigations, editor, open democracy,</v>

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.950
and I'm the author of democracy for sale, dark money on dirty politics,

5
00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:13.820
which is I would head, is this.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.200
<v 0>Right pizza? Um, it's a, it's a really impressive book before I go any further.</v>

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.510
And I recommend everyone. Everyone gets a copy.

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.520
Can you perhaps tell viewers

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.440
your basic thesis, your,

10
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:36.800
your basic concern before we start looking into details and

11
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:37.640
solutions?

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.260
<v 1>Basically my book is all about the rise of what I'm calling dark money,</v>

13
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:47.100
but what I mean by that is kind of unaccountable money and influence lobbying,

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.590
and even Daysha and the internet in British politics.

15
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.500
And I'm looking at basically my argument is that British politics has

16
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:58.730
fundamentally changed in recent years because we're seeing increasing froze of

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.020
just basically of dark money in different ways, money. Um,

18
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.620
in terms of political donations is becoming more of a feature of our politics.

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.610
Lobbying is becoming increasingly it'll pay, can hire to hard to follow,

20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.960
and actually really,

21
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:15.980
really fundamentally the interests also really change our politics and American,

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.100
not all of our rules and our laws around how we do politics,

23
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:23.240
how our democracy is protected are already for digital or for an analog era.

24
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.930
They're all out of date and we're living in a digital age and that our

25
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:31.010
politicians don't seem to want to grapple with the complicated,

26
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:35.570
difficult reality of just how really corroded and broken our electoral system.

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.950
<v 0>I suppose someone, uh, coming this a fresh could say, well,</v>

28
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:41.060
hold on a second piece. Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.040
We're not remotely like an Erica where there's no limits at all Supreme court

30
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.960
bench pose any limits on political funding. There, there are laws,

31
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.910
there are, uh, caps and limits and registers of interest.

32
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.390
Surely this is, this is quite a tight system.

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.320
<v 1>Serious. It is. And it was for a very long time. I actually would.</v>

34
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.600
I would agree for quite a long time. We had, you know,

35
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:09.140
we've always had the role of money in British politics is not new Lloyd George

36
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.480
basically sold honors, you know, to the highest bidder.

37
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.520
That's been a part of our system for a long time.

38
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:16.640
We've had cash for access cash for questions, but in general,

39
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:20.000
actually I would agree that the rules around our politics reasonably work

40
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.090
reasonably well when it comes to elections, there's really tight spending,

41
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.570
but in some ways actually that's an indication just how broken the system is.

42
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.900
The spending rules are so tight. It's about, on average,

43
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.000
about 12 to 15,000 pounds kind.

44
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.940
It's allowed to spend in each constituency that nobody keeps to them.

45
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.970
Nobody believes in Canada, general election spends that little.

46
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.660
So what we have actually is we all accept that those spending rules are going to

47
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.550
be broken. They're broken all the time. No one,

48
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:46.940
I think it's about a hundred years since the last person was convicted of

49
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:50.270
breaking spending rules during a general election, which is, is kind of,

50
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.080
that is a huge part of the problem. So we,

51
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.220
and in a world of kind of constant campaigning,

52
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:58.040
we have a political roots that are all set review around elections,

53
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:00.970
around electoral events, but in a world of constant campaigning,

54
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.850
which is kind of where we're at now in Britain. It's, uh, you know,

55
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.220
you just have to look at how our government docs in general,

56
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.230
that we have rolling political campaigns, the role of money then becomes way,

57
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.280
way harder to track.

58
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:15.400
And the way money brings influence into politics inspire for our heart.

59
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.700
<v 0>If you, if you, if you wanted to give someone one example, uh,</v>

60
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.420
to change their mind, to say something in your book, just look at this,

61
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.050
look at this, and then think again, what would you pick? Well.

62
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.100
<v 1>I think I might take two examples just to be, just to be.</v>

63
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.260
<v 0>Here.</v>

64
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.580
<v 1>What is a really thank you very much. That is very generous.</v>

65
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.570
One's a really simple one.

66
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.110
So if you get a lead for trigger your door front a politician election time,

67
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.530
it'll have probably their face looking smiling, maybe holding a baby,

68
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.950
seeing something on a dime. As I love on the back, it'll have their details.

69
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:51.930
And let's say who paid for new prints and all the rest.

70
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.860
So that's called an imprint.

71
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.150
All physical pieces of election paraphernalia have to have an imprint.

72
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.200
If that same politician was to send you a target out on Facebook saying the

73
00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:03.360
exact same thing with exact same picture of themselves,

74
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.880
they don't have to say anything. They don't even have to carry an imprint on it.

75
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.580
Like that's not that we don't have to do that. They don't have to do that.

76
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.190
So that's a very, very kind of basic example of,

77
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.590
and that's not hard to fix that could be easily fixed,

78
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.260
but the decision is always has been taken not to fix it.

79
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.290
But if we wanted to put something which I think is more insidious and actually

80
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:20.040
more concerning,

81
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.580
I write quite a lot in the book about the role of a think tanks of what are

82
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:27.270
basically kind of corporate lobbying organizations in British politics.

83
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.820
And this is very American model of politics.

84
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:33.120
What you do is instead of funding politicians,

85
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.530
instead of giving politicians money,

86
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.670
what corporations and certain individuals who are interested in changing

87
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.190
official conversation do instead,

88
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:45.630
or as well as giving money to parties is to fund what looked like independent

89
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:49.530
groups who come up with recommendations and ideas and policies that fit in with

90
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:52.830
their agenda. This has long been a facet of American politics, you know,

91
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.053
building.

92
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.320
<v 0>And who are, I mean,</v>

93
00:04:55.321 --> 00:05:00.180
you just want to migrate both bands or not treated or not cool

94
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:02.040
by their proper names by the media.

95
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.320
So before the last election you'd have Corbyn supporters from the

96
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:11.700
Vajra media, um, tore mean, excuse me, economic offense,

97
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.500
acting as outright,

98
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.810
outright propaganda for their parties.

99
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.760
And no one would say, hold on a second,

100
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.990
you are just repeating quality lines given to you by Jeremy Corbyn abolish guns.

101
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.240
That's what you are. You're not independent journalists. I think TennCare,

102
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.410
you are around propaganda because they, they, they, they, they want,

103
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.210
they closed along as the gang.

104
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.300
<v 1>And a lot of these organizations like, uh,</v>

105
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.450
the Institute of economic affairs and many of these Tufts and street groups,

106
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.750
there are also charities. So they even, it's like a double whammy.

107
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:52.050
You can give them sort of anonymously and get a charitable deduction on it.

108
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.620
And I think I completely agree what these art writers have done is CD

109
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.880
opportunities in the media space as well. A lot of these think tanks,

110
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.600
really what they are is very savvy media operations. They run phone lines.

111
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.100
If you pick up the phone and call them,

112
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.790
they will appear on your show to say pretty much whatever you want and what it's

113
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.660
done, what it does is it allows corporate influence to take,

114
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.910
to take hold and politics and ways we can see,

115
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.390
but it's also pulled and shifted our politics and our discourse in ways that

116
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.140
aren't representative. And I think I would agree if I turned,

117
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.930
when I turned on the television, the run-up to the 2019 general election,

118
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.130
the discourse has gone so far. It was so polarized for that very reason.

119
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.190
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I mean,</v>

120
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.330
they really do understand media because if you were running on boxing,

121
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.500
suppose someone watching this program, uh, publishes a piece,

122
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.760
say on Oakland democracy or in my newspaper, observe someone,

123
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.830
if someone's going to BBC polishing show phones,

124
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.460
not here's how the conversation goes. They'll say we really like your piece.

125
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.020
And the view view of you would say, Oh, thanks very much.

126
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.330
But would you say what you said, but then go on to just push it a bit far.

127
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.030
And if you actually want to know, I'm not sure that's true.

128
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.830
And then when you've pushed it a bit further,

129
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.270
will you push it to an absolutely absurd excrete?

130
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.400
Cause that's what we want on television.

131
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.020
And whether it's CIA on the foreign media or Claire Fox,

132
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.780
they all will say, yeah, of course we will.

133
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.490
We will go to the absolute extreme and provide you with a

134
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.330
gormless shrieking television that will stop the viewer. You know, rally,

135
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.800
make the viewer delighting or angry and stop them switching over or going off

136
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.040
and doing something. They really do understand how it works.

137
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.143
<v 1>Well, does it, does it.</v>

138
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.540
I call it a figure in my book and it's from the Institute to become confers own

139
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:41.710
report one year. And the IAA has a turnover. Most years of interim,

140
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.150
2 million pounds where the money comes from,

141
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:44.980
we really have no idea beyond the odd leak.

142
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.140
It's come from all the money in the past, back the money,

143
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:48.310
but we don't know much about it,

144
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.570
but it estimated it had 66 million pounds or to media and not one year.

145
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.080
That's a huge return for your investment. If I was,

146
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.880
why would you pay a lobbyist?

147
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:01.780
Who's going to have to have often registered a lobbying register who might get

148
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:04.180
you a meeting with a minister. It'd be there in the paper.

149
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:07.990
You have to look it up. You're much better. It's a better use of your money.

150
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:10.630
I would imagine spend a couple of grand with someone like that,

151
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.780
who will argue your point on television probably writes it in the newspaper

152
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:17.230
column, write a quick thin report that you can go around, you know,

153
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.170
go to gambling industry or wherever else. And you know,

154
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:22.270
and they will say in their defense, they would say, look,

155
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:24.640
we believe these things. Anyway, we're just saying what we believed,

156
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.830
but it's always interesting that what they say,

157
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.880
they believe tallies very closely with the kind of corporations that would want

158
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:31.630
to fund it.

159
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.340
<v 0>You also give their backers plausible tonight, tonight.</v>

160
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.430
That's what I find so fascinating about outriders, where long writes all that.

161
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.320
If they say something it's embarrassing, it's the party. They said, it's not us.

162
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:48.760
It's not us the party saying it's yes. So in shakes and the think tank, why,

163
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.050
why are you bothering us about it?

164
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.720
<v 1>The same thing is happening with social media. Nick, I think too.</v>

165
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.280
I think that's what's happened with social media.

166
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:56.130
Like I write in the book about the social media.

167
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.860
It started appearing around the 2019 general election.

168
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.580
You can push narrow shifts much further on social media with huge process

169
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.750
viability. You can just set up what are completely AstroTurf organizations.

170
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.170
You know,

171
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.340
I look at some like hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent on Facebook ads by

172
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.480
like groups from the left and from the right that disappeared.

173
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.270
As soon as the election ended, it's particularly on the right. It was, you know,

174
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.220
you're thinking, right you've you've spent,

175
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.010
there was one thing called capitalist worker spends about 65,000 pounds on

176
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:25.230
Facebook ads. You'd imagine at the end of that,

177
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.420
having won the election you'd want to celebrate.

178
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.550
You might want to harness those people who supported you.

179
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.280
Considering that you're saying you're a campaign, but yet no,

180
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.150
all of these groups,

181
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.480
every single one disappeared the day after the general election.

182
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.980
<v 0>Real friends, organizations,</v>

183
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.780
if you were a serious economic organization campaign group,

184
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.710
you wouldn't stop at the elections until you say no. Now, now, uh,

185
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.520
Johnson's in power. We want to give him ideas, hold him to account,

186
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.893
shape the debate.

187
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.880
<v 1>You see that as the opportunity to actually, you know, to really engage,</v>

188
00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.953
you'd say, Oh, my word,

189
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.420
I've got all these supporters because what's interesting as well.

190
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:05.930
A lot of these campaigns have recorded no donations.

191
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.810
And so the donation threshold of 7,500 pounds.

192
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:11.660
So they're suggesting that they've got some of these campaigns.

193
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:13.520
If you'd spend 65,000 pounds on ads,

194
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.960
you go at least nine or 10 people to give you almost a maximum donation,

195
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:21.470
but just not enough to declare it, which to be honest, kind of beggars belief.

196
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.510
If you've not got the, where are you,

197
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.870
where did the idea that large numbers people are going to give money for?

198
00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:30.320
What are, what are front organizations? It doesn't, it doesn't tally,

199
00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:33.620
but there's no fear about doing that kind of thing because the chances of

200
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:36.530
anything ever happened to you are so slim. And if you were,

201
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.150
if the extra commission was to investigate you,

202
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:42.800
the maximum fine in Britain for breaking a lecturer is 20,000 pounds in America.

203
00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:46.610
You can go to prison for breaking an extra law here barely even qualifies as a

204
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:47.444
slap on the wrist.

205
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.100
<v 0>Yeah. Um,</v>

206
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.600
so we've got a sort of 19th century,

207
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.730
early 20th century view of politics. It's just election campaigns,

208
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.130
very time controlled, but laws never enforced. Anyway,

209
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.210
we've got think tanks, front organization,

210
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.150
outriders who can operate particularly on social media,

211
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.370
basically beyond the rule of law, because there is no law covering them.

212
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.680
What else should we be worried about where else is dark money coming in?

213
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.080
<v 1>There's also just traditional ways actually of just like even in just</v>

214
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.080
traditional political donations, which do look like they're very transparent.

215
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.490
All political donations are, are, are, are, are, um, are registered,

216
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.800
but there's, there's still a problem with this. So for example,

217
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.640
the conservative party, which is the party that really relies on private money,

218
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.530
the labor party gets most of its money from the unions,

219
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:41.180
which has its own issues. But I.

220
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.830
<v 0>Want to, in the interest of fairness, come back.</v>

221
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.440
<v 1>I'm very happy to have a kind of a chapter about that too.</v>

222
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.990
But in terms of the conservative party, it's runs,

223
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.630
it runs what are called like an a two years of league of membership for

224
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.360
supporters. And this really happened during David Cameron.

225
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.510
It tried to diversify the amount of money to get into bill,

226
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.370
get more money instead of a thing called the leader's group for top Tory donuts.

227
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:02.860
If you give to conservative parties, it's 50,000 times a year,

228
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.100
you get to go once a quarter to meetings with the prime minister and leading

229
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.950
cabinet ministers. And you all kind of sit around, it's all off the record.

230
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:12.910
It's all private, nothing is nothing is divulged about what happens there.

231
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.870
That's incredible access for almost no money at David.

232
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.500
Carmen did come under pressure about this because he was holding hosts Indies in

233
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.910
Downing street and his flash, which was a government, a government residency,

234
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.970
relationally. He did start publishing these. But as I noticed,

235
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:28.810
when I was researching my book,

236
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:31.080
the conservative party has actually stopped publishing,

237
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.450
both stopped publishing any details of previous meetings and taken all the

238
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.840
records of the old ones off its website. So that's a really good example.

239
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.920
I think of how money can influence politics and really direct way. Um,

240
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.470
also what you're seeing is what is a lot of money.

241
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.620
I've spent a lot of time looking at the extra returns.

242
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.330
A lot of money comes from companies,

243
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.760
some of which seem to do almost no business and are very,

244
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:54.520
very opaque and hard to find out how they operate. You know,

245
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:58.210
I did a story recently about, there's not in Finch leaders,

246
00:12:59.380 --> 00:12:59.980
a building,

247
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.360
which is about 50,000 companies registered and a number of companies have given

248
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:05.650
money to conservative party charity.

249
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.770
They are not actively doing business and national dress.

250
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.220
It's very hard to see what these companies do because some of them have almost

251
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:15.430
no turnover yet. They're still able to give money to political parties,

252
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.810
but there's that. So that's another way in which it's quite easy to, uh,

253
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.260
give them a,

254
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.890
to kind of funnel the money almost anonymously into political campaigns.

255
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.780
<v 0>All the well, to me,</v>

256
00:13:30.781 --> 00:13:35.670
the most extraordinary story and the most English story of this is Russian

257
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:38.820
money, Russian influence in the Brexit referendum,

258
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.460
weekends up when we finally have a comms report on these

259
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.820
with something that is so disgustingly English,

260
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.220
it makes me want to abandon my nationality.

261
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:54.060
The security services didn't investigate. How would you, Oh, no,

262
00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:55.890
we don't wash our dirty laundry in public.

263
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.110
We don't want to embarrass to raise an a,

264
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.200
we don't want to embarrass y'all y'all so be politically difficult.

265
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.920
So we'll pretend it didn't happen, which is remarkable considering

266
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.800
[inaudible] special powers because their officers are bravely out there risking

267
00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:11.634
their lives.

268
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.260
And so they can have secret court hearings or official secrets acts protecting

269
00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:17.070
them. Yeah.

270
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.270
The normal standards of justice and accountability thrown out the window to

271
00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:26.190
protect these brave boys and girls, when a British referendum,

272
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:28.500
a British election there's allegations,

273
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.460
they've been interfered with little cows will close our eyes,

274
00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:34.770
hide the eggs and say, are we stupid? Super difficult?

275
00:14:34.771 --> 00:14:36.000
We won't do anything at all.

276
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.530
<v 1>Well,</v>

277
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.610
one of the things I found most remarkable about the Russia report is there's a

278
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:45.450
section in the middle where they basically the alters reports say we don't,

279
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.860
we never, when we were writing this,

280
00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:50.550
we found it really hard to figure out who was in charge of looking after our

281
00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:53.750
democracy. They could describe a democracy is a hot potential.

282
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.900
And it was quite clear that there's a bunch of different organizations,

283
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.900
none of whom had really taken responsibility for the kinds of things you were

284
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:01.190
talking about. Um,

285
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.000
this is a kind of Constantine might find them in the work ID where organizations

286
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.530
are regulations would pass the book from one to the other. Like we won't like,

287
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.311
you know, if I,

288
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.610
if I see an email between the extra commission and the information

289
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:14.690
commissioner's office, where each of them says,

290
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.610
this has nothing to do with us really it's the other one,

291
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.910
but that is writ large and the Russia report. And I couldn't,

292
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.920
I almost exact same time that report was being published and let's not forget

293
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.370
the government tried for eight months to suppress the report. And it was only,

294
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:31.580
you know, they tried everything to try and suppress that report,

295
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.300
but almost the exact same moment that was being that report was being finally

296
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:38.270
published. Chloe Smith, who's the cabinet office minister.

297
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.620
So she would be in charge.

298
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.490
Her brief should include things like exactly what we were talking about.

299
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.430
She was giving evidence to the PR or the separate parliamentary inquiry.

300
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:50.210
And she said, does a consolidation, electoral law reform, electoral law,

301
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.010
isn't the priority for the government.

302
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:54.530
So basically don't tend to do anything about any of these things.

303
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.340
And the only measure in terms of securing our democracy in our democratic

304
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:03.140
process that Boris Johnson has said he firmly wants to bring in is voter ID,

305
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.630
which is solving a problem that really doesn't exist.

306
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.190
Seven instance of voter ID at the 19 2017 general election.

307
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:14.390
So what you've got is, you know, you've got the security services you've got,

308
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.070
basically we haven't investigated what a huge question Mark about the democratic

309
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:20.810
process, which could happen again and again,

310
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.830
and instead it out there until we had the prime minister tilting at windmills.

311
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.180
<v 0>Well, I mean, say what you liked about America,</v>

312
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.080
but the CIA and the FBI did their duty.

313
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.600
They investigated a Russian interference in 2016 election,

314
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.090
and we know what they found.

315
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.890
We are pointed to the Facebook group set up to undermine Hillary Clinton.

316
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.800
We know, look junior in the song,

317
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.490
Japanese as a conduit for the Russians and Trump. We know if it will,

318
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.360
because it was investigated. Um, in Britain,

319
00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.370
they ran away are all pass the buck, as you say, because, well,

320
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.110
uh, leave one of the Brexit referendum first arrays away,

321
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.790
then Boris Johnson support Brexit. Gotcha. Has politically difficult for us.

322
00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:12.730
We could get into trouble. We'll just, we'll just, we'll just,

323
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.620
we'll just back off. I mean, she's a huge dereliction of duty, um.

324
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.240
<v 1>Completely, I think.</v>

325
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.740
And I think that that's writ large and I found the response was so

326
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.060
depressing in terms of, you know,

327
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:28.840
Boris Johnson stands up and says something that isn't in remainers and despite

328
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:31.630
having to things himself until quite recently, and it's all,

329
00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:34.840
some sort of city plot. And I think that that sort of,

330
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.240
that aspect of elves kind of,

331
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.570
I've just really not caring about how degraded democracy is,

332
00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:44.500
but in some respects, it is of a piece of what we saw in the last few months.

333
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.870
And then in the weeks and months leading up to the general election too,

334
00:17:46.871 --> 00:17:49.800
like we did see a really dirty general election complaint. I think it's,

335
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.540
it's quite easy to forget.

336
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:54.240
It was one thing that I wanted to do writing this book was to kind of try and

337
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:58.320
put down in writing, like just the various things that we saw or whether it was,

338
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.610
you know, whether it was kind of, um, rebranding the conservative priorities,

339
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:03.810
Twitter, Twitter accounts,

340
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.450
to fact check your account during a live debate or just pushing,

341
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.700
arrive yourself on social media.

342
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.960
<v 0>Do you, do you, um, I wanted to bounce. Do you have any worries?</v>

343
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.450
Oh, do you see union funding for labor in the same typically it's business

344
00:18:20.451 --> 00:18:22.070
funding through stories.

345
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.030
I'll tell you why I ask the question and it's not just as a matter of balance,

346
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.410
[inaudible] play a crucial role in getting its candidates, ed Miliband,

347
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.270
and the crucial role in getting Jenny foreign bla again,

348
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.060
Jeremy Corbyn directed after 2015,

349
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.830
it gets Len McCluskey gets, um, his friends,

350
00:18:45.831 --> 00:18:50.570
United officials as general sexism. And I was just thinking,

351
00:18:50.571 --> 00:18:55.520
well, if Maggie greed PLC the most evil capitalist company or

352
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.700
help select both to raise a may and Boris Johnson and then incest

353
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.890
executives and Beck agreed, went in and actually ran the tour reporting, um,

354
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.270
there'll be a bit of a fuss about it.

355
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.870
<v 1>I think I do think there's a, there's, there's something interesting.</v>

356
00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:15.620
Like the union funding question, I think is one that the labor party,

357
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.820
because it hasn't ever diversified its funding, especially in recent years,

358
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.570
it's become, I think it has become an incredibly reliant on union funding.

359
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.280
And you end up with a question like the democratic relationship between what's

360
00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:31.910
going on, what the unions, union funding and the labor party too, because,

361
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.480
you know, we've had seen ballots are very, very low numbers of, uh,

362
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:37.940
of return of returns and United and things like that.

363
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.030
And I think it's a reasonable question I would like to see to be honest,

364
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.510
like I think there's a reasonable case you made to just to capping donations

365
00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:48.380
across the piece and saying, look, this is, this is, this is the most.

366
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.600
And the donation you can get from the individual,

367
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.000
this is the most you can get from this type of organization.

368
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.160
This is the most you can get from that type of organization.

369
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.650
And it's a controversial thing to suggest,

370
00:19:57.651 --> 00:20:02.090
but actually getting the state to rename, to kind of come in behind. And, um,

371
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.480
I'm basically matched fond or more so small donations.

372
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.530
So if you were to move away from the reliance of the union of labor,

373
00:20:09.531 --> 00:20:11.780
on the unions, on the Tories on very,

374
00:20:11.781 --> 00:20:15.620
very small numbers of very rich people and actually force parties to diversify

375
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:19.880
their funding, they would, I think also be forced to diversify kind of how they,

376
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.190
how they operate and who they represent. You would see,

377
00:20:22.191 --> 00:20:23.960
I think a much broader split.

378
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:28.220
You would get the chance to go back to far more broad church political parties.

379
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.420
If you cast back to the fifties and sixties, when both labor and the tourism,

380
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.110
millions and millions and millions of members, neighbors had had a big booth.

381
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.620
I did have a big jump out of Jeremy Corbyn became leader that seemed to trading

382
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:42.880
off mandatories a very small number of memory at the same numbers,

383
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.940
the SMP and these appear only in Scotland. So I think, and I,

384
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.820
the problem is in some respects,

385
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.360
the union funding of labor has encouraged labor to S to,

386
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.850
to not move at times is not diversified.

387
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.450
It's not democratized because there is always going to be a vested interest in

388
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:02.650
unions in, in controlling, if they're controlling the purse strings, well, then,

389
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.080
then you've got a huge amount of clouds.

390
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.490
<v 0>I think your point that, you know, your controversial,</v>

391
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.600
there's got to be more state funding because people don't like,

392
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.370
why should I pay my taxes to fund politics? But at the same time,

393
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.640
the same people who say that will then read your book or watch less than say,

394
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.540
Jesus Christ. Look at the corruption Peter's showing me, well,

395
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.960
you've got to have one or the other real, you've got to bite the bullet and say,

396
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.800
as most countries do well, you know, um, if you,

397
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.150
if you want an end to, or never read, but you also limit,

398
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.910
then you've got to accept that some but more taxpayer funding is, is in order.

399
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.390
<v 1>That's why we don't realize how exceptional we are in some of this.</v>

400
00:21:45.391 --> 00:21:49.500
I think we do kind of tend to think that everywhere is the same as us and

401
00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:52.410
especially with what we do. Like when I started doing this sort of work,

402
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.760
I used to think that Britain actually,

403
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.400
it wasn't so bad in Britain because compared to America,

404
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.770
it's far less money in Britain, like in America,

405
00:21:58.771 --> 00:22:01.440
like you're 50,000 pounds would get you dinner with the prime minister.

406
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.650
I don't even fit in America $50,000. I'd probably get you, you know,

407
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.340
a minor Senator from, you know, from a Midwestern state, nevermind,

408
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.930
nevermind the leader of a country.

409
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.790
But if you think about it the other way around, actually it makes Britain,

410
00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:18.780
I think even more sensible to finance because partly because there's less money

411
00:22:18.781 --> 00:22:21.060
around, it's actually even more important to try and get it.

412
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.260
That's why I think like we, we toleration. So the conservatives tolerate,

413
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.740
you know, um, the wife of a former, um,

414
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.310
vitamin improved and finance minister spending 80, 90,

415
00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:35.430
a hundred thousand pounds to pay tenants with Boris Johnson. You know, this is,

416
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.270
which is just,

417
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.630
I think we saw that in other countries you'd find absolutely jaw-dropping.

418
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.320
And I think it's really erodes trust in politics.

419
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.790
There was an interesting survey from Cambridge university this year that found a

420
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.020
disenchantment and dissatisfaction with democracy were highest in two places in

421
00:22:52.021 --> 00:22:54.210
the world, the United States and great Britain.

422
00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.420
I don't think it's a coincidence that there are two countries in which money

423
00:22:57.421 --> 00:23:00.000
plays the biggest role. And it's like, we've seen even this summer,

424
00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:04.320
a series of scandals from the cronies knowledge arcs that got given peerages and

425
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.300
knighthoods and new dissolution honors list to the Robert Genex apparent bias in

426
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.600
Richard property case. You know, there's, there's not,

427
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.840
it's it's to the Russia report itself.

428
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.650
There's no shortage of evidence of like, you know,

429
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.070
of basically a cronyism and what I think could only be called corrupt.

430
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.290
<v 0>Well, it's an interesting point you make isn't it, um, uh, in Britain,</v>

431
00:23:28.291 --> 00:23:31.800
your bride goes further. You get, you get, you get a lot more for your money.

432
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.570
I will say things to just stop comparing ourselves in America, you know,

433
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.490
love daily lot should murder Tuesday, contrast his politics are fantastic.

434
00:23:41.491 --> 00:23:43.120
You corrupt are openly correct.

435
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.170
Even corrupting. The sense of politics takes tens, hundreds,

436
00:23:51.171 --> 00:23:53.750
and hundreds of millions of dollars. The Supreme court say,

437
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.620
you can take it from any in-class group they want, you want, they can run packs.

438
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.150
That's how America works.

439
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.950
It's not how the overwhelming majority of Western democracies work

440
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.140
in most Western democracies. As you say, you cannot. If you are a,

441
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.030
the wife of the leading Russian faker,

442
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.630
give the prime minister's party 80,000 pounds and have, uh,

443
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.990
have friendly tendencies match with him, you know.

444
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.620
<v 1>We wouldn't be allowed. It would be, it would be a huge scandal.</v>

445
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.420
It will be a kind of thing that ended careers.

446
00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.320
And I think that's part of it too, is that I think in recent years,

447
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.790
our tolerance we've become quite,

448
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.720
you're newer to the kind of scandals that I think in the past would have cost

449
00:24:31.721 --> 00:24:33.070
political career. So in my,

450
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.520
so I used to go back to the story of Liam Fox and Atlantic bridge,

451
00:24:36.521 --> 00:24:38.380
and we won't rehearse all of it here,

452
00:24:38.381 --> 00:24:42.100
but the long and short was being Fox spent 10 years building up this Atlanta

453
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.350
cyst think tank between Britain and America.

454
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.050
He got funding from all sorts of who knows where set up a sister organization,

455
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.540
America to, to pull in more money. And, but when he became minister,

456
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.810
he became sexually safe for defense, which is a high-profile position.

457
00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:00.370
And he had, uh, he had his, um, his AIDS coming and go, um,

458
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.850
his best friend and head of the same charity, Atlantic bridge,

459
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.090
going around the world with him and meeting foreign dignitaries and foreign, uh,

460
00:25:07.091 --> 00:25:11.110
you know, and making senior foreign, um, kind of political leaders.

461
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.540
And that did events that did cost Liam Fox.

462
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.260
But I actually think of that scandal that happened now,

463
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.140
a I think it probably wouldn't, it wouldn't have been as down.

464
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.480
It wouldn't have been anywhere near as in his political career,

465
00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:26.380
but also at that stage, all the newspapers really ran for that story.

466
00:25:26.381 --> 00:25:29.560
It wasn't just one paper. They all went into it together.

467
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.190
And I think there's been like as, as almost immediate,

468
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.430
immediately become polarized too. There's been less of a tendency. You know,

469
00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:38.440
the guardian wouldn't really go for these sorts of stories.

470
00:25:38.441 --> 00:25:40.210
People like NATO Moxie, we go for them.

471
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:42.850
But often actually this kind of stuff has become, it's not,

472
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.280
it's not been focused on as much. The rush report,

473
00:25:45.281 --> 00:25:48.670
I think was the first time in awhile where you've seen things like, you know,

474
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.040
Russian donors in the front page of the times and things like that.

475
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.500
<v 0>Well, I mean,</v>

476
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:58.120
I think you're quite right about the totalization particular Brexit is that if

477
00:25:58.121 --> 00:25:59.080
you were a lever,

478
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.140
all matters about a politician was [inaudible] nothing else

479
00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:05.974
mattered.

480
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:11.500
There was a time to go from money to sex and keep the scope

481
00:26:11.501 --> 00:26:12.334
bubbling along.

482
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.710
The conservative party of all parties would never have had the lecture like

483
00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:19.630
Boris Johnson as a leader.

484
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:24.520
They might've been filled with a queasy Victorian sexual hypocrisy or what have

485
00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:28.150
you. But as you just said, no, no, no, uh, you're a scoundrel.

486
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.060
We don't want you. And you'll known to be a scoundrel.

487
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.790
And I think the same applies with money. Now, you know,

488
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.920
this is what drives me mad on, uh, Russia in 2016 where, you know,

489
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.950
colleagues of mine like Carol Cadwalader actually got,

490
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.390
I would have the Russian ambassador meeting.

491
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.310
Um, Aaron Banks,

492
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.840
Nigel Farrage offers of goldmines in Siberia during the

493
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:59.490
referendum campaign or the referendum campaign. And it's still,

494
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.530
as far as the right-wing press,

495
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.080
because it's not a story because it's anti Brexit.

496
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.920
And so it was a BBC who just as bad as [inaudible], Oh,

497
00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:10.620
it's too hot for us to touch. You know,

498
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.670
I'd say a handful of journalists, if you Luke Harding,

499
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.950
Carol Cairo that have been left out there,

500
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.630
often abuse and have done the work that should have been done

501
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.280
by a well-organized properly run liberal democracy.

502
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.210
How it, you know, you can't, you can't leave it to journalists.

503
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.700
So I don't think I don't want to talk to a,

504
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.020
our trade down because we don't have subpoena powers. You know,

505
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.530
you can't say, you can't say, well, this, this looks so wrong.

506
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:44.340
I'm going in with my team. I want to get in the searches bank accounts,

507
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.750
you have no power to do that.

508
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:50.730
You have no rights to that only the state can do the job and the state's not

509
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:51.564
what students yell.

510
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.830
<v 1>Yes and no, I would agree just there is a limit to the power of journalism.</v>

511
00:27:54.831 --> 00:27:57.410
That's what journalism can do is put something out into the public domain,

512
00:27:57.411 --> 00:28:00.950
but it needs to stay to act on it. It needs political actors to act on it.

513
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.650
And what you saw in the, in the, in the kind of the closest we got was,

514
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.740
was the kind of, um,

515
00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:10.310
was the department of culture media in support select committee inquiry to fake

516
00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:12.500
news, which, which actually generates a lot of interesting stuff,

517
00:28:12.501 --> 00:28:16.310
but really that was just a talking shop. It was not, it had no official powers.

518
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.120
Dominic Cummings, numerous times refused to come and give evidence.

519
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.720
It didn't matter a to two dominant comments. And he was still,

520
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.760
he made special advisor to borrows Johnson,

521
00:28:25.761 --> 00:28:28.580
despite refusing to appear before parliament a couple of months later.

522
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.940
So it's quite true. I think that's the things that culture,

523
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.510
there's no comeback for people for bending the rules until they break.

524
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.600
There's no need for them to engage unless they're on a lesser is something

525
00:28:38.601 --> 00:28:41.030
rigorous with actual proper subpoena powers,

526
00:28:41.031 --> 00:28:43.580
with proper powers to Dem of democratic oversight,

527
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.850
to go and investigate these sorts of things. And they are the kind of questions.

528
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.880
It doesn't in my mind as well, you know? Okay.

529
00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:52.040
The Russia report is written just by Russia, but this, you know,

530
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.990
you could ask about Chinese influence.

531
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.170
You could also ask about the influence of individual donors. You might want,

532
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.780
you know, nuns does a huge amount. I mean,

533
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:01.640
if we're not going to ask those questions, well,

534
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.290
we're never going to find out the answers.

535
00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.670
<v 0>Well, I mean,</v>

536
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:08.990
that's the point there's worth making everyone refers back to 2016,

537
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.860
the Trump election, the Brexit referendum, but you know,

538
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.840
we're talking four or five years ago.

539
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.670
Now the world has moved on and there were all kinds of countries

540
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.060
now, uh, following Russian information warfare,

541
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.040
you still trying to start it with trying to cover up its failures on the COVID

542
00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:30.590
virus, Iran, Saudi Arabia,

543
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:35.270
all kinds of countries are piling into the avenues with

544
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.610
social media or growing forward.

545
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.910
So it's not as if it's not as if we ought to be looking,

546
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.680
are we fighting battles? Um,

547
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.680
because we haven't.

548
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.890
And as far as the establishment forums,

549
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:55.660
a better word has no willingness to change and put proper protections in

550
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:59.830
place where we're even more exposed. So I think as we go forward, yeah.

551
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.580
<v 1>I would agree. No, I think if anything where even because, I mean,</v>

552
00:30:02.581 --> 00:30:07.410
because I think of the response from Boris Johnson to the Russia report,

553
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.150
it's actually really denigrated.

554
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:11.070
I think the opportunity to even talk about these things,

555
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.040
because he's basically said, I do not want to hear about,

556
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.380
so if you're a government minister say you're a government who thinks this is a

557
00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:16.801
big deal.

558
00:30:16.801 --> 00:30:20.070
I actually ended up on the radio a couple of days after Russia reports with

559
00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:24.090
Tobias, Alberta conservative convention. And, you know, he was in,

560
00:30:24.091 --> 00:30:26.070
this is really, this is concerning. We should,

561
00:30:26.071 --> 00:30:29.310
we need to find out more about this. We need to be investigating it. Well,

562
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.780
you know, he's basically, you know,

563
00:30:30.781 --> 00:30:33.990
I can't imagine that would have gone down particularly well in Downing street,

564
00:30:33.991 --> 00:30:36.180
where there were basically the only,

565
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.670
the only people are going to say things about this are people who really are

566
00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:42.720
like twice I would, who voted remain. And it will be seen not as parts of a job.

567
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:43.891
It's like, well,

568
00:30:43.891 --> 00:30:45.840
my political career is not going to go anywhere for a moment anyway,

569
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.510
so I can talk about it. But if you were in a position of it's our,

570
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.030
like a government departmental minister, well,

571
00:30:51.031 --> 00:30:53.370
then you're not going to engage with it because it will be,

572
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.600
it'll be disastrous for your career.

573
00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.450
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I keep me reminded of a little couple. Of course,</v>

574
00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:05.190
it's Elizabeth, the first Rose, um, freezing, never prospers.

575
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.460
What's the reason perfect prospers. Non-dairy Couric, treason,

576
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.590
no one in power Daz call out or demand the

577
00:31:13.591 --> 00:31:17.910
laws, uh, that we need because,

578
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.820
uh, the people, uh, you know,

579
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.300
Boris Johnson and the people that want it.

580
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.140
<v 1>No. And so, so exactly. And so in that, in, in that vacuum,</v>

581
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.200
you get kind of quite fast or things like what's happening at the moment where

582
00:31:31.201 --> 00:31:34.920
you have the commission on standards and public life is having an investigation

583
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.880
and that kind of an inquiry into lecturer law and electoral reform,

584
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.240
but it's not going to include money in politics or party place donation.

585
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.810
So you will tinker around the edges and come up with small little bits and

586
00:31:45.811 --> 00:31:49.020
pieces, but there won't be any substantive change at all. And if anything,

587
00:31:49.021 --> 00:31:50.850
actually, it's quite not hard to see the system getting more.

588
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:55.140
<v 0>Okay. I want to end with two questions,</v>

589
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.840
what you think should happen and what you think will happen.

590
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.140
So if you were prime minister, as you probably should be,

591
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.030
what would you do? What laws would you enact?

592
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.760
<v 1>I will, I will, um,</v>

593
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.690
I'll resist the temptation to kind of on the idea of the first Irish prime

594
00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:20.220
minister of England. That would be a WTF that will be the full reversal,

595
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.860
but it's well, there's lots of things that we did quite quickly learn.

596
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.880
Aren't hard, you know, I would reform electoral law quite dramatically.

597
00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:28.260
It's not hard to do other countries do it.

598
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.210
They do it like there's models out there.

599
00:32:30.211 --> 00:32:32.430
It doesn't have everything doesn't have to be world vision.

600
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.450
It can be word copying. You know, there's not hard to lift laws.

601
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.490
And so basically, and some of us come from that,

602
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.530
like actually America have a proper, a proper lobbying registered.

603
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:44.960
It actually works or all the lobbying is there,

604
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.130
but unlike America put a seeding on political donations, make it quite little,

605
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:51.770
maybe about 10,000 pounds, seven and a half thousand euros in France.

606
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.600
So something like that make party membership, tax deductible, which,

607
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:56.841
you know,

608
00:32:56.841 --> 00:33:00.320
is quite an easy way of putting money into Pilates to priorities and increasing

609
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:04.970
the number of people in politics without, you know, without pausing the break,

610
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.520
uh, kind of touching that,

611
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:10.340
the idea of giving actual money to police departments and politicians does.

612
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.820
So there's a bunch of things like that. I think the internet is a huge thing.

613
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.190
I think it's beyond just a scope of one stage.

614
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.720
I think the power of Silicon Valley and tech companies to dictate how our

615
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:25.610
politics works and how democracy works is really is quite, is really terrifying.

616
00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:28.790
In many respects, especially companies like Facebook, you show, you show,

617
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.230
you flirt with the morality to be, to be, to be polite about it.

618
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.310
And I think there's a real need for politicians, um, to, to act,

619
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.960
to act collectively honest and to build coalitions and actually your husband

620
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:44.930
very good on, on this European union has been good on,

621
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.910
on Facebook and just the size of tech companies and the role that they play

622
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:51.890
in our democracy. I think that's something that isn't,

623
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.160
that is a nettle that really does need to be grabbed. So like in the book,

624
00:33:55.161 --> 00:33:58.790
I talk about what happened with the railroad in the like late 19th century,

625
00:33:58.791 --> 00:34:01.730
where you had these parents and you had this kind of basically what was a

626
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:05.510
captive, a captive capitalism, capitalism,

627
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.100
and that's bad for everybody.

628
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.270
And they were broken up and politics was actually really arranged around that.

629
00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:14.630
Like there was actual political candidates who stood on platforms like that.

630
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:18.950
And I think there's a whole, that's a huge thing that I think needs to happen.

631
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.040
There needs to be a huge kind of political will to do something on it.

632
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:27.680
So that's all the nice, you know, when I'm King, uh, when I'm the Irish,

633
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.910
the Irish English. Yeah. So

634
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:38.320
not being the prime minister when I'm kind of looking around just as,

635
00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:42.850
as, as, as the reporter and the punter. I, I do find that like,

636
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.990
it's hard not to it's,

637
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.130
it's definitely hard to discover and to not see at the moment in particular

638
00:34:48.131 --> 00:34:51.520
around reform, coming through government, that's quite,

639
00:34:51.521 --> 00:34:53.800
I find that quite difficult to see because of the steps,

640
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.100
because what this government is seen as I can get away with doing things,

641
00:34:57.101 --> 00:34:57.281
you know,

642
00:34:57.281 --> 00:35:00.370
I've spent the last few months actually reporting a lot on government contracts

643
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.820
and how government contracts have basically gone to meet at the conservative

644
00:35:03.821 --> 00:35:07.120
party with no tendering process, you know, really lucrative.

645
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.800
And when you're able to do that, and there's no political comeback,

646
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.830
I think why would you, why would you try and set set?

647
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.310
Why would you try and fix a system that benefits you when the rig system

648
00:35:18.311 --> 00:35:21.970
benefits you? Why would you try and fix it? So gloomy part off that.

649
00:35:21.971 --> 00:35:26.290
So I think what their needs almost be is like some sort of way in which actual

650
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.570
citizens and actual individuals are able,

651
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.650
whether it's engaging with tech companies and making, making, like, you know,

652
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.120
whether it's kind of saying,

653
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.400
like putting advertisement from things like Facebook to say,

654
00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:40.680
look on while you're going to still run political ads that are for spreading

655
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:41.640
lies. Well then, you know,

656
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:44.700
we're not going to advertise which a dark can be part of the solution,

657
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.050
but I also think another practice solution is, is,

658
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.760
is that taking that to a democratic level as well, it's going right for,

659
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.930
for MPS, for individual MPS who are found guilty of doing instead,

660
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.780
it becomes something that isn't just forgotten about. And isn't,

661
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.830
doesn't just move on from that. Like, so you do end up continuing on this is,

662
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.510
you know, this is, this is who this is what's happened and making that,

663
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:06.870
you know,

664
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.870
making that an actual point that that's just reiterated over and over again,

665
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:13.260
but it is, I'm not, I'm not Panglossian.

666
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:15.720
I do realize that in the current climate,

667
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.860
as long as politicians think they can get away with the only way around that is

668
00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:23.580
making the public say something, say that this isn't, you know, that politicians

669
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.993
will not tolerate.

670
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.480
<v 0>[Inaudible] the mood is going to change. I thought you were,</v>

671
00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.680
you were quite right from what you said earlier about, well, look,

672
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.690
any scandal will be tolerated, would not even be a scandal,

673
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.300
uh, to say supporters of leave.

674
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.630
If the politician century was a leader,

675
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.510
because what mattered to them was leaving the EU.

676
00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.990
Everything else was diversity and could always be dismissed though.

677
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.400
It's just moaning remain is trying to get involved. Now that's fading,

678
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.220
uh, people's incomes,

679
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.690
people's jobs are going up in smoke because of the COVID crisis.

680
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.240
And that is a, um,

681
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.520
there is a very bad smell about this government. Uh, anything goes,

682
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.890
uh, smell of entitlements. Um, I,

683
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:17.840
I thought the most interesting thing about it is partly the same as what your

684
00:37:17.841 --> 00:37:20.690
book's about, but about DMing, Dominic Cummings

685
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.010
was all he needed to do. When the guardian in the mirror broke.

686
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.470
The story on the Friday was, well,

687
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.290
he could have resigned that would have killed the story drops.

688
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.800
You sort of get set you're out. But if he, even if he has a college,

689
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.510
there is such an aggressive maps show.

690
00:37:41.511 --> 00:37:46.250
We are the masters now culture in this government, you never conceived an end.

691
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:51.140
You never apologize. You never recreate you. Uh, whatever it is,

692
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.250
whatever it is is where you've done. We can always say, Oh yes,

693
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.420
remain as this guest repeats. It's just our enemies making this up. We can,

694
00:37:59.421 --> 00:38:03.590
in the case of Dominic Cummings, even for his own blog posts to make it look,

695
00:38:03.591 --> 00:38:07.100
he's so essential, he saw COVID-19 coming. Um,

696
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.010
I wonder how the optimist in me, I'm not usually twos are being optimists. Yes.

697
00:38:13.011 --> 00:38:13.880
One does this,

698
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.890
how long this one will luckily decadent periods of English history can last,

699
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:24.200
before people start turning, particularly people whose incomes and tattoos,

700
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:28.280
jobs are going there's relatives might have died of COVID how long they were put

701
00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:29.114
out.

702
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:30.463
<v 1>It was interesting. I thought,</v>

703
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.150
I thought the dominant calming thing was bearings.

704
00:38:32.151 --> 00:38:34.370
And especially when you sort of polling around us, you know, uh,

705
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.120
lots of voters were really unhappy with a lot of leave.

706
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:38.410
Voters were really unhappy with it.

707
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.020
And the government tried to frame it as a leave remain thing, you know,

708
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.330
in the guard in America, you know, campaigning remaining newspapers.

709
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.010
And I don't think that worked and as it did.

710
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:52.630
And if you look at the polls, it really didn't.

711
00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.660
And that I think is going to be almost unsustainable position.

712
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:59.050
Say in six months time, you know, after January, I think it's going to be very,

713
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:01.960
very hard to frame everything. It's a breakfast of your conspiracy, you know,

714
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:04.570
as a, as a romaine conspiracy, no idea. I would agree.

715
00:39:04.571 --> 00:39:06.520
I think there's more reasons to be cheerful.

716
00:39:06.521 --> 00:39:10.750
If you look at the kind of polling data without comparing America to Britain,

717
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.740
I think it's easy to over compare the two, the two places.

718
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.790
It's easy to see too much of a bleed over from one to the other.

719
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.770
Even though my book, I talk a lot about those links.

720
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:23.560
And I think there's definitely in terms of money and politics a lot going on,

721
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.680
but the two societies are fundamentally actually really different.

722
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:29.230
I've lived in both of them and they really are very different.

723
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.430
And I think we're not at that level of cultural Wars here where if Boris Johnson

724
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:36.580
stands up and says black is white, everyone will go. Yeah, of course. You know,

725
00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:38.620
at least there's a lot of people who won't and it's still,

726
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.110
and I think there is actually in that respect. I do think there's reasonable.

727
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:45.870
<v 0>Be careful. Right. Um, thank you so much.</v>

728
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.410
And I'd like to end by saying everyone watching she'll go out and buy a copy of

729
00:39:49.411 --> 00:39:53.970
this book, preferably with their own money, not corrupt money, not stolen money,

730
00:39:53.971 --> 00:39:58.830
but I'm thought Peter will accept any sales. Um, uh, thank you.

731
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.940
And thank you very much for, uh, uh, depressing,

732
00:40:02.941 --> 00:40:04.680
but still invigorating conversation.

733
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.550
<v 1>Thank you very much and time. Thanks for making me imagine myself as a, as the,</v>

734
00:40:08.551 --> 00:40:09.660
as the prime minister one day.
