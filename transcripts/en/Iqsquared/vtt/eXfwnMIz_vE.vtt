00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>Hello, I'm Linda you and kind of nurse and author of the great economists.</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.450
Welcome to this video episode of the intelligence squared podcast.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.220
I'm delighted to be joined by Reese Weideman contributing editor at

4
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:18.870
New York magazine to talk about his new book, billion dollar loser,

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.430
subtitled the Epic rise and spectacular fall of

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.680
Adam Newman. And we work.

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.990
So we work is a coworking office space company founded about a

8
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:35.490
decade or so ago and was the largest office tenant in New York city.

9
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:40.470
And second in London next to only the UK government valued at

10
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:42.690
$47 billion at its peak.

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.320
It was the second most valuable private startup in America.

12
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
It then had a failed IPO in 2019 that the New York times described as

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.820
quote an implosion, unlike any other in the history of startups.

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.343
So, Bruce,

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.570
let's talk about what happened to we work and that's co-founder and CEO,

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.370
Adam Newman. So you open the book with a quote about Adam Newman, um,

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.520
and you quote his high school teacher who said, quote,

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.140
either Adam will end up in jail or he'll become a millionaire.

19
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.600
So why did you open with that quote?

20
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.401
<v 1>Well,</v>

21
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:23.420
we thought it was fitting cause I think part of what's interesting about this

22
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:26.600
story and what was interesting about it to me as I reported on,

23
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.400
on the company was that all of the good things about we work are not all,

24
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.580
but a lot of the good things and the reason it was successful, um,

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.960
stemmed from Adam Newman, um, as did a lot of the reasons it fell apart.

26
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:43.400
And so it was interesting to find that that kind of this,

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.290
this personality that he had of someone who was, who was so ambitious, um,

28
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.340
and, and, you know, so charismatic and,

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.360
and always, you know, going at 110%, uh,

30
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:58.100
with their way back in, in high school.

31
00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:01.910
And everyone could kind of re recognize that he was not going to be someone who,

32
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.460
you know, just kind of disappeared into the ether.

33
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:08.750
He was going to do something interesting, maybe a little crazy,

34
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:12.170
maybe successful, maybe not. Um, but whatever it was,

35
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.950
it was going to be interesting to watch what happened to Adam from there.

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.180
<v 0>And you're right, that some employees that we work,</v>

37
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.690
you spoke to compare Adam Newman to Steve jobs,

38
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.850
both emanated a quote reality distortion field

39
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.140
that convinced anyone within this radius that the impossible was not only

40
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:37.460
plausible, but exactly what they were going to do.

41
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.080
So in June

42
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.750
we work employees and mentioned that many of them use the opportunity of your

43
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:48.140
conversations as a free therapy session.

44
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.750
So what was your impressions of the employees as they were in this reality

45
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:57.560
distortion field health, and how did you conduct the research for this book?

46
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.040
Well, there was, there was.

47
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.310
<v 1>Kind of a shift for people. I think, you know, when,</v>

48
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.090
when a lot of employees got there in, in coming from,

49
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.580
in some cases straight out of college,

50
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.240
in other cases from kind of boring jobs elsewhere, they were really excited.

51
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.780
And, and to hear Adam get up on stage and tell them, you know,

52
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:19.450
we're not just renting out office space, we're changing the world.

53
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.420
We're making a difference in people's lives. Every single day was,

54
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:24.410
was really inspiring to people. And,

55
00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:28.690
and I think some of them had never had a job before didn't know what was kind of

56
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.530
quote unquote normal at a company. And, and, and so, you know,

57
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:37.030
when they found themselves working 80 hours a week, 90 hours a week,

58
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.840
they could kind of justify it in their heads because of the way Adam talked

59
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:41.680
about, uh,

60
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.570
what they were doing by the end of things after the IPO had fell apart.

61
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.690
Um, as I started to talk to more and more people who had,

62
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.630
who had left the company either willingly or unwillingly, they,

63
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:55.010
they were sort of jaded. And,

64
00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:59.500
and often they talked about their experience in as if,

65
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.910
um, we work with some kind of cult that they had kind of escaped from, uh, in,

66
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.480
in a certain way that that was exciting for a while.

67
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.830
But eventually you sort of realize, um, that, uh,

68
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.610
you you're working your whole life is wrapped up in this company.

69
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:19.930
All your friends are, are at this, at this, uh, at the company.

70
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.720
Um, and, and you're sort of uncertain why you did this,

71
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.820
especially given how things ended up.

72
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.970
<v 2>Wow. So just to say a bit about your research for the book,</v>

73
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.720
I'm thinking you write about in the book and that you've talked to hundreds of

74
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:37.554
employees.

75
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.930
<v 1>Yeah. So I started reporting on the company back in the spring of 2019 back when</v>

76
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:46.920
things were sort of still flying high, the company was worth $47 billion.

77
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:50.550
The IPO hadn't even been announced yet. Um, and at that point,

78
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.120
when I was just sort of writing a feature story for New York magazine,

79
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.620
we were just interested in the company because suddenly our office in Soho in

80
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:03.060
New York was surrounded by half a dozen Weaveworks seemingly sort of overnight.

81
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:07.110
So it was trying to kind of look at, um, what, uh,

82
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.350
just how this company had grown so quickly, so fast. And,

83
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.700
and as I started reporting then, um, again, back in,

84
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.800
uh, the spring of 2019, um, it became clear that,

85
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.950
that there were some unusual things about the company and that all of them, as,

86
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.350
as we talked about at the top, uh, stemmed from Adam, um, and,

87
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.840
and it was difficult to get people to talk about the company. And,

88
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:35.190
and this is kind of the struggle of reporting about any of these kinds of high

89
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.400
flying startups is, is that on the way up everyone on the inside is,

90
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:44.340
is kind of incentivized to go along with things, even, even if the,

91
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.490
the things that they're seeing, um, uh,

92
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.980
give them pause. Uh, and, and that could be for one reason or another one,

93
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:56.860
one reason is that we were kind of cracked down on, on people a lot who,

94
00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:58.220
who speak out, um,

95
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.760
and the other was just that people thought they were going to get rich. Um,

96
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.900
if you were an executive at this company, or even a low level employee, um,

97
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.990
you were being told over and over again by by Adam and others,

98
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.820
that we're going to go public one day,

99
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.450
your stock's going to make all this work that you did worth it. So,

100
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.270
so it was hard early on to get people to talk, um,

101
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.920
once the IPO fell apart and that incentive kind of went away and people were

102
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.440
frankly kind of upset with Adam, um,

103
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.210
it was much easier to get people to speak about their experiences. And that, uh,

104
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.440
as, as you said, I ended up talking to a few hundred people, uh,

105
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.740
who worked at the company, um, both from the most junior ranks,

106
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:40.820
all the way to the most senior people, um, within WeWork, uh,

107
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.930
as well as kind of this,

108
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.530
the investors and the landlords and all the people who sort of circled around

109
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.930
the company and dealt with Adam over the years.

110
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.490
<v 0>And retain a bit more about what Adam Newman was like when you</v>

111
00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:58.780
interviewed him for the book, you describe his office as having,

112
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.040
not just a private bathroom, but also a sauna.

113
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.490
<v 1>Yeah. He had sort of a two room suite, uh, kind of back in the corner.</v>

114
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:13.510
He had this kind of sauna and cold plunge tub, uh, that,

115
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:17.350
that had been installed. And there was a certain irony to the whole thing.

116
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:17.741
You know, the,

117
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:22.570
the business of WeWork was squeezing people into these famous glass cubes

118
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.050
that they, they had, uh, installed all over the world. Um,

119
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.890
it was squeezing people into smaller and smaller spaces. And,

120
00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:33.050
and here was Adam in, in kind of a pretty large office by,

121
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.280
by any standard. You know, that being said, you,

122
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:40.560
you could sort of recognize in meeting him kind of some of the reasons that that

123
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.270
people bought into what he was selling,

124
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.540
whether that was investors or employees or,

125
00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:50.230
or whatever audience he was addressing. He, he was just the kind of person who,

126
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.750
um, is, is charismatic, who,

127
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.440
who makes you kind of knows what you want to hear and,

128
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.220
and makes you believe in, in kind of what he's he's selling.

129
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:04.150
So that was one of his great skills. And I think, you know,

130
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.800
even in just sort of a brief interaction with him, you can see how,

131
00:08:07.801 --> 00:08:10.690
how people were, were attracted to, to being around him.

132
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.420
<v 0>And give us a sense of the New York real estate world,</v>

133
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.040
where we work started. Um,

134
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.990
so you describe how Adam Newman and Jared Kushner president Trump's son-in-law,

135
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.510
who was also the real estate. Um,

136
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.810
so tell us how they resolve disputes. I think, uh,

137
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:31.270
shots and arm wrestling might've been involved.

138
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.460
<v 1>Yeah, well, well, yeah,</v>

139
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.660
New York real estate is real estate anywhere has no shortage of colorful

140
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:41.080
characters. And, and, um, you know, yeah, both,

141
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.990
both Adam and Jared Kushner were kind of young,

142
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.180
real estate guys in,

143
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:50.130
in the city coming out of the last financial crisis. Jared was,

144
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:53.110
was trying to push his family business more and more into Manhattan.

145
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.910
Adam was growing his business there.

146
00:08:54.911 --> 00:08:59.520
They were about the same age and they connected. Um, and, and we worked at, uh,

147
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.080
did a few deals, um, with, uh, with Kirschner's, uh,

148
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.760
properties, both in Brooklyn and Philadelphia. And as you, as you mentioned,

149
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:13.500
you know, they, they came up with a colorful way to kind of resolve one dispute,

150
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:18.360
which was, um, uh, an arm wrestling match in, in Adam's office.

151
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.860
We were headquarters, uh, in lower Manhattan. Um, Jared lost, uh,

152
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.270
Adam bragged about how he had,

153
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.930
had done a lot of arm wrestling when he was in the Israeli Navy. Um,

154
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.830
Jared did object to the, the loss, um, and,

155
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:36.210
and demanded a rematch, but, but he lost that one as well.

156
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.180
So we work, uh, one, one out on that deal.

157
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.800
<v 0>Well, um, okay. So in a nutshell, um,</v>

158
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.710
how did we work, grow so fast.

159
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.170
<v 1>A few things, uh, all of which STEM from money, um, is, is,</v>

160
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:57.050
is sort of the easy answer. I mean,

161
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.530
if you go back and look at the early days of the company,

162
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.540
they were not the first people to invent the idea of flexible office

163
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:08.840
space or coworking, or the various things that they did.

164
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:13.610
There were other operators already. What, what Adam had was on the one hand, um,

165
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.790
ambition, you know, a lot of people who run these companies are,

166
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.640
are happy to have a few spaces in one city here or there. Um, and,

167
00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:23.930
and content with that, and content was slow growth,

168
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.610
Adam from the very beginning wanted to grow, and he,

169
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.410
he had access to the capital, um, necessary to do it. You know,

170
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:35.150
this as much as he would later often talk about the company as a sort of a

171
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.940
tech company, or at least a tech adjacent company,

172
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.330
this was a real estate business. And to expand a real estate business,

173
00:10:41.331 --> 00:10:45.980
you need capital, um, you need investment just for the basic,

174
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.780
um, construction and operation of, of your, your spaces. So,

175
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.380
um, Adam was in kind of a elite circles,

176
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:58.700
or at least on the fringes of that in New York is his wife. Um, uh,

177
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.240
Rebecca Paltrow was, was Gwyneth Paltrow's cousin. Um,

178
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.140
so from the very early days, he, he, he had access to certain circles in,

179
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:10.010
in New York that, that had money. He was able to sort of tap that to,

180
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.310
to grow the company early on. And then from then on, he was,

181
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.410
he was very good at, at pitching to investors and, and, you know,

182
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:22.880
some people like to just sort of suggest that there's some sort of con artist

183
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:25.820
aspect to that, but the reality is it's, it's a,

184
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.640
it's a skill for any business person. And Adam was,

185
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.320
it was especially sort of adept at going to investors and convincing

186
00:11:33.321 --> 00:11:37.790
them that this was not just kind of a boring real estate business. Uh,

187
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.120
but that this was a business that was going to disrupt, um,

188
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.330
the real estate world. And, you know, investors were,

189
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.730
were obviously interested in that,

190
00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:50.990
given how big of a market potentially the commercial office space world was,

191
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.420
they were willing to give him a really kind of shocking amounts of money, uh,

192
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:57.640
escalating more and more over the years. And,

193
00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.310
and that was the crucial difference, um,

194
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:05.320
between we work and other companies in this industry was Adam's ability to

195
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:08.680
raise that money, to then spend to, um,

196
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.420
expand that we work empire.

197
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.670
<v 0>So I wanted to, um, delve into this a bit.</v>

198
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.870
And so let's start with we work's mission. Um, so you, right. Um,

199
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.520
their mission was to elevate the world's consciousness, um,

200
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.810
community, um,

201
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.730
was mentioned in their IPO filing document 150 times, you right,

202
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.970
while office space appeared nine times.

203
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.660
So you called out in the room and I'm saying that we work, uh,

204
00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:38.160
wasn't a real estate company.

205
00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:42.690
It was a tech enabled physical social network.

206
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.560
So this is a big part of the pitch, the rise, wasn't it?

207
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.240
<v 1>Yeah, this was, this was the pitch that, that somehow, you know,</v>

208
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.260
Adam was attaching, we work to sort of the, the other unicorns,

209
00:12:55.261 --> 00:12:58.650
the other billion dollar companies, uh, in, in Silicon Valley.

210
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.120
And trying to sort of say that we work was, was, yeah,

211
00:13:03.121 --> 00:13:06.030
it was not just renting out space that they were creating this,

212
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.240
this social network and, you know, the, the elevating,

213
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:11.790
the world's consciousness, um, uh, came,

214
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.270
came sort of later and was sort of the grandest manifestation of,

215
00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:19.620
of Adam's vision, which, which again was, was to kind of,

216
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.620
as he said, many times to, to change the world.

217
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:25.170
And that was to change the world of real estate, but it was also to,

218
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.690
to do much more of that. And I think those,

219
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.450
the way that he talked about the company, while,

220
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.740
while it could sound ridiculous, and I think towards the end, it, it,

221
00:13:33.741 --> 00:13:37.170
it really came back to bite the company. It was kind of these,

222
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.850
these grand notions that Adam was good at talking about that that led

223
00:13:41.851 --> 00:13:44.850
people to buy into what he was selling.

224
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.740
<v 0>So I think just, just to go into a bit, you know,</v>

225
00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:52.260
shared office space, um, you know,

226
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.160
what was the kind of offering, um, that, um,

227
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:00.540
that sort of was behind, um, this ambition or this pitch of, um,

228
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.530
the way company?

229
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.770
<v 1>The business is pretty simple. Um, we work Brent's out of space in an office.</v>

230
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.080
Um, they go in, they renovate it. Um, they make it look cool with, um, you know,

231
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.230
uh, these, these sort of glass cubes, um,

232
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:21.170
these big open common spaces with free coffee and beer kegs and,

233
00:14:21.171 --> 00:14:25.790
and all of that. Um, and then they rent out the individual offices. And, and if,

234
00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:26.940
if you're able to do that,

235
00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:30.300
if you're able to fill all those offices and you charge more than you're paying

236
00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:33.750
in rent, then you can make it a decent amount of money. And,

237
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.290
and that's not a new business. There, there have been several over the years,

238
00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:38.460
including, um,

239
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.230
sort of most famously a company formerly known as Regis now called IWG that,

240
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.290
that has been doing this for decades. Um, you know,

241
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.320
they did a boring version of it. Uh, it was kind of, you know,

242
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:54.200
white walls and acoustic ceiling tiles and that sort of thing. Um,

243
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.930
we work w offered, uh,

244
00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:01.590
a different kind of vision for that, or more modern vision of,

245
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.100
of what the office would be a more millennial friendly kind of vision of,

246
00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:08.060
of what the office would be. And so at its core,

247
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.680
that was something that people wanted. They wanted community in their offices,

248
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.910
they liked the design and they liked the flexibility. You know, we work, if you,

249
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:19.730
if you wanted, you could rent your office months a month,

250
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.720
which was pretty unusual in the real estate world, um, where you,

251
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.190
you often are stuck with a five or 10 year 20 year lease.

252
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:31.340
So it was kind of those things that at its core, we work offered.

253
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:34.400
And for a long time, it was, it was what a lot of people want it.

254
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.690
<v 2>And then he had other businesses, um,</v>

255
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.720
that he was also developing as well as part of this offering.

256
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:46.270
<v 1>Yeah. So, and, and kind of from the beginning, um, the, he had,</v>

257
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.630
he had been thinking about this and, and wanting to, uh,

258
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.190
expand into other businesses.

259
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:55.780
One of the first that they tried was we live and we live

260
00:15:55.781 --> 00:15:58.340
was, uh, an apartment building. They,

261
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.800
they eventually built to one in Washington, DC, and one in New York city,

262
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.070
uh, that was sort of premised on the same idea.

263
00:16:06.071 --> 00:16:08.500
We're going to give you a small living space. Um,

264
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:13.420
these were tiny apartments even by New York city standards. Um,

265
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.480
and then these big open common spaces, big kitchens,

266
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.650
a laundry room with a pool table, those kinds of things on the idea that,

267
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.540
that what people wanted was community in their spaces that they wanted to know

268
00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:30.220
their neighbors and interact with them. And, you know, uh, that's, that's,

269
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.400
uh, it goes against a lot of, um, uh, received wisdom in,

270
00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:37.810
in the residential real estate world. Uh,

271
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.700
people don't often voluntarily give up more personal private

272
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:47.140
space, um, in, in their, in their homes. But, um, that was,

273
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.970
that was the idea. And then from there, they kind of spooled it into, uh,

274
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.650
starting a gym called rise by we, um, in, in New York city.

275
00:16:56.651 --> 00:17:01.450
And, uh, as well as an elementary school was kind of the last

276
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.340
iteration of this, um, called we grow that was led by, uh,

277
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.920
Rebecca Newman, um, uh, Adam's wife and, and,

278
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:14.320
and was meant to be kind of fill in this sort of holistic world where someone

279
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:16.030
could, could live at a, at a,

280
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:19.720
we live go to work at a WeWork and send their kids to a two a week route.

281
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.330
<v 2>Um, speaking of his wife, Rebecca,</v>

282
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.640
and you write that when Adam Newman was pitching this, we live concept smaller,

283
00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:33.910
personal space, more community space. Um, what was her reply?

284
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.810
<v 1>Uh, she was not interested in, in, uh, in, in living in that,</v>

285
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.760
uh, in that environment.

286
00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.340
So even though they thought this would be a place where,

287
00:17:45.341 --> 00:17:48.550
where the wealthy people would want to live as much as college students looking

288
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:51.780
for a dorm, um, Rebecca rejected that.

289
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.130
<v 0>And what was Adam's response when you asked him about this mission, this,</v>

290
00:17:58.131 --> 00:17:59.420
you know, this very, uh,

291
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.630
to elevate the world's consciousness in all of these ambitions,

292
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.563
but did he say to you.

293
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.160
<v 1>Well, it was a confusing conversation. Um, you know,</v>

294
00:18:07.161 --> 00:18:11.390
I had the thing that I relayed to him was that, uh, when I, um,

295
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.900
mentioned the mission to people, as I was telling them about,

296
00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:17.360
we were people who didn't know that much about the company and told them,

297
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.820
and they may have known that it was,

298
00:18:19.821 --> 00:18:23.420
it was kind of an office space company and a cool office space company at that.

299
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.720
And when I told them the mission was to elevate the world's consciousness,

300
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.390
that most common response I got was what does that mean?

301
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.560
And so when I relayed that to Adam, he sort of got excited and said, that's,

302
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:36.650
that's perfect. That's exactly what we want.

303
00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:40.610
We're starting the conversation about what it means to elevate the world's

304
00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:42.770
consciousness. And, uh,

305
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.840
I think that it's indicative of the fact that early on when the company was

306
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:51.720
providing these great office spaces that people liked and,

307
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:54.650
and was talking about, you know, build a life, not a living,

308
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.440
making a better day at work for people, but that was something that,

309
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.590
that everyone could connect to whether you are an employee or someone renting a

310
00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:04.640
space. And once it got to this notion of elevating the world's consciousness,

311
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.040
which again sounds good and well,

312
00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:11.090
and like something that any of us would want to aspire to, um,

313
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.710
it just felt really disconnected from the reality of what the company, uh,

314
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.573
actually did.

315
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.670
<v 0>And you mentioned, um, money as a big driver in WeWork's rise.</v>

316
00:19:22.671 --> 00:19:25.040
So private funders valued,

317
00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:29.690
we work as a billion dollar company, um, a unicorn, I learned a new term.

318
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.680
And from your book, uh, DECA corn, if you're working on the billion, uh,

319
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.120
DECA coin. So you quote a member of WeWork's finance team who said, uh,

320
00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:42.710
the nature of private markets is that if nine smart investors

321
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.490
pass, it only takes one relatively dumber investor,

322
00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:50.090
and then suddenly we're valued at $16 billion.

323
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.800
So just say a bit more about, um, the role of private investors, um,

324
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:59.060
specifically, um, I think SoftBank, um, was one that played a pretty big role.

325
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.910
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, we worked rise was, was fueled by, by private investors from,</v>

326
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.690
from all kinds of place. Their first investor was benchmark capital, a pretty,

327
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.340
um, one of the sort of blue chip. So account Valley tech firms, they got money,

328
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.450
uh, from a lot of New York institutions, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs,

329
00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:21.560
and eventually SoftBank and SoftBank was the biggest one. Um, in,

330
00:20:21.561 --> 00:20:26.180
in 2017 they invested $4 billion into WeWork. Uh,

331
00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:28.580
and this was from the vision fund,

332
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:33.320
which was a sort of a hundred billion dollar venture capital fund F uh,

333
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.190
funded largely by the Saudi Arabian government that,

334
00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:40.400
that SoftBank was going out and investing in companies that were by and large

335
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.950
tech companies. It was, it was meant to focus on,

336
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.370
on artificial intelligence is kind of what,

337
00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:49.780
what Masia saw the founder of SoftBank. And one of the,

338
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:51.430
sort of the most famous people in,

339
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:55.900
in kind of the business tech world is what he saw as the future. Um,

340
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.130
he invested in, in we work, um, you know, uh,

341
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.440
extensively on, on this notion of,

342
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.040
of WeWork was going to figure out how to use technology to sort of disrupt the

343
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:08.230
real estate world. But, but in large part,

344
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:13.000
he like many others bought into Adam's vision, um, of,

345
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.680
of changing the world and,

346
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.240
and creating this sort of globe spanning real estate company that will be unlike

347
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.920
any other, uh, that existed. And so, you know, the,

348
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:28.810
these venture capital firms are their whole business model is kind of predicated

349
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:33.070
on, on hitting home, runs on, um, funding.

350
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:37.570
These companies that can become these sort of giant world spanning corporations.

351
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.000
And if that means that, uh, you know,

352
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:43.060
they find 10 companies and 800 or nine of them fall apart,

353
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:47.770
but one of them becomes the next Amazon or Facebook or Google or Airbnb or Uber,

354
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.840
um, then it's all worth it. So in a lot of ways we work, you know, rise was,

355
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.570
was fueled by this group of people that were,

356
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.480
we're hoping even if the numbers didn't totally make sense that Adam could

357
00:21:58.481 --> 00:22:01.360
figure out how to turn WeWork into one of those kinds of companies.

358
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.860
<v 0>And SoftBank, um, bet on, uh, we were,</v>

359
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.600
can called it, um, the next Alibaba that you write about. So, um,

360
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.390
Masayoshi son, um, the head of, um,

361
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.920
the vision fund of SoftBank was known for investing $20 million in China's

362
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.870
Ali-Baba this e-commerce platform,

363
00:22:21.871 --> 00:22:26.760
which is very similar to Amazon and ended up with a stake worth more than

364
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.710
a hundred billion dollars, 20 million to a hundred billion dollars in a Chinese,

365
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:36.030
Chinese tech company. Um, yeah, I mean, he thought big didn't he,

366
00:22:36.031 --> 00:22:39.060
and this comes through in the book when you were writing about sort of his

367
00:22:39.061 --> 00:22:40.350
relationship without a Newman.

368
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.820
<v 1>Yeah. He that's what he did is he, he,</v>

369
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:49.050
he takes these kinds of risky bets and then pushes companies to become bigger

370
00:22:49.051 --> 00:22:52.560
and bigger. We say in the book, you know, he, he had had this, uh,

371
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.790
nickname from, from executives at Alibaba who called him Mr. 10 times.

372
00:22:56.791 --> 00:23:00.780
And they said, every time we had a goal or an ambition, he would say,

373
00:23:00.781 --> 00:23:04.410
make it 10 times bigger. And that was the same message he delivered to.

374
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.700
We work into Adam. You know, you, you have a thousand salespeople have 10,000,

375
00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:11.070
you have a million, if a hundred thousand members,

376
00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:15.030
why don't you have a million members? Um, all of, all of those kinds of things,

377
00:23:15.031 --> 00:23:18.450
he was there to sort of push the company and, and Adam was,

378
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:23.760
was willing to sort of be a vessel for that and push the company to try to meet

379
00:23:23.761 --> 00:23:24.594
those goals.

380
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.300
<v 0>You also write a great deal about the parties, um, and the antics. So,</v>

381
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.190
uh, I read a lot about tequila shots and fire extinguishers.

382
00:23:35.191 --> 00:23:37.320
So just tell us a couple of stories.

383
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.870
<v 1>Yeah. Well, you know, I'll tell,</v>

384
00:23:39.871 --> 00:23:43.610
I'll tell the one you're sort of alluding to there, which is, um, in,

385
00:23:43.611 --> 00:23:47.670
in 2016, uh, you know, we work with was running out of cash and,

386
00:23:47.671 --> 00:23:51.170
and they were trying to close a w another big investment round. And,

387
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.060
and they'd gone looking for money in China and really had struggled to get

388
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:59.180
interest in. And the only investor who came through was,

389
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:03.590
was a fund called HONY capital. And, uh,

390
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.640
the investors from Honi, including the founder of the firm, John Honi were,

391
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.080
were in New York and Adam invited them to, we live, um, the,

392
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:15.530
the sort of apartment tower in lower Manhattan where,

393
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.760
where a party was happening. And he told them to come by and check it out. Uh,

394
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.630
they did, uh, Adam took them up to the roof, uh, of the building,

395
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:27.290
which was not a place he was supposed to go, but at that point, he,

396
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.700
he more or less owned the building. So he was gonna do whatever he wanted. Um,

397
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.660
uh, we were complete, brought up a tray of tequila shots, um, which was just,

398
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.740
uh, a common site at, at pretty much every work event. Adam was, uh,

399
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.270
was a big fan of tequila and, and handed them out, um, at,

400
00:24:43.271 --> 00:24:46.250
at all kinds of events. And then at this one in particular,

401
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:49.870
he also brought a fire extinguisher and F after everyone gave a toast and,

402
00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:53.840
and took their shots, he, he sprayed the investors, um, with,

403
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.310
with the fire extinguisher and, and it's, uh, it's a ridiculous story. And it,

404
00:24:58.311 --> 00:25:02.030
it sort of repeats itself in all kinds of ways. And, and, and I think on,

405
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:04.040
on the one hand, obviously in hindsight,

406
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:07.190
you can look at it as kind of this moment of, of excess.

407
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:10.100
And there were so many in the company, but also on the way up,

408
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.770
it was one of the things that people loved about WeWork.

409
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.410
People loved living there, you know, young or working there,

410
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:20.390
rather young people, um, you know, loved going to a company that,

411
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.790
that knew how to throw a good party. And,

412
00:25:22.791 --> 00:25:27.560
and we obviously now know that that is, um, is, is problematic, but,

413
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.810
but in this case, um, with, with the Honi investors, you know, as,

414
00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:33.890
as one of the employees who was on the roof told me, you know,

415
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.670
we closed the deal next week. So, you know, clearly, you know,

416
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:41.540
while this wood is not something most more conservative business people would

417
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:46.080
do, it was part of the way Adam operated and part of the swagger that,

418
00:25:46.081 --> 00:25:48.200
that he had, and that attracted people to him.

419
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.370
<v 0>And part of that was the annual summer camp.</v>

420
00:25:51.371 --> 00:25:54.850
Wasn't a worldly employees and go somewhere. So, um,

421
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.900
I found it really entertaining to read about the summer camps, um,

422
00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.310
and the, uh, the requirements for Adam Newman, uh,

423
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.130
for his, um, tent. Uh, just tell us a bit about that.

424
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.350
<v 1>Yeah, well, we work had this annual summer camp for the first five or six years.</v>

425
00:26:11.351 --> 00:26:16.150
It was held at a, at an actual summer camp, um, outside of, of New York city.

426
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.820
Um, and it was essentially ostensibly, it was a weekend corporate retreat.

427
00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:25.390
What it, what it ended up feeling was, was a big party. Um,

428
00:26:25.391 --> 00:26:29.380
they would invite big musical guests and there was an open bar. And I know,

429
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:31.990
again, a lot of people who attended describe it as,

430
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.820
as one of the most fun events they've had by the end of it by 2018,

431
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.720
the event was costing the company tens of millions of dollars. And, and, uh,

432
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.100
one employee sort of shared with me this, um,

433
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.700
three and a half page long list of, of materials that,

434
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:50.280
that the Newman's wanted for,

435
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.900
for their sort of compound at summer camp. Uh, you know, it was a long list of,

436
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.760
of alcohol of snacks.

437
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.950
My favorite was that they needed to have at least 400 plastic shot glasses,

438
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.560
uh, was, was my favorite item on the list. And,

439
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.490
and I think eventually this became sort of galling to a lot of WeWork employees

440
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:13.140
who were in tiny tents, they were sharing in the cold, um,

441
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.150
and, and in the rain and, and Adam is kind of living in this kind of manner.

442
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.680
So a lot of the talk about changing the world and making it a better place and

443
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:26.610
elevating the world's consciousness sort of started to fall hollow or feel

444
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:29.520
hollow when, when he's also doing things like this.

445
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.910
<v 0>Hmm. So let's discuss, um, the fall of we work. Um, so, uh,</v>

446
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:38.780
revenues are doubling every year, but expenses were growing, um,

447
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.620
even faster. Um, and so that was, um,

448
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.660
one of the factors. And in fact, I might tie that into blitz scaling,

449
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.590
um, a term that you, um, you write about, um,

450
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.600
that Jenny Silicon Valley and lightening growth and not being too worried about

451
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.340
risk or cost, um, so that you can gain market share.

452
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.720
Um, and this was one of the kind of, um, approaches, um, wasn't it,

453
00:28:05.721 --> 00:28:07.550
that kind of fueled the rise of rework.

454
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.950
<v 1>Yeah, it was this, this sort of growth at all costs mentality. And,</v>

455
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:18.110
um, that the idea was that that in order to capture a market, um,

456
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.810
you needed to go Crick quickly before, um,

457
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.310
any of your other competitors could sort of catch up and that if you become this

458
00:28:25.311 --> 00:28:28.430
giant company, you sort of become too big to fail. And,

459
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.350
and this was a thing that, uh,

460
00:28:30.351 --> 00:28:34.160
an idea that was taking over a lot of tech companies and where, where, you know,

461
00:28:34.161 --> 00:28:38.210
becoming a platform was the hot thing to do and becoming a company that sort of

462
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:43.120
took over any one of these industries. And so, uh, you know, Adam, uh, and,

463
00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:47.870
and we work adopted that, um, mentality at least, and, and sort of,

464
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.640
uh, deployed it, um, deployed it in, in growing we work.

465
00:28:52.641 --> 00:28:56.030
Of course the problem was, it's just, it's just much more expensive to do,

466
00:28:56.090 --> 00:29:00.320
to build these, to build out an actual space than to build a piece of software.

467
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:05.030
And, and so the blitz scaling, we work was much more expensive than,

468
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.600
than blitz scaling as sort of more traditional tech software company.

469
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.140
<v 0>So you arrived by 2017. So sort of, um, the last few years,</v>

470
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.370
um, one of his early investors benchmark, uh, was, um,

471
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.440
increasingly worried. Um, they had thought that we work is supposed to be, um,

472
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.270
a $500 billion in profit, but instead it was losing a billion in 2017,

473
00:29:29.271 --> 00:29:33.710
by 2018, we work was losing $2 billion and raise

474
00:29:33.711 --> 00:29:37.700
$702 million in debt financing.

475
00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:39.890
And this is after obviously having raised, um,

476
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.300
large amount of money from private investors. Um,

477
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:47.830
the financial times that you write about describe their community adjusted

478
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.650
AP da as perhaps the most infamous financial metric of a generation.

479
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:55.300
So tell us about this, um,

480
00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.040
modified measure of what we would normally take as an indicator of

481
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:01.030
profitability.

482
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.210
<v 1>Yeah. Um, you know, EBITDA is sort of a traditional way of companies sort of,</v>

483
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:06.930
you know,

484
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.580
thinking about an and expressing whether they're making money and it's,

485
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.380
and, uh, we were kids sort of added on this phrase community adjusted, uh,

486
00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.214
to sort of,

487
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:21.060
as a way of kind of taking out certain costs that the company said would go away

488
00:30:21.061 --> 00:30:25.020
over time, marketing costs, uh, construction design costs,

489
00:30:25.021 --> 00:30:29.940
and then also streamlining some of the costs of their leases. And,

490
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.790
you know, there's a way in which that,

491
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.750
that idea isn't totally ridiculous. I, I think some,

492
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.570
some people certainly objected to the notion that those costs would just

493
00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:43.590
disappear. Um, what was almost as equally galling was,

494
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.730
was just the name of it. Community adjusted. Nobody knew what that meant.

495
00:30:47.731 --> 00:30:51.930
And it, it felt just like kind of another example of the company, um,

496
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.030
taking this kind of high minded language and almost

497
00:30:57.031 --> 00:31:01.620
trying to pull the wool over people's eyes and not let them see what it was they

498
00:31:01.621 --> 00:31:04.380
were doing, which was just cutting out some of their costs.

499
00:31:04.381 --> 00:31:09.030
And instead kind of inflecting it with this sort of community focused language.

500
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.540
So that was one of the reasons that sort of particularly turned off a lot of

501
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:13.374
investors.

502
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.930
<v 0>Um, and yet at that point, SoftBank was considering putting in more. Um,</v>

503
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.110
and I think around that period, um,

504
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.770
there were thinking about as much as $20 billion, which would have put,

505
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.400
we worked valued over a $40 billion.

506
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:30.990
And when you were writing about a,

507
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.410
you said that would actually double the value that SoftBank had put on the

508
00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:39.030
company just a year ago. And Adam Newman went retained control.

509
00:31:39.031 --> 00:31:43.650
He would work be worth $13 billion making him one of the richest people

510
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.970
in the world,

511
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:49.680
but the Saudis and Abu Dhabi who were partly being investors in,

512
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.920
um, SoftBank balked at it, uh,

513
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.580
SoftBank's on listing of a snowball phone arm tank. So the deal was off.

514
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.790
So we work needed more money,

515
00:31:59.791 --> 00:32:04.230
and that's why they planned to IPO in 2019.

516
00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:09.210
So just describe, um, this, uh, IPO and the race to do it,

517
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.170
um, before the end of last year, uh, where we work, um,

518
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.820
would have run out of money. Yeah.

519
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.800
<v 1>Yeah. A lot of people, I think on the outside of these companies look at IPOs,</v>

520
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:24.690
as you know, this is, this is my chance to get in on the next hot company.

521
00:32:24.691 --> 00:32:27.750
That's gonna fund my kids' college retirement, but in reality,

522
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.380
IPO's are just companies need more money and they have to go to the private

523
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.710
public markets rather to look for it. And then that was the case with WeWork,

524
00:32:34.711 --> 00:32:37.980
where they weren't going to get any more money from SoftBank.

525
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:42.890
They were continuing to at this incredible rate. Um, and, and to do that,

526
00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:47.240
they, they needed more money. And so that drove the impulse, um,

527
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.010
for WeWork to go public,

528
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:53.180
Adam Newman had had hopes to avoid it for a long time.

529
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:57.410
Being a public company just requires more scrutiny. Um, and,

530
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.760
and honestly kind of some, some sort of, uh, suppressing of,

531
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:06.330
of some of the grand ambitions that he had. Um, so it was not something that,

532
00:33:06.331 --> 00:33:09.020
that he or the company sort of did willfully,

533
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:12.170
but it was sort of a necessity by the end, if,

534
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.590
if the company was going to be able to continue growing the way that it,

535
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:16.483
it hoped to.

536
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.670
<v 0>So as part of promoting this IPO, trying to get interest in it you're right.</v>

537
00:33:21.671 --> 00:33:26.530
That Adam Newman struggled to explain why we work with different from another

538
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.990
real estate leasing company IWG,

539
00:33:28.991 --> 00:33:33.820
which is trading at a market capitalization of $4 billion and

540
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:38.170
not the $47 billion valuation of WIWORK.

541
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.080
So I'm just telling us about the failure of the IPO.

542
00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.990
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, a few things happened, um, you know, on the one hand,</v>

543
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.250
people finally got to look at the numbers and they saw how much money we work

544
00:33:51.251 --> 00:33:54.550
with losing. Um, they saw that, you know,

545
00:33:54.551 --> 00:33:58.690
there was this feeling or this fear almost in the real estate world that we,

546
00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.660
our kids sort of figured something out that the rest of the real estate world

547
00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:03.790
hadn't, but, but when people looked at the numbers, it,

548
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.580
it looked kind of like a normal sort of real estate business. And,

549
00:34:07.581 --> 00:34:12.100
and then when you took sort of the way that looked with kind of all of

550
00:34:12.101 --> 00:34:13.120
this, um,

551
00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:17.800
sort of gobbledygook language that was attached to the company about elevating

552
00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:20.500
the world's consciousness, um, the, the,

553
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.970
the IPO paperwork was filled with these kind of buzzwords and taglines about the

554
00:34:24.971 --> 00:34:27.280
energy of we. Um, and,

555
00:34:27.281 --> 00:34:31.250
and then along with kind of some of the conflicts of interests that emerged that

556
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:31.860
the way that,

557
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.320
that Adam and his family were sort of profiting off of the company,

558
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:39.130
gave this perception of, of, of just, uh, you know,

559
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:44.080
sort of a perfect storm of problems that the numbers weren't good. Um,

560
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:49.000
no one could quite figure out what the company was or what it intended to

561
00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:52.480
be. And then it seemed to have all these problems sort of at the heart of it.

562
00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.500
And a lot of them stemming from Adam, I think just gave, uh,

563
00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.610
investors pause and, and in the public markets, these are just more cautious,

564
00:35:00.611 --> 00:35:05.500
more conservative investors than they are, um, in, in the venture capital world.

565
00:35:05.501 --> 00:35:08.380
And, and they weren't willing to take a risk on the country.

566
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.830
<v 0>Okay. So just say a bit more about, um,</v>

567
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.370
the kind of conflicts of interest that, um, that you write about,

568
00:35:15.371 --> 00:35:19.390
which is part of the issue with public investors sort of bulking, and then,

569
00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.370
then, then basically having to pull the IPO.

570
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.590
<v 1>Yeah. There were a few things, I mean,</v>

571
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.310
the biggest one was that that Adam himself was, was the, uh, owner of,

572
00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:33.190
of several buildings that we work with leasing. Um, so, so in, in that way,

573
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.600
uh, his own company was paying him rent. Um, and,

574
00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:39.540
and know when it comes time to negotiate the lease, uh,

575
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.050
who who's gonna going to win out on that negotiation. And,

576
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.980
and it was those kinds of things that just gave at least the perception of a

577
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:51.660
company that, that did not have strong corporate governance. Um,

578
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:56.070
there was, there was another case in which Adam had sold, um,

579
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.820
had, had personally bought trademarks or these,

580
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.450
we related trademarks that he then sold to the company for

581
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.900
$5.9 billion. Um, and, and in some ways these were sort of accounting decisions,

582
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:13.810
but, but in, in, in total, they kind of gave the perception of a,

583
00:36:13.811 --> 00:36:18.190
of a company that was as much a family business, um, as it was, uh,

584
00:36:18.191 --> 00:36:19.800
a company ready to be public.

585
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.420
<v 0>And you also wrote that, um,</v>

586
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.970
Adam Newman sold millions of dollars worth of shares in 2017. Um,

587
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.620
and the question that you asked was, um,

588
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.520
why cash out if there are greater riches ahead? So why did he do it?

589
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:41.360
<v 1>Um, good question. Uh, you know, I, I think that,</v>

590
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:46.520
uh, the obvious answer is that he, he, he wanted to cash out, um, and,

591
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.650
and that he wanted, uh,

592
00:36:48.651 --> 00:36:52.640
at the time to have these hundreds of millions of dollars that he would

593
00:36:52.641 --> 00:36:56.090
otherwise have to be waiting for. I mean, the, the cynical view is,

594
00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.380
is did he actually believe that that the company was going to be worth as much

595
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.340
as, as the private investors were valuing? Um, I think he did. Uh,

596
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.210
I think he knew he was, he was pulling some kind of trick, but, uh, but, um,

597
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.770
and that, and that this might not work out,

598
00:37:09.771 --> 00:37:13.580
but I think he also believed very strongly and in the company and,

599
00:37:13.581 --> 00:37:16.280
and the fact that it was, and, and a belief that it was,

600
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:20.630
it was going to become as big. And he, uh, as he had Masayoshi son,

601
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.860
um, uh, hoped it would be, but, you know,

602
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:28.310
the Newman's at one point owned seven homes, um,

603
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.640
and were spending close to a hundred million dollars on personal real estate

604
00:37:31.641 --> 00:37:36.050
alone. So, um, you have to fund that in some way. And,

605
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.220
and Adam, you know, it was, is not alone in, in startup founders,

606
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.890
sort of selling off some of their shares in order to,

607
00:37:42.891 --> 00:37:46.460
to live the lifestyle they, they want, but he certainly was,

608
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.870
was more extravagant than most.

609
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.860
<v 0>And how did that, uh, Newman end up getting ousted from WIWORK. Um,</v>

610
00:37:55.490 --> 00:38:00.290
and, um, and I think you ride that, um, SoftBank's, um,

611
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.430
uh, Masayoshi son said we created a monster. Um,

612
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.700
so they were acquired to the exit for Adam wasn't weren't they?

613
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:09.770
<v 1>Yeah. You know,</v>

614
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.630
eventually once things went sour with the IPO, um,

615
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:19.640
it became clear to we works backers and Adam's backers

616
00:38:19.641 --> 00:38:22.910
that, that a lot of the problems were tied up with him and,

617
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.930
and that it was going to be hard for the company to move forward. And so, um,

618
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.410
you know, S and the company also needed needed money. So,

619
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.920
so SoftBank came in with this, this kind of rescue package, um,

620
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.510
part of which was predicated on Adam, stepping down as, as CEO and,

621
00:38:39.511 --> 00:38:41.830
and, uh, and it was clear that now, you know,

622
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:45.040
the backer that he had once depended on, um,

623
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.940
was now saying that he was not the person most well-equipped to,

624
00:38:49.941 --> 00:38:54.070
to lead the company forward. And, and, you know, he was,

625
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:58.210
he was kind of out of chips at that point. All of his money was at this point,

626
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.280
you know, still tied up in the company. He,

627
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.570
the last thing he wanted was to see it go down. And,

628
00:39:02.571 --> 00:39:06.310
and certainly in that moment, um, it felt like there was no other option,

629
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:09.010
but for, for Adam to, to step down.

630
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.870
<v 2>So SoftBank has not been sued haven't they?</v>

631
00:39:12.871 --> 00:39:17.460
So there's a legal dispute going on right now. So what's happened to we work.

632
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.330
<v 1>Um, yes, the, the exit package that,</v>

633
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.890
that SoftBank and Adam agreed to this roughly billion dollar exit packages is

634
00:39:25.891 --> 00:39:29.910
now under dispute there's there's, uh, the lawyers are involved. Um,

635
00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.840
uh, the SoftBank is claiming that, that we work itself, uh,

636
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.570
sort of did not live up to various terms of the deal. And that is,

637
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.010
is going to be adjudicated in, in, in the months ahead. And, and we'll,

638
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.770
we'll see what happens. Um, we work itself is,

639
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.920
is trying to figure out how to be a commercial real estate company in,

640
00:39:46.921 --> 00:39:50.880
in the pandemic, um, which is, is a tricky proposition. You know, they,

641
00:39:50.881 --> 00:39:53.580
they have, uh, given up the dream of,

642
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.180
of we grow and we live and,

643
00:39:56.181 --> 00:39:58.890
and all these other things and are trying to focus on being a real estate

644
00:39:58.891 --> 00:40:03.510
company. Um, and getting back to the core of kind of what the company does.

645
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.250
Um, the trouble of course,

646
00:40:05.251 --> 00:40:09.270
is that the brand is a bit tarnished and they're going to have to fix that.

647
00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:13.220
And then, and then the other trouble is that right now, um, there,

648
00:40:13.221 --> 00:40:17.010
there are few things worse than, than being an office space operator. And,

649
00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.980
and they're trying to figure out along with the rest of the commercial real

650
00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:23.820
estate world, um, how to get people to come back to offices and,

651
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.170
and what that will look like.

652
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:30.090
<v 2>So what's next for Adam Newman? Have you followed that?</v>

653
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:35.940
<v 1>Um, a few weeks ago, he, he invested in a, in a new company. Um, it's a,</v>

654
00:40:35.941 --> 00:40:40.590
it's sort of a residential, uh, focused, uh, startup. Um, he's,

655
00:40:40.591 --> 00:40:44.130
he's made several investments, um, over the course of this year. Uh,

656
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:48.930
I don't suspect that he's going to go quietly into early retirement in his,

657
00:40:48.931 --> 00:40:53.160
in his early forties. He's, he's the kind of person who, um, you know,

658
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.020
worked very hard for, for everything else that's been said about him. And,

659
00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:59.940
and I think wants to make an impact,

660
00:40:59.941 --> 00:41:04.770
and it will just sort of remain to be seen what he decides to do. Um,

661
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.521
but I think he's,

662
00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:08.910
he's the kind of person who people are going to be willing to take a chance on

663
00:41:08.911 --> 00:41:12.930
whether it's investors, whether it's politics is something he talked about, but,

664
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:18.420
um, I feel fairly confident that we will, we will hear from Adam Newman again.

665
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.700
<v 2>And finally,</v>

666
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.830
what is your biggest takeaway from the WIWORK story?

667
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.330
<v 1>I think as we looked at this story,</v>

668
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:35.780
I saw it as a story about the last decade in a number of ways

669
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:39.740
and the decade of the 2010s in, in kind of the startup world and,

670
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:44.240
and the fact that so much of the growth that existed in, in a decade of growth,

671
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:48.200
um, was these kinds of companies that grew, grew very quickly.

672
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.470
And some of them have obviously become very successful in crucial parts of our

673
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:52.111
lives. And,

674
00:41:52.111 --> 00:41:55.700
and others have spent lots of money and been unable to figure out how to

675
00:41:55.701 --> 00:42:00.260
actually make things work while kind of warping these economies along the way.

676
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:03.650
So I think as, as we sort of enter a new era, I'm,

677
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.620
I'm eager to find out what lessons, if any,

678
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.370
the sort of venture capital startup world learns from this.

679
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:13.040
And I think one is just that, you know,

680
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:15.780
growth at all costs has it's has this dangerous and,

681
00:42:15.781 --> 00:42:17.910
and growing in so many different directions at,

682
00:42:17.911 --> 00:42:22.400
at such speed can push a company to do things it isn't good at can push a

683
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:26.930
company to do things that's not, it's not equipped or prepared to take on. And,

684
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:32.300
and it's, it's gonna be hard to tell future founders to, to be more humble,

685
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.400
um, in, in their ambitions. But, but I think having some amount of humility, um,

686
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.540
even while trying to build a giant fast-growing company is,

687
00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:45.620
is going to be a necessary ingredient to, to long-term success.

688
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.220
<v 0>Thank you very much. Um, it's a great note to end on,</v>

689
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.990
so thank you very much to read why Dimon and do pick up his new book,

690
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.580
billion dollar loser.

691
00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.810
It is a stimulating tale with lots of anecdotes,

692
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.820
and who knew that coworking office space could be such a wild read.

693
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.010
Thank you all for tuning in for listening for more podcasts,
