which includes the city of Minneapolis before becoming a Congress woman.

17
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.863
Two years ago,

18
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.400
she was an experienced twin city policy analyst and community organizer.

19
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.420
She's one of only two Muslim American women elected to Congress,

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.190

represent Minnesota representative. Omar. Thank you for joining us.

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.860
Welcome to the tight rope.

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.900
<v 1>It is an honor to be here with you today.</v>

24
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.940
<v 0>We're, we're thrilled to have you, I just want to start off.</v>

25
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:31.790
I know we don't have a lot of time with you today and I just want to just start

26
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.120
off with, you know, how you're doing, how your family's doing.

27
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:38.240
I know everyone's wondering, you know, you're running around on the trail,

28
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:42.320
but also how's your constituencies doing what what's on the ground,

29
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.250
where things are right now. Yeah.

30
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.250
<v 1>We're all holding on. Um, you know,</v>

31
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:53.900
I represent a district that includes all of Minneapolis and

32
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:58.580
14 other surrounding municipalities. And as many of you know,

33
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:03.080
Minneapolis has been ground zero for, um,

34
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.120
the response our communities have had to police brutality after the murder of

35
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:12.410
George Floyd in the hands of the Minneapolis police. Um,

36
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.480
and so there's a lot of trauma that has been an earth. There was a lot of pain.

37
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.610
Uh, people were already struggling because of the public health pandemic and the

38
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:27.470
financial crisis that it brought. And, uh, and now,

39
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:31.700
you know, there's, there's just a lot of other pain, um,

40
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.230
that people are going through, but were resilient here in Minneapolis. Uh,

41
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:39.080
and we are, um,

42
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.550
a community that's Rives on solidarity. And so we have been, um,

43
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.540
holding onto one another and helping each other through not just depend

44
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.700
emic, but the financial crisis. And now, you know,

45
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.790
dealing with systematic racism and police brutality.

46
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.290
<v 0>Yeah. Well, you've got your hands full.</v>

47
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.520
<v 2>And deed. Well, we are just so blessed to have you with us.</v>

48
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:08.380
It's so wonderful to have somebody who's so courageous and so

49
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.330
consistent and so compassionate when it comes to the least

50
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.120
of these in the biblical sense of the ones catching halo,

51
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.370
press folk here and around the world.

52
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.690
How do you read this present moment though? I mean,

53
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:26.200
we've got this kind of Neo fascism escalating.

54
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:30.190
We need to push the gangster out of the white house.

55
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.540
And yet at the same time we've got the contestation among the

56
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.420
coalition itself. Well, how do you read this moment?

57
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, we have to remember right. That we didn't,</v>

58
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:46.470
we didn't arrive in this moment by accident, uh,

59
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.820
everything that we are living through and,

60
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.500
you know, thinking of as a, as a painful moment in our history,

61
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.120
um, was ushered in, by, you know,

62
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.930
decades of social and economic neglect,

63
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.050
uh, by systems that weren't designed for many of us to, um,

64
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.710
not survive and thrive. Um,

65
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.020
and you know, we have had, um,

66
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.190
decaying really of our systems of

67
00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:26.670
democracy, um, and,

68
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.400
and our morality, uh,

69
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.410
that has led its way into allowing someone

70
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.120
like the president that we currently have to come to

71
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:43.050
power. And, you know, I was, I was, uh,

72
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.360
reminiscing about, you know, my,

73
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.850
my arrival here in the United States.

74
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:54.210
And I was thinking about how my father would have

75
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.950
reacted. If someone told him that, you know,

76
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.570
some day we would have a president unhinged enough to,

77
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.660
um, to use his daughter's name and every rally and,

78
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.110
uh, and, and conversation to stare up hate,

79
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.690
but that also the American people would vote for someone who would not

80
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:23.220
only neglect to fully address a public health crisis, uh,

81
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:25.740
address, you know, an economic crisis.

82
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.860
That's bringing on devastation onto people,

83
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.050
but would take joy in an earth thing,

84
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.120
um,

85
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.890
trauma for people and sort of thriving in,

86
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:45.270
in dividing our nation and not, um,

87
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.830
uniting it. And, and I said, you know, my dad would have,

88
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.660
uh, told him to seek help.

89
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.860
I think, you know, to, to many of we are,

90
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.700
we continue to be stuck in this moment where, um,

91
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.840
w we're we're analyzing this situation from a

92
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.620
decency point of view, right? Like, how did we get here?

93
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.310
How would our country, our fellow country,

94
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:17.810
men and women would allow someone like this president to come

95
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.470
to power. Um,

96
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.780
but if you look at the, the complacency, um,

97
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.220
that has been part of our systems for so

98
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.910
long, for so many people, it's not that surprising.

99
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:37.670
There isn't that much to analyze. Um,

100
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.350
we haven't invested in strengthening our communities.

101
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:45.200
We haven't invested in the strengthening, our democracy.

102
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:50.150
We haven't invested in making a representative democracy actually

103
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:54.830
represent its people. And we haven't invested in having,

104
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.850
you know, the mechanisms to allow, um,

105
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.540
for government to be of,

106
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.200
of the people and for the people. And so now,

107
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.650
do we not only have, you know, uh,

108
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.030
fascism at our doorsteps, but we also have, uh,

109
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.470
a system that is for the first time, I would say,

110
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.750
in the open, um,

111
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.670
sort of wrapping the American people and, you know,

112
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:28.700
every single day somebody says, why can't you hold them accountable?

113
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.940
Why isn't this administration accountable? Um,

114
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.860
and we can't because we haven't really invested in strengthening

115
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.130
our accountability measures, um,

116
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.410
to stop someone from exploiting them.

117
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.410
<v 0>Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. You know what you say there, um,</v>

118
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.050
really puts into more into broader context of the crisis that

119
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:55.810
we're facing regarding not just the moment,

120
00:07:55.811 --> 00:08:00.270
but this legacy of neglect and this legacy of, of certain kinds of,

121
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.520
of racialized corruption in particular. So it may,

122
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.110
I'm wondering if you could focus this, uh, uh,

123
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.460
issue in on, um,

124
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.200
George Floyd and all of the institutional mechanisms and systemic forces that

125
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:16.840
you described, uh, that you referenced, you know,

126
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.260
that brought him into the situation he was in because, you know,

127
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:24.040
some conservatives and others might say, you know, listen,

128
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:28.780
it's a democratic leader. And in the town where I, uh, the district was,

129
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.490
um, uh, a democratic district, you know, how is it that, um,

130
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.470
this could happen to George Floyd in, in what would be considered, uh,

131
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.380
you know, a relatively liberal context, but can you,

132
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.690
can you unpack what you were just saying in relation to that,

133
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:47.470
because I think people need to hear why this isn't just a matter of,

134
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.450
of individual institutions being able to respond to those kinds of

135
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:53.284
crisis.

136
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.440
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, we, we are seeking to have, um,</v>

137
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.270
equal access to systems that were created without us in

138
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:05.850
mind. Um,

139
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.830
and so it doesn't really matter the amount of

140
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.710
reforms we carry on.

141
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.360
If the whole system is sort of designed

142
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.270
to not grant you,

143
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.370
access to opportunity and prosperity access to

144
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:29.940
your civil liberties, access to your full humanity,

145
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.880
access to dignity. You know, people think of Minnesota as a,

146
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:39.870
as a liberal Haven. Um, and it is for, for a lot of people.

147
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.090
Uh, but it's also one of the worst States for black people to live in.

148
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.100
Um,

149
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.050
every single study has shown that Minnesota,

150
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.930
Wisconsin, and Illinois, um,

151
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.310
are the worst three seats for black people to live. Uh,

152
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:03.600
and that's, that's not because the, you know,

153
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.580
the people in power haven't done the work of trying to reform

154
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:13.440
these systems is that the systems themselves didn't imagine people

155
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:15.990
like us living here, um,

156
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.030
and didn't create systems to fully

157
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:25.800
allow us to exist as ourselves fully equal to everyone

158
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:27.330
else. Um,

159
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.890
and so you will see the disparities because, you know,

160
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.130
they, the systems aren't designed to educate our children,

161
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.140
the systems aren't designed to create economic investment in our communities,

162
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.990
the systems aren't designed, um,

163
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.070
to adequately absorb us in, into,

164
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.270
into society. And, you know, the,

165
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:54.660
the kind of transformation that is needed, um, is,

166
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.240
is asking people to do something that they haven't done before.

167
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.170
And there is, um, fear, uh,

168
00:11:05.171 --> 00:11:06.870
amongst many,

169
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:11.820
because their way of life feels threatened when you are asking for

170
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.930
them to, you know, expand their,

171
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:20.730
their thought process and to reimagine a system where everybody's

172
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.280
way of life is protected and uplifted.

173
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.460
<v 2>Mm Hmm. Yeah. You know, it just strikes me that one of the, uh,</v>

174
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.900
historically unique callings that you have,

175
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:36.740
and haven't been able to execute in such a powerful way,

176
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.320
is to try to convince folk on the ground that that

177
00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:46.790
system was not designed for them. So I'm with like Martin Luther King,

178
00:11:46.791 --> 00:11:48.830
you call for revolution,

179
00:11:48.831 --> 00:11:53.410
fundamental change in priority shift of power and wealth from

180
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.110
those at the top to everyday people.

181
00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:01.030
But you also are able to do that inside of the very system itself.

182
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.560
So you've got this inside,

183
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.600
outside dialectical dance that is so difficult

184
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.810
to do. How do you pull that off monsters?

185
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.310
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, you know, I'm, I'm an organizer.</v>

186
00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:22.050
And so, um, having, having that mindset,

187
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.360
um, and bringing that in into the halls of power has allowed me to

188
00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:31.080
not forget right, who, who I work for,

189
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.090
where I came from,

190
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:37.770
what it felt like to be out

191
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.700
protesting and organizing people, um,

192
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.640
to see themselves as not only part of the system,

193
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.020
but to see themselves as agents of change. Uh,

194
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.630
and now that, that I am there, that's,

195
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.850
that's the only way I can see myself. And, you know, if,

196
00:12:55.851 --> 00:13:00.810
if we think about what Martin Luther King was fighting for and how he

197
00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:02.580
transformed, you know,

198
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.080
even his messaging after the civil rights battle was won

199
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.670
was to, to speak about, there is no good at right,

200
00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:15.360
like having equality when he said, you know, what, what,

201
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.810
what is it to have a seat at the table if you can't like,

202
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.980
what is it to have a seat at the counter, if you can buy the burger, um,

203
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.000
is to, to understand that, you know, I don't,

204
00:13:27.001 --> 00:13:30.540
I don't just want you to see me as equal.

205
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.980
I also want you to see me as deserving of equal

206
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:39.960
opportunity and prosperity and, you know, um,

207
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.800
everything that, that is part of the promise of America.

208
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.130
Um, and so, so for many of us,

209
00:13:50.131 --> 00:13:54.690
we recognize that our cries in the streets can

210
00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:59.340
be legislated, right. And we can,

211
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.890
in the ways in which they have codified profit

212
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:06.600
for, um,

213
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.470
corporations and prioritizing capitalist

214
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.180
society,

215
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.580
we can codify our opportunities for

216
00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:20.880
prosperity into, into law as well.

217
00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:24.120
We can quantify our, um,

218
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:29.160
right to wealth and joy and dignity and humanity. Uh,

219
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.870
and I know that, um, that's a great task, but we are,

220
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:36.600
we are, we are up to it. Yeah.

221
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.260
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. You are up to it. That is for sure. Um, but what,</v>

222
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:46.080
what are some of the obstacles that may also be inside the

223
00:14:46.081 --> 00:14:48.630
democratic party? Right. Um,

224
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.360
it's easy in these highly polarized voting president presidential

225
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:57.980
election contexts to think of it simply between two parties, but,

226
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.980
you know, if I knew it as the white house, uh,

227
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.830
and Democrats win the house in the Senate, you know,

228
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:07.760
do you think that there'll be enough groundswell within the context of the

229
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:12.020
democratic party to embrace the kinds of progressive

230
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.270
visions for, um, the kinds of opportunity that you just described?

231
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.670
<v 1>Uh, yes and no. Um,</v>

232
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.470
I know that, you know, there, there is going to be, um,

233
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.120
a cohort with,

234
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.460
within the democratic caucus, um, in, in Congress,

235
00:15:36.461 --> 00:15:38.710
whether it's in the Senate or in the house,

236
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:44.080
that really is clear-eyed about what our objectives are in addressing,

237
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.300
you know, the, the,

238
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.050
the decades of social and economic neglect that many of our communities

239
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.860
have experienced that have brought us to this moment.

240
00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:58.360
And I've been laid bare by, by the public health crisis.

241
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:04.090
Um, but I also know that, you know, what we are seeking to do,

242
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.280
um, hasn't been done before and we will be faced with

243
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:14.530
many obstacles and a lot of people will try

244
00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:19.030
to go back to their traditional conversations

245
00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:23.080
about incremental change. And, you know, we,

246
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.760
we can't move fast enough.

247
00:16:24.761 --> 00:16:29.230
We can dream big enough and we can't implement, you know,

248
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.730
transformative change,

249
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.070
but what we are mobilizing for right now,

250
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.090
isn't just to, to,

251
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.130
to sustain the house and when the Senate and the white house,

252
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.810
but it's to keep up the momentum, um,

253
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.690
on the ground, uh, because we are,

254
00:16:49.691 --> 00:16:54.160
we're going to need an organized electorate in order

255
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:56.980
to have sustainable change.

256
00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.890
<v 2>Mm Hmm. I mean,</v>

257
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.140
I think part of the challenge is how do you get a democratic

258
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.940
party where its major corporate wing is so tied to wall

259
00:17:09.941 --> 00:17:14.320
street and Pentagon militarism the focus on

260
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:20.020
the predatory capitalism on the one hand and that militarism abroad the

261
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.250
groans and Somalia and Yemen and so forth. And,

262
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.930
and at the same time deal with the white supremacy and male supremacy at home,

263
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.060
the homophobia and transphobia at home.

264
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.490
Now you have been able to speak with carriage to each one of those

265
00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:41.110
issues. That that's a rare thing for elected officials. I know I don't,

266
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.410
I don't want to just keep coming back to that point, but my dear sister,

267
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.380
that's her red thing, and it needs to be said and acknowledged that highlighted.

268
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.490
And yet you got to walk your own tight rope and we glad to have you on our tap

269
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:55.320
room, but, but you get,

270
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.480
you got to walk your own tight rope daily and you've been able to do it so well.

271
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.500
And we just wonder, it's hard to say how that's going to going to unveil.

272
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.680
We've got to get the gangster out of the white house first. That's, that's,

273
00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:08.310
that's the crucial thing right now,

274
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.080
but after I think it is going to be a battle and one, one does,

275
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:16.590
how does it go into a procedural? You know?

276
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.140
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, so I will say, you know,</v>

277
00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:25.910
I think one of the most threatening things about me to,

278
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.140
to not just the right, um, but to the establishment at large,

279
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.483
is,

280
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.900
is that the unique lens that I bring as someone

281
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.820
who has lived outside of the United States, who had, uh,

282
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.710
a window to the school of America,

283
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.390
um, and who now lives in America and is an American, um,

284
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.220
who gets to see the soul of America from a different

285
00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:57.890
point of view, um, is that I,

286
00:18:57.891 --> 00:19:02.870
I know how we see ourselves and I know that how other people see

287
00:19:02.871 --> 00:19:07.040
us, and there is a clear gap,

288
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.170
uh, and most of us have values and principles

289
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.330
that don't allow us to want that gap to exist.

290
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:22.520
And I think the awakening of, of that consciousness, um,

291
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.660
is really what has made me a threat

292
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.920
to, to, to the powers that be, um,

293
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.900
because it is an important awakenness that needs to happen.

294
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.040
People have to be awakened from the

295
00:19:40.041 --> 00:19:44.750
complacency of believing,

296
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.980
right? That,

297
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.720
that everything that we are doing outside of this country,

298
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:55.640
that we seem to think is done out of a humanitarian,

299
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.070
um, point of view,

300
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.690
isn't being viewed that way to the people we are trying to be,

301
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.600
um, you know, responsive to and, and supportive to. And if,

302
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.610
if we want that value to be carried out on those principles to be carried out,

303
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.290
then we have to change the way that we carry out our missions

304
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.380
of, um, of, of,

305
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.820
of foreign engagement and, you know, domestically,

306
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.430
I think a lot of people also, you know, I know you talk about this, Mr. West.

307
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.070
Um, often I know Bernie, um,

308
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.750
talks about this often is that we don't make a clear

309
00:20:38.751 --> 00:20:39.590
connection,

310
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.020
but the economic devastations that we are living here in here in the United

311
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.400
States, and those, the least of us, um,

312
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.750
are bearing the burden of that economic devastation.

313
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:58.090
And every time they ask for, you know,

314
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.350
a cancellation of student debt, or they asked for, um,

315
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.910
an increase in the minimum wage, or they ask for, you know,

316
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.200
a housing program that, that ends our homelessness,

317
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:15.820
or they ask for more support for our veterans who are living on the side of the

318
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:20.800
streets, people say, or even, you know, addressing our climate crisis.

319
00:21:20.801 --> 00:21:24.820
People say, how can we afford it, right. Um, how are we going to pay for it?

320
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.910
And there,

321
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.710
that conversation never takes place when it comes to our supporting our endless

322
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:34.810
Wars, it never comes to, you know,

323
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:39.580
the billions of dollars we shell out every single year, um,

324
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:39.971
to,

325
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:44.830
to the Pentagon those conversations aren't asked when we are talking

326
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:49.270
about what defending our country looks like,

327
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.600
but our defense is also domestic.

328
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.280
And if we are to invest, uh,

329
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.450
in creating a stronger society, um,

330
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.480
that, that would ultimately make us safer,

331
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.990
uh, and would lead to, you know,

332
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:14.800
a more prosperous United States. You know, it is,

333
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:19.750
it's almost ironic and laughable that there are so many people who are

334
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:23.860
coming out on an America first, um,

335
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:30.160
banner and rhetoric who are not interested

336
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:34.750
in investing in raising the minimum wage are not invested

337
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.560
in addressing our climate crisis are not invested in ending.

338
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:43.180
Homelessness are not invested in, you know, stopping wall street,

339
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.250
um, from robbing, you know, the American people blind or not invested in,

340
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.350
you know, stopping these endless Wars and, you know, the, the Bloomington,

341
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.800
the bloating of the Pentagon budget. Um,

342
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.780
and you know,

343
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:03.700
the way that we get to do what you asked earlier, um,

344
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.430
is, is by continuing to emphasize that, you know, and,

345
00:23:08.431 --> 00:23:11.920
and sending out that message to the American people,

346
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:17.110
that our work has always been about putting people

347
00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:19.930
first, and, you know,

348
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:24.640
the people who are telling you that we are some how

349
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.690
radical for wanting to feed our children and how's our,

350
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.260
um, folks and, you know,

351
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.980
create a livable planet, um,

352
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.550
are the ones that are not putting America first and are not,

353
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.650
are not the ones that are putting your lives first. Um, well,

354
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.650
wow, well put.

355
00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.440
<v 0>Very much so, um,</v>

356
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.400
I know you have a hard stop and so we don't want to hold you up,

357
00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:57.610

And we really hope you join us again on the tie rope. And, uh,

361
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.730
we're also sharing this space with intelligence squared.

362
00:24:12.731 --> 00:24:16.330
So we welcome you back to, uh, either venue in the future.

363
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.390
And we thank you again for joining us here on the tightrope today.

364
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.580

365
00:24:24.581 --> 00:24:25.540
powerful voice.

366
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.550
The Negro Nasser Anthem is lift every voice as a prosthetic Muslim

367
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.990
voice and the legacy of Malcolm X and Hammad Ali, and so many others,

368
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:40.050
we salute you and we are with you. Thank you.

369
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.070
<v 0>Boy, Cornell. That was an amazing conversation with representative Omar.</v>

370
00:24:45.071 --> 00:24:48.460
She is just a force for good and such an inspiration.

371
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.980
<v 2>She's got a powerful intellect.</v>

372
00:24:50.981 --> 00:24:55.450
She's got a strong spirit and a compassionate heart. She really does.

373
00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:00.160
<v 0>Well. My dear colleague Cornell, this is the end of our office hours,</v>

374
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.690
which is always a sad thing, but we'll have more. So that's, that's an upside.

375
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:09.430
And we're also delighted to have been able to be part of a

376
00:25:09.431 --> 00:25:11.830
takeover with intelligence squared.

377
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.820
And so we wish them well and hope we can partner again in the future,

378
00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:20.800
but we want to also ask our fans from the tie rope to go visit intelligence

379
00:25:20.801 --> 00:25:24.700
squared and sign up. They have some fantastic debates, uh,

380
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.830
globally subjects of great interest.

381
00:25:26.831 --> 00:25:30.070
And we want to tell you intelligent squared fans to come join us on the

382
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.850
tightrope. We got a safety net for you. I promise. And we have, uh,

383
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.540
equally rich dialogues on our, on our show.
