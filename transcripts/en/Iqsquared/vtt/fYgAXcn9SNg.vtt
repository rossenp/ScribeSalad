1
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.270
<v 0>Sign up, pick up the spirits.</v>

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.130
And let's hear from SIDA Farsi, who is, as you know,

3
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:15.540
a member of the house of Lords para ness, no less from, uh,

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.390
one of your favorite people. David Cameron,

5
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:23.340
what's he doing now as he was the first Muslim cabinet minister,

6
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.840
first Muslim chair of the conservative party first, um, in many,

7
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.420
many ways to do many things.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.170
He's a prominent campaign of Islamophobia and against racism.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.330
So she is going to lift our spirits and tell us the truth

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.673
at last.

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.590
<v 1>Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, water, ridiculous motion.</v>

12
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:49.760
There's nothing. There's not much great about Britain.

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.980
It is a nonsense,

14
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.200
and that is why I urge you to listen carefully to my submissions and vote

15
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.630
against this motion tonight.

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.700
This is what's great about Britain, this amazing city, this

17
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.891
multicultural audience,

18
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:11.330
you an audience that has turned out on a bitterly cold

19
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.630
night and has paid yes, paid I'm shocked,

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.640
paid to listen to those two miserable moves over there

21
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.440
telling you what a hole we live in. Right?

22
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.430
I asked you to oppose this motion and that's where I start.

23
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:31.610
What's great about Britain is our quirky pastimes.

24
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:35.390
Our ability to listen politely when we disagree,

25
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.640
our dry self-deprecating sense of humor. We are a serious nation,

26
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:45.230
but we don't take ourselves very seriously. We wear as a badge of honor,

27
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.180
our ability to do ourselves down because deep down we know we have

28
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:53.900
nothing to prove when we don't just tolerate,

29
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.660
but celebrate great thinkers.

30
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.950
Those have perfected moaning to a form of art.

31
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.720
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been on display tonight. I asked you to reject it.

32
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.380
The fact you came here, we discuss what we do.

33
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.260
We leave and call home where we choose.

34
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:17.000
We pray to whom we wish, and we love who we desire.

35
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.660
You may say these are basics, but basics,

36
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.490
which as a whole are simply not true of most nations.

37
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.001
And yes,

38
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:30.920
there's the issue of values and democracy and the rule of law and free

39
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:34.880
speech and freedom of association and privacy. And I could go on and on.

40
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.090
And crate was brilliant at outlining some of that.

41
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.800
And as someone who has lived in cultures where overdramatic

42
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:47.330
reactions, high emotions are part of everyday discourse,

43
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.400
I'm clad that reality TV in the UK is just a pastime are not

44
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:53.750
aware of life. I say,

45
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:58.010
what makes us great is that we're a country of steady eddies,

46
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.550
not a nation of drama Queens.

47
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.450
It's what underpins our world-renowned diplomatic service,

48
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.840
how even in the ex colonized nations,

49
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.670
we still command a hearing. And it's where in international fora,

50
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.300
our advice is still sought and still heard.

51
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.660
And I had the privilege of serving our country,

52
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:24.490
serving as a foreign office minister and have lost counts of the number of

53
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.324
times.

54
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.370
We were asked for our unique British perspective in our unique

55
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.330
British way,

56
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.400
branded in Ellie report last year as a truly global power. Second,

57
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.230
only to the us,

58
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.270
it said that we have a unique capacity to project and extend

59
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:48.130
ourselves around the world with a particularly strong performance in relation

60
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.990
to diplomatic leverage. And yes, we may be leaving the UK in my view,

61
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:53.830
a bad decision,

62
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.020
but it's one top table of many that we sit on as head of the Commonwealth,

63
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.860
a member of the permanent five at the UN security council,

64
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:07.270
a member of the G seven, the sixth largest economy in the world,

65
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:11.680
despite being less than 1% of the world's population. We,

66
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.450
and this was for you, Peter.

67
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.350
Cause I know you love this phrase were punching above our weight on the

68
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.560
international stage as we do in shorts,

69
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.340
as we do in sports, we ranked third in the world for rugby.

70
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.990
You heard from Kate second in the Olympic metal league first in cricket.

71
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:33.910
And yes, we may fall down all nations in terms of our national football teams,

72
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:37.840
but we still have the best football league anywhere in the world.

73
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:41.410
There's only Morgan said when we won the cricket world cup last summer,

74
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:46.180
ladies and gentlemen, Allah is definitely with us and in the arts,

75
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.380
Shakespeare is the unrivaled King of theater and we have an

76
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.120
alphabet of great letters. Gentlemen, can you name them? A is for Austin.

77
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.810
B is for my favorite blights and C is for Chaucer.

78
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.450
D is for Dickins E is for Elliot.

79
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:06.280
We could go right down to Z and we would still have people to name from

80
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.100
Lawrence of Arabia to Gandy.

81
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.960
We tell other people's stories better than they do from the railway children to

82
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:14.890
train spotting.

83
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.050
We beautifully defined and redefined the coming of age moments through

84
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:24.550
film. And we may not rival Marvel and star Wars,

85
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.540
or we could close second with Harry Potter and Mr. Bond.

86
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.070
yMusic the beacons still rank as the top selling band of all times.

87
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:37.210
And we dominate the top 10 with led Zeppelin pink Floyd, Elton John,

88
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:42.160
and even today with Adele and ed Sheeran and ladies and gentlemen,

89
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.150
we have Yorkshire. We have God's own County,

90
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:50.560
that little nation within a nation with its stunning landscapes. The pen Hines,

91
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:53.260
the malls, the historic towns, the quirky villages,

92
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.130
Betty's cream cakes rub alongside Bradford,

93
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.940
the authentic Curry capital of the world and tea tea,

94
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.780
ladies and gentlemen,

95
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:07.430
it may have been discovered in the East Peretz Yorkshire that perfected a brew

96
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.320
and you share,

97
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.180
and Britain is where this daughter of an immigrant millworker

98
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.400
broke tradition and taboos to become Britain's first Muslim cabinet minister.

99
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.820
And that as a conservative and years later,

100
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.230
as I publicly and forcefully objected to government policy and

101
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:28.064
resigned,

102
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.170
I knew that I could have my say and walk away without the

103
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:35.780
fear of a bullet in the back of my head,

104
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.230
a certain outcome in many nations around the world.

105
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.870
We simply take these things for granted.

106
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.880
We take for granted that we have non rip-off black cabs that we can arrive in

107
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.500
Heathrow, get in a cab and we will arrive safely with a fair fair,

108
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.050
we have free schooling. We have free healthcare.

109
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.130
We have world leading universities and cutting edge research.

110
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.110
We have a largely non-corrupt police force operating within without fear

111
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.010
or favor.

112
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.870
And we have an armed force who embrace a human rights

113
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.830
framework,

114
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.450
even when operating in the harshest of environments on which for

115
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.860
over a hundred years.

116
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.510
And I'm proud that both my paternal and maternal grandfather were prepared to

117
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:23.930
serve for great Britain, a country that they had not even seen.

118
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.850
And this great armed force has been made up of people of all faiths

119
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.500
and all races. Yes, including seeks, can somebody send Laurence Fox,

120
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:35.870
the bloody memo and even our,

121
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.880
whether we have the blessings of seasons and yet most often

122
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.820
it may be mediocre weather, but you know what,

123
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:48.800
a time of climate change and extreme climates, I say, thank God for mediocre.

124
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.490
And finally language ladies and gentlemen, English,

125
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.870
the world's language of choice, the language of trade,

126
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.770
the language of dispute resolution, the language of diplomacy.

127
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.900
500 years ago, 5 million people spoke English today.

128
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.640
It's over 2 billion.

129
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.260
A quarter of the world's population speak the language of a

130
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.870
country of just over 50 million.

131
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.330
And if for no other reason than just this makes us not just

132
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:23.300
great, but pretty spectacular. In fact,

133
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:28.250
the only thing that's really rubbish about great Britain is the rubbish.

134
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.180
And so if we clean up our streets and country verge as a neighborhoods,

135
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.540
we will not only address one of my biggest irritants,

136
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.730
but we could be the cleanest as well as the greatest nation on earth.

137
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.290
So ladies and gentlemen, I asked you to reject the motion today.

138
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.210
And if in that typically British way after my,

139
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.950
and Kate's submissions,

140
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.730
you feel pangs of sympathy for the underdogs on the other

141
00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:00.150
side don't will.

142
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.520
And Peter I've done all right tonight.

143
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.020
They've had a fabulous moaning therapy session

144
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.440
and they've made you pay for it. Thank you.

145
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:24.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
