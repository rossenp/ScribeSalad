00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>Hello, and welcome to this intelligence squared election special with me,</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.890
Jonathan Freeland.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.450
We are recording on November the third election day

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:13.320
itself for what is set to be a historic election,

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:17.010
really for not just the United States, but I think the entire world,

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.400
it seems to me, the entire world is biting his nails and watching this election.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.600
And to help us talk through it and maybe even have a kind of mutual therapy

8
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.390
session to help some understand what's at stake.

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.080
I'm delighted to introduce our guests for this conversation.

10
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:35.550
She is the professor of American literature and public understanding of the

11
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.400
humanities at the university of London here in the UK.

12
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:41.190
And she is the author of behold America,

13
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
a history of America first and the American dream.

14
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.110
She is Sarah Churchwell. Sarah, how are you coping on this day? Week?

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.670
<v 1>Well, I've been tweeting a lot and I'm glued to all of the,</v>

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.340
um, the, you know, different facts and reactions that people are sharing. Um,

17
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.840
there's been a lot of joking about alcohol, uh, in the not too distant future,

18
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.540
um, which has only so much. Okay. So, um, yeah,

19
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:16.460
you know, I mean, I think all of us are, are, uh, reliving 2016, pretty vividly.

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.860
And, um, and I know how, how devastated I personally was by that outcome.

21
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:26.840
So, um, I actually think that, um, my nerves were worse yesterday.

22
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.820
I found yesterday really difficult and I mean, like personally difficult and,

23
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.420
um,

24
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.140
today it feels more like a last it's here and we're going to get this thing over

25
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.170
with, and of course that begs the question,

26
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:41.390
which we'll probably talk about about whether we're going to get this over with

27
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:43.550
today, but at least it's beginning.

28
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.700
<v 0>Psychologically. I know what you mean. You almost, if it's an ordeal,</v>

29
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:50.300
you'd rather, so let's see. Yeah, let's see. I mean,

30
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:52.550
I'm amazed and impressed that you're looking at Twitter.

31
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.070
I've developed all these strategies for today, which is I'm,

32
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.600
I'm really avoiding it. And I went for a little run this morning with, uh,

33
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.450
you know, the podcast in my ever deliberately.

34
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.920
It was about arsenal football club.

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.880
I thought I can't take anymore now of this sort of election stuff.

36
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.390
It's partly the sort of shouting is all over and now it is just.

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.230
<v 1>Yeah, I think that's right. But I, you know, I'd say for a couple of things,</v>

38
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:19.100
one is that I am, um, I'm at that state where I'm,

39
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.240
I'm so obsessed with it,

40
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:23.210
that it's a wrench to try to talk about anything else or think about anything

41
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:28.180
else. And I find not disturbing. Um, but also that, I mean,

42
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.200
it's just kind of overwhelming right now. Um,

43
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.910
so I kind of need to be overwhelmed by it. Um, but also that the way that I,

44
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.670
um, I have, I have been, um,

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.360
I've deliberately kind of set up Twitter as a source of information for me and

46
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.490
as kind of curated information from, um, experts that I trust. Um,

47
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.530
and so there are people who are, uh,

48
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.930
filtering things for me and bringing in different perspectives,

49
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.350
legal perspectives, um, political perspectives from, you know,

50
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.573
serious pollsters.

51
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.280
So I feel like that's helping me manage it and it's certainly an illusion of

52
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.330
control. Um, but it's a very important, uh, psychological crutch, right?

53
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.570
<v 0>What if one of your curated experts tells you something that you you're just</v>

54
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.810
your nerves can't bear to hear at this point?

55
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.400
The example I would have is a whole lot of people that were, we were w we've we,

56
00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:20.350
we should come clean. I mean, you already have you that you you're,

57
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.480
you want to see Trump lose,

58
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:24.810
and I don't think I've met him a secret and the stuff I've written for the

59
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:27.210
guardian that I'm in the same place. So we can be honest about that,

60
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.380
but I had a sort of weekend freak out with this poll out of Iowa.

61
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.490
Now I was not even a state that people were hoping or dreaming that Democrats

62
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:36.090
could win,

63
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.330
but when this polls suddenly suggest to be a big shift to Donald Trump,

64
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:42.090
he was seven points ahead in a spy, you know,

65
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.840
in a survey done by a polling company who had previously had him more or less

66
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:49.860
level, or even behind, you know, it just sort of nerves were shredded.

67
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:54.690
So even though it was reputable people who were passing on this data, to me,

68
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:57.150
it was all my finally curated Twitter feed.

69
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.760
It still was enough to have me in shreds over the weekend,

70
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.650
which is why as a person, as a matter of personal health.

71
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.110
<v 1>Yeah, no, absolutely.</v>

72
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.080
But it's funny because it's exactly what clearly in exactly the same boat there.

73
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:08.420
But, um, but in my case, the,

74
00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:11.400
the instant thing that I had to do was to go find out,

75
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.000
and this is cognitive bias, but I had to go find out why the salts were Paul,

76
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.270
which as you say, is a gold standard poll in Iowa. Um, but it was like,

77
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:21.510
this can't be right. Like this just can't be right. And so,

78
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:25.170
but also it was all kidding about cognitive bias aside.

79
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:30.150
It was actually trying to understand how that poll could account for

80
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.750
what was the twenty-three point shift among independents in a month from

81
00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:37.510
September to the end of October, which so there's a part of that,

82
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.180
which we all just as, as you know, um, observers on our own, you know,

83
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:46.110
judgment have to go. We either by 23 points shift among independents,

84
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.930
or we don't, and we recognize that polls are predictive mechanisms,

85
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.940
but not absolute and all of those things.

86
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:54.990
So it was kind of like finding all of the mechanisms that would enable me to

87
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.930
cope with that particular poll. Absolutely.

88
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.090
<v 0>I mean, we do, it's interesting because your, you know,</v>

89
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.720
your field is American literature and of course it does range wider into

90
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:07.560
American society, but you know, you're not a psychologist nor am I,

91
00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:12.150
and yet suddenly you can go right into the weeds there about kind of polling

92
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:16.050
methodologies. It's something about this contest that is sort of false.

93
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.050
It's made psephologists of all of us as an outlet,

94
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:20.850
really in a way for neurotic energy. Yeah.

95
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.770
<v 1>Exactly. Right. That's what I mean,</v>

96
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.220
it is a psychological crutch that we're kind of pretend, you know, claiming, or,

97
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:29.940
or, or not even claiming expertise we don't have, but, uh, um,

98
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.560
but trying to master the, all of this information, disinformation,

99
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:36.630
misinformation, distortion, and noise,

100
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.220
just trying to find some way of making sense of it in our own heads.

101
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.970
And yes, I come at this from, from a background in literature, are those,

102
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.570
you say have been,

103
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.570
I've been working actually on American cultural history for a long time,

104
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.500
but that's also means that I'm really sensitive to narrative and that this is

105
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:57.440
about trying to construct narratives, um, very consciously that, and you know,

106
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.100
all of my work is really about the importance of context for determining meaning

107
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.770
there is no meaning without context, which everybody knows on a,

108
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:04.790
on a kind of basic level,

109
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:08.240
but we often don't think about what that means in terms of the ways we talk

110
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:12.470
about politics or history or culture. And that's really my kind of research, um,

111
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.760
focus and interest.

112
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.850
And this is all just a way of creating contexts for ourselves.

113
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:19.880
We need to contextualize this information so we can make sense of it.

114
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.820
And yet one of those is that suddenly we all have to become highly numerous.

115
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.953
What is that?

116
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.321
<v 0>Absolutely. No,</v>

117
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:30.280
I think that's the point is that people who previously didn't have to drill into

118
00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:33.700
this level of detail have, and people like you are now, you know, you know,

119
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.710
fully expert in, in, in the situation,

120
00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:40.570
let's talk about election night as we both go into how your yourself, um,

121
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.990
going to plan it. I mean, what for you,

122
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:48.010
have you decided in your mind what the kind of key moment is that once you hear

123
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:48.340
that,

124
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.940
then you kind of know what's going on and we should say that it's an odd kind of

125
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:56.410
election day because close to a hundred million Americans have already voted as

126
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:57.131
we go into it.

127
00:06:57.131 --> 00:07:01.420
It's not as if we can say this is the moment it's already been the moment for

128
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.960
four weeks, but do you have, in terms of when the moment the, you know,

129
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:07.210
the broadcast, first of all, which broadcast you're going to watch,

130
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:10.450
what for you is the key hour? Are you going to sleep before or afterwards?

131
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:11.350
Just talk us through your life.

132
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.080
<v 1>Okay. Well, um, my, my plan began with taking drugs last night,</v>

133
00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:21.970
so I could sleep, um, legal over the counter drugs I hasten to add, but, uh, I,

134
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.390
because I wouldn't have slept otherwise and I knew I needed to, uh, um,

135
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.210
be able to go through today. So I don't plan to sleep tonight.

136
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:31.550
I'm just going to go straight through it. And, um, and it.

137
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.960
<v 0>What about the disco nap before between 7:00 PM and midnight?</v>

138
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:35.794
That's what I'm saying.

139
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.490
<v 1>I don't think I'll be able to, I think I'll just be too hyper at that point.</v>

140
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.210
Yeah. I mean, I might give it a whirl, you know, um, the, uh,

141
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.350
when we we'll have to see how it goes and how the energy's feeling, but, um,

142
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.820
I will, I always, um, since I'm in, based in the UK, like you,

143
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.720
I actually switched back and forth between different, um, uh,

144
00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:00.010
coverage because I find all of it a little bit inadequate, um, from a distance.

145
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:02.860
But, um, the last election I was watching CNN primarily,

146
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:05.440
and I think that's probably where I'll land, but I'll be moving around.

147
00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:09.400
It might be MSNBC, um, as well, but, but at least in 2016,

148
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.900
CNN seemed to be the fastest. Uh,

149
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.710
it seemed to be the most up-to-date over here in terms of cable coverage and

150
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:16.860
stuff that I could keep up with, but I don't actually,

151
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.440
so I'm just going to kind of bop around and see who I land on. Um,

152
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.310
but I'm also going to have that Twitter feed on in front of me. I'm be,

153
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.200
you know, watching what other people are, are, uh, saying about it. And,

154
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.160
um, and in terms of the States to watch, um, I personally,

155
00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:37.270
we were just talking about this, uh, you know, you know, um,

156
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.040
super numeracy that we've all achieved,

157
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.420
but I actually find it really helpful to use the visual trackers on the maps

158
00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:46.930
where you actually play around with the battleground States and workout pathways

159
00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:51.160
to victory that way, because it really helps me visualize, um, how many,

160
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.700
you know, you read that, that Biden has more pathways to victory than Trump has,

161
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:59.160
but when actually start, you know, saying, well, what happens if, um, uh,

162
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.650
Biden takes Pennsylvania and Florida?

163
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.550
And then you realize that Trump literally has to take every other battleground

164
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:07.800
state and even then, yeah, I think I, I think it not started,

165
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:10.470
he can't quite get over the line. Um,

166
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.430
and so I think that w I think we all know what the States are to watch.

167
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:18.480
He's got a Biden, has a, unless the polls are, you know,

168
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.140
wildly out much more out than they were in 2016.

169
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:23.820
And as many pollsters have pointed out,

170
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.500
they were within the margin of error in 2016, and they had not had robust,

171
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.180
um, uh, polls in the, the, the kinds of, we were just talking about in Iowa.

172
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.870
They had not had that kind of gold standard polling in the upper Midwest States

173
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.930
that carried, uh, um, Trump over the line,

174
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:42.570
the 77,000 votes he got in three upper Midwest States.

175
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:45.460
Those States have now been deeply, um, um,

176
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.430
carefully polled and Biden is leading by somewhere between eight and 15 points

177
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.950
in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, um,

178
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.930
and at a similar range in New Hampshire. So unless those polls are wildly off,

179
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.620
if we assume that Biden takes those, and he's also, um, uh,

180
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.400
very far ahead by early vote counts in Nevada. Um,

181
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.970
but unless that is completely blown out of the water,

182
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.780
then it does come down to the big States. It comes down to Pennsylvania,

183
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:17.010
it comes down to Florida, um, um, potentially North Carolina and Georgia,

184
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.010
both in play. Um, obviously the more,

185
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.860
the more of them that go to Biden, the better it is.

186
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:26.160
I think Pennsylvania is a must wind for Trump numerically.

187
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:31.140
You can see it mathematically. And, um, and it's clear that kind of, uh,

188
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.010
um, it, it, it majorly increases both candidates chances.

189
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.750
So Pennsylvania is the first one I'm going to be watching,

190
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:39.120
but of course they may not call it quickly if it's close,

191
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.210
it may take Pennsylvania several days. Um,

192
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.010
and the other thing that I'm very conscious of and worried bracing myself for is

193
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.510
the, um, is the,

194
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:53.400
the many warnings about the so-called red Mirage because of the expectation that

195
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:57.000
Trump voters are going to vote overwhelmingly in person today.

196
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.740
And that Biden voters were overwhelmingly voting Malin and absentee ballots.

197
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:03.350
And those are taking longer to count obviously,

198
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.160
and may have to be counted after the election,

199
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:07.320
which is why the Trump campaign is going after them.

200
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:10.110
And the local GOPs are going after those, those votes.

201
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:13.530
So staying I'm going to be watching what happens in Pennsylvania tonight doesn't

202
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:16.860
mean that I'll know what happens in Pennsylvania tonight, but if,

203
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.570
if all of the major outlets call it, um, for one, uh,

204
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.210
or the other, then that's going to be a pretty clear indicator.

205
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:26.970
And that should happen pretty early in the process.

206
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.600
<v 0>I mean, it's the red Mirage thing is a very,</v>

207
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:31.910
very good health warning for people that, uh,

208
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.060
that some States could look more Republican at the beginning.

209
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.720
And then that can sort of melt away. People are warning equally though,

210
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.100
down South Florida, Arizona,

211
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.980
Georgia could themselves have a blue Mirage where they look more Democrat

212
00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:50.930
because they're, they will have taught it up the early male in votes first.

213
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.670
And so the early numbers might look really encouraging for Biden,

214
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:58.300
and you could then see Trump's sort of catching up as it were as the night goes

215
00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.170
on. I mean,

216
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:02.050
it's interesting this thing about Pennsylvania and everyone is rightly sort of

217
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:05.020
focusing on that. If, as I understand it,

218
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.260
if Joe Biden gets one of what some people are going to the significant six,

219
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:12.760
and I think that's Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona,

220
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.490
um, and you can throw in Iowa and Ohio,

221
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.370
if you get one of those it's sort of game over,

222
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.450
and we may not even have to get to sort of obsessing about Pennsylvania in a

223
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:26.860
way. I think the psychological test is if Florida goes to, uh, Trump,

224
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.480
and if Arizona goes to Trump is somehow holding one's nerve for Pennsylvania,

225
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.560
but people say the trouble with that is that then, because it takes so long,

226
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.670
Donald Trump can try and get ahead of that by saying, well,

227
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:43.210
obviously I'm going to in Pennsylvania, I, you know, one won these other States,

228
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.010
it's all over. I declare myself the Victor. How do you think the M you know,

229
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.780
American politics in the sense of Republicans in Congress and congressional

230
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:56.500
figures governors should handle and we'll handle that situation.

231
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.210
<v 1>Well, how they should handle it as very different from how they will handle it.</v>

232
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.700
Um, I think very, very clearly they've made their, um, their position on this,

233
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.120
uh, all too clear. Um, so you're absolutely right.

234
00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.850
That's exactly what he'll try to do for me. The, the, um,

235
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.320
in many ways the worst case scenario is not even Trump having a clear win,

236
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:20.460
although that would be a terrible scenario from my point of view, but, um,

237
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.410
is a knife edge where the, the results look like, and there are, um,

238
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.590
uh, you know, again, just sticking with those battleground States. Um,

239
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.410
there are distributions of those States where, you know,

240
00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:36.330
you end up with trumpet two 69 electoral votes and, you know, Biden at,

241
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.230
you know, two 71 or something. And so it's basically a dead heat.

242
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.670
And I think in many ways that would be the worst possible outcome, um,

243
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.340
because all of those divisions will just get fomented.

244
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.250
And because what it will do is it will start to normalize the idea that a merit,

245
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:50.581
which is,

246
00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:54.570
which Trump has been trying to do to normalize the idea that American elections

247
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:55.770
are decided in the courts,

248
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.980
but American elections are not supposed to be decided in the courts.

249
00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:03.690
That is not what should be happening. And so to get to these battleground, uh,

250
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.920
positions of, you know, as I say, really being balanced on a knife edge, um,

251
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.970
we saw what happened in 2000 with that we saw how bad that was for the country.

252
00:14:11.971 --> 00:14:16.050
And in my view, that damage has continued to, um,

253
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.350
to divide the country. And the consequences of it are very real. I mean,

254
00:14:19.351 --> 00:14:22.380
there are not enough people I think are aware of,

255
00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:26.670
particularly in Europe that both Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett

256
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.980
were, um, uh,

257
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.720
judicially advising the GOP in that Florida recount.

258
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.380
Um, in 2000, they have had a political, um,

259
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.390
position that is pro GOP for those 20 years. And they helped, um, uh,

260
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.650
convince the Supreme court that it should, um, halt the recount in Florida.

261
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.630
And the consequences are real.

262
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.640
<v 0>I think I read somewhere that it wasn't just Supreme court judges, justices,</v>

263
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.370
Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, but John Robinson as well.

264
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.310
So it was all three of them, all three of them. Yeah.

265
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.660
So he's now in a different place,

266
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:03.650
and this is seeming to occupy sort of now kind of centrist swing,

267
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:05.090
vote position potentially, but you're right.

268
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.870
They all have that amazing sort of muddle on their boots from the Florida

269
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:13.370
battle. And yet we're asking you potentially now yeah. To be, to play referee,

270
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.960
just to take a step back for a second. I have been in my journalism and I,

271
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.420
and we both have, I think in this conversation,

272
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.440
I've been working on the assumption that this is an absolutely pivotal election

273
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:27.260
for the United States and maybe for the wider world.

274
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.590
And I just want to sort of substantiate that a bit. I mean,

275
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.370
anybody who's covered in American elections knows that the candidates always

276
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:37.370
say, this is the most important election of my lifetime and your lifetime.

277
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.020
My sense is that it is this time. It's not just rhetoric, but let's,

278
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.180
let's hear you make the case for why this is first of all,

279
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.180
let's do with America and then we'll get onto the wider world.

280
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.500
<v 1>Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Look, I think there's no question that it is.</v>

281
00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:53.590
And I would argue that there is a strong case to be made that it's the most

282
00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:57.850
consequential presidential election in American history since 1796.

283
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.400
And what happened in 1796 of course,

284
00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:05.200
is that George Washington decided not to run for third term and to step down in

285
00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:09.640
order to establish the peaceful transfer of power in order to establish the

286
00:16:09.641 --> 00:16:13.990
presidency was not a monarchy since 1796.

287
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:18.670
We have never had a president who didn't accept that principle until now,

288
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.350
um, you know, during Wars. Um, uh, so, you know,

289
00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:27.850
people would say this is as consequential as rink Lincoln's reelection in 1864.

290
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.910
Um, yes, but Lincoln's opponent in 1864,

291
00:16:30.911 --> 00:16:35.530
the Democrat McClellan accepted when he lost. And, um,

292
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.560
and so, you know, we can argue consequential elections,

293
00:16:38.561 --> 00:16:41.920
1968 was incredibly consequential. Um, 2000,

294
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:45.100
as we've just said was incredibly consequential, not just for the United States,

295
00:16:45.101 --> 00:16:49.930
but for the world does have to pause and imagine what world history would look

296
00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:52.930
like if Gore had become president instead of w right.

297
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.810
The consequences for climate change are enormous. Um,

298
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.710
the consequences for the middle East and for the refugee crisis.

299
00:16:59.711 --> 00:17:02.320
And many of the things that we're dealing with right now, um,

300
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.620
are enormous the ways in which the so-called war on terror. Well, first of all,

301
00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:08.160
they wouldn't have called it a war on terror. And, and, you know,

302
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:10.690
and from there on out the ways in which, uh,

303
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.150
nine 11 would have been responded to in different ways.

304
00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:15.790
So it's almost unfathomable how different everything would be in how

305
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:18.670
consequential that election, um, turned out to be.

306
00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:22.930
So I'm not saying there haven't been other majorly important elections in us

307
00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:26.530
history, but, but this one is unique in that regard.

308
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.460
And it is unique in that for the first time. Um,

309
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:35.290
we do not have a presumption among both the president and his

310
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:39.910
administration and among the American electorate, that the,

311
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.811
um, that the,

312
00:17:40.811 --> 00:17:45.700
that the outcome of the election will be peacefully accepted and

313
00:17:45.701 --> 00:17:48.940
that the, uh, loser will congratulate the winner.

314
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.590
And that goes for the losing side, uh, voters,

315
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:57.010
as well as the winning side of voters. And then we will accept the outcome and,

316
00:17:57.011 --> 00:17:58.950
and move on. I found I was,

317
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.190
I was doing some research actually about something else. Um, but looking into,

318
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.240
um, newspaper coverage in 1936, and I stumbled on, um,

319
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.030
this kind of fascinating article about, uh,

320
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.560
from the American press about Roosevelt's reelection in 1936.

321
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.080
And it actually said, um,

322
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.280
everybody's so worried about FTRs election and Democrats and Republicans.

323
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.170
And then this editorial, um, said, but at the end of the day, we will all,

324
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:28.410
and it was just exactly that language that we will all congratulate the winner

325
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.990
and we will move on. And, and then he said,

326
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:32.700
and the moment that that ceases to happen,

327
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:34.530
the United States will cease to be a democracy.

328
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.740
And I read that a couple of days ago, and I thought, well, there is, you know,

329
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:40.920
from 1936 saying, this is the key to democracy,

330
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:46.290
and this is the first time that we've had an administration that was absolutely

331
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:50.190
refusing to adhere to that principle.

332
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.090
Now will all of the GOP refuse to do that, that remains to be seen?

333
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.530
What will the Senate do? I don't know.

334
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:57.540
I don't know what McConnell would do in such a situation,

335
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:00.030
but I don't trust them as far as I can pro him. Um,

336
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.180
certainly the evidence of what he's done so far is that he's,

337
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.600
he has absolutely no, uh, um, sense of, of, um,

338
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.800
of principle to the, to the, you know, to the constitution. So.

339
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.210
<v 0>And just tell us again, who was it in 1936, who issued that warning?</v>

340
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.073
That if we don't.

341
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.050
<v 1>It was an editor, I actually tweeted it and I'll have to look it up. It was,</v>

342
00:19:18.051 --> 00:19:20.390
it was, it was a local editorial.

343
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.370
I want to say it was like in Wisconsin or something.

344
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.600
<v 0>But this goes to, is the notion of loses consent. And th th th that,</v>

345
00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:28.070
that is actually a crucial,

346
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.700
perhaps as you've just suggested the crucial aspect of the democracy,

347
00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:33.740
that consent of the loser. Uh,

348
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.650
and one thing it's interesting how this has been normalized.

349
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.270
The one thing everyone is not expecting tonight and, and, and,

350
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.800
and people are not holding their breath for is a concession speech from Donald

351
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.240
Trump. Even if it is a massive landslide on ambiguous

352
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.813
wind for Joe Biden,

353
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.990
nobody believes that Donald Trump will pick up that phone and call Joe Biden,

354
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.400
and then tell you supporters, I wish the new president elect luck.

355
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.730
That's not going to happen.

356
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.250
<v 1>It's not conceivable. So that's, you know, that's part of the reason we start,</v>

357
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.700
we started by saying that, you know, um, my nerves were worse yesterday. And,

358
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.140
um, part of what made my nerves yesterday was so bad was that I tried to imagine

359
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.610
Trump just not even conceding and certainly not graciously calling anybody,

360
00:20:19.611 --> 00:20:24.110
but just admitting that it was over and that he lost. Um, and you simply can't,

361
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.800
you can't conceive of it. It is inconceivable that Donald Trump, um,

362
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.420
who we have watched closely for four years, um, would do that. So, um,

363
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.020
I found myself, you know, kind of taking refuge in, I mean, I, you know,

364
00:20:36.021 --> 00:20:39.230
he has said at some of his rallies over the last few weeks,

365
00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:41.810
he has said things like, you know, can you imagine if I lose,

366
00:20:41.811 --> 00:20:43.760
I'll have to leave the country. Um,

367
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.040
so I find myself thinking that he's actually more likely to scuttle off, um,

368
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.500
you know, uh, but like the end for those who know, um,

369
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.790
Phillip Roth's plot against America when Lindbergh just kind of flies away. Um,

370
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.050
but I, I find that more conceivable that he would literally just get on a plane

371
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:02.140
overnight, if it's clear that he's lost. And if the Republicans call him up,

372
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.680
you know, behind the scenes and say, you know, game's up, it's over,

373
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:09.130
you've lost. Um, then him actually standing up and making the speech.

374
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.210
I think he just run away.

375
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.910
<v 0>I mean, this breaks mine to my vowels,</v>

376
00:21:11.911 --> 00:21:15.810
which is not to allow myself to imagine this scenario because it's sort of,

377
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.240
I don't want to jinx it and it's getting too far ahead now,

378
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.560
but it is a fascinating thing.

379
00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:22.410
There is a three month transition period in the U S system.

380
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.070
And it's very hard to imagine, you know, the,

381
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.810
the text I always think of here is the letter that George Herbert

382
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:34.770
Walker Bush left on the desk of the incoming president,

383
00:21:34.771 --> 00:21:39.450
his successor bill Clinton, which is it's a, it's a genuinely moving note.

384
00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:42.990
It's a very short note, but he says, essentially, you're my president now.

385
00:21:42.991 --> 00:21:46.860
And I'm going to be rooting for you to do well. Your success is our success.

386
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.720
The idea of Donald Trump writing that note. I can't even conceive of it,

387
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.970
but this morning, um, Don, uh, of all people, Nigel Farage, uh,

388
00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.390
put out a little film of himself, walking the streets of Washington, DC,

389
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:05.250
noticing how many shops and stores and banks were boarded up. Um,

390
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.070
and he said, this is because they're bracing themselves for violence.

391
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.250
If Donald Trump were to lose.

392
00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:16.170
And if he were to not give the con consistent speech concession speech

393
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.910
we've, which we both said, we don't expect,

394
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.770
what cue does that sound and what would be direction do you think among his

395
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:25.170
supporters? And I'll just slip in there that image,

396
00:22:25.171 --> 00:22:29.910
a lot of us saw this week of the Biden Harris bus going through Texas

397
00:22:29.911 --> 00:22:34.230
being essentially like a scene out of that early, um, uh,

398
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.480
Steven Spielberg, film, duel, you know, being kind of driven off the road. Um,

399
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.830
do, I mean,

400
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.530
Farage is suggesting there will be violence implicitly in that film of his,

401
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.573
what do you think?

402
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.690
<v 1>Well, um, for, I wanna say two things about frosh first, uh,</v>

403
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.190
before I answer that question, um,

404
00:22:50.191 --> 00:22:53.100
the first is that he said that he thought it would be violence on the left.

405
00:22:53.101 --> 00:22:57.150
He was saying it would be Antifa violence. So, you know,

406
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.160
which I think is really important there because he's there,

407
00:22:59.161 --> 00:23:03.030
he's trying to say that it will only come from the left. Um, uh, and,

408
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.140
and the pictures have gone around, um, this morning also of the white house,

409
00:23:07.141 --> 00:23:09.240
surrounded by barricades. And people have been saying, you know,

410
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:11.010
he couldn't build a wall on the Mexican border,

411
00:23:11.011 --> 00:23:15.180
but he managed to build a wall around the white house. Um, the, and again,

412
00:23:15.181 --> 00:23:18.090
for the first time in American history, right? I mean, this just doesn't happen.

413
00:23:18.091 --> 00:23:18.241
I mean,

414
00:23:18.241 --> 00:23:21.330
we didn't even build a wall against the British when you guys came and burned it

415
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.910
down in 1812 for heaven sake.

416
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.540
Exactly. Right, exactly.

417
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:33.960
But the other thing that I'll say about Faraj is that it, um,

418
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.000
it has been, um, unexpectedly.

419
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:40.110
One of the things that's given me hope in the last 24 hours, um,

420
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.290
because I don't think he would have announced his little reform party if he

421
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:44.910
thought he was going to get anywhere in the United,

422
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.400
if you thought Trump was going to win,

423
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:50.570
he'd be over there still sucking up relentlessly to try to get a job with Trump.

424
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:52.580
So I think that is his decision to,

425
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.650
to return to his political fortunes in the UK, um,

426
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.000
bodes well for the U S if not for the UK, um, the, the,

427
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.030
to the question of violence, it's a very, very,

428
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:05.680
very real possibility as you say, it's already happening. So is it, uh, it's,

429
00:24:05.681 --> 00:24:08.660
it's a reality there's, I don't think there's any point in, in, uh,

430
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:13.100
talking about it as hypothetical. We're seeing it happen. The question is how,

431
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:18.290
um, how entrenched that violence will get, will it just be sporadic, uh, um,

432
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.230
you know, and will it just be some malicious, you know, shooting off their guns?

433
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.060
Um, uh, you know,

434
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.510
but we've gotten to the point where we've got an administration that is

435
00:24:26.511 --> 00:24:29.600
justifying, um, I mean, militias are armed.

436
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.500
Militias are illegal in every one of the 50 States. Um,

437
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.460
and we have an administration that is, uh,

438
00:24:36.461 --> 00:24:40.730
and we've all seen it that is encouraging them and is as broad was doing

439
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:43.370
insisting that all the balances on the left and fomented on the left,

440
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.520
when we can all see that it's white supremacist violence on the right.

441
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.900
There were pictures over the weekend of protestors in front of bars,

442
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:52.850
house I'm attorney general BARR.

443
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:55.490
And they were protesting that they didn't think that the Trump administration

444
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:59.390
was doing enough to stop the left and bar went out there and like gave them

445
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:00.950
coffee and chatted with them,

446
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:05.720
although they were like armed militia in front of his house, you know? So, um,

447
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.230
all of that says to me that violence is a very real possibility. If anything,

448
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:14.030
you know, the, my concern would be that the left, um, my, you know,

449
00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:15.800
my rollover before it,

450
00:25:15.801 --> 00:25:19.040
now that might sound flippant as if I'm saying I want armed conflict in the

451
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:23.120
streets. And obviously nobody saying wants that, but is it a,

452
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.850
is it a viable possibility? Of course it is. And you know,

453
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:28.670
the other thing that I, you know, I say, I say this a lot,

454
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:31.220
but I think it is we're thinking about, um,

455
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.820
that any country that calls itself the United States is really protesting too

456
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:39.500
much. Um, and that they're, the divisions are the reality and that the,

457
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:43.610
these rhetorical moves are there to try to pull us back together again. Um,

458
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.190
but we have had several civil Wars. Um, the, uh,

459
00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:51.020
American revolution was a civil war. It was brother against brother.

460
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:54.080
It was family member who would loyalists against family members who were

461
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:58.910
revolutionaries 75 years later. We had, um, the civil war,

462
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:03.710
the Vietnam conflict led to bombs and riots crossed the country in

463
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:08.450
68 and in the early seventies violence, you know, and, and really serious, um,

464
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.070
violence in ways that I think people have forgotten. So the, the, the, um,

465
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.720
the reality of armed conflict, unfortunately, um,

466
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.970
in the United States is a historical fact.

467
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:23.510
And we've actually never gone very long without it. So again, I'm not,

468
00:26:23.511 --> 00:26:24.800
I hope it's clear to everybody listening.

469
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:28.160
I'm in no way I'm making light of that. And I'm in no way saying that,

470
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.050
that I think, you know, we should, uh, you know, um, just pass it over lightly,

471
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.960
but do I think it's, it's a real possibility in the coming weeks.

472
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240
<v 0>I mean, we,</v>

473
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.080
I want us to get to the rest of the world and we must do that in a moment,

474
00:26:41.081 --> 00:26:42.940
but just before we leave this, I mean,

475
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.860
do you spend a lot of time thinking about the 40,

476
00:26:46.861 --> 00:26:48.510
41 42%,

477
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:52.400
which polls say aren't going to vote for Donald Trump despite,

478
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.910
as you were there. And I would,

479
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.230
to everything that's happened over these last four years,

480
00:26:58.231 --> 00:26:59.970
even despite the handling of the pandemic,

481
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.590
despite some of the sort of gross remarks that sort of personally gross things

482
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:05.760
he does and says,

483
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.980
w w w what do you think explain explains that resilience of that vote.

484
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.970
And, and I suppose in a way, if he does lose the, you know,

485
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:18.660
the kind of grief they're gonna feel a sort of lost that group of people will

486
00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:23.580
feel if he, this may have sort of become so attached to lose it.

487
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.880
<v 1>Yeah. Um, I'm afraid. I mean, that's my,</v>

488
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:30.260
my sound make me sound callous and I'm feeling I'm not,

489
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.260
I'm not going to spend a lot of time worrying about their feelings.

490
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.453
<v 2>Wow.</v>

491
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.210
<v 1>The point and his cruelty to the people they see as their victims and their</v>

492
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:53.540
opponents is the point. So those people who relish that cruelty,

493
00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:56.510
I'm not actually going to spare them much compassion. Um,

494
00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.910
now that's a different thing from thinking about how we,

495
00:27:58.911 --> 00:28:02.330
as a democratic polity need to try to come back together. Um,

496
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.670
and I think we do need to try to find common ground.

497
00:28:04.671 --> 00:28:08.930
We absolutely have to rebuild first. We have to just outvote them. The thing is,

498
00:28:08.931 --> 00:28:12.290
is there a minority, right? So that 42%. So at the moment,

499
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:14.810
we're in a minority Prairie and rule position,

500
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:18.890
which is just untenable for anything that calls itself a democracy, but for,

501
00:28:18.891 --> 00:28:21.110
particularly for such a large one as the United States,

502
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.690
it's simply just disenfranchise, disenfranchises, too many people. And,

503
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.700
and in a, in, in a very, um, uh, dramatic way, right? So that the, that the,

504
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.770
um, the policies of the current GOP are wildly off track with

505
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.480
the voting preferences of, of the vast majority of the American electorate.

506
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.130
So things like gun control, abortion, um, reproduction rights, um, you know, uh,

507
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.750
um, the, the big, hot ticket issues healthcare, um, those are, uh,

508
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.620
they are, um, the Democrats positions on those issues is very,

509
00:28:51.621 --> 00:28:55.010
very much in track with the vast majority of the population and the Republicans

510
00:28:55.011 --> 00:28:56.960
are outliers. So, you know,

511
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.870
the democracy is not going to hold if you don't have a representative government

512
00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.730
that actually represents the views of the people.

513
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.400
So I think we have to get to that point first,

514
00:29:04.401 --> 00:29:08.390
where there is more of a matchup where we're not in the situation where it's

515
00:29:08.391 --> 00:29:09.980
just an eight, you know,

516
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:14.330
the setup of the United States is an 18th century Republic that this trying to

517
00:29:14.331 --> 00:29:15.680
act more like a democracy.

518
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.240
So we've got to figure out from within ways for it to become more democratic in

519
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:24.350
its representation, numbness, or whatever that word is that representativeness,

520
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.820
um, in its ability to represent a larger proportion of the American people.

521
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.721
And then what do we do?

522
00:29:29.721 --> 00:29:33.260
We work on education and we work on dismantling propaganda because the thing

523
00:29:33.261 --> 00:29:38.040
that has held for 42% together is propaganda. Um, you know, there was a, uh,

524
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.090
we were talking about the polls over the weekend. And, um,

525
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.380
and there was a really interesting, um, New York times, um,

526
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:48.100
five 38 piece about the ways in which, um, uh,

527
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:50.860
new voters are coming to the, that it's a new electorate,

528
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.000
basically because people who didn't vote in 2016 people who've never voted in

529
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:59.560
their lives, old voters who are literally coming out, um, for the first time.

530
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.680
And then they were also interviewing some Trump supporters, of course.

531
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:05.560
And there was one that just hit me where this woman said she was going to vote

532
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:09.620
for Trump again, because he never lies. And I just thought, you know, you,

533
00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:14.140
you're dealing there with somebody whose willful blindness and their cognitive

534
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:19.090
bias is so intense that they think that Donald Trump never lies when

535
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:22.210
he's told 22,000 lives while he's been in office.

536
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.590
And there was some polar other recently you'll know who it was that that found

537
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.750
that he's literally the biggest liar in the world.

538
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.200
The literally nobody has lied more than this man.

539
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.930
And here's a supporter insisting that he doesn't lie.

540
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:38.020
So until we get to the point where we don't have supporters saying that black is

541
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.800
widened up is down and day is night, I'm afraid we simply have to outvote them.

542
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.911
And then as I say,

543
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:47.440
we have to get back to trying to reclaim the common ground of factuality

544
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.173
that you know of.

545
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.110
<v 0>No, you go ahead. You've just completed that.</v>

546
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.670
<v 1>About factuality, right. Is the point that, um,</v>

547
00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.600
that historians of authoritarianism and hotels, I mean, it's the point that, uh,

548
00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:04.990
rent makes and, um, the origins of totalitarianism and she makes it again and,

549
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.230
and, um, her great essay on America, um,

550
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.680
on the politics of lying when she responded to the Pentagon papers, um,

551
00:31:10.681 --> 00:31:13.230
in the early seventies, and she basically says, you know,

552
00:31:13.231 --> 00:31:18.000
you don't have democracy without shared consensual ideas about facts,

553
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:21.870
and you need, um, trustworthy people telling you what the facts are,

554
00:31:21.871 --> 00:31:24.300
because that's how your political system comes together.

555
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.950
And that's clearly what is being deliberately damaged, um, in,

556
00:31:28.951 --> 00:31:33.060
in the United States. And, you know, um, I would argue, um, in the UK as well,

557
00:31:33.061 --> 00:31:35.100
but that might be another conversation for another day.

558
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.700
<v 0>That certainly is I, your point about people saying he's on,</v>

559
00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:42.000
it's really strikes a call when I was covering the campaign in 2016. And again,

560
00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:45.780
actually interviewing Trump's supporters earlier this year, they repeated the,

561
00:31:45.781 --> 00:31:49.710
go back to this point about him being honest. And you either,

562
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.010
it's some psychological thing of saying, you know, flipping the, very,

563
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.360
turning his weakness into a strength,

564
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.080
or I think it must be that on some level,

565
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.110
the sentences that he's not truthful factually,

566
00:32:01.111 --> 00:32:05.070
but he's honest in the sense of the underlying truth, the underlying truth,

567
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.370
being that all these other people are evil and we're good,

568
00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:09.990
and that our country has been stolen from us.

569
00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:12.600
I think that must be what they mean. The very last thing,

570
00:32:12.601 --> 00:32:16.590
because we're running out of time is the, is the wider world. I mean,

571
00:32:16.591 --> 00:32:21.360
obviously people all over the world have become obsessed about this election.

572
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:26.430
Is there something massive at stake for people who live in Lisbon

573
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.910
and Liverpool and Lima in this election,

574
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.760
as well as for people who live in Louisville or Lexington.

575
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.970
So just pull those out, please.

576
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.790
<v 1>I like a pattern. Um, but I, you know, look,</v>

577
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:46.160
I'm suitors will have to judge for themselves.

578
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.680
They're obviously I'm biased here as an American who lives abroad.

579
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:52.430
I'm going to think that this, um, has massive consequences for everyone,

580
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.610
but I think that it does. And again, we can just name a couple of the ways, um,

581
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.830
when we talked about, uh, um,

582
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.010
the consequences from the 2000 election climate change, I mean,

583
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.110
simply the issue of climate change, simply the issue of, um,

584
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.740
you know, the, the, well, none of them are simple issues, right? But I mean,

585
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.930
the, the biggest issues that we face, um, as someone living in Britain and, and,

586
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.200
um, with an eye on what's happening in Ireland, um,

587
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.420
I'm very conscious of the fact that, um,

588
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.840
Biden and Pelosi are very clear that they will do no trade deals that will

589
00:33:23.841 --> 00:33:28.220
jeopardize the good Friday agreement. So, you know, those are two really, uh,

590
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.050
um, prominent examples where the difference is going to be profound,

591
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.550
and then we can multiply those out. But in terms of just security and stability,

592
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:41.330
in terms of regrouping about what factuality looks like in terms of, um,

593
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.560
having a leadership that actually, you know, will criticize Putin.

594
00:33:45.561 --> 00:33:47.480
Imagine that idea again, um,

595
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.830
and we'll hold lines against him will reinforce the importance of,

596
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:55.070
of the strategic alliances, particularly with NATO, um,

597
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.760
that will not just suck up to strong men and bullies around the world. Um,

598
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.820
that will go back to empiricism, to evidence-based thinking.

599
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.550
And I haven't even mentioned the pandemic. Um,

600
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.130
the consequences for the pandemic are immense,

601
00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:10.460
unless you actually close American borders and stop them from traveling.

602
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:12.860
Even if the rest of the country gets this under control,

603
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:14.570
the United States is going to keep spreading it.

604
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.670
It's going to be the super spreader of the world.

605
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.100
So it turns out we need science.

606
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.510
And it turns out that with all due respect to people of faith, um,

607
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.530
religion ain't enough,

608
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:29.650
we need science and we need an administration that believes in science. So, um,

609
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:32.960
and believes in, in contracts that doesn't just break contracts.

610
00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.630
So you need to know as a,

611
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.520
as a country that is making deals with another major power in the world

612
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:45.500
that they, uh, are, you know, the leadership can be trusted to, um,

613
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.980
to stick to the deals and that's, and that's crucial for, uh,

614
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:53.120
that's crucial for the economy. That's crucial for, uh, um, you know, um,

615
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.450
international investment in global movement of money. You have that.

616
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.780
We need that for the security of currencies. You know, I mean,

617
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:04.550
all of that stuff is real and people are acting as if it just kind of, uh,

618
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.800
you know, regulates itself. And it doesn't,

619
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.430
and the de-stabilizing that we've seen in the last four years has been profound,

620
00:35:10.431 --> 00:35:15.110
but it will just, it will go off the charts if Trump gets back in.

621
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.720
<v 0>So huge amounts of stake, uh, at stake for the world,</v>

622
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.560
obviously for the United States itself, I was gonna say,

623
00:35:23.561 --> 00:35:26.440
I'll let you get some sleep. You're not going to be able to get any or too wide.

624
00:35:26.441 --> 00:35:31.360
And so, so mine, so is everyone else. Um, thank you so much,

625
00:35:31.361 --> 00:35:33.790
Sarah Churchwell for this, for this conversation.

626
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.330
I'm Jonathan Frieden and you've been listening to intelligence squared.
