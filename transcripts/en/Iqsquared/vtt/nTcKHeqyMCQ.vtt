00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>You're welcome to this intelligence squared podcast with me, Helen Joyce.</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.750
I'm delighted to introduce our guests today. Helen Rose.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.140
She's the editor of arrow magazine and co-author with James Lindsay.

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:12.360
I have a new book, cynical theories,

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.890
how activist scholarship made everything about race, gender, and identity,

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.230
and why this harms everybody it's out now.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.460
<v 1>Okay. Thank you for inviting me.</v>

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.550
<v 0>Oh, it's very exciting to have you on. I really enjoyed the book.</v>

9
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.490
I actually bookmarked it as soon as I heard about it several months ago,

10
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:29.990
because I thought that's a book I need to read.

11
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.270
<v 1>Oh, thank you. And I'm never quite sure.</v>

12
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:36.170
People always tend to have an opinion very far in one direction or the other.

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.941
<v 0>The world we live in.</v>

14
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.920
And actually that's something we're probably going to talk about. Isn't it.

15
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.070
I wanted to start with that word. Cynical. I have the book on my phone.

16
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.500
I don't have the print copy or I'd show our audience,

17
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.590
but you've got the word critical and you have the word cynical written over it.

18
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:52.040
So it's like critical theories, but cynical theories instead. Cynical what?

19
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.883
Cynical.

20
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.810
<v 1>Okay. So when postmodern is, post-modernism a Rose,</v>

21
00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:59.720
it was defined as a skepticism towards narratives.

22
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.770
And what annoys us is that this particular approach,

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.330
this critical approach considers itself to be the epitome of

24
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.700
skepticism. Whereas in fact,

25
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:13.520
being skeptical of meta-narrative has been something that been happening

26
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:14.870
throughout the modern period.

27
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.380
This is what the whole sort of scientific revolution was about.

28
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:19.820
How do I know this is true?

29
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:24.680
So we say that the theories that came out of these postmodern ideas,

30
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.780
aren't skeptical because skeptical is doubtful and it's still in search of some

31
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:30.710
kind of truth.

32
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.060
It's cynical because it begins with the assumption that everything is about

33
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.730
power and balances and people trying to protect their power.

34
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.130
And then it reads society through it.

35
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.480
<v 0>So no idea about how people are working together,</v>

36
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.120
sometimes in opposition sometimes,

37
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:51.230
but towards some variety of truth or objectivity or

38
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.360
understanding or any of those things.

39
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.400
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. I think, um, uh, Joe, Alan Sokal and John Brickman, they,</v>

40
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:00.020
they wrote, wrote it very well.

41
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:03.500
They said there's a specific skepticism in which we say,

42
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:07.490
how do we know this is true? And then we work out how to find out a bit is true,

43
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:11.240
how to falsify it, if it isn't true. And this is interesting and productive.

44
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.740
If you've got the kind of radical skepticism of the postmodern approach,

45
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.120
you don't even look for truth.

46
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.050
You just start with this idea that we can't actually obtain truth.

47
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:25.460
And what's interesting is, is what power dynamics are being are in play here.

48
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.720
<v 0>You said the word power several times here. And I do want to come back to that,</v>

49
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:30.950
but I want to say just one more thing.

50
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.410
I'll get you to comment on one more thing before we do that.

51
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.880
So you've said no twice.

52
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.600
I think meta-narrative so they're skeptical about metanarratives,

53
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:41.210
but it sounds like what you're saying is there is a meta-narrative they have

54
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:42.044
their own.

55
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.850
<v 1>Yes. Th this is, um, the third generation. So in the sixties,</v>

56
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.950
uh Jean-Francois Lyotard he described postmodernism as a skepticism towards

57
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.030
meta narratives, and that's all those big overarching explanations for things.

58
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:59.590
So Christianity obviously Marxism, um,

59
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.220
but science and progress as well. So he was skeptical of that.

60
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.570
And so were all of the first postmodernists they really took things apart. Um,

61
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.130
they didn't really try to build anything,

62
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.520
but as these few core ideas about power, knowledge,

63
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.340
and language have evolved over the last 50 years,

64
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.940
they have formed a meta-narrative of their own now.

65
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.440
<v 0>So power, knowledge, and language,</v>

66
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.150
and from reading your book power is what people have kind of innately

67
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:29.550
because of their characteristics and languages.

68
00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:30.860
What brings the whole thing together?

69
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.980
How we talk about it and our discourses and knowledge is what we're creating by

70
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.830
discoursing if that's a verb, is that right?

71
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.390
<v 1>Yes. So, um, it's, uh, Michel Fuko,</v>

72
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:44.310
particularly who joined the words,

73
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:46.530
power and knowledge to make one power knowledge,

74
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.090
and this is what underlies everything. So it isn't that, um,

75
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.650
people are deliberately trying to exercise power over others necessarily

76
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.700
it's that people are born into certain positions in society that gives them a

77
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:01.350
certain relationship to power.

78
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.190
The powerful forces get to decide what is knowledge and what isn't.

79
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.080
And then this is legitimize. And everybody speaks, um, through this,

80
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.710
these discourses of, of knowledge, which really discourses of power.

81
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.540
So they can be called things like white supremacy, patriarchy, CIS,

82
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:22.500
normativity, heteronormativity, and we're all upholding them all the time.

83
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.270
By assuming that, um,

84
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.630
there is knowledge that is legitimate about these things.

85
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.720
<v 0>So we've been quite abstract up to now,</v>

86
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:33.270
we've talked about things like metanarratives and discourses,

87
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:36.750
and now you've started to hint at some rather specific versions of this and the

88
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:41.640
book you give a chapter each to several of these cynical theories. So, you know,

89
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.120
critical race theory, et cetera, et cetera, let's pick race.

90
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:46.800
Since you mentioned, uh,

91
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.610
you mentioned the white fragility or the white supremacy sort of idea.

92
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.330
That's very topical right now we have books like, um,

93
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.200
with people like Robin de Angelo, I'm talking about white fragility.

94
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:02.160
And so what's wrong with that. I mean, we, we do, we do live in a world where,

95
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.800
um, you know, people have been horribly oppressed on the basis of race. There,

96
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.540
there is, there is a hierarchy here, so are they getting it completely wrong?

97
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.040
Have they got some aspect of it, right.

98
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.190
<v 1>The approach wrong. So if we're going to look at, um, racism,</v>

99
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.740
there are a number of different ways to do this.

100
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.540
So the liberal approach to racism, which was, uh,

101
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.420
kind of put forward in Martin Luther King frequently,

102
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.740
this aims to take significance out of identity categories. So, you know,

103
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:34.710
while being black or being a woman could be important to your sense of who you

104
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:35.041
are.

105
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:39.450
It shouldn't tell society anything about your moral or social value or what role

106
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:40.410
you should play in the world.

107
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.550
So this is what the liberal approach is when critical race theory arose.

108
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.520
It took aim at that. Um,

109
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.410
particularly it didn't agree with the liberal approach of trying to be

110
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:53.041
colorblind.

111
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:57.950
It obviously it tends to interpret that as a willingness to be to racism,

112
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:02.570
which isn't a tool. The same thing, if you think being colorblind is a, is a,

113
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.290
is a positive thing that we should try, we should aim for in our society.

114
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.690
It means you oppose people who are not being colorblind,

115
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.440
people who are being racist. So when we look at racism,

116
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.580
we need the most rigorous scholarship that's out there. And there are some very,

117
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.250
very rigorous, uh, scholars out there. They, um,

118
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.420
take a materialist empirical approach. So you could look at the, um,

119
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.230
research into the criminal justice system, by someone like Michelle Alexander,

120
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.370
for example. And you will find her looking at systems at,

121
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.750
at laws at numbers. And she'll be analyzing this in a, in a,

122
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.400
in a strong and steady way. But if you go with somebody like Robin D'Angelo,

123
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.020
she is all about, um, theory, her own interpretation of how,

124
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.730
what all white people must think how all black people must experience things.

125
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.110
She wants people to admit all white people to admit that they have been

126
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:58.340
socialized into believing that black people are inferior in various ways,

127
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.850
and then work to dismantle that even though that isn't actually ever possible.

128
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.480
So one of her, um, when she,

129
00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:07.550
she wrote a number of tenants with a team,

130
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.470
and one of them was the question is not, does racist, did racism occur,

131
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.320
but how did racism manifest in this situation?

132
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.120
So it's assumed to always be there.

133
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.410
<v 0>It reminds me very much of the logic of the ducking stool. You know,</v>

134
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:21.970
you've got the, you know, if the witch sinks,

135
00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:24.820
she wasn't a witch and if she floats, well, we will burn her.

136
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.220
So there's just no way. I'm just,

137
00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:28.300
there's nothing that you can do in this situation.

138
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.250
<v 1>No, exactly. There's the Angelo. She gives us two choices.</v>

139
00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:37.390
You can either be racist and acknowledge it and work against it,

140
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.630
or you can be in, be racist and in selfish denial of it.

141
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.210
<v 0>So it's unforeseeable and that's obvious that's a feature. That's not a bug,</v>

142
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:48.820
I guess, because she doesn't want anybody denying it.

143
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.850
How can this actually have caught on when I thought we had, you know,

144
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.680
I thought we had actually solidified the idea that what was the power of the

145
00:07:56.681 --> 00:08:00.280
modern world was that we have periods that we could test and we could falsify

146
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.130
them and we could reject them if they weren't good enough and replace them by

147
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:04.570
new ones. How did that even catch on.

148
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.430
<v 1>This is what has been being undermined. This is the liberal approach.</v>

149
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.860
Then it's what Jonathan Rausch called liberal science,

150
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:15.370
that process where everybody can raise any idea they want.

151
00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:17.410
Anybody else can challenge that idea.

152
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.880
There's the belief that we can all get at ideas and examine them on their own

153
00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:22.361
merits.

154
00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:25.960
And that the individual has agency to reject some ideas or not hold others.

155
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.170
So this to the postmodernist is very, very naive.

156
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.330
It's either an extreme naivety and an inability to see the

157
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:36.730
invisible powers, power structures,

158
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.960
or it's a selfish attempt to protect one's own privilege.

159
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.710
So you see per some extent that there is of course truth in this,

160
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.060
because if we look at how our understanding of homosexuality has changed,

161
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.840
for example, dominant discourse is for a long time. So it was a heinous sin.

162
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.830
Then it said it was a shameful disorder.

163
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.640
Now the dominant discourse around homosexuality is some people are going to get

164
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:03.650
over it. So this has changed, but whereas the liberals would say,

165
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.010
this has changed because we were able to look at it, talk about it,

166
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:11.940
discuss it, apply science to it. And, um, you know,

167
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.420
really sort of compare arguments for what homosexuality is.

168
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.340
Does it have any moral valance at all? And that was how we overcame,

169
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.190
um, prejudice against homosexuality. But the, the,

170
00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:27.510
the discourse there is the descendants of the postmodernist would say,

171
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:31.140
this is naive. And what all that has happened is that, um,

172
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.530
the ways of talking about things have changed. We are still living in a very,

173
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.700
um, heterocentric and a centrist society,

174
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.720
and that those power structures are still there and they still need to be

175
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:43.554
dismantled.

176
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.520
<v 0>And they think that we're going to do that by changing the way that we talk</v>

177
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:47.390
about things.

178
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.590
<v 1>Yes, precisely if, if language creates social reality,</v>

179
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.540
changing language can create a better one.

180
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.040
<v 0>And if you think that, like, if one thinks that, uh,</v>

181
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.810
we're in this sort of invisible web, this, this power web, and we're all of us,

182
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.780
it positioned according to our characteristics,

183
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.740
we maybe even don't see these things until somebody has taught us the techniques

184
00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:13.580
of critical whatever theory, how can, like,

185
00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:15.890
it sounds like we're trying to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.

186
00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:17.720
If you believe that you can change the way that you talk,

187
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.930
and that will change reality, like it is incredibly pessimistic.

188
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:23.060
And I don't know how they think, if you think like that,

189
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:25.130
how they think that you can't even change your language.

190
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.630
<v 1>Well, some theorists have argued that, that it's almost impossible.</v>

191
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.980
Kristy Dotson. Um, for example, when she does her, um, conceptualize,

192
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.420
conceptualizing epistemic oppression, she says that third level,

193
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.840
that one where you have to try to,

194
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.780
to even speak in the language that you have,

195
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.720
trying to see that there is a problem when you only have the language,

196
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.290
the epistemic resources that you have is almost impossible.

197
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.560
So there is a lot of, um, of pessimism there,

198
00:10:54.561 --> 00:10:57.620
but there's also a certain simplicity to it.

199
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.300
And there's a certain appeal to it because people feel as though we're only at

200
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:04.280
the beginning, we can't, they don't know,

201
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.470
not even that the most advanced theorists in the world know or exactly how

202
00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:10.490
this power system works,

203
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:13.760
but what we're doing is we're picking at it where we're digging at it.

204
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:14.720
We're trying to see it.

205
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:18.470
We're uncovering more bits of it because it's unfortified bubble.

206
00:11:18.471 --> 00:11:22.760
Somebody can identify racism within any interaction.

207
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.090
And as long as it's, um, according to the theory,

208
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:29.090
it will be deemed or authoritative. It will be correct. So there's,

209
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.430
there's a lot of, um, a lot of room for people to play with these ideas,

210
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:37.460
for them to interpret things. And,

211
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.800
and to them feel like you're really uncovering new ground and,

212
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.670
and setting the scene for improving things.

213
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.670
<v 0>Right? So they feel like they're making progress because when there's no,</v>

214
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.450
falsifiability, everything is sort of progress. Every bit of thing that you say.

215
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.280
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it's beginning be able to see it,</v>

216
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.230
that that's the thing the Angelo often says,

217
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.820
we need to make it visible and then we can get at it.

218
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:00.811
<v 0>I mean,</v>

219
00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:03.210
I think the second bit of that doesn't necessarily follow from the first,

220
00:12:03.211 --> 00:12:04.620
but since I don't agree with the first either,

221
00:12:04.621 --> 00:12:07.170
I think that's going to be relevant. Um,

222
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.840
I thought it was very interesting the way you talked. I think it was, it was,

223
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.630
um, Megan, an article just very recently,

224
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.270
you said this thing about what cancelled culture really is.

225
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.110
And there was a great explanation that the point of cancel culture is that if

226
00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:21.510
people are saying wrong things, I know it was wrong.

227
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:24.340
Things are creating wrongness and silence,

228
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.980
and them is extremely moral thing to do and silencing them by any means really.

229
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.290
Um, and you don't have to debate them, debating them will be bad.

230
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.790
Have I got that about right?

231
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.600
<v 1>Yes, exactly. I think this makes intuitive sense to humans. I mean,</v>

232
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.640
this is why there have been such strong laws against heresy and blessing for me,

233
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:46.290
because the idea is you can corrupt society. You can taint and dam others.

234
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.070
So, you know, when we had awful things like the inquisition,

235
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.470
this was a moral endeavor because the attempt was to stop this

236
00:12:55.471 --> 00:13:00.120
corruption from spreading and damming, a lot of people to hell. And so, yes,

237
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.350
they wanted to put very,

238
00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:05.250
very strong disincentives in place for people to question

239
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.920
the orthodoxy of religion.

240
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.350
Now this is a different situation because we're in a different time,

241
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.030
but the same, um, the same, sorry,

242
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.490
my husband has not got his keys. Can you let that in please?

243
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.610
<v 0>Should I ask you the question again? I think you were going well,</v>

244
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:23.610
so I don't want to meet people from the inquisition. That was good.

245
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.920
<v 1>So, uh, yeah, so we, um, yeah,</v>

246
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.570
even with things like the inquisition,

247
00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:35.400
which where was such a sort of terrorizing, um, thing,

248
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.010
there was a moral imperative, uh, underneath that,

249
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.040
the idea was that if people, um, speak heresy, if they,

250
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.520
they challenge the, um, the orthodoxy, but the truth of God's this,

251
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.420
this can, um, this, this will corrupt and, um,

252
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.550
and taints the rest of society and cause, and cause people to be down to hell.

253
00:13:56.551 --> 00:14:01.110
So there's this incentive to really make, um, to,

254
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.650
to ensure that people are thinking and speaking in the right way for the good of

255
00:14:04.651 --> 00:14:08.130
everybody. And that's what you get right now. I mean, the,

256
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.750
the strongest mantra I think that people are wanted, uh,

257
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.740
expected to repeat at the moment is trans women are women. And so what,

258
00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:19.530
no matter what you actually believe about trans identity,

259
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.540
I'm fully in support of trans trans rights and people identifying as they

260
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.800
wish to with, you know,

261
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.650
there's obviously conversations that need to be happened about spaces and

262
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:32.040
sports, but no matter what you think about this, we,

263
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:35.640
it's difficult to notice that the emphasis is,

264
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.440
is very much on language.

265
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.040
Are you saying things which suggests that trans women aren't women,

266
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.650
the way to respond to that is not with an argument.

267
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.660
So we don't have people arguing back and forwards as much as we have them and

268
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.270
throwing mantras at each other as if they're trying to, um,

269
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.260
to, to out outspeak each other on the level of these discourses.

270
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:00.650
If I say trans women are women often enough, if enough people say it,

271
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.820
that will make the social reality be what is needed for the acceptance of trans

272
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:05.654
people.

273
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.230
<v 0>Yeah, it's interesting because I had, honestly,</v>

274
00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:11.350
I had sort of thought that anyone who hung on to a mantra that much couldn't

275
00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:13.930
possibly really believe it, you know, that if you're,

276
00:15:13.931 --> 00:15:16.690
if you feel secure in your own ideas, I'd always thought,

277
00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:19.030
but then this just shows that I'm from a previous generation.

278
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.100
I always thought if you were secure in your ideas,

279
00:15:21.101 --> 00:15:22.210
you wouldn't mind debating them.

280
00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:25.420
You'd feel confident that you could answer any criticism that people put

281
00:15:25.421 --> 00:15:28.930
forward. But I think what you showed, uh, you know, and you, you,

282
00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:30.730
you gave me a different way to conceive of this.

283
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.140
Was it the very saying of these things was a harm.

284
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.100
And I haven't understood that before that, you know, I was creating an evil,

285
00:15:39.101 --> 00:15:41.320
according to these people, by saying things even possibly,

286
00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:42.340
if I were saying them on my own,

287
00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:45.490
in a room normally even meant to think that I'm not even meant to say them in my

288
00:15:45.491 --> 00:15:46.330
head, I guess.

289
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.780
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, this is why we get the argument that, um,</v>

290
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.920
gender critical feminists are involved in the murder of trans women,

291
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.160
even though, you know,

292
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.530
trans women do seem to be particularly vulnerable to violence, but this isn't,

293
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.440
um, has never been by a gender critical feminist,

294
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:07.090
but there's this idea that they're speaking into a narrative that de validates

295
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.540
in validates de legitimize is, um, trans people.

296
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.950
It creates a hostile environment and one in which it is acceptable for them to

297
00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:19.330
be abused by people who have completely different ideas and aren't feminist at

298
00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:20.950
all. So it's, um.

299
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.630
<v 0>It seems quite remarkable. I mean, it seems, you know, I mean,</v>

300
00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:27.430
I lived in Brazil for several years and I mean,

301
00:16:27.431 --> 00:16:29.950
that is one of the places where trans women are murdered. I mean, you know,

302
00:16:29.951 --> 00:16:31.810
it's actually one of the hotspots, but in Rio de Janeiro,

303
00:16:31.811 --> 00:16:33.490
because there's a lot of street workers there, you know,

304
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.660
they're not listening to what gender critical feminists are saying. I mean,

305
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:40.210
these men, it's nothing to do with, it's nothing to do with that. It's,

306
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.790
you know, some mixture of violence homophobia, to be honest,

307
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.240
self hatred, et cetera, et cetera, you know, and just being violent.

308
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.550
Is anyone really so convinced if they think it through,

309
00:16:54.551 --> 00:16:57.100
or is the point that they're stopping themselves from thinking it through,

310
00:16:57.101 --> 00:16:59.560
by saying the mantra? Like, is it a thought stopping cliche?

311
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.773
<v 1>I think it's,</v>

312
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.970
I have a tendency to think that it is actually quite normal,

313
00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:11.920
quite intuitive to humans to think that our words have more power than

314
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:12.754
they do.

315
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.410
I think that the idea that if we can just get everybody

316
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.690
saying the right thing, everything will be okay,

317
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.310
actually makes a lot of sense to us, whereas storytelling the species.

318
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.290
So I think what's more counter-intuitive to us is the idea that there can be

319
00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:33.850
worth in getting people together who have two different views on a thing and

320
00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:38.380
getting them to argue their own side, using evidence in a reasoned argument.

321
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.723
This,

322
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.390
this doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to a lot of the activists right now.

323
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.270
And it hasn't made a lot of sense, historically.

324
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:50.910
I think people like you and I and our generation and people who have been

325
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:54.210
involved in having these kinds of conversations, we can,

326
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:58.020
it seems that this is the obvious way. You know, we talk about things. We,

327
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.420
we exchange ideas. This is how we progress,

328
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:03.360
but it doesn't seem to be that intuitive to a lot of people.

329
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.630
<v 0>Yeah. So maybe it was a brief period,</v>

330
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.760
but it was a brief and very glorious periods.

331
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.030
<v 1>I think it's something we have to, we have to hang on to it.</v>

332
00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:14.330
We have to constantly reinforce it. Otherwise it will,

333
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.080
we are likely to lose it and it will be the most powerful narrative wins.

334
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.390
<v 0>So what let's see, um,</v>

335
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.170
I want to ask you what you think this means for two particular large areas,

336
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.170
very important areas of society that I think are really under attack at the

337
00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:29.540
moment. And one is academia and the other one is journalism.

338
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.800
So academia seems to have pretty much fallen to these ideas,

339
00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:35.390
at least large chunks of it.

340
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.820
<v 1>I th I think it's certainly, um, very much overpowered by it.</v>

341
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.410
Of course you get, um,

342
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.450
I don't think the majority of academics hold these views and that you don't find

343
00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:48.740
them in, uh, in every field,

344
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.060
they really sort of concentrated in a cluster in the humanities and also on

345
00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:53.930
campus culture.

346
00:18:53.931 --> 00:18:58.910
But anybody who goes against them is likely to find themselves

347
00:18:58.911 --> 00:19:02.300
in trouble. So this is what I was I found when I'm studying, um,

348
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.630
late medieval women's religious writing. Now I can look,

349
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:10.220
I can do work that I can be proud of as long as I'm not looking at what

350
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.330
sex is, what gender is, how it works in any way,

351
00:19:14.331 --> 00:19:17.210
that's going to go against the dominant narrative. You know?

352
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:20.240
So if somebody wanted to be a historian and they wanted to look at agriculture

353
00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:20.691
or something,

354
00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:23.960
like it goes through their whole lives without becoming a Cropper with this.

355
00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:28.070
But if you're a scientist and you want to look at say how sex differences exist

356
00:19:28.071 --> 00:19:31.190
between men and women, then you're going to find yourself in trouble.

357
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.840
<v 0>It's interesting, isn't it?</v>

358
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.440
Because I think that's a bit of it's that people don't see if they're outside,

359
00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.300
what we might call a knowledge producing industry.

360
00:19:38.301 --> 00:19:42.560
So I'll count journalism to that, even, even if it's not very fair, but it's,

361
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.221
it's the,

362
00:19:43.221 --> 00:19:47.690
it's the self-censorship it's before you even get to the area that's touchy.

363
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.411
So it's not a bit,

364
00:19:48.411 --> 00:19:50.540
not about the people who were sacked it's about the people who never said

365
00:19:50.541 --> 00:19:51.650
anything more than anything else.

366
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.370
<v 1>Yes. I hear it from a lot of academics.</v>

367
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.910
And I hear from a lot of people generally, who write to me and say, I, you know,

368
00:19:58.911 --> 00:20:03.830
I think I'm the only person in my organization who is concerned about

369
00:20:03.831 --> 00:20:06.440
this. And then quite often now I happen to know that they're not,

370
00:20:06.441 --> 00:20:08.300
and I can put them in touch with somebody else.

371
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.440
And I think there's a lot more people who are, um,

372
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.320
concerned about it or who at least don't agree with it.

373
00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:20.090
I think with a lot of liberals on the left who still actually have those kind of

374
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.350
beliefs that I'd like them to have about the value of different ideas and the

375
00:20:24.351 --> 00:20:26.600
exchange of debates and consistent principles,

376
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:32.060
they tend to understand the social justice approaches a more

377
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:36.830
friendly and liberal thing than it is and feel that they should be supportive of

378
00:20:36.831 --> 00:20:41.750
it. And the scholar is producing it because the problem on the right is,

379
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.570
um, is a more severe one. If you, if you are a leftist, yes,

380
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:47.560
we're going to worry about the rise of right-wing populists.

381
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.460
And they then get rather annoyed with people on the left, who are saying yes,

382
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:53.980
but this is a problem that's on the left. It is a problem.

383
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:55.240
We do need to address it.

384
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.010
<v 0>And more than that, they're connected, aren't they and people. Yeah.</v>

385
00:20:59.011 --> 00:21:00.960
So you tell me about how you think they're connected then.

386
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.280
<v 1>I don't think, I think there are two ways. If you,</v>

387
00:21:05.281 --> 00:21:09.360
if you are a leftist and you want left-wing parties to win and be able to, um,

388
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.910
Institute left-wing policies, there are two things you have to do.

389
00:21:11.911 --> 00:21:15.030
You have to show the problem with the party on the right,

390
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.550
and you have to make your own party,

391
00:21:17.551 --> 00:21:20.070
a strong one and one that people can respect.

392
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:22.440
And I don't think that's happening on the left at the moment.

393
00:21:22.441 --> 00:21:26.550
I think that there's this division between the identitarian,

394
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.880
the radicals and the liberals on the left. And at the moment,

395
00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:33.180
the identity politics left is the one that is most visible.

396
00:21:33.181 --> 00:21:36.840
It's the one that corporations and politicians feel that they have to appease.

397
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.880
And I think it's driving people right now. I can't know how many people went,

398
00:21:41.881 --> 00:21:46.470
right, because of this. And, um, so it's not very helpful to guess,

399
00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:51.450
but I do think that if we could have a more consistently liberal left,

400
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.920
then we could see,

401
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.700
then we'd have been a better chance of getting people to vote left again.

402
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.670
<v 0>So the profession that worries me most,</v>

403
00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:01.800
I have to say because it's the one I'm in is journalism.

404
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.360
And I think you see a lot of the same tendencies in particular.

405
00:22:06.361 --> 00:22:09.540
The self-censorship not surprisingly, I suppose. I mean,

406
00:22:09.541 --> 00:22:10.980
a lot of money has gone out of journalism.

407
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:14.880
A lot of people have gone out of journalism. It's become a low paid, um,

408
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.990
very temporary and casual sort of work that young people come into.

409
00:22:18.991 --> 00:22:22.710
And they have no time, no specialism, no support from older journalists.

410
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.630
And of course, they're all graduates now.

411
00:22:24.631 --> 00:22:27.780
And most of them have come in from the sorts of courses where they learn this

412
00:22:27.781 --> 00:22:28.614
sort of stuff.

413
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.070
So I'm absolutely a standard how fast this has happened to the journalism has

414
00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:32.904
been hollowed out.

415
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.080
And I also see this as part of the political problem because

416
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.250
ordinary people slowly get the sense that they're not actually reading what's

417
00:22:41.251 --> 00:22:42.150
going on. They're reading a,

418
00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:45.480
sort of a self censored version of it in what are meant to be the papers of

419
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.570
record. So you have a, you have your own magazine,

420
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.640
you editor as sort of a new magazine.

421
00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:55.590
Is this part of the motivation for you that you see no other place to put the

422
00:22:55.591 --> 00:22:56.820
sorts of things that you want to say?

423
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.760
<v 1>Yeah. And th that was why area was, um,</v>

424
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.620
was created in the first place by amalgam Mali. He wanted something that wasn't,

425
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.810
um, left-wing or right-wing, or both,

426
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.720
but something that would have views from both sides,

427
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:14.730
but would argue them straightforwardly with, um, evidence and reason.

428
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.070
And so that, that is what we try to do.

429
00:23:17.071 --> 00:23:19.590
We have quite a lot of leftists who write for us,

430
00:23:19.591 --> 00:23:22.290
but few of them are the social justice leftists.

431
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:25.800
They tend to be socialists or, um, social Democrats.

432
00:23:25.801 --> 00:23:29.820
And we have quite a lot of conservatives as well. And, and, um, and Christians,

433
00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:33.240
and they will write from, from their belief systems. And this,

434
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.480
I think works well. We don't require people to be apolitical,

435
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.080
but we do require them to both state what that,

436
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.450
what political position they're coming from is,

437
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.880
and try to look charitably and concede much as they can to the one they're

438
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:48.540
criticizing. Yeah.

439
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.700
<v 0>Okay. I'm going to take a bit of a leap, a sort of a sidestep here and say,</v>

440
00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:58.390
and how fascinating I find it endlessly fascinating,

441
00:23:58.391 --> 00:24:03.190
the way that race in one bucket. And then we might say sex, gender,

442
00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:04.540
and sexuality in another bucket,

443
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.800
how incredibly differently theorized these two things are so race,

444
00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:13.030
which actually is this fluids blurbs sort of category.

445
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.830
You know, I mean the,

446
00:24:14.831 --> 00:24:17.860
the race line was drawn differently in different countries at different times,

447
00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:21.880
et cetera, is regarded as the most rigid, possible thing.

448
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.380
And sex, gender sexuality. When you know, sex is incredibly rigid,

449
00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:30.100
sexuality mode for fields, for most people, quite binary, not everybody,

450
00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:33.550
but most gender less. So, but I mean, compared to the race, you know,

451
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.360
how did that happen? How did he end up sort of almost the wrong way round there?

452
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.250
<v 1>Okay. So I think that we've come from different, um, different places.</v>

453
00:24:42.251 --> 00:24:43.270
So theory,

454
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.980
which is where a lot of the sort of gender theory and then trans activism comes

455
00:24:47.981 --> 00:24:50.740
from that's the most purely post-modern.

456
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:56.050
So it believes that there is a problem with having stuck with knowledge and that

457
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.590
it's been constructed in the service of power. So to get at that,

458
00:24:59.591 --> 00:25:03.100
we have to look at the categories through which we think, and to try to,

459
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.220
to blur those boundaries, dismantle those categories,

460
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.500
and stop putting people into them.

461
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.210
They believe that if we get rid of all,

462
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:14.530
all categories that aren't, you know, uh,

463
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.100
feminine women attracted to men or masculine man attracted to women,

464
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:23.200
then the world will become a more welcoming place to the people who don't, um,

465
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.520
not be fitted for the pathways. So we've got that whole, um,

466
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.460
fluid thing going on there. And in fact, has become, uh,

467
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.710
a verb and to something is to blur the boundaries and to mix up the

468
00:25:35.711 --> 00:25:40.510
categories. So that that's one particular theory and it relies quite a lot on,

469
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.560
um, dairy Darren Fuko. So when we're going into critical race theory,

470
00:25:44.561 --> 00:25:48.880
this comes from a different lineage that has quite a lot of, um,

471
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.780
of input from the radical new left.

472
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:58.420
And then it has the post-modern influence, um, on top. So Kimberly Crenshaw,

473
00:25:58.421 --> 00:26:00.760
when she described intersectionality,

474
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.300
she described it as contemporary politics by which he meant the radical

475
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.800
activism, um,

476
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.210
linked to postmodern theory by which she meant the idea of everything being

477
00:26:10.211 --> 00:26:13.690
culturally constructed, but she wanted, um,

478
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.900
some acceptance of objective truth to be there.

479
00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:20.020
She criticized the postmodernists saying that, you know,

480
00:26:20.021 --> 00:26:21.790
we can't just dismantle everything.

481
00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:25.150
We have to accept that some things are objectively true,

482
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:26.350
or we can't achieve anything.

483
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.400
So those systems of power and privilege had to be seen as true.

484
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.930
And I think because this comes from America and because there really has been

485
00:26:34.931 --> 00:26:38.440
that rigid line in America, you know, there has been that one drop rule.

486
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.000
If you are black at all, then you are black. And so this,

487
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.760
the whole sort of, um,

488
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.620
identity politics to push back at this has taken this as well as,

489
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.210
as a solid category. They don't think that race is a biological category.

490
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.370
They do think it's a social construct,

491
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:01.020
but they think it's been constructed very simply into white supremacy and black

492
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.453
subordination.

493
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.490
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

494
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:08.690
How can we get some of the things that I never talked about in this whole world

495
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.010
view that are actually to do with power in particular money in class?

496
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.940
How can we get money in class, back into this sort of discussion poverty?

497
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.480
I never hear it. I never actually hear poverty or poor exception.

498
00:27:20.481 --> 00:27:24.620
It's kind of tagged on to other things, you know, poor black women or, you know.

499
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.280
<v 1>I mean, I, I mean,</v>

500
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.810
this is why it's been the Marxist who have been criticizing the postmodernist

501
00:27:31.811 --> 00:27:32.511
for longest,

502
00:27:32.511 --> 00:27:36.920
and we still have the traditional Marxists who are still saying you are

503
00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:41.630
dividing the working class. This is now all about rich, um, uh,

504
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.940
black and white people. Usually in universities,

505
00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:45.860
we're not looking at economics or class at all.

506
00:27:45.861 --> 00:27:50.270
Now this is an entirely Bush war enterprise. And, um, you know,

507
00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:51.920
that they're criticizing on these grounds.

508
00:27:51.921 --> 00:27:55.610
And so they get quite annoyed when people then call what we're seeing now,

509
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.960
Neo Marxism, because this has nothing to do with Mark's.

510
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.220
You can't blame him for this,

511
00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:05.150
but I think that there are more connections with the whole sort of revolutionary

512
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.550
idea, but leaving class out is I think one of the,

513
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.730
the,

514
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.610
the most serious drawbacks of the critical race approach,

515
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.330
because we, we can look at race certainly,

516
00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:23.390
and there are re you don't always have to only look at class.

517
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.190
I think the Marxists are a bit restricted if they only want to look at class in

518
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.400
particular, in a country in which race has been significant for so long,

519
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.740
but by only including class,

520
00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:37.550
when somebody has another intersecting identity that is marginalized,

521
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.260
we're going to lose a lot of the, um, of the,

522
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:45.020
the sort of empirical analysis that we could have to actually make things

523
00:28:45.021 --> 00:28:48.200
better. Um, a lot of the reason that, um,

524
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.120
that black Americans have such a lower, lower outcomes in life, generally,

525
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.350
it surely because they've only been allowed to try to rise out of the lowest

526
00:28:57.351 --> 00:28:59.180
positions for about two generations.

527
00:28:59.181 --> 00:29:04.070
Now we know that the best indicator of an individual success is if their

528
00:29:04.071 --> 00:29:08.210
parents have been successful. So it's not going to happen straight away,

529
00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:11.540
and it's not going to happen unless we look at social and material factors,

530
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.850
as well as potential prejudice.

531
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.190
<v 0>And it also seems something that is quite obviously going to create</v>

532
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:21.620
pushback, because if you've got, I mean, I think you mentioned this in the book,

533
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.570
you would easily get a hypothetical example of, you know,

534
00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:27.680
very poor white person, like somebody with a really, really hard life.

535
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.130
And if the only thing you have to say to that person is if you've been black,

536
00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:34.430
it would have been even worse. It's like, come on. You know,

537
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.960
and if the person is saying is, is,

538
00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:40.340
is a university graduates or whatever race is painful,

539
00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:42.250
it sounds like nothing has anything to offer you.

540
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:43.780
And you may as well just go off to the right.

541
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.210
<v 1>Yes. I think this does make a lot of, um, of working class.</v>

542
00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:52.260
People feel alienated. We've seen the surge to the right from the working class,

543
00:29:52.261 --> 00:29:56.790
both here in the UK, although we can't sort of put too much emphasis on,

544
00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.310
on that being anything to do with the social justice,

545
00:29:59.311 --> 00:30:03.270
because there was the whole Brexit thing going on as well. But yeah,

546
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.300
the working class do seem to be going to the right.

547
00:30:06.301 --> 00:30:09.360
They see Trump as having their interests more than mine.

548
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.030
They see Bryce Johnson as having their interest more than mine. Now this is,

549
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.230
this is a really strange development and I think critical social justice ideas.

550
00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:18.150
I've got to take some responsibility for that.

551
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.660
<v 0>So there's something else that you talked about in the book that I thought was</v>

552
00:30:21.661 --> 00:30:25.800
really also clarifying for me was that we have three levels of analysis.

553
00:30:25.801 --> 00:30:30.480
We could say individual and group and universal. And as a liberal,

554
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.210
the emphasis is really on individual and universal.

555
00:30:33.211 --> 00:30:36.300
So we are human beings and that's what we share, but also we're individuals.

556
00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:37.500
So we have our own interests.

557
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.340
Whereas all these sort of cynical theories that you talk about are really at

558
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:45.090
that middle level of group as maybe you could talk a little bit about that.

559
00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.390
And whether you think liberals could maybe learn something from that,

560
00:30:48.391 --> 00:30:52.200
or whether you think that particular slice way of slicing things through should

561
00:30:52.201 --> 00:30:53.100
just be abandoned.

562
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.653
<v 1>No, I, I,</v>

563
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.200
I think it would be great if we didn't have to think in terms of group,

564
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.290
but as a tribal territorial species, I think we always will have to.

565
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.510
So I think sometimes when the, um, the socialists and the social justice,

566
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.490
um, scholars have criticized liberalism for focusing too much on the

567
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:12.121
individual,

568
00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:16.380
having access to everything and our shared humanity and not enough on group,

569
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.420
they do make a point because it's quite simplistic to think, well,

570
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:25.770
we just want every individual to be able to do everything and not look at things

571
00:31:25.771 --> 00:31:27.180
that could be holding them back from that,

572
00:31:27.181 --> 00:31:29.910
which could be their class could be their race could be their sex.

573
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.060
So we do need to have that kind of focus. And I think the,

574
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.390
the liberal civil rights movements of the sixties and seventies,

575
00:31:36.391 --> 00:31:39.150
liberal feminism, gay pride, the civil rights movements,

576
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.920
they were largely driven by this liberal Universalist impulse. They said,

577
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.860
we want to have the same rights as everybody else,

578
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.600
which is very different to the identity politics approach, which is,

579
00:31:51.601 --> 00:31:53.460
we are this group with this source of power.

580
00:31:53.461 --> 00:31:56.850
You are a different group and we are in conflict. Right.

581
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.860
<v 0>Right. So you were saying maybe the group is the way that, uh,</v>

582
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.920
let's see an inequality lawyer or might look at this will be to say, well,

583
00:32:04.921 --> 00:32:06.510
you know, this could be indirect discrimination.

584
00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:08.910
There could be something here that it's a facially neutral policy,

585
00:32:08.911 --> 00:32:11.820
as they say in American law, meaning everybody has access,

586
00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:14.970
but actually not really. And that could be discrimination.

587
00:32:14.971 --> 00:32:16.980
So you can kind of fit it into a liberal framework.

588
00:32:16.981 --> 00:32:20.760
You don't have to go the whole way down to, you know, group sources.

589
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.870
<v 1>I think we need a liberal framework overall,</v>

590
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.050
but one that takes input from, um,

591
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.400
from class analysis and from identity analysis, because we,

592
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.190
that, that is how humans work.

593
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.680
I think the danger of focusing too much on groups is that,

594
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:44.180
that brings out the worst of human nature because we are tribal because it's so

595
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:47.240
easy for us to think, well, of our own group demonize an out-group,

596
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:51.410
but we become callously indifferent to people who aren't on our team.

597
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.380
That's something we need to always protect against.

598
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:56.960
And we need an element of liberal humanism to do that,

599
00:32:56.961 --> 00:33:01.940
to be thinking of as many people as possible as coming within our Sierra of,

600
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:06.770
of concern. So my, my fear with identity politics is that it will lead.

601
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:11.920
Um, and it is leading to really harsh conflict and an inability to,

602
00:33:11.921 --> 00:33:14.300
to see each other as human beings or as individuals.

603
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.200
<v 0>So the first time I heard of intersectionality,</v>

604
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.020
I thought that's what it was trying to do, that it was saying,

605
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.710
think about the way that this could be different for people who are different,

606
00:33:23.711 --> 00:33:24.430
you know, think,

607
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.070
are you actually thinking how this would look to a feminist who's black?

608
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.440
Are you thinking about how this might feel to someone who's disabled?

609
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.940
And I really liked that idea,

610
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:35.740
but somehow that's not at all how the word has come to mean.

611
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.870
<v 1>No, I mean, it, it really could be valuable. I think Patricia Hill Collins who,</v>

612
00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:41.620
um,

613
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:46.030
sort of developed the concept of intersectionality along with Kimberly Crenshaw,

614
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:51.310
she points out that in the U S there are very, very different stereotypes,

615
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.580
um, for black women than there were for black men or white women.

616
00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:59.050
So a black woman could be discriminated against in an employment position

617
00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:02.530
because there's this stereotype that she was be, um, aggressive,

618
00:34:02.531 --> 00:34:05.800
sexually promiscuous, all these other things, which don't,

619
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.420
aren't considered to be traits of white women. So there, you know,

620
00:34:10.421 --> 00:34:14.320
that that was a valid point that you can't really say, well,

621
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.130
this company employs white women. So there's no sex ed when it closed back men.

622
00:34:18.131 --> 00:34:22.210
So there's no racism if there is a prejudice specifically against black women.

623
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.800
So that needs to be in there. But unfortunately right from the start, um,

624
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.100
Kimberly Crenshaw was critical of liberalism. She said,

625
00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:32.170
it wasn't the way to go.

626
00:34:32.171 --> 00:34:35.950
She said that taking social significance out of categories, um,

627
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.660
sort of disempowers people,

628
00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:41.770
we need to have a less universal group orientated approach.

629
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.580
And she wanted to go with postmodernism, which is all about social constructs.

630
00:34:45.581 --> 00:34:49.840
And that really kind of shot itself in the foot because now everything is

631
00:34:49.841 --> 00:34:50.651
interpretive.

632
00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:54.100
Everything is theoretical first and then trying to make things fit it.

633
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.720
And then you get, um,

634
00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:00.520
people in opposition and in conflict and in competition with each other

635
00:35:00.521 --> 00:35:05.320
until you're, you're ending up with this, um, really combative, uh,

636
00:35:05.321 --> 00:35:09.850
approach at looking at what could be a useful theory of understanding how

637
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.750
different kinds of identity can, can compound each other.

638
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.500
<v 0>Yeah. And also you have to say then if you,</v>

639
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:19.870
if you want to take this identity first approach, you have to say that,

640
00:35:19.871 --> 00:35:23.380
say a black woman who doesn't agree with you is somehow got a false

641
00:35:23.381 --> 00:35:27.430
consciousness or she's wrong, or she's theorized it wrong because you, you know,

642
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.630
hot, the black woman or whatever position actually is.

643
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.460
You end up with somebody like Robin, you know,

644
00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:38.010
Robin de Angelo telling people what they should think. Really. Yes.

645
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.630
<v 1>This is, um, this is something I've been wanting to write about recently.</v>

646
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:44.460
I've just started reading, um,

647
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.420
a lot of black conservatives again in the American context,

648
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:53.310
because I want to see a range of how people are addressing racism.

649
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:56.400
And so I've been reading Shelby Steele, and I think he's attitude.

650
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:59.790
He really has got this kind of pull yourself up by the bootstraps attitude.

651
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.570
That's really typically conservative personal responsibility thing.

652
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.190
And I'm looking at him and I'm thinking,

653
00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:08.760
I think this for an individual is probably a really, really good attitude,

654
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.190
but it's no good for a social policy. You know,

655
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:16.260
conservatism isn't a black conservatism is the same as other kinds of

656
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:16.971
conservatives. I mean,

657
00:36:16.971 --> 00:36:20.850
it focuses too much on the individual's power and not enough on social,

658
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.740
on the responsibility of society.

659
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.480
So I think we do need to keep pointing out to people who say, well,

660
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:29.070
this is listen to black people,

661
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:32.760
listen to people of color that this is not a monolithic entity.

662
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:36.240
We have a number of black intellectuals and they are to be found all over the

663
00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:37.200
political spectrum.

664
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:42.690
What would really be helpful is if people try to look at the good and bad

665
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:45.690
points of all of them, and I think Cornell West does this quite well.

666
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.800
I really liked, um, reading his race matters because he he's.

667
00:36:49.801 --> 00:36:54.000
One of his sentences started my fellow Christian and friend Glenn Lowry.

668
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.880
And then he went through about how he's completely wrong about everything.

669
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.810
And I said, yes, this is what we need kind of attitude.

670
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:02.780
Do you think.

671
00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.320
<v 0>They are unfair to say that postmodernism is a new religion? Is that, uh,</v>

672
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.260
an apt characterization?

673
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.190
<v 1>Well, we, we did a talk on that and we said, no,</v>

674
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.900
but it does.

675
00:37:14.901 --> 00:37:18.560
I think fulfill the same social and psychological needs as religion,

676
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:23.870
I think for purposes of, um, the amount of power it can,

677
00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:27.230
they allow to have on over how other people think and speak,

678
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:31.130
it should be treated as equivalent to a religion in that it should be a

679
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.340
protected, people can believe it. They can say so they can live by it,

680
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.760
but they mustn't, um, impose it on other people.

681
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.120
<v 0>Right. Right. I find,</v>

682
00:37:41.121 --> 00:37:44.300
I must say I find the whole thing extremely pessimistic,

683
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.160
because it's got a lot of things built into it that make it very

684
00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:52.730
hard to course. Correct. So for example,

685
00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:57.590
this thing of double binds or this thing that, um, if you criticize it,

686
00:37:57.591 --> 00:37:59.540
you're just proving that you're a very bad person.

687
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:04.340
So it seems to be something that's going to go and go and go and then crash.

688
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.460
And I find it hard to be optimistic. You,

689
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.110
I think are a bit more optimistic than me,

690
00:38:09.111 --> 00:38:11.660
or at least you're pretending to be in your last chapter you went through when

691
00:38:11.661 --> 00:38:14.630
you said what was worth keeping and what wasn't honestly.

692
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.090
<v 1>I'm not as optimistic as I was a year ago when I finished writing that chapter</v>

693
00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:24.350
before we saw all the, um, um, protests that we're seeing now,

694
00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:29.120
I still don't think this can last for long because it's,

695
00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:33.620
it is too counter-intuitive and it's really, um,

696
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.670
sort of setting up against the majority,

697
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:39.100
which that's what worries me particularly.

698
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:43.000
I think we could actually see a pushback, um, on,

699
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:47.290
in the form of white identity politics and socially conservative ideas about

700
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.760
sex and gender.

701
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:53.710
And that this could actually set us back considerably with the amount of

702
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:58.240
progress that we've already made towards, um, racial and gender equality.

703
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.040
But I am optimist because I used to,

704
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:07.720
as a set of ideas that can survive for long term. And the more extreme it gets,

705
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:12.580
I think the more liberal lefties who aren't completely committed to social

706
00:39:12.581 --> 00:39:15.850
justice ideas, or having to admit that there is a problem, right.

707
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.880
And having to sort of distance themselves from it.

708
00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:23.800
So I seen the rise of a group that is sort of between me

709
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:28.120
and the social justice people. So they are now, um,

710
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.570
criticizing me that they're saying that I'm, I'm too dismissive of, um,

711
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.750
social justice, but they're also picking out the problems in social justice.

712
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.550
So I don't think that, um, little tribe really existed even, uh,

713
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.630
a couple of years ago.

714
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.070
So this is something in the leftist academic sphere,

715
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.960
which is already starting to distance itself in a way that it hadn't before.

716
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:52.540
So yeah, I think it will happen.

717
00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:57.070
I think it will gradually get marginalized unless there's

718
00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:01.030
something dramatic happens first. And I'm afraid that in America,

719
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.960
we could even see something equivalent to a civil war at the moment. I don't,

720
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.190
it's, it's escalating so fast. It's really quite worrying.

721
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.720
<v 0>Okay. I don't want it to end on such a pessimistic note.</v>

722
00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:17.250
So I want to ask you if you could pick the things from the

723
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.380
cynical theories, because quite often, you know, you're very,

724
00:40:19.381 --> 00:40:22.920
you're a very generous interlock is very, you, you, you often say, you know,

725
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.740
I really like this idea or I get something from this,

726
00:40:25.741 --> 00:40:27.690
or I think there was a really good insight here. Could you pick,

727
00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:29.670
say three things that you think, you know,

728
00:40:29.671 --> 00:40:32.970
you learned that you'd like to rescue from the conflagration if there is a

729
00:40:32.971 --> 00:40:33.840
conflagration?

730
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.340
<v 1>Um, so I think in theory, um,</v>

731
00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:43.260
the pointing out that the way we see sexuality has changed so much in the

732
00:40:43.261 --> 00:40:46.440
last century and we shouldn't be too confident that we're now getting it right.

733
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:52.080
That is something I could certainly agree with. Um, within critical race theory.

734
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.030
Hmm. That's a little bit more tricky because it's, so, um,

735
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.140
it it's so dogmatic at the moment and it's gone down the path of,

736
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.060
of Robin de Angelo. However,

737
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:07.170
I think that we need to point out that there are still some very good,

738
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.630
um, scholars looking at racial issues who are still accepted within that.

739
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:15.090
That's fair. Like I particularly, like, as I said,

740
00:41:15.091 --> 00:41:18.900
Michelle Alexander and she is still well-regarded by, um,

741
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.610
the majority of critical race theory.

742
00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:23.190
So I think there's space for some improvement there.

743
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.840
And then when we come to disability and fat studies, there's,

744
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:31.680
there's some good work in there where we're trying to sort of move the

745
00:41:31.681 --> 00:41:35.240
responsibility to be, um, you know,

746
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:38.180
with disabled people to be fully, um,

747
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.350
active in society from the disabled individual to society,

748
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:47.120
to make society more accommodating of disabled people. And, um,

749
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.620
when it comes to obesity to, to not consider people, uh,

750
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.720
people's worth in terms of their weight,

751
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:57.230
to such an extent that that actually is a stigma, which isn't helpful.

752
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.010
So we can, I think, support those ideas. Um,

753
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.730
fortunately there's been a lot of nonsense about how, you know,

754
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:07.460
being healthy as a social construct, but there,

755
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:11.930
there are good intentions in there. And I think if you've got, um, shared goals,

756
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:15.710
but different methods, that's, that's something you can work with.

757
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.970
<v 0>Well, that's a nice place to stop. Thank you so much, Helen.</v>

758
00:42:18.971 --> 00:42:20.500
That was a great discussion. I really enjoyed it.
