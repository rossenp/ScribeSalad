00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.340
<v 0>Our final speaker against the motion identity politics is tearing</v>

2
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.880
society apart. David Lammy, labor MP for Tottenham.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.890
One of Parliament's most prominent campaigners for social justice

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.750
famously led the recent campaign for the Windrush generation to be granted

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.430
British citizenship. He's fought for justice for the Grenfell tower families.

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.470
And of course has run the high profile campaign calling on Oxbridge to

7
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:35.940
improve access for students from underrepresented and disadvantaged

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.430
backgrounds. David, the floor is yours.

9
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.270
<v 2>So I'm listening to the speakers and I'm</v>

11
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.690
thinking about a young David Lammy

12
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.050
growing up in Tottenham in the 1970s.

13
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.570
It's the young David Lammy that looks like Michael Jackson and wants to be

14
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.950
Michael Jackson.

15
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.140
And that young David Alami would never have believed

16
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.140
that the tide of human progress would bring

17
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:22.340
me here in front of you able to

18
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.390
articulate, to speak, to have the confidence to do that.

19
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.130
I was also thinking of another young,

20
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:35.450
but a bit older David lobby who walked into the house of commons

21
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.440
at the beginning of that Tony Blair government.

22
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.100
By that point, I look more like Denzel Washington.

23
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.830
This was a period of consensus.

24
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.240
<v 1>Politics.</v>

25
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.900
<v 2>Clinton, Blair,</v>

26
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.990
new labor things were coming together.

27
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.120
We had 10 consecutive quarters of growth and the

28
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.790
kind of cool Brittania emerged,

29
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.200
where there were a lot of drugs as well and things, but you know,

30
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.250
dance music, but people loved one another.

31
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.980
Here I am 2019.

32
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.850
I now look like forest Whitaker

33
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.250
Tomorrow.

34
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:35.630
People will be voting in the European elections and

35
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:40.190
many will vote for what I see as

36
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.750
hard, right? Parties and positions.

37
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.810
This is an age of Trump,

38
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.790
of Farage of Jacob Reese, [inaudible] of Boris Johnson.

39
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.170
And we are accusing identity politics of

40
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:01.720
tearing society.

41
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.100
The great story of the 20th century

42
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.140
was probably democracy,

43
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.230
but if there is a second story theme that ox

44
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.950
that century surely it is rights.

45
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.160
And that by the end of that century,

46
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.350
so many human beings who started off at the beginning of the 20th

47
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:32.184
century,

48
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
subjugated oppressed could actually begin to self

49
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.350
actualize in their own lifetimes.

50
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.750
Women got the vote and with the invention of the

51
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.050
pill control over their own bodies,

52
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.740
ethnic minorities, colonized,

53
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:57.210
you remember those pink bits of the Atlas over so much of the world

54
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.760
broke off because of the powerful words and behavior of

55
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:07.680
people like Gandy from that colonization workers

56
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.440
came from being exploited,

57
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.710
burst movements like the labor party.

58
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.320
And I still believe at its best,

59
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.000
the best progressive cause in our country and

60
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:25.350
now same sex marriage and those who are

61
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.580
LGBT taking their place when it's only in

62
00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:31.440
1967,

63
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.990
that you could be imprisoned because of the person that you

64
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:39.480
love. That is a remarkable story.

65
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.010
The story that is the story of the 20th century.

66
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.900
And of course that is a story about identity because

67
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.790
when Martin Luther King spoke and he talked about judging

68
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:57.480
somebody by the character

69
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.370
of their soul, not by the color of their skin,

70
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.650
have we arrived at that?

71
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.480
And even though that was a goal, even though that was a goal,

72
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.070
he didn't park his identity at the door to get that

73
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:14.904
goal.

74
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.680
And neither did Harvey milk fighting for gay rights in

75
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:22.050
San Francisco and beyond,

76
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.730
and all those fighting for disability rights. So for me,

77
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.180
identity politics is about empathy.

78
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.560
It is about dignity and my God,

79
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.580
I look Nigel Farage in the face and I say,

80
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:40.020
it's about compassion,

81
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.980
compassion for your fellow human B.

82
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.900
So we stand buying that progress despite all that we

83
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.040
have to do.

84
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.240
And now in a period where those on the right dismiss,

85
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.050
when I raised concerns about who should

86
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:07.760
lead the inquiry into those poor people,

87
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:12.250
that right, desperate knit included a friend of mine,

88
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.300
the 20th floor of Grenfell tower burned to death,

89
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.550
a young woman called Khadija se.

90
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.830
And I raised questions about who should lead that inquiry because

91
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.160
actually in the role that I play in public life,

92
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:29.370
someone should say this,

93
00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:33.820
it has to another white male

94
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.700
privileged class judge,

95
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.960
not because he can't do a good job,

96
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.210
Joe scam and did a good job when he led the riots into the Brixton riots.

97
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.570
But is there not in Britain in 2019,

98
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.810
an ethnic minority lawyer,

99
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.280
or even a woman that could take that role.

100
00:06:57.281 --> 00:06:59.920
And I say that at a point in our country,

101
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.360
we're only 7% of the judges are from an ethnic minority

102
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.670
background. And we have one,

103
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.980
one woman on our Supreme court progress so

104
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:15.040
much more, so much more to do.

105
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.380
And those on the left of course,

106
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.810
class and economic equality inequality

107
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.030
have to be challenged. That's the basis of my politics.

108
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.380
But those who fight for rights today do not stand

109
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:40.300
opposed to issues of inequality

110
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.890
that exists in our society.

111
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.300
Just as there were LGBT people who set up solid,

112
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.910
these parity funds to fight for the minors.

113
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.830
You can be alongside those in that battle for

114
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.690
against inequality in our society. And yes,

115
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:00.700
there are moments when it goes too far.

116
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.440
If you're tweeting or writing white people or trash

117
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.360
kill all men that is identity politics that I would not want to

118
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.370
associate myself with,

119
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.270
but let us be clear on the proposition.

120
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.060
Let us really single in on what may be tearing

121
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.850
our society apart.

122
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.740
Populism might well be tearing our society

123
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.933
apart,

124
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.250
populism on the hard right and populism on the hard left

125
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.430
austerity cuts,

126
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.290
brutal cuts to local authorities right up and down the country.

127
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.580
The biggest North South divide since 1911,

128
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:52.570
that may be tearing our society apart,

129
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.453
grim poverty,

130
00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.060
chronic housing conditions right across this city.

131
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.600
That means so many people who could be in this audience.

132
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.160
Aren't in this audience that could be tearing our society

133
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.040
apart, gross inequality

134
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.100
with 44% of the goo case wealth owned by just

135
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:19.380
10% of our population.

136
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.450
50% of the land in the UK owned by 1% of the

137
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:29.040
population that could be the proposition that could be tearing

138
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.600
our society apart.

139
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.550
But instead this proposition asks you blame the Bangladeshi

140
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:36.384
woman,

141
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.730
blame the trans man play me individual with disability,

142
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.610
and then they say their victims.

143
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:49.290
And we heard that language from Laila victim hood.

144
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.900
The victim hood that is being manipulated in our country is a victim

145
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.500
hood. That's being peddled today by Nigel Farage.

146
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.550
It is not the victim hood of the people I just described.

147
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.540
So reject this proposition.

148
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.570
It is not tearing our society apart.

149
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.710
It's an arc that begins with people like

150
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.820
Mandela, Martin Luther King Gandy,

151
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.010
Emily Pancras stand alongside it because in the age

152
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.120
that we are in, there is a big difference between dignity,

153
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.193
compassion,

154
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.450
and human rights and the populism that would rip our country a

155
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.733
Sunday.

156
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.170
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
