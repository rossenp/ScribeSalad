00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 1>You hanging in there.</v>

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.560
I have not been off of my property more or less in two weeks.

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.300
So it's crazy to see another human being.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.720
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think this is healthy for us. I know this lockdown.</v>

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.770
Everybody's so weirded out. He want to run into people, walking dogs.

7
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.200
Like they don't want the dogs to get close to each other. Like, hi,

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.180
everyone's across the street. Hi.

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
<v 1>And I'm a hugger, right? And we're in California.</v>

10
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.610
So I'm a hugger in California in all of my instincts around.

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.240
<v 0>Everything's all messed up. Everyone's confused. Here's the big question.</v>

12
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.740
How long does it take before we normalize and go back? Like,

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.700
let's say the end of July, everyone announces,

14
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.540
we've got this thing locked down. We have a viable treatment.

15
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.270
It's no different than the flu that gets you,

16
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:49.680
this chlorine queen with the pack or whatever the current

17
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.190
treatment is. Yeah. When the people start hugging again.

18
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.170
<v 1>It's going to be crazy. I mean,</v>

19
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:58.230
I think that the idea is we're all so starved for touch. Yeah.

20
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.870
Like we're going to have a Jubilee.

21
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:03.660
Like you've never seen people are going to greet each other with tongues who are

22
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:04.830
almost like just acquaintance.

23
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.910
<v 0>I think that's a good idea.</v>

24
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.670
There's still colds and cooties and all that other stuff.

25
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.180
<v 1>But I think, I think everybody's losing their. They definitely.</v>

26
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.750
<v 0>Are.</v>

27
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.710
I've been talking to a lot of friends that are on the I'm extremely cautious

28
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.360
side. Let's say that. And you know,

29
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.210
they're not going anywhere and they're wearing gloves and masks.

30
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.970
When they step outside their house to go do something in the backyard.

31
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.450
And then they put the glove and mask down and they spray it with Lysol and they

32
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.320
come inside and.

33
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.050
<v 1>It's not healthy. And it is also healthy. I mean,</v>

34
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.020
the idea that we have not been tested in so long,

35
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.570
it's good to remember also that the stuff is live

36
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:46.170
and real, and it has always been live and real. And you know,

37
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.990
if it was possible to live without this stuff, that would be one thing.

38
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.060
But the 75 year nap that we've been in since 1945 is itself the

39
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.430
greatest threat to all of us. Right. And, and,

40
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.420
and our preparedness is just a wonderful indicator, um,

41
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.690
where you actually get to see, this is the quality of your experts.

42
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:05.250
This is the quality of your leadership.

43
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.330
This is what they look like when put under stress. That's.

44
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.520
<v 0>True. Right? That is a good, that's a good thing.</v>

45
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.340
And I'm impressed with the medical community.

46
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.660
I'm impressed with the people that are recognizing that this is a huge problem,

47
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.860
not so impressed with the administration of a lot of these hospitals that

48
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.630
haven't prepared in terms of like masks and ventilators and a lot of these other

49
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.510
things, not so impressed with politicians, but also,

50
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.570
it just seems like every one, like you said,

51
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.280
was in this nap state and hadn't really been tested and really

52
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.990
globally, no one had been tested since the pandemic of 1918,

53
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:44.850
like this right. 68.

54
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.890
<v 1>Uh, which I had,</v>

55
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.900
I had the Hong Kong flu and 57 were sort of the best parallels

56
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:52.560
to this. You've.

57
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.900
<v 0>Got the Hong Kong flu and 16, I had the Hong Kong.</v>

58
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.020
<v 1>Flu and was sick as a dog, San Francisco.</v>

59
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.420
I was like 3, 2, 3, 4.

60
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.570
I think it went from 68 to 78 somebody. Oh yeah. And I was in San Francisco.

61
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.070
My grandma had to come up from LA to care for me. Um, it was,

62
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.490
it was bad. It was like one of my earliest memories. Yeah.

63
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.010
And so 68 and 57,

64
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:22.750
I think are the best comparables to this

65
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.880
before we go back to 1918. And almost nobody remembers these things.

66
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.420
Like it's very weird. Many people had never heard of the Hong Kong flu.

67
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.950
When I started talking about the fact that I'd had.

68
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.100
<v 0>Vaguely remembered it until you just said it. And then I'm like,</v>

69
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.120
I'm slightly older than you.

70
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.320
<v 1>Right? Yeah. I'm 52.</v>

71
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.000
<v 0>I'm 54. Yeah. I don't remember the Hong Kong flu, but I do.</v>

72
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.490
You know what I mean? Like I don't remember it personally. No.

73
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.800
<v 1>But you as a health geek, um, are, are up on these sorts of things.</v>

74
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.080
And so you understand the ways in which, you know, for example,

75
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:56.830
you can have a flu where the, I guess the cytokine storm, you know, is your,

76
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.240
your, the threat from your immunity,

77
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.540
your immune system is like bigger than the virus itself.

78
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.820
There are all of these various weird things that happen.

79
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.470
But I think that the let's call it the big nap. The big nap is itself.

80
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.190
The greatest threat to us. And this is, this is bad,

81
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.430
but it is also a shot across our bow. And you know,

82
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:19.030
this is what was happening in my mind when I was on here talking about the twin

83
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:23.260
nuclei problem of selling Adam, we didn't stop history.

84
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:26.890
It's not like we're past the atomic war. Like we figured that out. We just,

85
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.870
we just hit the pause button for a little while and we hit.

86
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.880
<v 0>Yeah. The fear is also that nefarious players will take this</v>

87
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.970
opportunity to erode civil law, civil rights,

88
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.130
to erode civil liberties and then China to gain power in the U

89
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:47.050
S market to gobble up a lot of stocks while everything is down and try to

90
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:51.940
increase their stake in our economy and try to push the, you know.

91
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.710
<v 1>China's got its hands lovingly around our throat because our elite have been</v>

92
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:01.330
moving into greater and greater states of China dependence. Right.

93
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.740
And so I think this is what the community refers to as breath play.

94
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.850
And I don't like it.

95
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.600
<v 0>I get plays like he kind of like half choke somebody. Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.660
How do you know that? What I don't like the fact that, you know.

97
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.350
<v 1>I went to MIT, MIT is wildly at the,</v>

98
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.580
so many white wire geeks, uh, and,

99
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.060
and ask these into that somebody said, lots of rules.

100
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.710
<v 0>What's an Aspy as far as.</v>

101
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.500
<v 1>Serious people, right? Lots of rules. They like, they like,</v>

102
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.860
they love rules because they're hope because to do all of this stuff safely,

103
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:37.320
you would have to have a huge hierarchy of rules. And my claim is,

104
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:39.490
is that China is,

105
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.140
they supply so much of our stuff. We've moved all of our,

106
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.430
uh, you know, manufacturing base into these crazy supply chains.

107
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.830
And we are completely dependent on a strategic rival. And you know,

108
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.870
China's very careful if you remember, when they,

109
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.410
when they hosted the Olympics to have these amazingly impressive displays

110
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.940
that are always friendly.

111
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.720
But what they're really saying is we have our together.

112
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.690
And our system was hackable. It was open as law. For example,

113
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:15.980
if you have a company that has, um, a duty to its shareholders,

114
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.900
the directors of the company must do what is EV whatever is in the best interest

115
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.180
of the shareholders and everything else doesn't matter.

116
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.100
Then you can have a situation where a director has to move things to China,

117
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.170
because that isn't the best interest of the shareholders.

118
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.850
Even if it's an absolutely not in the best interest of the United States.

119
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.230
This is what Ralph Ghamari,

120
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.670
who used to head the Sloan foundation once said an address I was at at the

121
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:43.760
national academy of sciences. He just said, as a director,

122
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.900
I am incentivized to do exactly the wrong thing for the United States of

123
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.560
America. So I'm going to put one hat on and tell you as an American,

124
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.500
we must not move all of this over to China.

125
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.350
And then I'm going to put my director's hat on,

126
00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:00.740
and I'm going to vote to move everything over to China because I have no choice.

127
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.500
And so, you know, in essence, the smart, good people, all 11 of them, uh,

128
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.521
were always fighting.

129
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:11.810
This thing about you cannot become China dependent.

130
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.090
And in, during the big nap,

131
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.320
there was no way to make this argument convincingly. You couldn't say, look,

132
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:22.820
we have a serious strategic problem by your continuing moves

133
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.260
to bring China in as the solution to every equation we can't balance.

134
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.050
And that, that is really the problem is,

135
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:34.970
is that there wasn't any ability to say we are way too dependent on a

136
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:37.490
strategic rival. You saw this at the beginning of the pandemic,

137
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:41.480
everyone was afraid of what? I don't want to appear xenophobic.

138
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.930
I don't want to appear like chicken little, right? And so all of our friends,

139
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.060
the nutcases, the marginal weirdos,

140
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.830
the supposedly Grifters and gadflies are the people who most got this one,

141
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:52.820
right? And early,

142
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.080
and all the respectable people like Nancy Pelosi telling people,

143
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:59.960
please go to Chinatown to celebrate the Chinese new year.

144
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:03.740
Bill de Blasio of New York saying, despite Corona, coronavirus, get out there,

145
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.040
let you know, don't lead your lives. Don't don't let this thing hold you back.

146
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.380
These people need to resign. Nancy Pelosi should resign.

147
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.710
It's one thing to say, we don't have enough information about this.

148
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:20.240
It's another thing to say. Um, take the information that's coming in,

149
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:23.930
disregard it and get back in there and keep fueling the economy.

150
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.800
This is exactly our leadership class, their problem.

151
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.140
They think about this in short-term economics, the,

152
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.410
the long-term implications of us all sheltering in place.

153
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.870
Nobody can compute the consequences of it.

154
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.260
Not one person in the world knows what happens when you run this experiment.

155
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.240
<v 0>Yeah. It's a new thing. Right? The maiden America argument was always like,</v>

156
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:47.300
sort of a frivolous, almost seen a phobic. Like,

157
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.730
why do you want things made in America? What do you care? Do you not?

158
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.230
Do not like people from other countries?

159
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.850
Do you not want to buy things from other countries?

160
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:57.540
It was like this made of made in America thing was people disregarded it in a

161
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:01.740
lot of ways. But when you realize that all of our medical supplies,

162
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.550
like so much of our electronics, so much of all the,

163
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:10.200
the stuff that you need to kind of keep things exactly the way they are,

164
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.270
it's cheaper to make it over there because they will like what we saw with

165
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:16.104
Foxconn,

166
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.780
where they put nets around the building to keep people from jumping off.

167
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.480
And the weirdest thing was people trying to argue that the suicide rate at

168
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.130
Foxconn was essentially the same as the suicide rate in the general population.

169
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.530
Well, you ever heard that argument? Like, what the are you talking about?

170
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.620
That's where they work. There's nets around where they work.

171
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.090
Because so many people where they work,

172
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:43.290
jump off the building to end their life because their life sucks that bad that

173
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.390
they killed themselves at work. Do you know rare?

174
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:49.860
It is to kill yourself at work, probably pretty rare. You know how common it is,

175
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.500
where you have to put nets around the building. You're like, look,

176
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.350
we're getting really tired of people going to the roof and jumping off because

177
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:57.840
it's the easiest way to kill yourself. They're going to get more creative.

178
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.573
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.650
The problem is we are all hooked up to this need for cheap

180
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.430
products profits. When we can't figure out how to innovate enough,

181
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:10.620
to actually create the juice in our own system.

182
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.410
And therefore we have to rationally. You were going to say, no.

183
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.130
<v 0>I was just gonna say, I mean, also we've gotten into this idea of every year.</v>

184
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:19.200
We have to have a newer, better piece of electronics.

185
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.080
Like if you had to go the rest of your life with an iPhone 11,

186
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:23.130
how much would you suffer?

187
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.860
<v 1>Um, not that much,</v>

188
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.240
although I would say that many of us are not that excited about the next phone.

189
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.060
That, that, that itself is an antiquated thing.

190
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.830
<v 0>I'm saying, it's like, why can't they make it so that you can just fix this?</v>

191
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.670
Yeah. You know what I mean? Like w who the fixes their phone?

192
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:43.500
You don't fix your phone. You bring it in.

193
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.353
<v 1>You can get.</v>

194
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.450
<v 0>Well, not Depression-era thinking. It's like,</v>

195
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.880
why can't things be sustained?

196
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.253
<v 1>No, no, I,</v>

197
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.130
the plant's obsolescence and the need to constantly update so that you,

198
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.700
you're never, it's a tricky problem.

199
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.230
If you need growth to power your system, then in a weird way,

200
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.580
it makes sense not to build the optimal phone, right?

201
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.670
Because if you were to build the optimal phone and then people stopped renewing

202
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.940
everything, your systems, then your system weirdly breaks down.

203
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.940
So it makes sense that the level of the phone that you wouldn't want to do that,

204
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.240
but weirdly in aggregate, if you can't start innovate,

205
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.690
if you can't figure out how to restart innovation in a big way.

206
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.800
Now you're stuck with either having to Le learn to live in steady state,

207
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:32.760
which none of us, we Americans have no program for living in steady state.

208
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.260
We need growth.

209
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.200
That was the whole point of the embedded growth obligation idea that it's

210
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:41.070
suffused throughout every institution, every pension plan assumes growth. Right.

211
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.020
Right. All right.

212
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.100
So now we have this problem where we don't have the growth and we need the

213
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:49.020
growth. And then in a weird way,

214
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:52.110
the planned obsolescence is like fake growth.

215
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.860
It means that we're going to rebuy our phones even as if they were now

216
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:57.700
highly innovative.

217
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.840
So there's like a weird way in which we become dependent on nonsense.
