00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. There could be a bunch of things that played on.</v>

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.640
<v 1>Well, you didn't run when you met me. So, no, I appreciate that. I mean,</v>

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.080
I know we're probably scheduled to do this interview, so you couldn't, but.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.080
<v 0>I was looking forward to this. Why would I run &lt;laugh&gt;? I mean, I was,</v>

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.880
I was impressed by your intensity, but I expected that in a way. I mean, I just,

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.270
I don't see how you could be a race car driver and not be intense,

7
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.790
especially be a woman and a race car driver and not be.

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.550
<v 1>Intense. Well, that's nothing I even thought about until I was like 14. Um,</v>

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.910
for the first few years of racing late life, late way, late in life.

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630
I didn't even think about being a girl out there.

11
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.070
It wasn't until I had cameras following me around my schools and stuff that I

12
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:39.790
was like, right. Maybe this is, and then they start asking you about it.

13
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:42.580
They're like, what's it like to be a girl? Like. I never really, I don't know.

14
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:45.020
Really. Haven't really thought about that. Um, how many.

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.853
<v 0>Other girls do it?</v>

16
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.860
<v 1>I mean, there are various girls here and there, but you know, like.</v>

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.300
<v 0>In all of NASCAR, how many women are, are racing? Oh, um.</v>

18
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.760
<v 1>At my level.</v>

19
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.580
<v 0>No. Yes. Zero. Yeah. That's crazy. Oh, that's pretty crazy. I don't know.</v>

20
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.250
Yeah. That's crazy used to it. Wow. Take it from me. I'm on the, if you'll ask.

21
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.250
<v 1>Me, what's it like to be a girl in racing? I'm like, uh, well,</v>

22
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.650
I don't really know what it's like to be a guy. So, you know,

23
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.370
I only have my perspective.

24
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.850
<v 0>That's true. You.</v>

25
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.730
<v 1>Know? I mean, I don't like being a girl versus a guy. What's the difference?</v>

26
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.610
I don't know. What's it like to be a guy?

27
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.970
<v 0>Uh, yeah, it probably be different, but I think that like, what's it like to be,</v>

28
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.800
be a woman? That's the only woman who's in NASCAR.

29
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:29.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; at your level. That's that's a valid question. I mean,

30
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:32.280
that's crazy. How, how does everybody else treat you?

31
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.720
<v 1>Yeah, that, that, that really is the,</v>

32
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.920
the main question I can't answer because I I'm not them. And I, right.

33
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.280
I know that, um, from, from enough experience now,

34
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.230
cause I used to not really look into it much. And in,

35
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.070
in the IndyCar days you couldn't hit each other, you know, you really, I mean,

36
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:50.550
it was, you know, you could block and things like that.

37
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.990
So there was some guys out there that were and I didn't like 'em, but you know,

38
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.350
sometimes every driver has some Dr.

39
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:58.870
Some other drivers that they don't really get along with. And so,

40
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.500
but in NASCAR you can hit each other and it's, you have bumpers and, um,

41
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.580
which is really cool, but it also isn't cool because if somebody wants to do it,

42
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.820
they can. So what would I say?

43
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.740
I would say that they don't wanna get passed by a girl and you know what I don't

44
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:17.460
either. Is that weird? No, I really don't. I mean, I've driven,

45
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.860
I've raced with girls and I don't, I don't like it.

46
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.290
<v 0>So do you &lt;laugh&gt; do you feel differently when a guy passes you a girl passes?</v>

47
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.430
You probably yes. Yes. In what way? Well, you know,

48
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.350
you just go internally that I'm.

49
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.190
<v 1>Like, I can't believe my car isn't faster right now.</v>

50
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.790
&lt;laugh&gt; this, this sucks.

51
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.830
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;. But if it's a guy that passes, but then there are.</v>

52
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.990
<v 1>Other cars that are not good that I'm like, you know,</v>

53
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:43.830
come on the radio and I'll be like, uh,

54
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.260
I just want you to see that what car past me and how bad my car is out now,

55
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:52.660
right now. Um, so it happens with guys too, but you know, I don't know.

56
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:57.460
It's just a cultural norm that girls aren't good and allow,

57
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.040
you know, aren't very good. And that they, they, um, somewhat don't belong.

58
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.160
And I get like the little bit of animosity at first,

59
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.560
but I would've thought that people would've got got used to it a little bit more

60
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.394
than they did.

61
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.320
<v 0>So, but you have that cultural animosity, you were saying a little bit. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 1>Yeah. But, and.</v>

63
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.640
<v 0>I don't know where it comes from, but when you say that it's a,</v>

64
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.440
it's a cultural norm. That girls aren't good.

65
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.350
You don't think about that about yourself? No. Yeah. See, I knew that. No,

66
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.750
there's you don't have any doubts. No, I.

67
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.910
<v 1>Look at everyone out there. I'm like,</v>

68
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.990
you suck because of this and I'm gonna beat you cuz of that and right. Oh God,

69
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:30.570
I hate you.

70
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.390
<v 0>And you don't think because I'm a girl I'm not as good as them. No, not at all.</v>

71
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.110
So why would you think that about the other girl? I don't know.

72
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.830
<v 1>I just did. Cause I'm not used to it. Right. You just,</v>

73
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.060
&lt;affirmative&gt; something you're not used to. Yeah. That.

74
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.860
<v 0>Makes sense. Yeah. Well also it's like, you're unique. I.</v>

75
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.901
<v 1>Mean,</v>

76
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:47.020
what if you were out there in the gym and some girl comes and picks up more

77
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.580
weight than you and you're like, oh, that's weird. I'd be like, that is on.

78
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.700
<v 0>Roys. &lt;laugh&gt; she's.</v>

79
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.860
<v 1>Gotta be, she probably would be. But some Amazon.</v>

80
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.580
<v 0>Some freak, some genetic freak. I try to sign her.</v>

81
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.020
I just bring her to the C don't listen. Kidding.

82
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.010
Do you know how to throw a punch? Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I don't know. I think, um,

83
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.690
I think we all have, uh, cultural prejudices. Yeah. You know,

84
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.170
to a certain extent whether we admit it or not. And you know, maybe you're not,

85
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.810
uh, a bigot. Maybe you're just,

86
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.290
maybe you just have reservations and you're pleasantly surprised when people

87
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.530
surpass those expectations. Yeah. You know, but I would think that, uh,

88
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.970
you would experience,

89
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.840
it's probably more discrimination as a woman, uh, than,

90
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.360
I mean, if you think about a woman doing almost any other job,

91
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:34.200
like if you're telling me you're the only woman that does that,

92
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.240
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you're at this intense macho job,

93
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.430
this is a intense job. And &lt;affirmative&gt; mean you'd going 200 miles an hour.

94
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.990
BA nah, everybody's, it's nuts. That's a crazy job.

95
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.630
And you're out there at the top of the food chain with all these men. Yeah.

96
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.910
I would, I would imagine there's two things that happen.

97
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:57.350
There's a bunch of guys that treat you with respect.

98
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.390
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they're like, wow. They'll like impressed. Yep. Yeah.

99
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.180
They're cool with you. They're like, she's one of us. That's right.

100
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.700
And then there's a few that are just mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and those are just

101
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.133
encourageable. Mm.

102
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.740
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; man, the amount of times I wish I was good at taking people out.</v>

103
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.060
I wish people knew how hard it was to actually take someone out on track.

104
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.100
It's not that easy. Yeah. Because.

105
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.260
<v 0>You can risk yourself. Exactly.</v>

106
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.130
<v 1>Yeah. And if your car doesn't handle very well,</v>

107
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.930
you can't get close enough to 'em. If you could, you would just move the air,

108
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.770
which is almost like hitting 'em and get 'em out of the way.

109
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.810
But sometimes the car doesn't handle well enough. So like,

110
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:36.290
you'd have to just bomb in there and God willing,

111
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.650
you hit 'em to get you to slow down and then they go sailing and you keep going,

112
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.623
but it's risk.

113
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.200
<v 0>That's a rare moment, right? Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.560
<v 1>Have you done that before? Oh, I've tried to take people. I suck at it.</v>

115
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.400
I absolutely suck at it. I've taken myself out like three times trying to do it.

116
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.600
I mean, look, I'll be the lamb. I don't mind to make a point. Um.

117
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.800
<v 0>So you do that to make a point, if someone's.</v>

118
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.720
<v 1>Driving like a Dick. Yeah. Look at you. You're like, yeah. Oh yeah. There was a,</v>

119
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.640
one was the one that was the most sad was, um, uh,

120
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.600
it was a couple years ago.

121
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:10.400
It was at Martinsville and this is when something was going down with,

122
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:14.400
it was Matt Kenzie and Joey Lagano. And it was during the chase,

123
00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:18.030
which is the last 10 races of the season. Then they were in the chase,

124
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.390
Matt and Joey and, um, Joey had made it so that Matt couldn't get in.

125
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:24.510
Cuz he took him out a week earlier, a week or two earlier.

126
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.150
And then they got to Martinsville and it's a very, very small, short track.

127
00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:29.710
It's just a half a mile. And so, um, it,

128
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.430
it's easy to kind of be able to attack if you want to.

129
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.110
And so he just straight took him out and um,

130
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.500
there's a whole big hoopla about it.

131
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.660
People up in arms thought it was totally unfair. And um, anyway,

132
00:06:42.661 --> 00:06:47.020
during the same race, some hits me, takes, spins me out.

133
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.540
And so I come back and I'm a lap down or something cuz he spins me out and I go

134
00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:53.540
to take him out and I just sail off into the corner.

135
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.570
He manages to kind of keep going. I spin again cuz I'm horrible at it.

136
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.050
And uh, turns out that, you know,

137
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.690
I get a $50,000 fine because I am, um,

138
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.770
I'm not racing for a position cuz I was a lap down. Um,

139
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.450
and they applied that because that was also the same race that Matt and Joey had

140
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:17.010
their big thing. And I think maybe Joey was leading or something like that.

141
00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:19.600
I think he was leading and it was, was on a restart. Um,

142
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.320
so they weren't racing for position either.

143
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.640
So that was kind of like their rule that they put forth to make for.

144
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.480
I mean Matt probably got a hundred or $200,000 fine. But um, there I am,

145
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.160
you know, not the I'm definitely screwed in this scenario,

146
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.560
so I got find 50 grand for it and I'm the one that's out. So.

147
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.470
<v 0>If you're this other guy racing for a position,</v>

148
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.510
then it's okay to bump into each other. Apparently.

149
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.230
<v 1>Yeah. So really you're the one that's screwed because if you're racing,</v>

150
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.230
if someone takes you out and then you're still racing for a position now you're

151
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:52.550
gonna have to be potentially, you know,

152
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.310
putting yourself in another position to get taken out when they started it.

153
00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.540
There's a no win for the person that's being aggressed by the

154
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:01.374
aggressor.

155
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.780
<v 0>Was it always legal to bump into each other?</v>

156
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.460
<v 1>Uh, it's gone kind of through waves of different rules, but yeah.</v>

157
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:09.290
I mean it is legal.

158
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.060
<v 0>Well when whenever a big accident happens and there's a tragedy,</v>

159
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.900
I would assume that that's when they tighten down the rules. Mm.

160
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.940
<v 1>Sometimes, sometimes not sometimes.</v>

161
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.020
<v 0>Sometimes not. They just accept.</v>

162
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.730
<v 1>That. It just happens sometimes.</v>

163
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:23.210
It's just usually if there's something like that, that happens.

164
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.850
It's not from one person's action that it's maybe a chain of events that leads

165
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.770
to something like that.

166
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.730
<v 0>It's one of the rare jobs that you do. That's a sport. Uh,</v>

167
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.170
one of the rare sports where the potential for death is always there. Yeah.

168
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.970
<v 1>That's true. It is true is.</v>

169
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.840
<v 0>Of the reasons why you decided like enough, enough, I.</v>

170
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.440
<v 1>Am not a Daredevil. Like I am not a Daredevil.</v>

171
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.360
I went bungee jumping and that is the bravest thing I've ever done otherwise.

172
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.960
And I only did it because I am afraid of Heights.

173
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:53.400
So I just needed to know that if I had to conquer a fear.

174
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.360
<v 0>I could, well, what's your definition of a Daredevil.</v>

175
00:08:55.361 --> 00:08:56.640
You're you're a race driver.

176
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.560
<v 1>Do things or you can potentially get hurt. &lt;laugh&gt; I'm not though.</v>

177
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.773
That's true.

178
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.160
<v 0>Yeah. But you're a race car driver.</v>

179
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.160
<v 1>I know, but I'm a methodical driver. I'm methodical.</v>

180
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.920
I don't go out there and just, you know,

181
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.360
hold it wide open until the car does something and then I'm like, oh,

182
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:14.910
better lift. Now. I'm like, I'm methodical driver. So I.

183
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.790
<v 0>Build up, well, I think what you're saying is you're not stupid. Ah, thank.</v>

184
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.230
<v 1>You. But you're definitely, that's very nice. You thats like a really,</v>

185
00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:23.630
really nice way to say that.

186
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.190
<v 0>Yeah. You're not dumb, but you're definitely a Daredevil. Thank you. Well,</v>

187
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.350
I'm you have to be, I'm not, there's no way you can not be. I'm.

188
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.830
<v 1>Just not I'm serious. Have two really knows me. Knows that I'm not brave.</v>

189
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.460
<v 0>Wow. That's so crazy. I know it's I, I think you're talking crazy,</v>

190
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.820
a crazy talk over.

191
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.660
<v 1>Here. Well, you know, it's true. I,</v>

192
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.300
I just have been grooming this talent since I was 10 and 26 years later.

193
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.540
I'm I'm okay.

194
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.140
<v 0>With it. I think it it's both of those things,</v>

195
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.860
but I think there's no doubt that you're a brave person. There's.

196
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.010
<v 1>Actually, and my first time in a go-kart was horrible.</v>

197
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.673
<v 0>What were you? Three.</v>

198
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.290
<v 1>10 &lt;Laugh&gt; 10. And my sister was eight. My dad built the go-karts.</v>

199
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.010
There was a big parking lot out back. So we got like spray hands, WD four,

200
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.890
whatever pop cans. I don't know, whatever. Yeah. I grew up in the Midwest.

201
00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:13.130
So pop, um,

202
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.840
and set 'em up in a big circle for my sister and I to go drive around,

203
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.000
drive our go-karts for the first time. And um, my dad made,

204
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.000
there was a little mistake with the brake pedal and so it stopped working and

205
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.120
um, since I'm 10 and I'm really young and dumb and I don't know what I'm doing,

206
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.160
young dumb and broke, I guess I was. Yeah, like the song goes. Um, but I, um,

207
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.950
I went to hit the brake. It wasn't there.

208
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.390
So instead of just spinning out or continuing to turn,

209
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.550
I just went straight and I was headed for, um, trailer,

210
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.430
like kind of a higher elevated trailer, which would've resulted in decapitation.

211
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.630
And I swerved at the last second and hit a concrete wall and I like go flying

212
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.230
and my arm lays back on the,

213
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.020
on the muffler and my cool puffy a it burns.

214
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.180
And like I bruises all up my legs and on my arms. And uh,

215
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.740
that was my first time in a go-kart within, you know,

216
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.940
five or 10 minutes of being out there. And so, um,

217
00:11:06.941 --> 00:11:09.340
my dad just got a new one and built it and we went racing.

218
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.220
So maybe I am really brave. I don't know. You're right.

219
00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:16.780
Maybe it's I always felt like an Indy car to some degree.

220
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.730
I wasn't brave. Cuz people were willing to do things that were Hmm.

221
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.650
Perceivably more brave. But I also, I did describe them as dumb you're right.

222
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:28.650
Yeah. So I, I, you're probably a little right. And I'm maybe a little right too,

223
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:29.370
but you're right.

224
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.171
<v 0>I think you're definitely brave,</v>

225
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:33.730
but I think there's definitely a line where bravery becomes stupid because the

226
00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:35.050
risk outweighs the reward.

227
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.650
<v 1>100% &lt;Laugh&gt;</v>
