00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.260
<v 2>It's a very, you know, it, it's, it's a very hard path and, and you know,</v>

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:11.910
one of the app Urus place for me to go in the saddest place to go,

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.550
it's the gym. When I go train to the gym,

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.040
it's the happiest place for me to go,

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:20.790
because I can practice the sport that I love because I love training. You know,

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.060
I love the science of fighting and it's very sad too,

8
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:28.200
because after our training, there's always some guys that come to me too,

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
because they seek some advice and I always give them advice regarding fighting.

10
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:37.110
But a lot of them, my advice for them would be, Hey, bro,

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.160
you know, you should hang off your, hang up your gloves and find a real job.

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.581
You know,

13
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:45.750
my guys have some of them because I've seen this movie and it's not a good

14
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.750
ending, my friend and I go fine. But if I tell them.

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.583
<v 1>The truth.</v>

16
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.770
<v 0>They'll get mad at you. They get mad at me because I'll be like, oh yeah, he's,</v>

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.700
you know what I mean? Like you're jealous, he's jealous, you know, he's,

18
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.850
he's arrogant and stuff, you know, but that's the thing. I tell him,

19
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.880
my real friends that when it's time to hang up the gloves,

20
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.600
I tell them the truth. I said, listen. And I said to them, and like I said,

21
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.690
listen, man, what's good for you now.

22
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.250
<v 2>You know, you know, you, you know, it's a little bit like in, um, the movie, um,</v>

23
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.260
uh, with, uh, Bruce Willis, you know, uh, uh, equivalent Tarantino, you know,

24
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.430
pulp fiction fiction. You know, if you, if you would, if you would have made it,

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.060
you would have made it before. You know, when he made that speech, you know,

26
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:30.480
it's a little bit the same thing, but it's it's, I love that monologues.

27
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:34.860
It's amazing, but it's true. A lot of people should relate to this,

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.650
but it's unfortunate. Well, the reason.

29
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.310
<v 1>Y champions are so exceptional is because it's so hard to become a</v>

30
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:44.370
champion. It's so rare. All the stars have to align.

31
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.120
You have to have mental prowess, physical prowess,

32
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.860
you have to have great coaching.

33
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.490
You have to have so many different factors have to come together.

34
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:55.140
And also fortune. I mean,

35
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.340
you're a guy has been through some surgeries and we all know guys who they get

36
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:03.060
injured and they can never even train again. It happens, it's unusual,

37
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:04.110
but it can happen.

38
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.430
<v 2>And we were dealing with this,</v>

39
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.200
this giant hurricane of possibilities for someone to

40
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.990
boom, come out of that and be a George St. Pierre,

41
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.010
or be a Khabib Nurmagomedov or a Jon Jones or someone who is exceptional.

42
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.670
It's so rare. So when someone's kid comes up to you and says,

43
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:21.880
I'm going to be the next world champion.

44
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.780
<v 0>The possibility that the odds of failure are so they're so.</v>

45
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.690
<v 1>High, it's so.</v>

46
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.670
<v 0>High. That's the thing it's it's I believe it's.</v>

47
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.240
You need to have a certain predisposition. Yeah.

48
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.030
I met in my life,

49
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.050
incredible mentors that add an huge influence on me.

50
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:44.280
<v 2>They, they, they taught me like great life lessons, techniques,</v>

51
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.420
and it's incredible. Like if I would not have had that,

52
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.530
those, those guys who influenced me,

53
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:55.380
I would never have been where I am right now. And plus on top of that, you know,

54
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:58.590
I w I got, I worked really hard and I was lucky, you know,

55
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.360
like the war all align, but you need all that.

56
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.450
<v 1>The great coaching is so important too.</v>

57
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.950
There's so many guys that are really talented, but they, they,

58
00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:10.330
they have meet head coaches and the coaches train them the wrong way.

59
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.500
So they spar full blast in the gym, and then they go out and they, they lose.

60
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.141
And then they have their,

61
00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:18.160
their coach has them sparring a couple of weeks after they get knocked out.

62
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.550
And that kind of, and they don't have the technical prowess,

63
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.840
the technical proficiency to teach a child or a kid or an athlete. Right.

64
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.410
You can get unlucky, you know, I believe.

65
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.490
<v 0>Dave, the best way to improve. It's when it's playful.</v>

66
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.760
I've seen so many guys, Joel, I can't say names,

67
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.810
but it's crazy how many guys I've seen that lived their career in the gyms

68
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.290
because they aspire too hard. Every aspiring for them.

69
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.560
<v 2>It's about winning the rounds. Yeah. So life or death,</v>

70
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.520
you cannot improve like this. It needs to be playful. Of course,

71
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.460
when you're in training camp and your fight is coming up,

72
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.810
you need to somehow trying to recreate that environment of

73
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.060
discomfort that's stress.

74
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.820
But when you're outside of that preparation preparation

75
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.460
zone, you need, you need to be playful.

76
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.290
And that's when you improve when it's playful, when it's like a game, you know,

77
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.590
because you will be more prone to try new things.

78
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.580
And by trying new things, you'll, you'll adapt. You'll, you'll be like, oh,

79
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.410
this one works. This one doesn't work.

80
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.230
<v 0>But the one that works, I keep it in my back pocket, you know? And it,</v>

81
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.110
it makes you grow. That's a problems. You know,

82
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.110
I've seen like very often, I see guys like sparing day, they,

83
00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:37.000
they lose a lot of brain cells. It's terrible. It's terrible. And I'm well,

84
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.900
I'm former world champion. You know, like when I'm Sparwood with guys,

85
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.410
very often, they are nervous. So they become all stiff. And then when they hit,

86
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.230
they hit so hard. I tell them, I'm like, you don't get ready.

87
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.260
You don't wanna have any fight coming up soon. Like, just have fun, but relax.

88
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.610
I tell them, relax. And they very often, they, they relax, you know,

89
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.420
some will try to make, you know, so I have to answer back. I have to,

90
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.550
but very often they relax and, and, and, and they're surprised that it,

91
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:07.450
because it's so, so much of a NIGO testic sport, you know,

92
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.570
like we have this mentality that, oh, if the guy tells you to relax,

93
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.560
because he's scared, you know, it's so stupid, you know, but it's, that's how,

94
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:18.970
if you want to improve, you need to, it needs to be playful. And in everything,

95
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.650
you know, we say, are you, when I say spiring, when I,

96
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.300
when I'm about to spar with someone I never sparked before I that's what I do.

97
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.300
I tell him, I say, Hey, would you like to play a little bit?

98
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.220
I don't use the words. Piring cause sparring is like aggression. I tell him,

99
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:38.170
I say, Hey, would you like to play a little bit there?

100
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.620
And then we touched Levin and we play and, and I never go high.

101
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.570
I'd always start very, very slow.

102
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.470
And if I see that EAs D going to our, I tell them, I say,

103
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:50.280
please go Google more or more easy. And of course,

104
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.950
if he's getting ready for a fight, it's different. It's a different situations.

105
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:56.470
But you know, that's how it is, you know? And you need, you,

106
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:59.240
shouldn't be afraid to tell your training partner, Hey,

107
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.710
please like put it like slow down a notch. You know? Like,

108
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:06.380
like when you see guys trying to chew a head kick to now get shuttered or out,

109
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.430
you know, in boxing, sparring, it's different because we, we have big gloves,

110
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:14.330
big head gear, you know, they can go hard. I mean, even if it's not good,

111
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:19.070
because it's repeatedly blows repetition with the blows to the head,

112
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:21.320
but in MMA with the cakes,

113
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.100
it's the damage is basically like a baseball bat hitting your head.

114
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:29.570
You can't do that. It's it's crazy, man. The ties of it. Right, right.

115
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.990
That's right. That's right. Because they have so many fights.

116
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.100
They have so many fights that, and also when you fight someone,

117
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.690
when I fight someone, it happens very often in my career.

118
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.090
Like when I fight someone,

119
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.870
you have a connection with the guy, you fight.

120
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:50.060
A lot of things happen here.

121
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.670
And real fighter will know that what I'm talking about,

122
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.540
the connection that we have,

123
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:56.420
because you look at each other and these disconnection,

124
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:00.530
you cannot see it when you watch a fight on TV. But very often,

125
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.250
and most of my fight, when I went to decision,

126
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.550
I could see the guy break, breaking, folding,

127
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.410
like ease,

128
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.420
letting me know that he doesn't fight to win anymore is fighting to not lose.

129
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.460
And like I said earlier, it's not up to me trying to,

130
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.010
trying to push the pace,

131
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:26.930
trying to finish him and increasing my risk of getting cut by a

132
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:29.240
counter punch and getting knocked out. You know,

133
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.160
it's up to him to take the risk, you know,

134
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.510
because he's losing the fight and the ID in this game,

135
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.750
you want to save your cell for another day. I mean, it,

136
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:41.660
it's sad to say for the family, this, this is the truth. If you win.

137
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.590
And that's what you're doing is good. You win, you're winning the fight.

138
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.800
You know, you you're going to get paid the same amount of money. Of course,

139
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:51.290
if you have a, like a highlight reels, something like that,

140
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.030
it could increase your pay. But, but in terms of your career,

141
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.680
I believe you should see your career as a marathon, not as a sprint. So you,

142
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:03.890
you kind of save yourself. And a lot of time I fought guys.

143
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.070
I could see in their face that, oh, he doesn't want to be there anymore.

144
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.830
Like I know I'm winning the fight before. Even the fight is over.

145
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.090
They get desperate. Of course, they're going to choose a haymaker or something,

146
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:16.910
but I know they're not going to take any risk because they they're,

147
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.230
they're hurt they're they lost already. They know that I'm better than them.

148
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.920
And that's when I know I get the fight and I know that I'm just need to be on

149
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.320
cruise control. I can win. If they don't like,

150
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:31.880
it's hard to finish someone who doesn't fight to win anymore. Right?

151
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.050
You see very often champions in MMA.

152
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.890
I have a very dominate, dominant carrier in the beginning. You know,

153
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:42.080
they finish a lot of their openings, but after a,

154
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:44.150
while it become it kind of peak because

155
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.940
all the entire UFC roster is studying you and they figure you out.

156
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.160
