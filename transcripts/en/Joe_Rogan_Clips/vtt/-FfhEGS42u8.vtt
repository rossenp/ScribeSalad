00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 1>Experience, you know what the problem is, this idea of approved truth,</v>

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.720
what YouTube calls, authoritative sources. So I know I'm pretty hard on YouTube,

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.780
but this does involve Facebook as well. That name I sent you,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.080
Facebook will delete your posts without notice if you type it. Wow.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.320
So here's what I did tried it. I typed, I just, uh,

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.790
I said something like I heard of a man from Dubuque on orthodontist named

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.430
who has five kids. And he's in his mid fifties.

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.630
I did that because that in no way describes who that person is, right. Not,

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.860
not only to Facebook delete it,

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.550
they deleted it without telling me it was just erased from the site gone.

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.360
So it's.

13
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.250
<v 0>Some sort of a filter that's in place. No.</v>

14
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.350
<v 1>No. Somebody manually did it. It was there for a while.</v>

15
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.110
And then somebody came in or somehow. So,

16
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:47.100
so do you know what happened with a CNN, Chris Cuomo getting, getting COVID,

17
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.160
you know, they fake that whole thing, right? What do you mean the effect? It,

18
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
so Chris Cuomo was spotted 30 minutes from his house on a property with a new co

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.030
with a new construction being built, a steel frame, a guy on a bike saw him,

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.480
Chris Cuomo, they got into it. Chris Como goes on his radio show and says,

21
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.000
I don't want this on a fat tire bike coming up to me.

22
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.980
I should tell him what I want the guy in the bikes,

23
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.780
as he called the cops and said, he threatened me.

24
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.350
So this basically confirms the encounter. Chris Cuomo then,

25
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.950
then shot a segment for CNN of him emerging from his basement. Like,

26
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.910
this is what I've been dreaming of.

27
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.800
Finally getting out of my basement and seeing my kids.

28
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.880
But he was witnessed seeing his kids somewhere else with his kids. Yeah.

29
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:25.710
So you even had that you even had Ben Smith,

30
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.030
the New York times call this out saying E w Ben Smith used to be the editor in

31
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.931
chief of Buzzfeed news.

32
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.870
Now he's a media columnist for New York times said something to the effect of

33
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:34.230
it's.

34
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.010
It's like shocking how CNN is aligning this whole controversy there they're

35
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.780
pretending like it didn't happen. Everybody knows Como faked it.

36
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.630
He wasn't in quarantine. He was out. Presumably he was,

37
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.480
he was a two women and three kids. So we can,

38
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.400
we can assume it was his wife and his kids, whatever.

39
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.100
I bring that up because you've got a couple other moments, right?

40
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.290
You've got Brian Stelter on,

41
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.100
on his show saying that we got to channel the anger for the people. Yeah.

42
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.990
<v 0>That he was saying that journalists.</v>

43
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.750
<v 1>Need to do that. Which is, which is, you know, I basically said,</v>

44
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:02.130
so you're admitting your rage bait.

45
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.750
<v 0>Yes. I saw you did that.</v>

46
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.300
And I was glad that you said that like finally they're admitting it.

47
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.180
<v 1>Right, right, right. I mean, look, it's no secret. I'm going to rag on,</v>

48
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.691
on the media.

49
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.050
I worked for these companies and I've seen them slowly getting worse and worse

50
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:14.430
with everything I want to see. Brian's.

51
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.263
<v 0>Scream.</v>

52
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.950
<v 1>You want to see Brian's scream? Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.890
<v 0>I think like him enraged would be a dog.</v>

54
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.370
Like I wonder how much anger he can muster.

55
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.250
<v 1>I can't. So, so here's, here's the point I was getting to.</v>

56
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.080
CNN's called an authoritative source. Yeah. They're lying in our faces. I mean,

57
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.180
you just had the Joe Biden thing for it.

58
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.260
I don't know if you've talked about this yet,

59
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.010
but if you go to Google play and look up Larry King show from 1993,

60
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.840
you will see there. So actually I checked many of the different, uh, months.

61
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.790
What people noticed was that one episode was missing August 11th, 1993,

62
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:52.380
the episode where Joe Biden's accuser called in saying my daughter had a problem

63
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.670
with a prominent Senator knows.

64
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.740
<v 0>Joe Biden's accuser's mom.</v>

65
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.740
<v 1>What did I say? I said accuser. All right. Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.110
He's the user's mom write that up. So it's gone. Yes.

67
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.340
So I went through Google play and there certainly were other episodes that were

68
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.120
presumably missing. Typically Mondays, where I assume I would assume that,

69
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
you know, Larry can get a day off or something. The 11th was a Wednesday.

70
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.430
Why was this missing? Why did CNN, why were they scooped on their own story?

71
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.040
They had this evidence, apparently this was, this was news.

72
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.010
So when you look at what CNN has been doing, admitting that they're doing rage,

73
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.290
journalism, you get people like Jim Acosta.

74
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120
<v 0>Isn't that like, what's what Brian said. What's Brian's Helter Skelter, Stelter.</v>

75
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.020
Isn't he just that's his own opinion. You know? I mean,

76
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.780
and it's not that they're admitting that they're doing rage journalism.

77
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.470
It's he's saying that they should do that. Right. Isn't that what it was?

78
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.600
And he said it on Twitter, right? Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.880
<v 1>I think it was a quote from his show. Was it?</v>

80
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.730
I think it was reliable sources tweeting it out and you know, look,

81
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.710
I may be hyperbolic or whatever. Cause I got my opinions on,

82
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.250
on CNN and all that. But take a look at someone like Jim Acosta, he stands up,

83
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.070
he argues with the president. That's not what journalists are supposed to do.

84
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.610
You know, if you want to ask the president a question, he gives you an answer.

85
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.980
If he, if, if you have the opportunity for follow-up you do,

86
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.350
and then you write your story and you fact check them,

87
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.600
you write your story and say Donald Trump. Here's what he told us.

88
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.670
Here's the truth. That's what journalists used to do.

89
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.120
Now you've got this idea of channeling, the rage for the people.

90
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.210
What that means is it's something I've seen in activist circles,

91
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.590
where it was explained to me that what people are looking for is someone to

92
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:28.030
strike down a symbol of what they view as their enemy or the cause of their

93
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.840
problems. So the reasons why someone like Jim Acosta would do so well,

94
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.940
he would get so many followers constantly doing this.

95
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.000
It's not that he's asking any real questions or actually challenging the

96
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.670
president. It's that the people who don't like Trump,

97
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:41.800
see him as striking a symbol down.

98
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.420
It doesn't matter if he's telling you the truth or not.

99
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.350
Now you get performative journalism where Chris Cuomo pretends to come out of

100
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.630
his basement, where you know,

101
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.600
you get people standing up with the white house correspondence, uh,

102
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.920
or at the press conferences,

103
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:57.190
just arguing instead of actually asking questions and then YouTube,

104
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.460
Facebook and Twitter say, this is the truth. We deem it.

105
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:04.930
So YouTube now puts them among other outlets on the front page of the website,

106
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:07.990
guaranteeing hundreds of millions of views. Meanwhile,

107
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.830
independent commentators like myself. We actually get hurt in the algorithm.

108
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:15.490
If you go to my channel, they only show you Fox news. If you want to watch me,

109
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.790
then you are guaranteed in the sidebar. The next video will be Fox news.

110
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.260
They prop up all of these channels. David PackMan, for instance, you get MSNBC,

111
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.490
Jimmy Dore, Fox news. I don't understand why they're going to send Jimmy's,

112
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.660
you know, lefty followers to Fox news, but they're doing seemingly everything,

113
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:35.260
their power to make sure individuals like myself and other commentators are

114
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:38.890
struck down while channels like CNN, Fox and MSNBC are propped up.

115
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.900
Even though we know that they put out fake news.

116
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.050
<v 0>But isn't that, but because of the algorithm though.</v>

117
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:47.200
And do you think that algorithm is engineered in order to engineer towards those

118
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.460
mainstream site? Absolutely.

119
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.730
<v 1>We can see, we can see when it happened. It was may of last year.</v>

120
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.290
I've looked at my analytics around the time these smear pieces came out,

121
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.630
arguing that there a rabbit hole where if you watch one kind of contents,

122
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.480
all you get, it's a very, very misleading way of framing.

123
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.440
What was really going on.

124
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.630
And so I I'm surprised that YouTube just bent over for this.

125
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.690
You basically have YouTube competition.

126
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.610
These media outlets using their media waits to hurt YouTube in ad sales.

127
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.310
So YouTube says, you got it, we'll give you front page access.

128
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.610
We'll guarantee you, you know, people watch your content.

129
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.160
<v 0>Right.</v>

130
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.760
But they're doing that because that content is very popular and that generates

131
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:26.594
ad revenue.

132
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.280
<v 1>Well, I would, I would, I would say no, actually I would argue against that.</v>

133
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.130
<v 0>Yeah. Well, okay. Well listen like Tucker Carlson, for example,</v>

134
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.990
you got to know he's hugely popular.

135
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.860
If you have a Tucker Carlson video is going to generate millions of views.

136
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.500
Absolutely. So YouTube within their best interests.

137
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.340
<v 1>Thinking about Alison Camerata is anybody really Google searching you on</v>

138
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.580
YouTube? Alison camera Rhoda's opinion on this all day. I don't think so.

139
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.640
I think I don't know who that is. Uh, right, exactly.

140
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.700
And so you wouldn't be searching for it, Tucker of course we know. Um.

141
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.290
<v 0>The channel in general, not just, uh, someone who's popular,</v>

142
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:01.940
like Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson.

143
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.200
<v 1>They as, as very famous personalities, very obviously do get, you know,</v>

144
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.860
more get more naturally. Yeah.

145
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.970
So people are searching for Tucker all day and night Hannity and Rachel Maddow,

146
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.090
things like that. Right. But if you, if you look at how, uh, what,

147
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.020
what YouTube has even said to CNN, they prop up authoritative sources.

148
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.690
If you search for a new story, guess who you're going to get.

149
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.910
If you Google search, you know, Tyree Joe Biden, you're going to get CNN CBS.

150
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.280
<v 0>Though, because they're trying to get rid of conspiracy theories. Yes. Yeah.</v>

151
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.820
They're trying to reason. Yeah. They're trying to get, like,

152
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.590
I understand what they're saying in terms of, so like the CEO of YouTube,

153
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.440
when she said that they're going to go with the world health organization,

154
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.200
I don't think it's a good idea to go with the world health organization.

155
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.030
Cause it seems like it's a very corrupt organization,

156
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.680
but I do understand this desire to go towards respected and

157
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:53.420
established medical professionals.

158
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.340
So for staff respected and established medical professionals have a protocol for

159
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:02.630
dealing with coronavirus, we should listen to them. Right? Absolutely.

160
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:06.770
And there's a lot of wacky online that are trying to say that it's not a real

161
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.830
virus and that it's 5g. And there's like,

162
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.040
all that kind of stuff is dangerous. You know what they told me.

163
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.110
<v 1>Don't you think? Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

164
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.030
But they told me they published an editorial guidelines very early on.

165
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.540
I did a video about this January 23rd, when they first started locking down,

166
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.070
I did a segment talking about what's going on.

167
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.390
And I actually didn't think it was a big deal.

168
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.420
This was before anybody was really covering it. I mean, this is, you know,

169
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:33.470
impeachment was happening and YouTube fully monetized. It can.

170
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.680
So I have a thing on YouTube called self-certification where,

171
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.840
when I upload a video, they asked me, do your,

172
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.550
does your video contain any of the following?

173
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.340
My videos are always clean family family-friendly I don't swear.

174
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.730
And I was approved video monetized a week later,

175
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.700
they implemented a new change without telling anyone, anything.

176
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.110
Anyone talking about coronavirus was instantly demonetized D ranked possibly had

177
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:55.830
your videos harder to find things like that.

178
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.360
And it wasn't until about a couple weeks ago, they overturned these,

179
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:04.350
the rankings on my channel. They told me before they published the guidelines,

180
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.270
you cannot say these things.

181
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.570
One of which was that it may have emerged from a bio-lab.

182
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.800
Now we have on April, I think, I think it was the 16th,

183
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.140
a former Clinton administration,

184
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.150
NSC staffer saying that outcomes razors suggests the most likely place that this

185
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.910
came from was breaking out of a Wu Han Biolab.

186
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.660
There was a story by Brett Baer over at Fox news where he said,

187
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.840
according to sources, he has who've overseen the documents.

188
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.050
They believe that China was trying to essentially prove their, their,

189
00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:40.290
their worth with American bioresearch by racing to do this development.

190
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.100
And there was a breach and this resulted in the COVID outbreak.

191
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.870
That's that's Fox news and CNN CNN's run, run multiple segments saying this.

192
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.070
When I talk about it, I get direct. Do you monetize confirmed? They say,

193
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:55.860
you can't talk about this temp, CNN, Ken they're authoritative. You can't.

194
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.730
Even if I use them as a source, even if I say like, so if I,

195
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.260
what I try to do is, you know, weigh the sources. How good are they?

196
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.830
Brett Bair. That's a good source. I mean, Brett bears,

197
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.350
one of the last true newspeople I don't I'm,

198
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.860
I'm not somebody who follows him too much, but he's a straight news guy.

199
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.350
He put his name on this. And that, that says a lot to me.

200
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.150
You don't got to like the guy you've got to like Fox news,

201
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.770
but CNN also ran the story saying U S intelligence now believes, or,

202
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:24.930
or I'm sorry, they're investigating whether this claim is, has merit.

203
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.440
We also had a story from the Washington post that asked the same question,

204
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.270
even got a professor from Rutgers university to say it's very possible.

205
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.530
The story actually emerged because at south, uh, China universe, uh, is it,

206
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:41.430
I think south China university in Beijing released a paper saying that somebody

207
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:43.980
was doing experiments on bat bats with coronavirus.

208
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.620
And one of the bats spilled blood on them and peed on him.

209
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.240
And he had to self quarantine for 14 days being that the Wu Han CDC,

210
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.810
I think it's the CDC is about 300 meters away from the, from the food market.

211
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.090
It seems like that was a likely scenario.

212
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.910
They eventually retract that retracted that paper. So movie.

213
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.550
<v 0>Scene. Totally. So.</v>

214
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.590
<v 1>Look, uh, it's not, it's not me saying it. I, I understand.</v>

215
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.423
<v 0>What you're saying.</v>

216
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.710
<v 1>But, but I get, I get knocked down for this.</v>

217
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.000
<v 0>That's about it. I understand. But I think in their defense,</v>

218
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.850
some of this has to be that they're managing at scale.

219
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.660
Some of this has to be the fact that millions of videos are uploaded every day

220
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.350
and they have to keep this dense disinformation from spreading out of control.
