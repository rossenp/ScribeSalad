00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.910
I know you're going to say some crazy and you're going to torpedo your

3
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:11.450
life. Now that you're a cult girl with strawberry blonde hair,

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.210
it's more a strawberry blonde.

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.950
<v 1>It's a home job. It's, it's beautiful with yourself. So it's more, um,</v>

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.520
my therapist would always say lean into this comfort what you don't like.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.930
And I hate Ginger's. So I said, why don't I just like your.

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.850
<v 0>Therapist has leaned into discussion.</v>

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.090
<v 1>Yeah. If there's something that like I'm in a men's group also. And they said,</v>

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.380
and I told them, I said,

11
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:41.150
I'm going to go back on the Joe Rogan experience after four or five, six year.

12
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:43.190
I don't know when the last time I was here at five. Right.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.410
I don't know it's been awhile.

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.030
And so they go lean into the discomfort,

15
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.530
start with what you least want to share. And I go,

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.860
this is me trying to, they don't know you that well.

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.040
<v 2>That's terrible advice for you.</v>

18
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.720
<v 1>So I sit there, I'm driving over here and I go, okay.</v>

19
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:09.500
Start with what I at least want to share. I pulled over on, uh, uh,

20
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.540
van Nuys Boulevard and a puked. Yeah, I puked. Wow. Um, uh,

21
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.280
I have, uh, I don't get nervous. I, you know, I used to run my own podcasts.

22
00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:21.140
I've talked to you a million times. Um,

23
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.460
like I just had like a visceral response and I was like,

24
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.670
and I just pulled over on van Nuys. And I think someone took a picture of me.

25
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.650
So you're out there and, uh, I don't get nervous. Like these things,

26
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.790
like I'm, I'm able to just, uh, almost disassociate and like, whatever.

27
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.170
And just go ahead and just go into any situation. And I just felt,

28
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.900
you know, and I was like, oh, maybe it was the breakfast.

29
00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:48.650
I ha I had a hard boiled egg and a chia pudding.

30
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.230
That's what I had for breakfast. So that's it, that's it.

31
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.220
And I pull over and I was like, oh my God, I'm nervous.

32
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.430
I'm just going to puke puke. I look across the street, there's a guy like,

33
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.050
and then I get in the car and I'm like,

34
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.300
do I really want to share with a Joe that I tried on like four different

35
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:10.610
outfits? Uh, last night. Um,

36
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.480
do I want to share with him that I got caught yesterday at, um,

37
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.290
I was eating at this place called Johnny Pistor armies in west Adams that just

38
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.300
opened, it's an old restaurant that just reopened.

39
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.520
And I know the guy that runs it, Danny. And he said, um, you know,

40
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.810
there's an outdoor, I only eat an outdoor spots right now. And I'm like,

41
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:33.560
what the? I'm so scared. I'm going to be canceled. If I talked to Joe,

42
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.610
that'd be fine. And then that way through this, I go,

43
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.270
I've been canceled so many times. Like I kinda like it. It feels good.

44
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.510
<v 0>Yeah. I haven't been canceled since the age of real canceling.</v>

45
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.000
The age of real canceling has been,

46
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.570
since you were on the podcast last that's when canceling is kicked up to new

47
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:50.871
level,

48
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:55.610
because now the pylons happen right before there was just

49
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:57.350
canceling. Like, you'd get in trouble for things.

50
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.070
Someone would write an article, they'd be like, oh my, what did David do?

51
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.220
He's crazy. But now the pylon,

52
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.540
the social media and the effectiveness of the pylon has been established.

53
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.590
So now whenever someone, anything happens to someone, all the,

54
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.800
the pylon people. But.

55
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.950
<v 1>But I like, I like getting canceled. Like you enjoy it.</v>

56
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.270
Did you see the Michael Jordan.

57
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.160
<v 0>Documentary? I still haven't seen it.</v>

58
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.480
<v 1>All right. I'm not going to ruin it for you, but it's I heard it's awesome. It,</v>

59
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.630
the actual filmmaking is kind of amateurish,

60
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:30.240
but the subject matter is so dynamic that like you're in it.

61
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.610
And like the guy's a full on gambling addict, you know? And,

62
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.960
and it's 12 episodes that could have probably been like four.

63
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.680
And the story is the same. It's just this guy,

64
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:42.480
didn't give me the best seat on the airplane. This,

65
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.370
this guy overlooked me in high school.

66
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.030
It's like all these slights and he takes it and he uses it as fuel.

67
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.060
And so I sit here and I go home driving to Joe Rogan's right now,

68
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:52.080
I'm scared to be canceled.

69
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.700
And I sit here and I go every horrible thing that's happened in my life,

70
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.770
physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal abuse, spiritual abuse, prison,

71
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.720
getting my career taken away,

72
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:07.770
or this or anything has always led to bigger and better. So I'm like,

73
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.880
kind of like it, you know.

74
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.830
<v 0>That's. Yeah, but that's just because you're a real person. Like you're not,</v>

75
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.060
you're not full of in any way, shape or form. You might be crazy, but,

76
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.890
but you're a lovable crazy. And when people know who you actually are,

77
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.120
it's like, you have these moments where things are uncomfortable and you know,

78
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:31.800
and you're confronted with, you know, bad, a bad scene.

79
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.570
<v 2>But then you rise above.</v>

80
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.720
<v 1>Thank you. I appreciate that. What is your, uh,</v>

81
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.260
threshold with receiving compliments? My threshold. Yeah.

82
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.100
What's your comfort level? I haven't seen you in a long time. Yeah,

83
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.110
it's been awhile. Can I give you, can I give you five? Sure. Okay.

84
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.300
Um, you are you're you only look better as you get older. Oh,

85
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.280
you have a beautifully shaped skull. Like as an artist, as a sculptor,

86
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.130
like I painted you. I don't like the painting anymore.

87
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:03.150
I think I can do a better one now.

88
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.970
<v 0>But it's an awesome painting. I'm like this guy.</v>

89
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.720
<v 1>Like all artists and sculptors out there, listening, paint, this guy's skull.</v>

90
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:14.160
It's beautiful. Um, you're unbelievably,

91
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.900
uh, curious, inspirational.

92
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.130
You give me hope. You're funny. You're entertaining. And you're a leader.

93
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.840
Just talk to all your guys right now.

94
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.280
Like you're leading this charge to Texas right now. And, uh,

95
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.530
Europe, perfectly imperfect unrepeatable,

96
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:39.670
miracle of the universe. Wow. That's heavy. You're great, man.

97
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.230
<v 0>Well, that's very sweet of you. I appreciate you. Thank you very much, man.</v>

98
00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:44.490
That's very nice of you. Yeah. I.

99
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.780
<v 1>I love, you know, I haven't talked to you in a long time, but I told you I just,</v>

100
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.730
I, I I'm sure a lot of people feel this way. You're just on all the time.

101
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.190
You're in, on YouTube or on a podcast or on someone else's podcast.

102
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:02.420
So I still I'm like. I think about you. You're in my you're in my head.

103
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.160
Can I give you a on air gift? Sure. Um, I was,

104
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.310
while I was trying on all my outfits last night, I was like,

105
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.060
I want to see who Joe's talking to. This is Mike smells like post Malone.

106
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.800
So I was, uh, I was painting last night and I made you a shirt. Oh my goodness.

107
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.500
Cause you guys got on a little thing. I didn't listen to the whole episode yet.

108
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.060
Cause it's four hours. But um,

109
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.050
you were talking about ghosts at the beach ghosts on the beach.

110
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.620
So there's a ghost on the beach right there. Well,

111
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.380
I didn't make the it's it's uh, you see the ghost,

112
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.030
you see the ghosts on the front.

113
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.380
<v 2>That's awesome. You can give it away.</v>

114
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.830
I'm going to wear the out of this very much. Yeah.

115
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.440
That's so cool.

116
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.120
<v 1>You're welcome. That's awesome, man. Coastal the beach. Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:54.850
You never see ghosts on the beach. All the ghost stories are always at night.

118
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.690
That's true.

119
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.200
<v 2>Right? Yeah. That was a good point. I felt like I made a good point.</v>

120
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.200
That was a great point because like everyone, I mean, if ghosts.

121
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.290
<v 0>Were real, like if they were really scary, you'd see them in cool times.</v>

122
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.640
Like at the pool, you know, Vegas drinking,

123
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.700
everybody's having fun. ghost shows up, freaks everybody out. Never.

124
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.740
<v 1>So, um, I got all the embarrassing stuff out of the way I think. Oh no.</v>

125
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:21.430
So I was at this outdoor restaurant eating at the corner

126
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.200
and not having a full on panic, panic attack, but I have a nice,

127
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.910
beautiful, wonderful, quiet life. Now I'm not on the air.

128
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:33.310
I don't do podcasts. I don't do interviews. I'm not,

129
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.650
I'm not like my life is amazing.

130
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.690
Like I completely changed my life since the last time I saw you and I

131
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:43.060
go, I do want to talk to Joe, but maybe, you know,

132
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.550
maybe we'll just talk to you on the phone or go visit you in Texas. Like,

133
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.840
do I need to go on the air?

134
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.410
<v 0>Give me that option. I was like, you don't have to do this, but.</v>

135
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.520
<v 1>Right. But I'm a sick person, but you're a fun guy. You're fun.</v>

136
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.230
<v 0>People enjoy listening to.</v>

137
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.000
<v 1>You. So I had this, uh,</v>

138
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.560
sculpture that I made and it was in my car and I just brought it out and I sat

139
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:05.440
next to it. And I said, I'm just going to prepare a little bit.

140
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.700
So I started preparing for the Joe Rogan experience and I started talking to

141
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:13.570
this sculpture and I'm like, looking, I'm like, you know, it was three o'clock.

142
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.260
There was no one eating there. And I got caught, I got caught.

143
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.990
Like I talking to a sculpture, talking to sculpture.

144
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:23.860
I was talking to this thing I made. And it wasn't a, it wasn't a friend,

145
00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:28.720
but it was a guy I knew. And he's like, Dave comes over and I'm like, oh dude.

146
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:32.290
And he's like, shame red face. I'm like, oh, Hey. And he's like.

147
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.480
<v 0>Are you talking to thing right now? And I was like, oh yeah,</v>

148
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.480
I'm going on this thing tomorrow. I just wanted to prepare a little bit.

149
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.460
<v 1>I'm a little bit nervous. I got my nerves. Um, um, cause I talked to you what?</v>

150
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.860
Thursday? No. I talked to you a few days ago

151
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.920
and we talked for a while and I'm like, this guy is a professional talker.

152
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.530
He's a commentator. He's a standup.

153
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.330
He has his podcast that on for hours and hours, thousands of hours,

154
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.750
it's an art, you're a painter. You're a MMA artist in, in, in my world.

155
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.860
I'm also an MME artist, mixed media artists. Right? That's uh,

156
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.950
the bisexual of painting. It's like, you use everything, everything,

157
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.630
anything goes. So I go, this guy is so good at it.

158
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.770
Cause I got off the phone with you and I'm like, he's so good at talking.

159
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.500
He's so good at talking. And he's just, it's like,

160
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.390
it's like when you practice something so much that you don't even know how, how,

161
00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:30.840
how good you are at it. You know? And um, even, even,

162
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.750
even your podcasts, they, they go on for a few hours,

163
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.360
which is against every everyone's like, oh kids,

164
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:40.170
they have no attention span these days. It's like 10 seconds, 15 seconds.

165
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.690
It's take talks or Instagram. I mean,

166
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.200
here's this guy he's talking to post Malone for four hours and,

167
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.320
and making it seem just seamless and effortless.

168
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.900
And that's because you're a master at it.

169
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.930
And I go I'm uh,

170
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.820
my confidence level is as far as this art form is low.

171
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.490
I don't talk to people anymore. I mean, I talk to my friends,

172
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:06.810
but I don't talk as storytelling or entertainment. Um,

173
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.910
my memory is shot to. I can't,

174
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.230
I watched three seasons of Ozark and I can't even tell you anyone's name. I go,

175
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:16.680
there's Jason Bateman. And there's the kid and the kid with the drone.

176
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.450
And I don't know the wife, I don't know anyone's names. I can't recall anything.

177
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.800
Um, and, and you have all these scientists that are brilliant.

178
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:28.230
You have comedians. And everyone's like quick-witted and they're fast.

179
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.670
And they're, and I go, I'm dim with it. I'm like a, uh,

180
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.230
human soft serve. I'm like, I can't and comparing.

181
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.560
<v 0>Yourself to the other people. I've got to let that go right now. Well,</v>

182
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.050
you are who you are, the applicant can't do what you do.

183
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.160
<v 1>Um, that's true. Yeah. Your abstract.</v>

184
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.980
<v 0>Way of thinking, like the way you are as a person. Uh you're.</v>

185
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:53.270
You're so freely yourself. That's what allows you to create such amazing art.

186
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.560
Like you just you're free. Some people can't be themselves and not good at it.

187
00:10:57.561 --> 00:10:59.240
You're really good at being David Cho.

188
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.550
<v 1>Thank you. I'm horrible at taking compliments by the way. So.</v>

189
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.800
<v 0>It's uncomfortable for everybody. I think, unless you're.</v>

190
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.510
<v 1>A real creed that you did a great right now, you're awesome. That was good.</v>

191
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.950
Could have, could have done more. Could have given you like.

192
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.510
<v 0>We're good. You want to hear something funny? Okay.</v>

193
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.940
<v 1>So the reason why it kind of did that was I wake up every</v>

194
00:11:22.941 --> 00:11:27.170
morning, racked with anxiety and nerves and it starts immediately.

195
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.560
You're a piece of. You're no good people. You don't like you, this and that.

196
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.160
And then like, what did I say when you showed me my painting from 2018,

197
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.850
I immediately have to self DEP. That's not that good. I could do a better one.

198
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.450
So I, um,

199
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.670
I talked to my therapist about it. I say, I don't have a self.

200
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.620
I don't have a high self opinion of myself. And they go, well,

201
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.650
an average human living in society today from morning till night

202
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.630
will say thousands of horrible things about themselves. Like thousands.

203
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:04.300
Like I'm not good enough. I'm fat, I'm ugly. This and that. Just,

204
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.250
and for you to say just a few nice things. I'm like,

205
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:12.670
one of those is some Stuart Smalley, and I'm good enough.

206
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.870
And I'm PR and they go see you did it again. You just went right into it. Like,

207
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.350
why can't you say you're a good painter? You know, you're a good painter.

208
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:25.480
Why can't you say you're? And so they go give me five right now, five. What?

209
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.980
Say five things about yourself that, that, and I, I couldn't give him one.

210
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.620
I couldn't give him one. And, and they were like,

211
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.480
don't you think that's always been the case? I think so. I think it's a

212
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.790
to go into that kind of self hatred is I could sit here and say, it's a, um,

213
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.310
Korean thing, K rage, but it's Cambridge.

214
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:53.160
They said, you know, take a stick of deodorant, go home tonight and write,

215
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.940
I am enough on your, on your mirror. So you see it every morning.

216
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.880
And I go, I'm not doing that. That's retarded deodorant.

217
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.230
Yeah. They go, we're at, you're paying us. You're here. Just do it. All right,

218
00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:12.090
fine. I'll do it. I go and I write, I am I miss spell it? E N U F F I am enough.

219
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.320
And then I go next week and they go, so how's it going? You know,

220
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.380
brushing your teeth. You okay. I'm enough. I can't see it. They're like,

221
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:23.430
what kind of deodorant did you use? You know, the clear invisible one. No,

222
00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:26.700
get the thick white, chunky, whatever. Yeah.

223
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.600
Old spice and like, uh, like you're graffiti artists. Right.

224
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.260
So, okay. And I, and I said,

225
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.230
I can do it, but I don't believe it.

226
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.480
Cause I can sit here and tell you the amount of times in my life that I wasn't

227
00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:48.720
enough. Like I can sit here and go through many,

228
00:13:48.721 --> 00:13:53.700
many stories of women dumping me for richer.

229
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.010
Better looking more famous, better.

230
00:13:56.011 --> 00:14:00.390
This better that I can tell you of jobs I didn't get. So I, I'm not enough.

231
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.050
And I'm not, you know, so, and it's this struggle.

232
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.970
It's this burning like the Michael Jordan. Like I got a, I'm not,

233
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.800
I'm not at war. I'm not, you can't cancel me. I've already canceled myself.

234
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.220
How are you going to cancel someone who's already canceled it. There's nothing.

235
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:19.710
You're going to say, there's nothing you're going to do.

236
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.700
That's going to outweigh anything. I've already said to myself, you a, that guy.

237
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.710
<v 0>Sucks. He's ugly. He's fat. He's just full, full of.</v>

238
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.610
<v 1>That I've already said that, you know. So.</v>

239
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.360
<v 0>Do you think that fuels your art? Do you think there's a benefit? Absolutely.</v>

240
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.373
Absolutely.

241
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.660
<v 1>But you know,</v>

242
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.660
there's been that there's been that debate forever.

243
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.840
How do you create great art? And I'm not talking about good art,

244
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.610
but like the transcendent art, the heart that like is you remember it,

245
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.540
your it'll on for generations. And it's like, oh,

246
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.430
it's like the Picasso and van Gogh and all the comedians that

247
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.640
hate them. It's it. Wasn't a debate for me.

248
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.210
When I look at the art that I enjoy the comedy that I like,

249
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:10.040
the music that I like, you must suffer. You must suffer.

250
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.290
You have to suffer. Uh, comfort is the, is the killer of creativity.

251
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:19.490
That's what I used to say. And you know, and I, you know,

252
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.000
I'm saying it now, but like, I'd be like in a room like ranting, this.

253
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.550
<v 2>Comfort is the killer of create. You got to Mister killer of everything, man.</v>

254
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.160
<v 1>But I'm rich as. Yeah. I'm very comfortable.</v>

255
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.910
<v 0>With, but you're, you're comfortable financially, but that's how you keep sharp.</v>

256
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.950
You keep sharp by not being comfortable in.

257
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.800
<v 1>Other ways. So I sit there and I, and I'm going off on this rant.</v>

258
00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:40.480
I'm like in a echo chamber. They're like,

259
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:42.760
how long have you been telling this story for my whole life?

260
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.450
I believe it's not a debate for me. Right? For do you know,

261
00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:50.230
great artists that are comfortable and they're happy. And they're like,

262
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.390
they have loving families and they're.

263
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.610
<v 0>Digital, always something. There's always something, right?</v>

264
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.140
I think you can have a balance, but you have to have this thing. Right?

265
00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:01.600
Whatever that thing is, there's gotta be some sort of a struggle.

266
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.670
<v 1>And, and that was never a debate for me. I go,</v>

267
00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:07.120
there has to be that struggle and they go, but what if you take it away?

268
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.570
Like what if you chose happiness over great art? What if you chose?

269
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.390
And they go Dave,

270
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.780
for someone who's rebelled and like made your own rules and done everything your

271
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:21.670
own way. It's so weird that you just kind of accept this. They go Ken,

272
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.940
like what you just said, Ken, great transcendent.

273
00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:28.480
Next level art be created without that thing, without that edge,

274
00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:33.010
without with you pursuing joy and peace and love in your life.

275
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.270
And I go, you know what? Never tried it.

276
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.360
I never tried it. Well, why haven't you tried it? What'd you just say,

277
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.003
I don't know.

278
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.440
F E P S H fear. Ego pride, shame.

279
00:16:50.441 --> 00:16:55.330
Humiliation. That's why you never tried it. All right. You know,

280
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.440
and I go, you know what? I'll try it. And I'm today,

281
00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:00.640
I'm the happiest I've ever been.

282
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:08.560
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
