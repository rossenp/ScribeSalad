00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.720
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. One day. We're all gonna have no hair.</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.680
And they're gonna look back at pictures of us. They're gonna go,

3
00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:11.040
what the were they doing? What is that? Human race? Facial hair and.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.180
Everyone looks.

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.960
<v 1>The same. Yeah, no eyebrows, eyelashes.</v>

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.240
<v 0>I really think that's the future.</v>

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.880
I think the future is those aliens for closing counters.

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.270
I think the reason why we have those archetype images in our head, it says,

9
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:23.590
we know that's where we're going. Have you ever.

10
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.070
<v 1>Uh, talked to Paul Heller or looked at his stuff at all? Who's that?</v>

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.830
He's like the Canadian alien dude.

12
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.493
<v 0>They're all the same.</v>

13
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.390
<v 1>But he was, he was part of the government and.</v>

14
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.150
<v 0>He talks, oh, the government for sure.</v>

15
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.470
<v 1>He talk the truth. He specifically talks about the,</v>

16
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.060
the like different types of aliens. Oh.

17
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.100
<v 0>Well that makes him even more legit. Come on, Joe, for sure. With no evidence,</v>

18
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.780
he definitely would tell us all about these all different kinds.

19
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.700
<v 1>Of, yeah. You should look into it. You might wanna have them.</v>

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 0>On. I have, unfortunately. And I'm saying there's no alien evidence.</v>

21
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.260
I don't know him, but I know the, the whole alien alien.

22
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.340
<v 1>Because you're an alien and you don't want people to know. I.</v>

23
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.220
<v 0>Think there's a business. It's okay. People that you.</v>

24
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.300
<v 1>Know about alien for.</v>

25
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.970
<v 0>Who you are, the problem is there's a business in telling people that, you know,</v>

26
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.050
defense minister aliens would give us more tech. If we'd stop wars, right?

27
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:14.570
Let's play this. I wanna hear this. What's that? Oh, it's not, but it's on RT,

28
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.370
but why is he the one dude? He was on RT. Why.

29
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.450
<v 1>He a special dude? Why didn't didn't he.</v>

30
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.280
<v 0>Talk to other? But it says on RT proof of aliens. He's.</v>

31
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.280
<v 1>Overwhelming. Chosen one. No.</v>

32
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.840
<v 0>That's just a picture of it. That's just a screenshot. Oh, what?</v>

33
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.120
The Nintendo part. But he was on, right? Yeah. So he's gotta be,

34
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.960
there's gotta be a video of it. No, there's.

35
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.040
<v 1>Many videos of Paul Heller watched.</v>

36
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.760
<v 0>And do, do you buy it when you listen to him? Talk, it makes me question.</v>

37
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.760
<v 1>Don't I like to.</v>

38
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.520
<v 0>Hear I'm interested. I like to hear his voice to see if my crazy radar goes off.</v>

39
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.440
Just gimme a little piece. Tell us why.

40
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.590
<v 1>Tell us Wiseman what you feel production.</v>

41
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.830
<v 0>Before the end. You got two different playing. Jamie's a Taber &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

42
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.590
<v 2>Well, because I know that they are okay. And they've been, um,</v>

43
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.910
as a matter of fact, um,

44
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.230
they've been visiting our planet for thousands of years.

45
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.750
And one of the cases that would interest you most,

46
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:07.100
if you give me two or three minutes to answer is, uh, during the cold war,

47
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.060
1961, there were about 50 UFOs in formation,

48
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.420
flying south from Russia to the across Europe and the,

49
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.460
uh, Supreme allied commander was very concerned, um,

50
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.050
and about ready to press when they turned around and went back over the north

51
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:30.650
pole. So they decided to do an investigation. What does that see?

52
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.330
And they investigated for three years and they decided that, um,

53
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.090
with absolute certainty that four species,

54
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.320
four different species at least had been visiting this planet it

55
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.600
for thousands of years. So that's, uh,

56
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:52.200
we have a long history of UFOs and of course there's been a lot more activity in

57
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.840
the last, uh, few decades since, uh, uh,

58
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.680
we invented the atomic bomb. And they're very concerned about, uh,

59
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.480
about that and the fact that, uh,

60
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.200
we might use it again and because the whole cosmos is a unity

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.200
and it affects not just us, but other people in the cosmos they're, uh,

62
00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:15.040
very much afraid that we might be stupid enough to, uh,

63
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.240
start using atomic weapons again.

64
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.230
And this would be very add for us and for them as well.

65
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.510
<v 3>So no serious scientist has ever publicly confirmed evidence of an encounter</v>

66
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:30.430
with extraterrestrials. Why would scientists not confirm the fact if they exist?

67
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.450
<v 2>I'm,</v>

68
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.590
I'm afraid they must go out of their weight and not to find out because if they

69
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.590
did, you know,

70
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.060
even 10% of the amount of research I've done in the last eight years,

71
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.300
they would be as convinced as I am. I mean, they could do it even faster. Uh,

72
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.700
might take them a little longer when they didn't have a military background,

73
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.180
but, uh, there were so many wonderful books that tell these, these stories.

74
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.300
And, uh, and they've been authenticated. The,

75
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.050
the sightings have been authenticated by, uh, more than one witness and also by.

76
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.170
<v 0>Radar. Okay. It's the same horses. They've been authenticated by witnesses.</v>

77
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.010
That doesn't mean anything. There's no real video. There's no real photographs,

78
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:13.450
nothing looks good. Uh, a lot of people are talking about it,

79
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.250
but when you think about how many human beings there are,

80
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:19.890
there's 320 million plus in America. How many of them are crazy?

81
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.680
At least 1%. That's 3 million, 200,000 crazy people.

82
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.880
How many of 'em uh, really believe what they're saying at least half.

83
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.800
So you got a hundred. You, you got a lot of crazy people. Well.

84
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.960
<v 1>This is one video. So I I've watched a couple of his, and it's just,</v>

85
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:39.200
it's interesting to think about in terms of like, we're here.

86
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.480
<v 0>It's all interesting. Think about the,</v>

87
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.150
as soon as someone starts talking like that, he says they've been authenticated.

88
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:46.830
There was more than one witness. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that means nothing. Sure.

89
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:50.390
People are full. You just, I saw something doesn't mean anything you might have,

90
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.243
you might not have,

91
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.830
but if he's a hundred percent all in and he hasn't had a UFO experience himself,

92
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:56.710
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; then he's talking about that's fair. Well, then he,

93
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:59.990
then he seems gullible. Totally fair. I talk to a lot of those people.

94
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.260
I talk to those people that had been,

95
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.020
I talked to people that had implants pulled out of their body.

96
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.380
I talked to people that were experts. I.

97
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.420
<v 1>Have seen. Oh, oh, it's.</v>

98
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.340
<v 0>Gone. What does it say? You seen one. Yeah, sure.</v>

99
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.700
<v 1>He said he seen one &lt;laugh&gt; well, it's something that gives me,</v>

100
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.980
might thought. I don't know. I haven't seen one, but I'm curious he.

101
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.460
<v 0>To know, but what he just said, there did not impress me.</v>

102
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.130
Cuz he said that multiple people had seen it like more than one person had

103
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:27.130
confirmed it. That doesn't mean anything.

104
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.410
Like you could have five guys that lie.

105
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:31.370
That doesn't mean they might tell the truth. I.

106
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.890
<v 1>Don't think so. Italians call 'em UFOs. My people do they? Yeah. UFOs.</v>

107
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.810
Yeah. I've never heard that. That's a joke. Oh.

108
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.490
<v 0>Wow. Two in a row.</v>

109
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.680
<v 1>How'd I do. Harry Potter was a fail, but I came back around.</v>

110
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.320
It was an awful &lt;laugh&gt;.

111
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.520
<v 0>Are we still still friends? Yes. A hundred percent. It's not to dismiss.</v>

112
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.560
Thank God. It's not to dismiss the possibility of UFOs.

113
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.560
It's just that you gotta really be careful with how people talk about stuff.

114
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.360
Sure. You gotta be, you know,

115
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.360
if someone starts talking that they know something and they, well.

116
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.520
<v 1>That's, that's one video.</v>

117
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.920
I've watched a few of his videos and they were really interesting. He was,

118
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.840
he was speaking before Canadian Congress talking about this and um,

119
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.670
I I've watched a lot of it and entirety and it it's just worth thinking about

120
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.630
that's all. I don't know what the truth is. I I think sure please.

121
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.911
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

122
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.670
always just the fact that he has a lot of videos out there makes me wonder,

123
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.350
because that means that he's making a living doing this or this is a,

124
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.230
this is a gig. This is a thing he.

125
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.830
<v 1>Does not when you're you're um, speaking before the Canadian Congress.</v>

126
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.340
<v 0>Of course, if he does a bunch of these other interviews of well,</v>

127
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.860
and that allows him to speak in front of that's his thing. Sure.

128
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.380
His thing is I'm the guy who knows everything about UFOs. Right.

129
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.900
But if you were talking to scientists, they would say show us their evidence.

130
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.220
Right. Always there's nothing. That's the thing about these guys.

131
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:52.940
They all have stories and no one has any evidence. Yeah.

132
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.180
<v 1>I mean, I, I don't have the evidence, but it.</v>

133
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.730
<v 0>Feels good to think that they're out. Right.</v>

134
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.090
<v 1>Yeah. I wanna know. I wanna know stuff.</v>

135
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.130
I mean like look at all the that we have and we're here and all,

136
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.210
all the things that we, uh,

137
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.490
all the resources that we use and we're one planet in

138
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.250
a universe full of other planets.

139
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.810
<v 4>That's all there. It is way up there.</v>

140
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.160
<v 1>I'm not afraid to say that. I'm I'm curious. I'm I think everybody.</v>

141
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.360
<v 4>And I think people generally, it feels like a normal thing to be like, yeah,</v>

142
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.720
they're out there. But what I think is hard to accept,

143
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.880
I don't have hard evidence.

144
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.640
What's hard to accept is that they're communicating with us and only certain

145
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.360
people. Yeah. Like Paul hell or no.

146
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.160
<v 0>Well maybe he does know, and maybe he has seen something,</v>

147
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.350
but maybe he's full of. The problem is if you haven't seen it and I haven't,

148
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.030
or at least I don't think I have. And you're, you're talking about these things.

149
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.990
How much, how much time you spend thinking and talking about 'em like it, get,

150
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:49.790
it gets to become almost like a pathology.

151
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.510
Like why are you so invested in something that you don't even know is real,

152
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.710
but it becomes a thing that people are into,

153
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:58.910
like they're into baseball scores or they're into bowling. They get into UFO,

154
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.260
they get into it and then they start, I mean,

155
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:04.380
this dude's obviously making a career out of it. He's out there traveling. I.

156
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.060
<v 1>Don't know that. I mean, I that's something to,</v>

157
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.740
to investigate upon this conversation, but it makes,

158
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.020
it's made me think for years,

159
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:14.340
like I've seen some Paul Hellier videos and I'm just like, wow. Okay.

160
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.140
And it makes me think that's all maybe.

161
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.420
And it I'm cur I will always be curious about,

162
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.330
about aliens and psychics and all the.

163
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.530
<v 0>It's. So it's controversial.</v>

164
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.530
<v 1>In that way where it's like yes or no. I just don't know. But I,</v>

165
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.370
I don't to know. I'd love to keep learning.

166
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.970
<v 0>I would too. But I think that with guys like this,</v>

167
00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:34.610
when you're talking about a subject, that's this mercurial,

168
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.090
this is such a difficult subject.

169
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.210
I think it's very important to only talk about the actual facts. Sure.

170
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:40.044
Like what we know,

171
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.720
we don't know if he wants to talk about his own personal experience.

172
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.000
That's one thing. But when you start talking about stories that you heard, like,

173
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.940
okay,

174
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.440
people are full of from the beginning of time telling stupid stories about wear

175
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.320
wolves and vampires. I think that's.

176
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.520
<v 1>Saw a lot of damages done too. It's like, it's all, um,</v>

177
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.760
derivative passed down like, oh, I heard this from this and this and this,

178
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:01.640
but you weren't there. So you don't know mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, mm-hmm,

179
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:01.750
&lt;affirmative&gt;,

180
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.360
it's like I'm reading this book about our brains and how our recollection of

181
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.760
a memory of memories and like eyewitnesses are usually inaccurate, inaccurate,

182
00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:12.600
because you're, you don't really remember,

183
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:17.390
like you think you did and your brain lies to you and tells you that you saw

184
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:21.550
something a certain way. Right. And, and even that, like, I.

185
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.150
<v 0>Don't know, it, it, that's, that's very important for people to know.</v>

186
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:25.550
Absolutely, absolutely people,

187
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.270
a lot of people out there that think their memories are super.

188
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.390
<v 1>Accurate. Well, and this ties into being wrong. This ties into being like,</v>

189
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.750
I didn't see it the,

190
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.740
the way that I think I did and might have made a mistake and I'm sorry,

191
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.540
you know, like that's okay. That's important too,

192
00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:44.500
because I think a lot of times when you have some big statement about something

193
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.900
that you believe in, or, or, or like,

194
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.740
if you want to get down to having some sort of, uh, trial of this or that,

195
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.140
and you say, I remember it just like this.

196
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.730
<v 0>Right. It's and then you get dramatic and emotional and try to sell it.</v>

197
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.250
It's you're selling it like you're running for Congress.

198
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.730
It's it's $40,000 a day. Uh.

199
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:05.970
<v 1>Frightening. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>
