00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.420
Bring up Lancaster's or who I went with when I stayed in the NWT for that two

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.840
month timeframe, those guys live up there. I bet.

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:14.520
If you asked a Bart or a clay, Lancaster, how many times they've been blessed,

5
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.750
charred bluffed charged. It's like triple digits, like, well,

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.710
just hunting with those guys. The that they've done. Triple digits,

7
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:27.180
meaning a hundred times at a minimum and that's God. So like the,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.170
like the those guys deal with, they've been doing it since birth. Right?

9
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:35.670
And so I was telling 'em like, like Amy and Frank, I was like, okay,

10
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.280
you guys know how much I've done and all the different things, you know,

11
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.240
hunted and how many animals I put on the ground. It's a fraction clay.

12
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.490
Lancaster. Lancaster's been on 320 sheep hunts, 320. That's a lot.

13
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.730
That's not including caribou, moose. He's been all over the world.

14
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:53.640
So the amount of experience those guys have,

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.490
and the stories like when I get those guys on the podcast,

16
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:58.260
it's hilarious because I, you know,

17
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.020
I just got to experience the two and a half months section of it.

18
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.560
We were literally from, from a light bulb,

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.250
from a paved road hours, from any electricity,

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.300
like it's a 12 hour drive to where the helicopter picks you up.

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
And then you're flown in another two hours. So when I got bit by that bite,

22
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.400
it was funny. But spider, it was funny at first. Oh yeah.

23
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.920
I got bit by a spider up there. And uh, I'm like, Hey clay,

24
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:28.770
on my blind legs, up. I think that goodbye something. He's like, ah,

25
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:32.640
there's nothing poisonous up here. Well, my about died. My, uh,

26
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.240
my legs swelled up and we're drawing circles around it. Well,

27
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.420
the first couple of circles, right? Wasn't that big of a deal.

28
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.320
So clay cuts it open and listen to the podcast. He's hilarious.

29
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.300
Cause he squeezed that thing and I acted like it didn't hurt.

30
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:49.800
I thought I was gonna pass out from shock. So squeeze the POS out. Yeah.

31
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.390
I don't know that it helped, but it gave him pleasure because the spider was it.

32
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.750
Man. You got to listen to the podcast, hear the whole story.

33
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:59.390
But we ended up calling it the long, black hobo spider.

34
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:02.600
And there's a story by side that, but I think it was a hobo spider. Um,

35
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.810
those are dangerous. Yeah. But I don't think they're overly poisonous.

36
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:09.680
I think I was, uh, allergic to it. But the moral of the story in six hours,

37
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:13.520
my leg locked up straight. There was veins going up towards my heart. And uh,

38
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.360
I had cold sweats. Heart rate was racing and Clay's like, dude,

39
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.720
we gotta get you outta here. You're gonna die. Like we are a long, long,

40
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:23.510
long ways from anywhere how far

41
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.930
for our helicopter ride.

42
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:31.760
But then you're dealing with some up Northern part of white horse,

43
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:36.730
you know, I'm with doctor. It wouldn't have been good. So I called my, my,

44
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.850
my buddy, who's a medic. And I was like, dude, what should we do? And he's like,

45
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.860
all right, on it. Bleach ibuprofen, get some. Yeah.

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.370
Cause I guess I'm like bleach cleans everything out. Like he's given me.

47
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:52.400
I can't remember. I don't know what to draw.

48
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.703
<v 1>Exactly.</v>

49
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.060
<v 0>But I was like, holy. I was like, okay, so we're pouring pee.</v>

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.330
It we're like crushing up ibuprofen.

51
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.110
<v 2>And then you gotta, do you pour piano? Did you let your buddy piano?</v>

52
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.550
So here's the thing. One of my buddies.

53
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.810
<v 0>We had a big Johnson because he was ready to pee on it right there.</v>

54
00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:11.790
And I'm like, dude, pee in a bottle. I'm again,

55
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.580
I don't want to see your Wiener while you're peeing on my leg. And so.

56
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.360
<v 2>They want it right off the tap somehow or another it's better if he pees in a</v>

57
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:20.190
bottle and then pours it on you, it would have been awkward.

58
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.490
<v 0>And think of the stories that have been told after the stories.</v>

59
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.430
<v 1>Well way were pouring pee on my leg.</v>

60
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.110
<v 2>It was a matter of survival.</v>

61
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.030
Isn't that funny that you'd rather have a guy pee in a bottle and then pee,

62
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.230
then pour that pee on you, then pee on you. I guess looking at it that way.

63
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.560
Yeah, I get it. Yeah. I feel like I'm right there with you. I understand your,

64
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.100
your thought process. Well, I think I'd let the guy on me though.

65
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.820
<v 0>At the time I was like not overly worried.</v>

66
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.210
And then when my leg locked up, um it's so it was,

67
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.040
if you measured my leg, it gained two and a quarter in circumference inches.

68
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.060
That's how much my legs swelled up. Oh wow. That's a lot. Yeah, it was. I mean,

69
00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm laughing about it now, but what was funny is once it went back down,

70
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:05.940
we just duct tape towels around my calf muscle to go on moose hunts.

71
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.840
Cause it was so painful when the infection was going down because of the willows

72
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.220
were beating it up and I'm like,

73
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.580
I really want to see somebody 70 inch wide moose. Let's just take.

74
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.380
So we take towels around my kid.

75
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.110
<v 2>So you never made it out of there? No.</v>

76
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.930
So you just dealt with it while you were in the woods? Yeah. It went away.

77
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.350
<v 0>In like 24 hours. Oh yeah. It wasn't that it wasn't.</v>

78
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.970
<v 2>But you didn't think it was going to,</v>

79
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.720
you thought you were going to die and I don't want to make it sound worse than

80
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:32.190
it was it got a little nerve wracking.

81
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.760
<v 0>There towards the end. My heart started racing. Like, and I'm like,</v>

82
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.470
so your body's not good. Want.

83
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.330
<v 2>An infection? Infections are dangerous, man. I had veins going up my leg,</v>

84
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.470
but you got to see the vein. So.

85
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.230
<v 0>You're saying that's what clay was talking about it. Cause that was.</v>

86
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.020
<v 2>Great. Of course you have veins going up your leg. That's how you get blood.</v>

87
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.620
Yeah.

88
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.970
<v 0>And it showed them a lot. So they were blue or something like an extra sketch,</v>

89
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.630
um, going up my leg. Dark. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So.

90
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.850
<v 2>You were worried that the infection was making its way to your heart?</v>

91
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.120
<v 0>Well, from what limited knowledge I had was that,</v>

92
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:05.850
is this pretty much sure thing you're going to die. Yeah.

93
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.710
<v 2>Any antibiotics with you or anything when you go into a hunt like that?</v>

94
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.780
<v 0>I do. When I go to Canada now because of their weird government, I, I, I, uh,</v>

95
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.520
I shouldn't even say this. I have friends.

96
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.440
That'll prescribe them to me to take with me now last, uh,

97
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.330
in 18.

98
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.400
I don't remember my hands look like Deadpool's face from that milkweed or some.

99
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.170
I was that happens in the back country. What happened?

100
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.180
So I'm on that mule deer hunt and my hands were swelling up and I don't know

101
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:42.090
why. And they look like Deadpool's face and I'm like,

102
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.800
what the hell is wrong with my hands?

103
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:46.470
I'm looking around like what could be around me?

104
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.480
It's not poison Ivy and my hands are swelling up. Like a, remember that movie.

105
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.810
Um, big trouble in little China, the Asian dudes hands swell up. Yeah.

106
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.720
It looked like that. Well, as it turns out, it's um,

107
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.430
hogweed or milkweed on some plant that does that.

108
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.880
And if you, if you, now, if you Google it and you pull it up and it's nasty,

109
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.170
but if you want to Google, um, hogweed on certain humans,

110
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.320
it has this crazy rash inflammation.

111
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.640
So my hands it's affected by sunlight. It's worse.

112
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:24.560
So I'm at 13,000 feet and I'm on the spotter with my hands in the sun

113
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.630
all day to a point like.

114
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.080
<v 2>13,000 Feet. The sun is way stronger. Yeah. Yeah. Like we got really burnt up.</v>

115
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:32.380
These.

116
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.250
<v 0>Are solar charger.</v>

117
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:36.130
It charges up your twice as fast because you're that close to this stuff.

118
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.490
<v 2>Is that really what it's from? Or is it just a lack of, oh my God.</v>

119
00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:42.460
Look at that giant. Hogweed look at the hands.

120
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.850
<v 3>It wasn't good. Let me tell you, so my shoes look like those ones. Yeah.</v>

121
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.480
Blow that.

122
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.500
<v 2>Picture up in the right-hand corner. That is crazy. The one,</v>

123
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:53.470
the one that you see the large picture. The one. Yeah. Look at that.

124
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.600
What the man? That's from Holly.

125
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.640
<v 0>So go to the, go to the left. Um, the one in the middle there. That's what my.</v>

126
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.750
<v 2>Hands look like. Well, the one in the middle, the left that one. Yep.</v>

127
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.620
<v 0>They look like that. So Frank comes over and he's like, dude,</v>

128
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:11.410
what the hell is wrong with your hand? And I'm like, you know, that's a good,

129
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.060
good question. So we, we come out cause I, I dude, it was bad.

130
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.900
And I go to the doctor. Right. And I'm like, you know,

131
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.390
I go to the emergency room and I'm like, Hey, I.

132
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.370
<v 2>What does that hogweed look like? Just so I know.</v>

133
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.950
<v 4>Some people have gotten third degree burns from it. Whoa. It's not good.</v>

134
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.590
Can we see an image? It's like a little plant.

135
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.810
<v 2>Yeah. That's it. That stuff. That's beautiful. Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.450
And I was low crawling through that. Oh my God. Giant.

137
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:41.920
Hogweed and it's toxic cousins. Wow.

138
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.170
That's crazy. So, but those are the things you.

139
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.510
<v 0>Just don't think about. Right. So I went and they gave me,</v>

140
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:47.980
I don't know all kinds of steroid cream and.

141
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.890
And it went away in a day or two and we hiked back in.

142
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.490
<v 2>Soon as I like a flower, I would have never imagined. So this is just,</v>

143
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.150
how did he get on both your hands, your hands just rubbed up against it.

144
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.100
<v 0>There's big fields of it.</v>

145
00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:04.810
And I've got my bow hanging and I'm low crawling and oh.

146
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.260
<v 2>So to mitigate that, what do you do? Do you wear gloves?</v>

147
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.990
Is there something you can put on your hands? I don't know.

148
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.790
I just look at tolerance. is.

149
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.160
<v 0>Yeah. I just kept my hands out of the weeds the next year.</v>

150
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.380
<v 2>Toxic giant hogweed plants show up in Duncan lake. I don't know.</v>

151
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.210
You just made it to big lake coward. Chan Gazette. Hmm. Yeah.

152
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.240
Where's that Duncan. And now look at the size of that.

153
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.650
This is like nine feet tall.

154
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.860
<v 0>Well, where I was at, it was three foot tall. Right. About even with your hands.</v>

155
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:33.640
So perfect.

156
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.470
<v 2>Yeah. So just that weed has like some sort of an oil or something like that.</v>

157
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:41.140
That's what they said. The doctors and Ivy type deal. Yeah.

158
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.630
<v 0>Well it's funny. Cause when I went, they had no idea. I'm like, Hey,</v>

159
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.390
my buddy from Alaska messaged me. And he said, dude,

160
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:50.560
I think that's hogweed Mike wasn't same reaction. You did his dog.

161
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.400
We Googled it, drove across the road. Kaiser's uh,

162
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.970
whatever emergency room things like right across the road from Cafaro.

163
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.300
I drove over there and I'm like, Hey, you know, I'm all screwed up.

164
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.550
And they're like, what is, you know, they don't know what it is. And I'm like,

165
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.240
Hey, this is what I think it is. They Google it just like we did.

166
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.540
And they were like, oh, well that makes sense. Cause they didn't know.

167
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.480
And then they gave me like the steroid cream to put on it and I don't know,

168
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:14.420
went away in a couple of days. Jesus.

169
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.560
<v 2>Christ. So between that and the bite, what was worse?</v>

170
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.900
Oh the bite, the bite was that much worse.

171
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.310
<v 0>I could have kept hunting with that. I just not knowing what it was. Well,</v>

172
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:28.070
we'd been in there 12 days. I'm like, oh, it's about time to come out. Anyway.

173
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:32.300
So we came out what was crazy. We came out a couple of days.

174
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.110
We go back in and Frank's already got his deer.

175
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.830
We go back in and Frank, I thought his appendix burst his,

176
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:43.130
it turns out he just stayed too much sushi and it got clogged up in his stomach.

177
00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:46.550
But Frank is harder than woodpecker lips. We get on this.

178
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.880
These two deer were trying to get and uh, he's not getting out of the tent.

179
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.960
And so Frank is not like that. And he's like, uh, I hear him go, sir.

180
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.930
<v 3>I'm going to stay in a tent this morning. And I'm like, dude.</v>

181
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.300
<v 0>You good count. Keep in mind.</v>

182
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.430
Frank got pulmonary edema and that dumb hiked out with pulmonary

183
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:08.030
edema. Um, he literally his lungs filled up with, uh,

184
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.000
liquid and that's an altitude sickness, right? Altitude sickness.

185
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.170
And that hiked out nine miles with pulmonary DEMA. Jesus Christ. He,

186
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:18.140
when he got back he'd cough and it was like MP in a water bottle.

187
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.820
<v 1>So, uh.</v>

188
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.690
<v 0>He's a tough individual. So I'm like, dude, this guy, I even texted Amy.</v>

189
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:27.320
I'm like, Hey, Frank's up. I might, I might have to hit the beacon.

190
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.240
Like I might have to, I might have to get help. So anyway, I go over,

191
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.970
I shoot this deer. So it was just sushi.

192
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.710
<v 2>So where did you guys eat sushi in Denver the day before. So.</v>

193
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.250
<v 0>I think what had happened, we had starved ourselves for 12 days, right.</v>

194
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.140
Dehydration. And he must be in the woods. We came out, you know,

195
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:48.501
I took,

196
00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:52.520
we all went out to dinner and I think he ate all that white rice and it just

197
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:55.100
clung to his intestines, like a wooly mammoth,

198
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.650
because he ended up just having to take a big poop. Right.

199
00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:01.670
But right in the middle where, you know, your appendix is, he's like,

200
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:04.730
it hurts right here and I've had gallbladder issues. I got, I had,

201
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:08.720
I passed a kidney stone, like six miles in. So I was like,

202
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.890
he's appendix is erupt. He's going to die back here.

203
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.980
And so it's show you how the, you know, the

204
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.040
Moxie that Frank has,

205
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.000
he drug his out of that tent and filmed me shooting at mule deer.

206
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.770
And he hobbled his over there after I shot it and it's mile and a half from

207
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:31.850
where he's glass and flagging me in. And he just sat by the deer,

208
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.970
I cut it up whatever. And I'm like, dude, I'll get most of it. You good?

209
00:11:34.971 --> 00:11:38.180
And he's like, yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. And I'm like,

210
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.870
I can tell you're not okay. Like you're in pain. And he,

211
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.040
he made it out and then he took the poop and everything was okay. But it, uh,

212
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.890
I thought he was gonna, I thought I was gonna have to have the beacon.

213
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.650
<v 2>That's so bizarre that it was just from rice and poop.</v>

214
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.950
<v 0>Well, we're not doctors, but that's, I chalked.</v>

215
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.830
<v 2>It up to because he made sure it wasn't food poisoning.</v>

216
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.350
<v 0>He wasn't puking. That was the only thing. But again, I'm not a doctor,</v>

217
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.520
but every time I've had it.

218
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.520
<v 2>Puke. So those are the worst experiences.</v>

219
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.250
What about injuries you ever get like really hurt out there?

220
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.310
<v 0>Um, I'm trying to think the kidney stone. That was a bad one. You had that out.</v>

221
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.450
Oh. That was horrible. Um, how did, was it no,

222
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.030
I'll tell the quick version of it. Um,

223
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.450
I think it was 10 days into a hunt and I shot a mule deer and hydrated. Yeah.

224
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.830
And I peed blood and of course like an idiot and I'm like, ah, it's fine.

225
00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:29.190
Whatever. And go hiked the mule deer out, turned around. I, I met a buddy,

226
00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:30.660
dropped it off and then hiked back in.

227
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.880
And then like that night or the night after I was, um,

228
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.580
it was pretty high elevation. But anyway,

229
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:41.730
I went after this bull and something like knock loose in my kid, you know,

230
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:44.880
I didn't know what it was just all of a sudden I had this shooting pain and I

231
00:12:44.881 --> 00:12:47.550
looked at the dude that dude on the green mile trying to pee. Right.

232
00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:51.840
And I'm like, what the is going on? Like I literally I'm like,

233
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.630
I'm going to pass out from shock. What the hell is wrong?

234
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.940
<v 2>Do you think it was a kidney stone? I didn't.</v>

235
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.860
<v 0>Even, I didn't know. Right. I just, I didn't,</v>

236
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.400
it was so much pain in my back area that I knew it had something to do with my

237
00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:06.180
kidneys. But every time I tried to pee,

238
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.380
I literally would drop me to my knees. And so I was like, okay,

239
00:13:10.381 --> 00:13:13.290
let's assess this. And I'm trying to think through,

240
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.220
should I take next to no gear and try and hike out,

241
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.630
take enough gear to stay the night, but didn't have the burden of the weight.

242
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.351
You know what?

243
00:13:22.351 --> 00:13:25.320
What's going to be the best option because I didn't have any service and I

244
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:26.850
didn't have a big,

245
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.910
I didn't have anything back with me that I could get ahold of anyone.

246
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.240
And so I'm like, it, no guts, no glory.

247
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.390
I grabbed the basic essentials and hobbled my out.

248
00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:39.300
And at one point I did have a phone by them service.

249
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.020
I texted my buddy Tony and said, Hey,

250
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.150
what is the nearest hospital to this Trailhead? And I lost service.

251
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.050
And so all he knew was I'm up.

252
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.640
So I get to the trail head and I get my Jeep and I had a giant Jeep and I'm

253
00:13:56.641 --> 00:14:00.090
doing like 90 down the road and I get pulled over. Well,

254
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:03.750
the cop was looking for me because my buddy had called and said,

255
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:07.140
I don't know what's going on. Well, a cop was kind of a Dick, right. He,

256
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.120
I get out and I'm like, Hey man, I'm he wanted to call an ambulance.

257
00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:14.010
And I'm like, look, dude, I just hiked out six miles.

258
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.520
I'm not paying $3,500 for a ambulance ride. I just hiked six miles out.

259
00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:22.140
I can make it to the hospital. And so he was a little bit of a, of a Dick,

260
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.830
but he followed me into the hospital and I passed it. Um, I dunno,

261
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.330
clinic in the toilet thinking pink. And it looked like a checkup. No,

262
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:35.100
but it would look like a Chickopee um, oh, chick pea, little spiky,

263
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:37.410
little bastard. Yeah. It was horrible looking.

264
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.820
<v 2>Um, how big was it? Not very big. Uh, but you know, in the BB, your Dick hole,</v>

265
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.160
holy moly man. Going through.

266
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.970
<v 0>That, what was crazy is right. Yeah. After that, uh, I was good to go. I mean,</v>

267
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.790
once you passed it, I was fine. I went, I hiked back in the next day.
