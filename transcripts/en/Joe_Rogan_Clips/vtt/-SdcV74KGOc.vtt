00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Think about some jobs like lumber, Jack,</v>

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.240
like a lumberjack. You immediately think of a giant man.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.760
<v 1>I think of a paper towel giant. Yes. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.000
<v 0>That did that for that job. He was a lumber Jack, right? The paper towel guy.</v>

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.080
<v 1>Was he, a guy is not a giant. He maybe is a normal man. Bunion.</v>

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.990
<v 0>Is not the on guy. I look was, it is the Brony guy,</v>

7
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:25.190
a rip off of the Paul bunion character. Well, Paul bunion is like the,

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.270
the fair tale, whatever. But what is,

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.790
are we imagining the Brony guy incorrectly?

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.390
I have a feeling he's just a regular sized guy. I think he just.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.230
<v 1>A handsome, he's the kind of guy, men and women.</v>

12
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.390
<v 0>Wanna. That's right. He's like a Mar bro man type character. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.180
he would be the guy that starts the orgy and the LSD camp. Yeah, it's a regular.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.960
Oh, he is clean.

15
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.820
<v 1>Now. He looks like Teddy from.</v>

16
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.980
<v 0>It's just a perspective thing. Oh there's. Well, I remember there's water guy,</v>

17
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.700
but the other that's what I'm saying. Yeah.

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.700
<v 1>There we go. I know.</v>

19
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.380
<v 0>This guy, guy with the mustache,</v>

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.780
the guy with the mustache and the left hand side. Yeah.

21
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.300
He's just a regular size guy with some trees behind him. The guy.

22
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.620
<v 1>No, the, the,</v>

23
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.090
the guy in the top two is at the same guy or is that different mustache.

24
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.930
<v 0>Guys? The new guy is, uh, that, that.</v>

25
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.490
<v 1>Guy is, he died of HIV sadly. And that's why we had this new.</v>

26
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.690
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; like,</v>

27
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.330
how did I don't understand why they got rid of the old Brony guy made a totally

28
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:15.530
different guy, a Brony guy?

29
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.410
Cause this Brony guy looks like he lives in long island. And uh, yeah.

30
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.330
<v 1>He, he.</v>

31
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.880
<v 0>Looks like Adam, he owns a travel company, something &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

32
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.320
He's got a, like one of them, uh, second market ticket sales companies. Yeah.

33
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:32.840
They had a.

34
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.800
<v 1>Thing at strength has no gender. What.</v>

35
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.400
<v 0>Is that? It's a bro. Is that a Brony commercial please? Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:43.150
don't say that's real. Yeah. Yeah. Strength has no gender. That's true.

37
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.863
I guess.

38
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.150
<v 1>Why are they in the why that looks really like a lesbian book club of some kind</v>

39
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.910
like look at the.

40
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.950
<v 0>There are definitely women that are stronger than some men. Yeah. Well, I get.</v>

41
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.470
<v 1>It, but I don't know why I don't. First of all, I don't even why,</v>

42
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.470
why a paper towel would tell me.

43
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.460
<v 0>Anything? Well, not only that, Isaac, it,</v>

44
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.740
assuming that I don't think that women are strong. It's assuming it.

45
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:09.340
That's why they have that. Well, it's not, it's not.

46
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.140
It says strength has no gender. Okay. Listen.

47
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.260
<v 1>It's our women. It's our.</v>

48
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.660
<v 0>Women. But listen, what if it was us? What if it's a,</v>

49
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.420
a bunch of meathead looking men standing there and said, strength has no gender.

50
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.770
Be like, you. Right. you. We know you're strong. Right?

51
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.610
Stop. Stop. Women are strong too. Like, okay, I didn't say you were.

52
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.490
I just said, strength has no gender. And here's me and.

53
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.090
<v 1>My friend that somebody in marketing that's like the, the,</v>

54
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.730
whoever does the marketing. They're like,

55
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:38.890
what do women who are the Don Drapers that go, what do women want? There's a,

56
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.370
like, they're they are angry. They don't think they're strong. Like, that's the,

57
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.160
that's the purely, it's like the dumb dad on the sitcom thing.

58
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.640
That's just like a thing that's been going on for, I don't know, forever.

59
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:50.960
That image, that insulting.

60
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.600
<v 0>Yeah. They're teaching you about life while they're selling you paper towels.</v>

61
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.160
<v 1>Because every woman is an engineer. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

62
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.480
<v 0>But that picture go back to that picture.</v>

63
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.320
I would feel so sold out if I was a guy and I was really into Brony. Cause I.

64
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.720
<v 1>Kind of looked like the Brony guy and then I go to buy my Brony towels.</v>

65
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.720
And there's three chicks. If you were still position,

66
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.080
if you felt like the Brony guy, but literally.

67
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.990
<v 0>It's like pregnant men. Okay. The guys a lumberjack,</v>

68
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.550
I would assume most lumberjacks are, are,

69
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.430
are probably big strong men.

70
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.150
<v 1>You don't think he became a gay kind of icon. I mean,</v>

71
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.350
I understand the saying the idea.

72
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.270
<v 0>That they have three female lumberjacks three.</v>

73
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.310
<v 1>Well, you do the job of one man.</v>

74
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.980
&lt;laugh&gt; that was a lo you've got a, for the grand slam.

75
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.580
He has to Jack the lumber of one full man.

76
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.340
This is gonna take three of these strong ladies. It's just.

77
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.100
<v 0>What are the percentages of women that are lumber Jackson?</v>

78
00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:51.180
What's the likelihood of three of them being on a team.

79
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.060
<v 1>It looks in, in that picture, he looks like a guy who's about to take a off.</v>

80
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.340
And by.

81
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.500
<v 0>The way, this is an ignorant question.</v>

82
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.890
I I'm aware if you're a female lumberjack and you're mad at mere right now.

83
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.010
I'm sorry. I don't know anybody. That's a female lumberjack. I'm just ask,

84
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.770
just asking questions. They mean they're wearing lumberjack clothes.

85
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.370
That's what a lumberjack wear. I'm assuming are you posing shirt? What is this?

86
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.810
Is.

87
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.570
<v 1>This stole Val, if you have it is stolen.</v>

88
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.130
<v 0>It's stolen valor. Is it stolen? Valor?</v>

89
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.930
Are you pretending you're out there carrying trees?

90
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.160
<v 1>You wearing a lumber. Jack shirt is stolen valid. It's stolen valid.</v>

91
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.880
<v 0>These aren't lumber jacks. These are models.</v>

92
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.720
These are hot chicks with nice nails.

93
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.000
They're not out there carrying trees and. You.

94
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.080
<v 1>Know, they could, by the way that girl, they're not,</v>

95
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.360
you I'll tell you what the women that do do that job.

96
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.680
I promise they're not gonna put on the paper towel.

97
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.600
&lt;laugh&gt; there's you're right. They look like you there's. Yeah.

98
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.230
Just put a wig on the guy.

99
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.510
<v 0>Look at that one. Lady with her sleeves rolled up. Are you about to go to work?</v>

100
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.230
Look at her, go to that picture, click on that. She's got this really thin body.

101
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.910
This really thin arms. And she's got her sleeves rolled up with her flan shirt,

102
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:57.070
flannel shirt on in front of a bunch of trees. Are you about to chop trees down?

103
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:00.550
Ma'am because you weigh 90 pounds. I, you get.

104
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.500
<v 1>Out of the,</v>

105
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.060
I think the idea is to make you think that you feel like a lumberjack while

106
00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:07.660
you're wiping your counter down is the, is what they're trying to do.

107
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.300
I think we need.

108
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.940
<v 0>To be more respectful about what the it means to be a lumberjack.</v>

109
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.380
I would think you,

110
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.060
you would think that that would be romantic until you did that job.

111
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.940
Eight hours a day, five days a week and your body broken down,

112
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.330
cuz you're carrying logs on your shoulder. It you're chopping at trees.

113
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.410
<v 1>Oh my God. Was your father a lumberjack? Cause I was very.</v>

114
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.850
<v 0>This is what I feel. You, you can't pretend you're a lumber Jack.</v>

115
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.490
You can't take a hot model and cover a face with a little bit of coal powder and

116
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:38.090
pretend she's a coal miner in West Virginia getting black lung.

117
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.800
You can't cuz she's not. If you.

118
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.880
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;, that sounds like a great point. Best.</v>

119
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.800
<v 0>I believe you. You're not a lumber Jack lady and that guy. Okay.</v>

120
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.280
Brony. What, what if that was for Simak and uh, he was breastfeeding.

121
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.463
What about that?

122
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.400
<v 1>But that would be hilarious. Just as.</v>

123
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.360
<v 0>Likely as that lady being a lumberjack,</v>

124
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.000
&lt;laugh&gt; just as likely that the Brony guy is breastfeeding.

125
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.960
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah, I think.</v>

126
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.173
<v 0>Yes.</v>

127
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.680
Just as likely lumberjack is a brutal physical

128
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.240
it's. If a woman's doing it, that woman's gonna be jacked.

129
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.990
She's gonna be strong as the.

130
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.790
<v 1>What's the one that, uh, Jean shirt.</v>

131
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.783
<v 0>I just left it with that.</v>

132
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.070
<v 1>Less issues. What's the one that kicked off the whole like uh, oh,</v>

133
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.150
the Gillette one, like the one that kicked off the whole, uh, uh,

134
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.110
like men advertising. What was that one? You know the Gillette. I don't,

135
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:35.750
I don't who's a while ago. It's that? Did I miss it?

136
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.980
<v 0>It was like I some outrage. Yeah, we.</v>

137
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.460
<v 1>Talked about it. I'm sure you must have talked about it. Which one was it?</v>

138
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.620
It was Hal. It was about, uh, Gillette. The man can get,

139
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.700
is this the best a man can get? And then they would,

140
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.700
and it was like the me too movement.

141
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.740
Time's up the guy's looking in the mirror himself and then it, it cuts. Do you.

142
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.420
<v 0>Don't remember this? Oh, now remember it now I remember it. Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.170
It was preposterous. I am pretty high. So no, no, no. I remember it now. I,

144
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.450
I blocked it out like a childhood molestation.

145
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.330
<v 1>Well then there was like a, a fake debate. All these people are like,</v>

146
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.970
I'm never buying, you know, people are tweeting,

147
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:14.210
they're throwing out their razors. And um, somebody told me like,

148
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:17.610
it it's brilliant because it's to the women who are buying the razors,

149
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:21.360
but he is the thing. The women are buying RA. They're not into that. Either.

150
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.480
The, a woman that's buying razors for a man is also not into the Gillette ad.

151
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.240
So whoever's in charge of the marketing. They it's their entire like.

152
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.720
<v 0>What do you think that is?</v>

153
00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:34.720
Do you think that's like someone who decides they're gonna cash in? Yeah.

154
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.920
Well it's that? And they just say,

155
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.070
maybe there's an opportunity here to make some money and oh dude.

156
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.190
<v 1>Wait, well you okay? I totally forgot. &lt;laugh&gt; what, what, what do you remember?</v>

157
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.630
Look at this. The guy men with their sick. Now,

158
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:49.990
did you see what they just showed? It's.

159
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.910
<v 0>Like a, the guy put his hand on her shoulder. No.</v>

160
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.910
<v 1>It was a sitcom, right?</v>

161
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:57.470
Where a white guy grabs his black maids and it's all men in the ocean going ha

162
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:00.420
ha ha. What show is that? The,

163
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.900
the guy would just grab his MAs and everyone was like, yay.

164
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.540
<v 0>Is there a show like that? Maybe married with children? No, look at, even then,</v>

165
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.420
let me see it again. That's fake, but that's so fake.

166
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.940
<v 1>That's a bizarre dynamic.</v>

167
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.980
<v 0>But it's, you're right. You're dead. Right?</v>

168
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:19.060
Because it's a recreation of something that didn't really happen. What.

169
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.290
<v 1>Is that supposed to be an example of?</v>

170
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.570
That's not even like a mashup of anything I've ever seen, but.

171
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.490
<v 0>It's like, they made a fake TV show. Yeah. That's.</v>

172
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.690
<v 1>Where that's like, here's an example of the type of shows you like,</v>

173
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.330
no one was watching that, but.

174
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.810
<v 0>That's not even a show. Right. That's why it's so weird. It's not even. Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.010
So it's like a straw man show. The whole.

176
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.130
<v 1>Thing is a strong.</v>

177
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.800
<v 0>Right. But I mean that if they're, but that's a weird way of doing it.</v>

178
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:45.000
Is that what they were depicting? Were they depicting a fake sitcom? Yeah. Fake.

179
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.120
It seemed like it. Right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; which, I mean,

180
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.480
it seemed like it was Well,

181
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.360
the weird is that they don't have a real example. How weird is that?

182
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.640
This is like on a fake set right there. There he is. Oh yeah. How weird is.

183
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.473
<v 1>That guy?</v>

184
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.400
Like not even a puppet did like that on one of the puppet sitcoms from the.

185
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.180
<v 0>Nineties.</v>

186
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.320
And that's weird too guy put his hand on that girl's shoulder and she had this

187
00:09:06.321 --> 00:09:08.120
weird look in her face. Like, oh my.

188
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.080
<v 1>God. I know that's the craziest, like if a woman,</v>

189
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.440
I thought it was a Joe Biden campaign. &lt;laugh&gt;.

190
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.350
<v 0>If you were with the woman and she put her hand on your shoulder,</v>

191
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.790
like that you'd be, it would be nothing. Um.

192
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.590
<v 1>Right. Yeah. Well it, it's not a good, well,</v>

193
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.070
it's not a good example to put in your ad. I look in a real situation like, Hey,

194
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.150
I felt this weird thing.

195
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.590
I'm sure there could be a situation that someone puts their hand on your

196
00:09:30.591 --> 00:09:34.110
shoulder and it's weird, right? Oh yeah. Not automatically. Or, or.

197
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.940
<v 0>That you're they insulted you. Yeah. And then they put their hand on your.</v>

198
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.020
<v 1>Shoulder. Why are you putting this?</v>

199
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.100
The whole point that I can't get past is why the is just,

200
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.700
why are you talking about this now? Why.

201
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.660
<v 0>Arm? Why aren't you telling me how great your razors are? You. You.</v>

202
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.540
<v 1>Should be begging me to buy your RA. You moron. What.</v>

203
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.373
<v 0>Are you doing?</v>

204
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.340
<v 1>They think it causes teaching people. No.</v>

205
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.850
Cuz then you talk about it like on a podcast. Right? And then they're like, see,

206
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.730
you've got engagement. That doesn't mean people are gonna buy this.

207
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.930
<v 0>I'm not gonna not buy it. I just think some marketing person up.</v>

208
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.490
I don't think it's representative of the whole company. Um,

209
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.850
it's some marketing person. They just, they decided they were gonna like, yeah.

210
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:13.410
Right. Hatch or hitch a ride onto the back of this movement. A.

211
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.370
<v 1>Bunch of things did. Yeah, for.</v>

212
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.480
<v 0>Sure. A ton. Isn't that weird when they do that, it's like, like,</v>

213
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.160
it's you think I'm so stupid. I'm not gonna know what you're doing. That.

214
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.400
<v 1>You're cause statistically you are that Stu they have some kind of research</v>

215
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:27.960
where they're like, yes you are statistically. It's like the,

216
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.640
the letter from Nigeria to,
