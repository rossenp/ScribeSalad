WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Did you have any striking experience before that? No.</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.100
<v 1>Just to seaside boardwalk that's about it.</v>

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.010
<v 0>So what,</v>

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:15.960
what was it like going from just straight wrestling to learning how to strike

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:16.830
and wrestle together?

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.730
<v 1>It was, uh, it was learning process, you know, early in my career.</v>

7
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.520
I was able to take everybody down in those early fights, but, uh,

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.490
I had some pretty good fights even before UFC. I fought, uh

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.910
[inaudible] he was, uh, this Ukraine site fight. I don't know.

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.480
He fought and WC. Um, he beat some good guys, so he was decent.

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.130
I was able to take him down. Then I fought Jim Miller,

12
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:42.690
actually my last fight for UFC. No. Yeah. We had a crazy fight. Um,

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.400
so, you know, I, I had good opponents right away, but, uh, the striking,

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.130
you know, it it's something that I really liked.

15
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.740
I was always in the box and growing up, I was always in the fight and I,

16
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:56.160
you know, jerseys, you know, I'm not from the hood or by any means,

17
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.560
but w everyone fights where I'm from, you know, it's kind of like,

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.290
everyone goes to seaside, look for fights. That's kind of the nature of it.

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.500
Yeah. I mean, you hear Joey Diaz talking about it. So.

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.550
<v 0>Uh, Jim Miller is a beast. He is a beast.</v>

21
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.240
I'm so glad he's healthy now because that guy struggled for so long.

22
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.640
<v 1>Yeah. My wife has it actually does. She, she's been dealing with it since 2007.</v>

23
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.910
<v 0>And everybody gets it on the east coast. It's crazy how many people have it?</v>

24
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.530
And it's just, they say that, uh, there, there was a, we did this, this,

25
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.630
we looked at this map online of all the areas in the east coast where Lyme

26
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:34.530
disease is prevalent and how, what percentage of the ticks have it it's bananas,

27
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.960
right?

28
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.040
<v 1>Yeah. You it's it's, my wife's neurotic would it too. Cause you know,</v>

29
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.420
she's had to go through a bunch of, you know, treatments and whatnot. And.

30
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.370
<v 0>I was still with her right now.</v>

31
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.850
<v 1>It is, it's not as much, but she's got like a couple months of issues,</v>

32
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.900
like auto immune stuff, you know? And, um, she's calm.

33
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.890
She's doing she's does the IV treatments, the sunlight therapy.

34
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.130
It's like when they take the blood out, run it through UV, then put it back in.

35
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:01.830
Yeah. Oh yeah. She's done a lot, a lot of that stuff and she loves,

36
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.270
she's starting to feel better. Um.

37
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.030
<v 0>I think he changed his diet. I think that was a big one.</v>

38
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:07.410
Just really start eating clean.

39
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.200
<v 1>Yeah. My wife eats pretty clean she's she's uh, you know,</v>

40
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:12.150
kind of holistic type person.

41
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.920
<v 0>Yeah. Um, the,</v>

42
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.870
the Lyme disease thing's terrifying because for a long time they were

43
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.370
diagnosing it incorrectly.

44
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.760
Like people didn't know whether it was one disease and people would come in with

45
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:24.900
all sorts of aches and pains.

46
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.920
And if they didn't have that big bulls-eye mark on them or the tick bit them,

47
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.080
the doctor really had no idea what was going on.

48
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:33.090
And some doctors didn't have a lot of experience with it.

49
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.170
<v 1>I got it when I was young, I was just, yeah, but I've seen the tick.</v>

50
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.890
So I got on medicine right away and I was fine, but they say,

51
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:43.530
if you don't see the tick and then you still know you have it.

52
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.600
And then if you don't get on medicine right away, then you're.

53
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.860
I was in here for probably ever even say like,

54
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.290
it's not even the Lyme's disease. It's the other,

55
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.450
other diseases that get attached to it. Yeah.

56
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.180
<v 0>Yes. Well, there's the thing called more jealous.</v>

57
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:00.640
Have you ever heard of more Jones or jealous is a disease that a lot of people

58
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.490
think is like a, like a psychological disease.

59
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.590
They think that like you're imagining things.

60
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.620
Cause they would imagine that like fibers were growing out of their scabs and

61
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.290
they'd scratch themselves like crazy. Right. But I had some good insight. We,

62
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:15.780
we did a television show called Joe Rogan questions, everything. Yeah. And we,

63
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:16.614
we had some,

64
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.080
one of the conversations I had was with a doctor who has Lyme disease.

65
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:23.230
And that's when things got interesting because he was aware of it,

66
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.830
not just as a person who has the disease, but also as a doctor. And he said,

67
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.970
one thing that all these people that have more ones have in common is that they

68
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:31.960
all have Lyme disease.

69
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.430
And he thinks that Lyme disease is not just one thing that it's a host of other

70
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.940
things that are attached to Lyme disease, like, um,

71
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.500
non identified pathogens and that some of them

72
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.390
have some sort of neurotoxic effect that changes the way you see

73
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:53.020
things. So he was seeing things like that. Weren't there,

74
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.320
like he was seeing worms crawling around his eye that weren't weren't even

75
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:58.990
there, they weren't there. And he realized like, okay,

76
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.390
this is probably what more Jones is.

77
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.670
Like these people are thinking that things are growing in their skin,

78
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.510
but there's nothing there,

79
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.550
but it's really because the Lyme disease and all the other toxins and pathogens

80
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:13.570
that come with it are with your neurology. Yeah. They're with your brain.

81
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.210
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. My wife said brain fog is probably the biggest thing that,</v>

82
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.090
that bothers her, you know? Um,

83
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.770
and she went through a period where she was always tired and it's crazy.

84
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.350
Cause my wife, you would never guess it. Cause he's super high energy.

85
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.130
He's worked out every day, you know, pushes through it, pushes through it.

86
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.760
But uh, it's definitely something she has to constantly treat.

87
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.430
<v 0>You. Remember when people had chronic fatigue syndrome,</v>

88
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.990
people would always tell us where'd that go?

89
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.620
This is not like a thing that everybody always had, but it's an excuse.

90
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.453
<v 1>That excuse.</v>

91
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.840
<v 0>See that that's you? This he's mentally tough guy. Come on. How do I feel?</v>

92
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.674
I feel good. Let's go.

93
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.120
<v 1>I feel good. You know? I mean, my wife,</v>

94
00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.100
uh it's it's sitting it's, expensive to haul these drink.

95
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.810
<v 0>Well, Marcus Davis, all of his UFC money,</v>

96
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.280
he spent treating his wife for Lyme disease. Yeah. He wound up uh he's um,

97
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.350
a prison guard now somewhere.

98
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.573
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.110
<v 0>I think he's still doing that. You know,</v>

100
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:18.340
he's a good buddies with Della grata Delgato is keeping me posted on him,

101
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:21.790
but he wound up, um, like his wife got a real bad.

102
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:24.600
I think he spent more than a quarter million dollars. Yeah. Just yeah.

103
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.350
<v 1>Treating her. Not that much. I mean,</v>

104
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:27.790
I don't know less than why it's not telling me, but.

105
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.340
<v 0>It's bad. My friend, Steve Rinella he and his son got it. And the,</v>

106
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:36.010
the doctors didn't recognize it. The doctors, he was like,

107
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:37.000
I think it might be Lyme disease.

108
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.350
The doctors didn't think so then his son started getting Bell's palsy.

109
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.750
So fat half his face and his son was little.

110
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:46.660
I think he was like four or five half his face was going. Yeah.

111
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.220
<v 1>It's happened. That happened to my wife actually.</v>

112
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.270
Should Bell's palsy the one time? Yeah. I think she got a flu shot. She said,

113
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.370
and then came home. She got Bell's palsy. Geez.

114
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.320
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It's a creepy disease man. It is.</v>

115
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.530
Cause no one seems to know what to do with it. And you know,

116
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:02.390
they had a vaccine for a little while,

117
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.450
but the problem with the vaccine was people were,

118
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:09.590
and this is including my manager's dad took the vaccine

119
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.790
and got Lyme disease from the vaccine.

120
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.120
<v 1>I keep hearing this with vaccines or read the flu shot.</v>

121
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.640
Like I've heard them get the flu shot and they get the flu.

122
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.920
<v 0>You know, I've heard people get sick when they get the flu shot,</v>

123
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.350
but then I've talked to people that are vaccine people and they're like, no,

124
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.720
you probably were already getting the flu.

125
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:30.950
And the flu shot that you got was the wrong one for whatever flu was in the

126
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.310
area.

127
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.270
<v 1>Well, I also heard too,</v>

128
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:34.910
they give you the strain from last year and then there's the new strain this

129
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.590
year. So it's not even really helping you.

130
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.980
<v 0>I think there's multiple strains each year.</v>

131
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.280
And I think they're basically just hedging your bets or guessing I don't take

132
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:45.440
flu shots. No hell no. Yeah. But I,

133
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.240
I think they do work if you get lucky and you'll have the right one. I'm not,

134
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.790
I don't know. I mean, I believe in vaccines for sure,

135
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:57.260
but I don't think that it always works in, in, in, in the flu shot case.

136
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:01.190
I'm not sure. Cause like sometimes, sometimes they just get it wrong.

137
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.710
Like they have the wrong strain. Right, right. What do we know? What are we.

138
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.310
<v 1>Touchy subject anymore on.</v>

139
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.780
<v 0>Talking about flu shots.</v>

140
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.160
<v 1>With the, with the lines, these,</v>

141
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.340
my wife's there's a conspiracy theory that that's the government put that out.

142
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.900
<v 0>In the wild. Well,</v>

143
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:21.710
there was a conspiracy theory that there was actually look this up Jamie,

144
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:23.750
because there was actually something about this that we're talking about

145
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:26.960
recently where, um, there were looking in, there was,

146
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.730
there were investigating the idea that Lyme disease was a

147
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.080
biological warfare weapon that uh, accidentally got released.

148
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.500
But this was through like legitimate channels. They were investigating it.

149
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.870
Wasn't like some tinfoil hat job.

150
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.700
<v 1>They released it on the east coast,</v>

151
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.890
I guess right now where they want it to release it.

152
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.820
<v 0>I think it got out. I think the idea is that somehow or another,</v>

153
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:53.540
this disease had accidentally escaped their labs or while they were in the

154
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.000
middle of, uh, treating people is a tick.

155
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.750
<v 1>The only way you can get.</v>

156
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.810
<v 0>Lyme disease. I believe so. Yeah. And it's the ticks.</v>

157
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.000
I think it's deer ticks.

158
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.110
I think it's places that have a high population of deer also have a high

159
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:10.460
population, these ticks. And then when people get it,

160
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.690
it's less, you know,

161
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.690
most of them don't realize they have it until it's too late. Yeah.

162
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.190
So you don't realize you have it.

163
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:20.180
And then you miss the early rounds of antibiotics, which can knock it out.

164
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.650
And then you get this chronic state like Jim Miller has and your wife has,

165
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.040
and yeah, my, my buddy, Steve Rinella that had it,

166
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.380
he was up.

167
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.670
I mean bad for at least six months. When I saw him,

168
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.420
he looked like he had lost and he's a slim guy, but he looked like he was,

169
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.480
he had lost 20 or 30 pounds. And it was just said,

170
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.020
he'd just been dealing with the, the Lyme disease and it just killed him.

171
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.000
I mean, not killed them, but just, just really diminished. Yeah. It's,

172
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.820
it's a weird disease, man, because you,

173
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.720
you can't find anybody who doesn't know anybody who has it an east coast,

174
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.040
everybody knows a brother or cousin or a wife. Someone has it. It's crazy.

175
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.400
<v 1>We run in the woods and trails. But like in the summertime it's like, man,</v>

176
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.810
it's just, I'm so nervous to get ticks or my kids,

177
00:09:07.811 --> 00:09:09.060
I don't want my kids going out in it.

178
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.900
<v 0>Well, I think it takes 24 hours for it to set in. So like once you,</v>

179
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.850
once you do come back, if you have a tick on,

180
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:16.170
you just have to remove it immediately.

181
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.780
<v 1>So we do every time we go in the woods take checks.</v>

182
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.280
<v 0>How do you get him off you though?</v>

183
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.250
Like it's what if it's like in the middle of your back and you're by yourself?

184
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.443
Yeah. I guess she's.

185
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.190
<v 1>Like one of those back scratchers or something.</v>

186
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.530
<v 0>Like here it is, was Lyme disease created as a bio weapon.</v>

187
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.060
Is this a legit website?

188
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.060
<v 2>It's uh, how stuff? Well, how's the house stuff works. That's not.</v>

189
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.900
<v 0>Legit. That's legit. How stuff works is very legit.</v>

190
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.390
<v 2>I just sort of read through the article. It's sort of unproven,</v>

191
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:47.040
but there are some people I believe that think that this is a thing it just

192
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.350
would be very hard to do is what the look of this.

193
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.250
<v 0>Ticks has. Weapons issue made headlines back in July, 2019.</v>

194
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:57.930
Thanks to the us house of representatives, Chris Smith, uh, our New Jersey,

195
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.140
Republican New Jersey who introduced legislation legislation,

196
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:05.220
directing the department of defense to review claims that the Pentagon research

197
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.640
ticked base bio weapons in the mid 20th century,

198
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.510
the amendment passed Smith said he was inspired by a number of books and

199
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:15.300
articles suggesting that significant research had been done in the U S

200
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:19.110
government facilities, including Fort Detrick, Maryland and plum island,

201
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:22.500
New York to turn ticks and other insects into bio weapons.

202
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.420
Imagine if those cuts created a disease and now everyone in the east coast has

203
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:30.360
it. What the? Because it's mostly out there. That's, what's up.

204
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.530
<v 1>It is a lot lime isn't Lyme a place in Connecticut. Yeah.</v>

205
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.560
<v 0>Yeah. Is that why they named it Lyme disease? I mean,</v>

206
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:39.420
I think that's why they named it that yeah.

207
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.360
If you heard of the Rocky mountain tick, isn't that kind.

208
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.350
<v 1>Of the west.</v>

209
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.580
<v 0>Coast version of well it's Texas, uh, um, I think,</v>

210
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.940
or the lone star tick. That's definitely the Lonestar. It makes you.

211
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.840
<v 1>Not like meat or.</v>

212
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.230
<v 0>Something. Yes. Alpha gal alpha galactose. It does something.</v>

213
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:59.610
I think that's the word. Um, it, it makes you allergic to music to me.

214
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.110
So you literally go the rest of your life and you can't eat meat like chicken

215
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:05.460
and fish. Shoot me.

216
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.420
<v 2>What is that? The first cases of it were there in 1975.</v>

217
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.890
<v 0>Yeah. The government they're creating bioweapons. I'm not surprised. No.</v>

218
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.380
I talked to the Soviet union guy when I was doing that television show.

219
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:17.360
And he was saying that they,

220
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:21.210
they had all sorts of bio weapons that they were developing over there.

221
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.460
Gotta be giant Pittsville with anthrax.

222
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.570
<v 1>Other ticks and other countries like of airline disease and other countries.</v>

223
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.390
<v 0>That's a good question. That's a very good question. That would,</v>

224
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.410
that would like sort of.

225
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.920
<v 2>While we're in conspiracy veil, have you seen the coronavirus stuff.</v>

226
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.950
<v 0>Conspiracies about it? Yeah. What's.</v>

227
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.870
<v 2>A conspiracy or it's like a level four bio weapon facility opened in Wu Han.</v>

228
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.060
Not too long ago before the suggestions are on. I don't know.

229
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.310
I'm I'm not saying it. The suggestions are online.

230
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.200
Something might have leaked just like this.

231
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.450
Have you consulted with Sam Tripoli or Eddie Bravo? I have seen,

232
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.380
I have seen tweets. I'll just say I, the tweet from, from Sam where Eddie,

233
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.800
I think Sam three tweeted some stuff. So of course, of course he has,

234
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.050
but I've seen other stuff online too. I mean,

235
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:06.250
I think whatever news is out there,

236
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.440
there's always some conspiracy theory that goes with it. Right.
