00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>The specific person you're referring to at the American association for</v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.370
the advancement of science debate, which I just went to make the comment.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.480
I went into that thinking that was going to be a debate. I came out of it,

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:17.220
realizing that they were just trying to set me up to put me down and shut me up

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.310
forever, which they were not successful in doing.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.181
<v 1>That.</v>

7
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:25.500
They're so reluctant to just listen to the evidence and look at the information

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.911
and, and,

9
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:29.820
and consider the possibility that maybe there had been an ancient civilization.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.410
<v 0>Set up, sets the standard timeline, the standard standard story.</v>

11
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.240
And it also upsets a lot of people's concept of progression. And, uh,

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.150
this is something John Anthony West, like to talk about the whole,

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050
he called it the church of progress that we've gotten better and better and

14
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:46.650
better.

15
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.450
And I talked to so many people that think that we are the end all and be

16
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.000
all we're the best that there ever has been. Well,

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:58.860
maybe we are in terms of certain types of technology and I'm not

18
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:03.060
making any claim that people in the past could ever do what we're doing now,

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.340
doing a podcast with all the electronics.

20
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.120
But as I pointed out that also makes us really vulnerable to things,

21
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.010
but I would argue that there is a not so

22
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:18.870
remote possibility that they knew things that we don't know that they may have

23
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.180
understood things that we don't understand.

24
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.130
They may have had a worldview that would benefit us to at least have a

25
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:30.420
feel for it. Um, I mean, I don't want to go find spiritual tangents.

26
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.510
I could if I want to our philosophical tangent,

27
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.190
but I also have a training as an anthropologist anthropologists.

28
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:42.330
I have an under undergraduate degree in anthropology on top of everything else.

29
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.250
And I'm fascinated by human approaches to life and the

30
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.260
environment and their situation.

31
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.760
And I'm convinced that we do have things to learn

32
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.130
from the ancients,

33
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.080
whether it's the really remote ancients or the more recent ancients from

34
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.370
only 5,000 years ago, even dynastic Egypt. Um,

35
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.110
and that it's not all simply a one-way progress that there are fits and

36
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:14.400
starts that there have been high points and low points and high points again.

37
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.390
And I'm not frankly convinced that we're at the highest point when it comes to

38
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:22.890
certain aspects, we might be a high point with certain types of technology,

39
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:27.210
but I'm not convinced that we're at a high point when it comes to, um,

40
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.913
I don't know.

41
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.813
<v 1>Construction.</v>

42
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.240
<v 0>Certainly not with stone construction. So there are types of technology.</v>

43
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.710
We are not a high point with much less getting to this philosophical or

44
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:39.120
spiritual or whatever you want.

45
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.690
<v 1>Call it.</v>

46
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.600
And we don't think of it as technology because we think of technology as being

47
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:43.770
something that's electronic.

48
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.410
<v 0>That's right. That's right. And there are other technologies.</v>

49
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.220
And if you asked me, how did they build the pyramids? I will tell you,

50
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:54.090
I don't know if you ask me how they constructed the Sphinx temple,

51
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:58.740
they carved out those huge blocks of stone that can waive 50 or more tons

52
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.980
and move them in such tight spaces with such tight tolerances.

53
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.690
I don't know. I, I'm not going to, no one really knows. No one really knows.

54
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.280
And sometimes people say, you know, you bring in thousands of slaves or whatnot.

55
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.020
Well, there's no evidence for that.

56
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.290
And where would you have them stand when you're building the Sphinx temple right

57
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.730
now, there's not enough. Room to.

58
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.140
<v 1>Stones are so big. Even thousands of slaves struggled to move them.</v>

59
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.570
It's not like something like that. Just get a couple of buddies.

60
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.450
We're going to move this couch. Yeah. Yeah. We're not talking about that. No.

61
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.860
<v 0>No, no. And yeah, you can try to hypothesize levers and that type of thing,</v>

62
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.120
but it's, this has been said before, and I've seen, um,

63
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.260
I wasn't there in person, but I've seen off the record document, you know,

64
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.850
footage of it when they've tried to just construct a little pyramid with very

65
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.730
small blocks and then they, um,

66
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.710
end up using modern machines and they still weren't very successful. I mean.

67
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.540
<v 1>So they knew a lot.</v>

68
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.480
<v 0>Now they knew a lot. So there's a real resistance.</v>

69
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:03.430
I find among a lot of my academic colleagues to want to even suggest

70
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:06.700
that people could have known things in the past that we don't know now,

71
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.850
or if they knew something in the past that we don't know now,

72
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.740
it was so trivial that it was worth, forgetting, worth, not worrying about.

73
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.940
Uh, so there's this, that concept I find amazing.

74
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.110
And I hate to be stereotypic, some broad brushing,

75
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:27.760
but many Egyptologists when I read their works or I

76
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.980
listened to them at conferences, et cetera.

77
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.290
And I get the impression that they might love Egyptology and

78
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:39.940
studying the ancient Egyptians, but they also have this view that, oh,

79
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:44.500
these guys made wonderful temples and had some fantastic art, but really,

80
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:49.470
you know, they're sort of primitive in Hahahaha, isn't that silly. And you see,

81
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.530
I mean, it's like this very thing vacation, the very thing they study,

82
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.820
they put down in a sense to build themselves up and to.

83
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.490
<v 1>Build up this idea of ultimate progress that we can.</v>

84
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.990
<v 0>Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Then you also have in Egypt,</v>

85
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:07.270
tall G and I won't give you another example of this,

86
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:11.800
not just me bringing in scientific evidence and data and the Egyptologists

87
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.850
rejecting it, but just recently in the last couple of years,

88
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.700
have you heard about the project on the great pyramid,

89
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:22.900
the big void they've been using mammography, um,

90
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.790
which is a highly sophisticated technique using muon that come from outer space

91
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.400
or come from the atmosphere, they go through the pyramid,

92
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.630
you can set up detectors long-term and pick these up.

93
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.430
They're sort of like ex think of x-rays technology, but using muons,

94
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.330
uh,

95
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.440
which are sort of exotic particle that most people are not aware of because they

96
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.110
just pass right through us without interacting.

97
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.360
But when you've got massive stone, massive stone will block some of them.

98
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.010
So you can pick up essentially image over a long period of time.

99
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.430
So this is really high tech physics, very expensive.

100
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.390
A consortium of physicists did work on the great pyramid.

101
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:10.190
I think it's still ongoing, but they put up, you know, tens of millions,

102
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:13.100
if not more worth of a high, you know,

103
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.810
sophisticated physical physics equipment gathered all this data.

104
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:21.500
I've seen the raw data. I have a degree in geophysics,

105
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:26.060
geology and geophysics. I have some ability to evaluate this type of data.

106
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.240
Whereas I hate to say a lot that Egyptologists don't.

107
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.520
And I found that with my own data when I shared my own data that not to be

108
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.320
nasty, but they didn't know what they were looking at,

109
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.650
which is somewhat understandable since it's not their training. Right?

110
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.390
So you have with the great pyramid just recently in last couple of years,

111
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.720
published in nature, a very prestigious journal.

112
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.850
They found what they believe is evidence for a huge void

113
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.860
above the grand gallery that has never been known before.

114
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.160
Um, and yeah, there, we have a picture of it.

115
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.140
The Egyptologists have been so resistant to this saying,

116
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:09.770
this is nonsense. There can't be, we don't basically, we,

117
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.550
there can't be anything new that we don't know about our, if it is,

118
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.340
it's just trivial, it's just some, um,

119
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:19.100
space between the rocks is nothing important.

120
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.800
But what I wanted to say what's is really important.

121
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:26.750
Some Egyptologists actually called for the whole project to be closed

122
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:31.430
down because they don't like the results and they called it propaganda.

123
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.540
<v 1>Closed down, but you.</v>

124
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.080
<v 0>Cut that close down the whole scientific project.</v>

125
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.400
Not only do they not want to look at the data,

126
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.210
they'll want more data collected that might contradict their standard.

127
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.510
<v 1>That's fascinating that someone would actually call for that because this isn't</v>

128
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:49.790
even their study of their field of study. Right?

129
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:54.080
So you're dealing with physical evidence that they're saying is nonsense,

130
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.810
but this is not something they studied in the first place, right?

131
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.450
So there's this void that we're looking at here in these images.

132
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.300
Can you explain to people that are just listening? What we're seeing?

133
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.030
<v 0>Oh, what you're seeing is they call it a hidden chamber there,</v>

134
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:08.090
but you can see how it's parallel to the grand gallery.

135
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:13.010
The grand gallery is this huge gallery that goes up to the King's chamber in

136
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:13.850
the great pyramid.

137
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.740
<v 1>It's deep in the pyramid. The pyramid hidden chambers above this above.</v>

138
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.020
<v 0>Parallel said is maybe close to the same size of it. It's hard to tell with,</v>

139
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:25.640
until it gets probe, you know,

140
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:28.820
you'd have to drill into it and maybe put a camera in,

141
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.210
but I've seen the raw data. My point is I've seen the raw data.

142
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.280
I certainly think it's important. They're interpreting it correctly.

143
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.190
Now the proof will be in the pudding as they say,

144
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:43.220
if they ever entered or at least put a probe into it.

145
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.350
But my point right now is to just dismiss the data is nonsense to

146
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.940
call for the whole project to be shut down is nonsense. In my opinion,

147
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.470
some of the Egypt, Egypt, Egypt, tologist, um, close, close to the ministry.

148
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.010
And my point is, they've done the same thing to me. So for instance,

149
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:05.550
when we did seismic work and we found the chamber under the left pod,

150
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:09.300
the Sphinx, that's never been explored since at least not to my knowledge.

151
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.980
And they just dismiss it and say, we know there's nothing there. Um,

152
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.520
and that was despite the fact that we also found a chamber at the rump of the

153
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:20.610
Sphinx, which I didn't know about the time, but they already knew about,

154
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.870
so it confirmed that our data was good because we were finding something they

155
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.704
knew about.

156
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.460
But when we find something they don't know about and they don't want to be

157
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:34.050
there, they dismiss it and don't want to pursue it further.

158
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.180
<v 1>They have explored one of those chambers, correct?</v>

159
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.890
Is that they explore the one that's in the room.

160
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.140
<v 0>The one in the rump. Yes. The one in the rump,</v>

161
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.850
but it turns out they already knew about it.

162
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.130
It's probably not super significant.

163
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.080
It probably is just maybe a correct code Roman or late period, you know,

164
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.620
burial or some kind of excavation.

165
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.610
The one that I believe is important is under the left Palm of the Sphinx,

166
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.680
which I believe is a archive actually may go back to this very

167
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:05.820
early period because we now have hieroglyphic evidence indicating that.

168
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.700
<v 1>W what is the evidence indicates? It's an archive. Okay.</v>

169
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.740
<v 0>So recently, and this gets back to, um, the Sphinx. Yes.</v>

170
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.280
Okay.

171
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.990
So we started this portion of the discussion with the Sphinx and my initial

172
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:20.460
observations of the Spanx.

173
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.170
And one of my observations was that there's something going on with the

174
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:29.940
weathering and erosion on the Sphinx. The second observation,

175
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:34.740
this is within the first two minutes at most was that the head is too small for

176
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:38.190
the body. The head is not a road at the way.

177
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:42.660
The core body is it's not a rote. The way the walls of the Sphinx enclosure are.

178
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.700
It's not the original head.

179
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.350
I hate to say it this way by knew immediately,

180
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:53.160
that was not the original head, you know, just from a geological point of view.

181
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.720
And I believe that's now since been fully confirmed that this is not the

182
00:10:57.721 --> 00:11:01.380
original head. It was a re carved head. So for a long time,

183
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.140
the question has been in my mind,

184
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:06.390
and we talk about this on mystery of the Sphinx.

185
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.720
What was the original head of the Sphinx? What was this thing?

186
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:13.590
So originally we've speculated and other people's speculate.

187
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.560
Might've been a lion for instance, Leo,

188
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:19.710
because it faces on the Equinox,

189
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.010
the constellation Leo in the sky,

190
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.290
not today, but 10,000 BC or so,

191
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.260
more or less at the very end of the last ice age.

192
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.240
Now I've had a lot of colleagues of mine.

193
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.180
Academic colleagues say that's nonsense. You know,

194
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:38.970
it doesn't mean anything because they weren't even recognizing the

195
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:43.950
constellations back then. Um, we now have plenty of evidence,

196
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.780
at least some of the constellations that we recognize today, uh, Leo,

197
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:52.620
I would put in that category, uh, a tourist is in that,

198
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:58.030
or Ryan is in that core category. Some of them we don't have evidence for,

199
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.710
but the ones I just mentioned, the, the, um, they,

200
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.850
these are constellations that go back well into the end of the last ice age.

201
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.950
We have documents of that. We have, um,

202
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.800
mammoth bones where you have a Ryan carved on it.

203
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:16.720
We have tourists shown in cave walls. We have Leo shown. So it's, to me,

204
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:21.310
it's fascinating that some of these constellations that we recognize today were

205
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:24.490
recognized tenths of thousands of years ago. So to me,

206
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:27.730
it's not nonsense that they carved a structure

207
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.250
10,000 BC, approximately that was facing its own image in the sky.

208
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.350
So one suggestion was that maybe it's Lele, but recently, um,

209
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.060
Manu safes today, Dr. Manu saves a dead. Another colleague of mine.

210
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.980
He recognized initially that there is a title what's known as a

211
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:52.690
dual title in dynastic Egypt that goes

212
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:55.240
back to the fourth dynasty.

213
00:12:55.241 --> 00:13:00.070
And even back to the first dynasty with the earliest writing. And it,

214
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.530
when properly translated,

215
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.810
basically refers to the Sphinx as the guardian up an archive

216
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.730
and not the Sphinx as we think of it as a lion with a human head,

217
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.920
but as a lion ness. And there was a name for this line, this head,

218
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.960
she was the goddess met Hitt who guarded archive. Um,

219
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.610
and we wrote a paper on that. When I say we Manu safes a day,

220
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.260
myself and Robert [inaudible] who you may know up from, uh, Ryan correlation,

221
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.550
some of his, his work ties in with this, the Archeo astronomy,

222
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.570
but we've now found that there is this sign,

223
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:44.680
which we named the J w sign in honor of in honor of

224
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:48.400
John Anthony West. Uh, there it is. There's the JW sign.

225
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.730
And what you see here is a lioness met hit,

226
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.470
which was the Sphinx originally based on our reconstruction and

227
00:13:56.471 --> 00:14:00.760
interpretation. Um, can't go into all the details. Now you can actually,

228
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:05.470
people can read the paper if I could put a plug in. If people go to my website,
