00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.200
So you're in this position where you have this information and you, you know,

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.840
that these surveillance systems are in place and they're unconstitutional

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.200
and you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about

5
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.440
this. What, what makes you take the Lee?

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.360
<v 1>So this is, um, covered, uh, extensively in the book,</v>

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.560
um, because it took a long time. I would imagine.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.893
<v 0>People.</v>

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.880
<v 1>People, you know. Yeah. Right. Exactly.</v>

10
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:39.200
People like to think it's like a cinematic moment, um,

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.190
where I find this golden document, like this seller wind report,

12
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.950
and that's the closest thing to a smoking gun, right. That, that exists.

13
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.150
But look, if you found that you, you can read that later, look at that and like,

14
00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.470
imagine yourself being like, oh,

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.910
I'm gonna go outside on the courthouse steps and wave this thing and burn my

16
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.830
life to the ground, burn my family to the ground. I'm never gonna be work again.

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.500
Uh, I'm going to jail for the rest of my life. Um,

18
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.020
the question is what would it take for you, uh,

19
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.020
to light a match and burn your life to the ground? Um,

20
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.900
and for a long time, uh, too long, um,

21
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.180
the answer was nothing and I'm, I'm, I'm ashamed at that. Uh, it took me,

22
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.020
uh, so long, uh,

23
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.180
to get over that home because I was waiting for somebody else to do it. Uh,

24
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:35.140
when I saw, uh, people like Ron widen on this, uh,

25
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:37.460
when I saw people like the court case that I showed before,

26
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.940
where people were actively challenging these programs, right.

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.770
Journalists had the scent of it. Uh, and you know,

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.490
there are a lot of people who are gonna be in, you know,

29
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.890
the YouTube comments or whatever, and go, oh, I knew this was happening. No,

30
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:51.290
you didn't. Well, bill bimney.

31
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.223
<v 0>You had.</v>

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.090
<v 1>He, uh.</v>

33
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.210
<v 0>Bill bennyney. Yeah. Bill, bill BI, excuse me, bill. Bennyney.</v>

34
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.690
He initially was the one that came out and spoke about this issue.

35
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.210
And so.

36
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.800
<v 1>Yeah, bill Biney, uh, is, uh, part of,</v>

37
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.760
shall we say the group of early NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas Drake?

38
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.080
Uh, bill Benny, uh, Kirk Webe I believe in ed Loomis, uh,

39
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:17.600
and these guys all got their doors kicked in, you know, they, they got harassed,

40
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.160
um, by the FBI, Tom Drake, uh, who was a senior executive at the NSA.

41
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.080
This is guy who had a lot to lose, um,

42
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.750
was charged under the same law was the espionage act.

43
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:29.710
And these guys who were doing it earlier during the Bush administration,

44
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.630
some of 'em were talking to the journalists, uh, that didn't, you know,

45
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:36.910
maybe it's alleged, I don't wanna put them on the spot. Maybe they deny it.

46
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:40.830
Maybe they don't leave that to them. Um, but uh,

47
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.710
somebody somewhere was informing this reporting, right?

48
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.700
It got into the New York times about the Bush era warrantless wire tapping

49
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:50.100
program. And eventually journalists put this out there.

50
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:54.300
People knew these capabilities existed. Um, but yeah, then,

51
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420
then there's the person in the YouTube comment. So it's like, oh,

52
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:57.860
we knew all about this. It's nothing new.

53
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.120
And the thing is you can know about some programs and not know about others.

54
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.600
You can have a suspicion,

55
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.640
you can know with a certainty that this stuff is capable or is, is possible.

56
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.840
The capability exists.

57
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.520
You can know that the government has done this stuff in the past.

58
00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.760
You can know they are likely to do it again. You can have all these indications,

59
00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:17.880
you can have, um, like the Juul versus NSA case. Uh that's um,

60
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.550
run by the E EF F, which is about the at,

61
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.790
or it's about at and T setting up, uh, secret rooms in their,

62
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.310
uh, telecommunications facilities where they basically drag, uh,

63
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.390
all the fibers for their domestic internet, uh,

64
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:37.830
communications and like phone communications into a room that's purpose built

65
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:42.180
for the NSA, and then they've bring it out. Um, but at, and T denies,

66
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.380
it's the NSA, uh, the NSA denies that these things, uh,

67
00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:50.740
happen or that are done at all. Right. And so this is the context, uh,

68
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.860
you say, you know, and, you know, let, put it the other way. Maybe you do know,

69
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:57.740
right. Maybe you are, uh, an academic researcher, uh,

70
00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:00.490
maybe you're technological special list. Uh,

71
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.690
maybe you're just somebody who reads all the reporting and you actually know,

72
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.890
uh, you can't prove it, but you know, this is going on,

73
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.730
but that's the thing in a democracy,

74
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.890
the distance between speculation and fact,

75
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.570
the distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in

76
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:24.560
the country is everything in our model of government, because what, you know,

77
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:28.240
doesn't matter what matters is what we all know.

78
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.720
And the only way we can all know it is if somebody can prove it,

79
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.360
if you can prove it. And if you don't have the evidence, you can't prove it.

80
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.920
And of course, when we talk about the earlier stuff, right, like the sort, uh,

81
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.560
a more corporatized media,

82
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.270
they've got a thousand and incentives not to get involved in this stuff.

83
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:44.910
They need access to the white house.

84
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.550
They need these officials to sit down with them, uh, and give interviews, right?

85
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.830
That's constant content that they need that's access that they need,

86
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.390
they need to be taken seriously. They need to be, uh, you know, uh,

87
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.110
admitted to briefers, uh, it is a co-dependent relationship and yet,

88
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.170
uh, and rather,

89
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.450
and so the only way to make sure people understand this broadly

90
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.530
is if we all work together, right. Um,

91
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.410
if we collectively can establish a Corpus of evidence, right.

92
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.800
A body of facts that is so large and so

93
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.560
persuasive, it overcomes, uh,

94
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.360
the natural and understandable resistance of the,

95
00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:34.120
these more corporatized media groups. Um, it overcomes, uh,

96
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:38.240
the political and partisan, uh, sort of loyalties that, that all of these, uh,

97
00:05:38.241 --> 00:05:41.400
political factions in the country do, where they go, you know, it's,

98
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.790
it's my present in it. Even if I don't like this stuff,

99
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:46.990
even if I don't agree with this stuff, I don't wanna say it exists.

100
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:49.710
I wanna deny it until it's proved, you know, uh,

101
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.030
&lt;laugh&gt; in HD on video, you know, signing the order to do this,

102
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:55.390
that or the other. Um,

103
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:59.400
because otherwise there's a chance my guy might not get reelected and that's the

104
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.800
only way this kind of stuff can happen.

105
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.640
And the sad fact is the opportunities that we have to prove

106
00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:09.400
this, like the, the moments in history where we do prove something, anything,

107
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.000
uh, beyond a reasonable doubt are so few, uh, and,

108
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.870
and so rare that they almost always only come from whistle blowers.

109
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.190
Uh, and, and I think that's, uh, one of the problems that we have, uh,

110
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:29.270
particularly in the, the climate movement did, uh, today look, EV go ahead.

111
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.510
<v 0>I'm sorry. Did you take any comfort from knowing that Obama,</v>

112
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.390
when he was running for office and in his hope and change,

113
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.300
he had provisions to protect whistle blowers and provisions to

114
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.980
&lt;laugh&gt; to reward people, right? I mean,

115
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.380
do you remember all that mean it was eventually redacted or eventually deleted

116
00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:51.900
it from the website &lt;laugh&gt;, but that disappeared it from the,

117
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.820
but that was a big part of his program.

118
00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.330
What he was running on was that people were exposing unlawful activity.

119
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.430
He was gonna protect those people. Did that,

120
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:04.870
did you take any comfort in that mom also.

121
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.430
<v 1>Campaigned? Well, Obama also, uh, during his campaign said, uh,</v>

122
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.670
he campaigned actively against the warrantless wire tapping the Bush

123
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.910
administration, because remember Bush is in the scandal,

124
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.220
the height of this on 2007, you know, the election's coming up right after,

125
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.540
and he's going, uh, Obama's saying, uh, you know,

126
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.860
that's not who we are, right. That's not what we do. Um,

127
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.340
and yet within a hundred days of him becoming a president, uh,

128
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.900
now he's sitting in that chair rather than extinguishing these programs,

129
00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:39.450
he embraces them. And why do you.

130
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.730
<v 0>Think that is a more entrenched?</v>

131
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.570
<v 1>I think it's actually, uh, again, what we talked about earlier, first thing, uh,</v>

132
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.530
every time a new president comes into the white house, uh,

133
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.330
they get their clearances, right? They get read into all this stuff. Uh,

134
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:56.810
during the campaign, they get clearances and they get written and stuff,

135
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.680
but when they finally become president right now,

136
00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:02.280
they're the only people who can sign what these are called,

137
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.000
the covert action findings and things like that, um, which are basically,

138
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.880
you know, the intelligence community wants to assassinate somebody.

139
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:13.960
They wanna run this illegal program here, there or everywhere. Um,

140
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.320
and they can't do it because they're executive agencies without that top level

141
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:21.310
executive sign off. So they gotta open the vest, right.

142
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:24.310
They gotta get these guys on, on side. Um,

143
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.750
and basically every president, uh, since Kennedy,

144
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.990
um, they have been successful in, uh, what they call fearing up, uh,

145
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:38.150
where as soon as they come in, uh, they lead,

146
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.220
you read you the litany of horribles and they go, these are all the threats, uh,

147
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.780
that we're facing. And let's be real. It is a dangerous world. Uh,

148
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.740
it's not just all made up BS. Uh,

149
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:53.660
some of it is right where it's inflated. It's not that it's completely false,

150
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.600
but they make it sound more serious than it actually is. Um,

151
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.280
but there are real bad people out there who are trying to do real bad things.

152
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.000
And you have just gone through a hellish election, um, because our,

153
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.880
our electoral politics are so diseased. Um, and,

154
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.760
uh, now after you've crawled through fire,

155
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.830
you're already thinking four years ahead, you know, how,

156
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.310
how do I stay in this seat? And these guys are basically saying, uh,

157
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.790
if you don't do X, Y, and Z,

158
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.470
this is gonna fall on your lap and the implication, which I,

159
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.670
I don't think they actually say, but every president knows, uh,

160
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.860
is these guys can undermine you to death. Um, if got the IC,

161
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.260
uh, against you, right? Uh, they can Stonewall you.

162
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:43.700
They can put out stories that are gonna be problematic for you, uh, every day,

163
00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:46.740
your presidency. Um, and it's,

164
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.780
it's not that it's necessarily gonna gonna cash you outta the white house,

165
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.020
but it's a problem that is a president. You very much don't want. Uh,

166
00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:56.850
so in the most charitable interpretation of this,

167
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.650
you've got a new guy coming in in Obama's case. This is a pretty young guy. Um,

168
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.890
doesn't focus in this kind of national, uh,

169
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.530
security forum policy stuff throughout his earlier career.

170
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.810
He's more interested in domestic policy and always has been,

171
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:14.330
that's actually one of the positive things to say about Barack Obama. Um,

172
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.080
he's just trying to make things better home. And now suddenly they go, look,

173
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.240
you need to worry about this country.

174
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.320
You need to worry about this group that you've never heard of.

175
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.280
You need to worry about, you know, this technology,

176
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:26.280
you need to do all this stuff. Uh,

177
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.280
and the only reason we can tell you this stuff,

178
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.920
and the only thing dividing America and the abyss

179
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.470
are these terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible programs, right. Uh,

180
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.110
that are in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness.

181
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.230
And so here's, here's the, the, the real problem. Uh,

182
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.790
every president hears that. And every president, you know, first off,

183
00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:53.510
they've got so many other things to do is they,

184
00:10:53.511 --> 00:10:54.870
they just kind of nod their head and they'll go,

185
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.660
I'll deal with this later in my administration. And this,

186
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.140
this is one of the ironies, uh, when I come, came forward in 2013, right.

187
00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:05.500
This is now Barack Obama's second term president. Uh,

188
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.940
one of the responses that they had to the mass surveillance scandal was yes,

189
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.180
we think they went a little too far.

190
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.740
This is after the initial thing where they went,

191
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.890
nobody's listening to your phone calls, you know, uh, just made data, right?

192
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:20.530
Nobody, nobody can have, uh,

193
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.930
perfect privacy and also have perfect security.

194
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.650
So we gotta sort of divide a line here between &lt;laugh&gt; the constitution and you

195
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:31.930
know, what the government wants to do. Um, but they said, uh,

196
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.240
we were gonna get to it. We knew these programs were problematic,

197
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.800
but if they just gave us more time, we would've fixed them.

198
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.440
Maybe it's true. Right. Seems,

199
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:48.680
seems awful convenient in hindsight that throughout the entirety of the first

200
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.560
term, well, it seems like what you would say if you got caught &lt;laugh&gt; right,

201
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.440
right, right, right. Um, but look, uh, in,

202
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.320
if we're being the most generous, uh, that we are here,

203
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.000
the president is briefed on real and legitimate threats and they scare

204
00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:10.200
the hell out of 'em I'm sure. Um, and we can, we can all imagine being there,

205
00:12:10.201 --> 00:12:10.801
right? Those,

206
00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:14.150
those of us who remember what the world like post nine 11 fear is a powerful

207
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.950
thing, but the guys who are doing that briefing,

208
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.950
they're no longer scared of it. Uh,

209
00:12:21.951 --> 00:12:23.510
because they've been dealing with this for years.

210
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.390
This is the oldest thing they've given this briefing times before. You know,

211
00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:29.870
when we talk about people talk about the deep state, right? They, they,

212
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.380
they talk about it like some conspiracy of lizard people in it.

213
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.500
It's not that it's something much simpler.

214
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.860
The deep state is simply the career government.

215
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.220
It's the people who are in the same offices who outlive and outlast

216
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.700
presidencies. Right. They've seen Republicans, they've seen Democrats,

217
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:49.860
they don't really care. Uh, and they give that same briefing again and again,

218
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.300
and they get good at it. They know what they want. Uh,

219
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.770
know what this person's saying. Uh, where's the president. They,

220
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.130
they don't know who these people are. Uh, the,

221
00:12:59.131 --> 00:13:00.970
these people have been there before the president.

222
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.170
They're gonna be there after the president. Uh,

223
00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:06.970
and so they give this very effective, uh, very fear inducing speech.

224
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.610
And then they followed up with their asks, which are really demands, um,

225
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.440
just politely put vied, uh,

226
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.040
and anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff, uh,

227
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:22.640
who is not ready for this, uh, uh,

228
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:28.200
sort of trade off and who you have to understand as a career politician is

229
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.040
entirely used to the horse trading game, right.

230
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.320
And going I'll deal with this later or not now, or, uh, what are the,

231
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.310
this is the cost benefit here. And the intelligence community goes,

232
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.430
if you give us what we want,

233
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.630
no one will ever know about it because it's classified.

234
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.670
It's obviously the easy answer. Uh, and maybe, uh,

235
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:51.470
Barack Obama honestly, did want to get to this later.

236
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.300
But what we can say today is, uh, uh, uh,

237
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.500
for all the good that may have been done in that white house, uh,

238
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:04.380
this is an issue where the president went through two full terms and did not

239
00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:06.140
fix the problem, but in fact, made it worse.

240
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:15.570
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
