00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 1>Experience. The reason that I'm fighting through culture, war issues,</v>

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.660
which are not very interesting to me is that we are destroying the thing that

4
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:13.620
has the ability to make sense of the world. Right?

5
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.310
It's really the design and logic. What do you mean?

6
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:21.780
Like the ability to say no, you know, you come with an experiment that failed,

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.760
you know, and you say, I think it succeeded and I say, no, it didn't, it failed.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.990
And you say, well, I actually am, um, Cambodian,

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.070
and I think you're discriminating against me because I'm Cambodian like, look,

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.900
your experiment failed. It has nothing to do with Cambodia.

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.290
And you keep that stuff out of my lap. I mean,

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.830
if you watch your war stuff. Yeah.

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.100
Really what I'm animated by is get your social

14
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:54.570
engineering out of my laboratory.

15
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.420
You've got 10 minutes and I'm calling security. That's my issue.

16
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.280
It's not telling people how to behave or that I have all the

17
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.890
answers or that we need to be objective in our lives.

18
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.720
And that we just want to have sensible discussions. It's,

19
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
you're coming after core reality and our ability to make sense of the world.

20
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.070
And so I'm happy to entertain all sorts of things. You take one foot,

21
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.210
step one foot in my lab and I'm calling security. And if I can't do that,

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.340
if I can't maintain a scientific journal or a university in which the

23
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.080
departments do not invade the departments that are actually doing a super

24
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.850
important work, we're lost.

25
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.810
<v 0>And there is a distinction this distinction needs to be made. There,</v>

26
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.380
there is a distinction between hard science and gender studies.

27
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.140
<v 1>You could pull up, pull up Jamie, um,</v>

28
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.260
let's do the, uh, uh, anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.190
Oh, you can do that. Yeah. You went all Sean Connery on me.

30
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.460
<v 0>Yeah. One eyebrow. Isn't that like a genetic thing?</v>

31
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.630
Like you can curl your tongue. Like yeah, I can do that.

32
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:04.260
Some people can't do that. A parameter turnover.

33
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.440
You mean turn it upside down. Oh, no, I can't do that. All right.

34
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.060
<v 1>You've got one thing. I got another. Okay. Uh, this is a very mature Joe. Huh?</v>

35
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.920
Um.

36
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.750
<v 0>Well, what is going on here? Um.</v>

37
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.850
<v 1>Put a SIG where I'm looking for a number with like 10 or 11</v>

38
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:30.360
significant digits. Um,

39
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.850
w we are able to do calculations in quantum electrodynamics,

40
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.770
let's say quantum field theory in which we can figure out the

41
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.540
precision of some thing.

42
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:46.470
We can predict it to like 10 or 11 decimal,

43
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:50.490
places of accuracy. And when I look at the,

44
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.470
the achievement that was necessary to have theory agree with experiment to that

45
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.304
level.

46
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.930
And then I listened to some of the discussions about, oh,

47
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.570
just take these hoaxes about, you know, uh,

48
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.390
somebody who submitted parts of mine comp to, uh, you know,

49
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.570
as with Jews re written, as men, Peter looked feminine.

50
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.643
<v 0>Right?</v>

51
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.120
<v 1>Those two subjects are taking place in the same institution.</v>

52
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.950
One is incredibly rigorous and demanding and completely unforgiving.

53
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.390
And the other thing is just like.

54
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.670
<v 0>Frivolous and nonsense. Well.</v>

55
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.220
<v 1>Maybe there's a core of it that makes sense, but there's,</v>

56
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.880
it's not going to get anywhere close to the achievements of the,

57
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:32.290
of the hard sciences.

58
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.870
<v 0>But the, the core of it, whether or not it makes sense.</v>

59
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.960
The real problem is the motivation for doing it in the first place.

60
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.770
<v 1>The real motivation may be activism,</v>

61
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.150
but Activision, activism and scholarship. Aren't. I mean,

62
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.190
there's so many things that I want to be true.

63
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:52.960
That just aren't I want beautiful. I mean, like, you know,

64
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.380
nature, you spend time in nature. You want to think, you know,

65
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.770
like nature is a community and where the forest is a bunch of different

66
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.860
organisms, all working together. No it's red of tooth and claw.

67
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.200
Everything that you think about the universe that is purely beautiful and

68
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.020
aspirational is contradicted by some system in nature.

69
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.660
And that's why evolutionary theory was the first thing on the chopping block.

70
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.101
It's just like, well,

71
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:22.180
this contradicts everything we want to claim about organisms. Well, tough luck.

72
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.140
<v 0>I feel like there's a way to define this clearly that makes people understand it</v>

73
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.680
better. Okay. And I don't, I don't know if I'm the guy to do it,

74
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.770
but I feel like someone that there's a,

75
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.360
this is an incredibly complex issue, right?

76
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.160
Where you're dealing with emotions and feelings and people who

77
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.280
feel like there's unjustice in the world and inequality.

78
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.240
And they focus on those things to the point where they're almost participating

79
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:50.980
in social engineering,

80
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.020
by ignoring reality and focusing on what they want to be

81
00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:00.700
true and sort of this way of re-imagining the world.

82
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.610
And they're also demanding compliance.

83
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.890
This is a big part of this whole thing that's going on here.

84
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.280
Then on the other hand, you've got this stuff,

85
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.660
you've got these hard sciences that demand just rigorous,

86
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.910
rigorous intellectual debate.

87
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.170
They demand careful study of the facts. They demand

88
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.320
deep understanding of complex mathematics in order to achieve these results and

89
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:29.690
to be able to verify them, they're unforgiving, unforgiving. They're,

90
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.780
there's just, they're two totally different things.

91
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.010
And what you're saying is when one of them that is this sort of

92
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.050
fervor, frivolous,

93
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.090
airy kind of utopian version

94
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:44.950
of what they like the future to be.

95
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.930
And that interferes right where they want a certain amount of diverse

96
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:51.490
people on the staff.

97
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.160
<v 1>I am not even saying that it's frivolous.</v>

98
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.520
I'm not even saying it's not scholarship. I'm saying that whatever it is,

99
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.410
I don't care. Maybe, maybe it's, maybe it's some beautiful social thing.

100
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.220
<v 0>Well do you do,</v>

101
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.670
but then they'll hit you with you don't care because you're a white male and you

102
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.110
have white male privilege.

103
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.790
<v 1>And I don't. And what I realized is, is that as important as inclusion is,</v>

104
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.860
exclusion is equally important.

105
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.830
And the instant you say that I don't know you the time of.

106
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.680
<v 0>Day. What does that mean by exclusivity? Important?</v>

107
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.640
<v 1>We keep talking about diversity and inclusion, diversity inclusion,</v>

108
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:28.760
diversity inclusion, and there's an implicit threat in that,

109
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:32.900
which is what makes it really juicy and interesting, which is like, well,

110
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.160
let's look at us. We got three white guys in here. There's Jamie, you and me.

111
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.203
It's like.

112
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.790
<v 0>Yourself, I'm 1.6% African. I recognize that. I knew that.</v>

113
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.210
<v 1>I knew he was going to play that card, but you sir can pass as white, right?</v>

114
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.550
Yes. Okay. Now,

115
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.280
in order to have the objection, like there's some little bit of guilt,

116
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.331
which is like, well,

117
00:06:56.331 --> 00:07:00.170
why aren't there any people from Cambodia in here is it that we were really anti

118
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.160
Cambodian? Um, if you carry that guilt,

119
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.700
you're always worried that you have to be able to prove that you're inclusive.

120
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.890
It doesn't matter. Right. Right. Okay.

121
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.750
It is also important to exclude certain voices from the conversation.

122
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.830
So the voice that plays the card, which says, well,

123
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:22.850
you're only saying that because X I don't have to listen to that voice.

124
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.380
And I think this is really important.

125
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.580
That is not a voice that needs to be answered.

126
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.030
It's not a voice that, um,

127
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.940
needs to be taken seriously or paid attention to,

128
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:39.890
unless there's some serious allegation that there has been some kind of

129
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:41.180
discrimination or inclusion,

130
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.220
the burden of proof is on you for saying why that's interesting in a particular

131
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:47.054
conversation.

132
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.000
<v 0>The burden is on you to explain why that's interesting. Right?</v>

133
00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.430
Well, for them, they're trying to engineer a more fair and balanced society.

134
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:01.930
If I was going to take their perspective,

135
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.370
they would say that the reason why there aren't more women in science or trans

136
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:08.410
people in science, or, you know, filling out more.

137
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.560
<v 1>Also trying to engineer a world where there were more women in science,</v>

138
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.430
how are you doing.

139
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.720
<v 0>That by.</v>

140
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.980
<v 1>Trying to figure out what is it that selecting against women, for example,</v>

141
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.250
that we need to get women more money. As I said,

142
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.500
on this program earlier in their lives,

143
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.600
so they can hire help to help raise their children so they can spend more time

144
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:31.360
on their careers and balance. Um.

145
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.870
<v 0>Yeah. But a lot of women don't find that attractive. They don't want to do that.</v>

146
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.480
<v 1>Maybe, but I'm trying to think.</v>

147
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.680
But my point is is that there are lots of reasons that men and women are

148
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:44.620
different, right? Yeah. So for example, um,

149
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.510
I saw a beautiful video of a guy who jumps down at enormous flight of

150
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:52.870
stairs on a skateboard, and he just nailed the landing. And it's just a,

151
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.800
it's a thing of art.

152
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.730
And then it shows you 150 attempts where this guy

153
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:04.500
just abused his body and failed and failed,

154
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:09.090
maybe broke a tooth, you know, blood everywhere. And you're thinking, oh,

155
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.700
you showed me the success.

156
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.120
And you didn't show me that this guy was willing to put his brain,

157
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.300
his life on the line in order to nail that trick.

158
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.370
And he's actually one of the world's falling champions. Right. Okay. Well,

159
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.000
when you start saying, well, why are you putting this video of this person?

160
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.430
Who's doing this thing, you know, on the internet,

161
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:32.100
because that person belongs to a privileged class. I'm saying, well,

162
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.680
I don't know that guy abused himself and put himself at risk and, you know,

163
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.160
devoted his life in a singular way that no sensible PR I mean, I would be,

164
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.320
I would be appalled if my son did that. I'd be furious with it. You know,

165
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.920
there are things that are, that are happening that result in imbalances,

166
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.950
that aren't about some kind of unfairness.

167
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.280
And I think it's very important to say that unfairness is real and structural

168
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:01.170
problems are real and non structural problems and

169
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.750
things that really aren't unfair are also real.

170
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.400
<v 0>I think we both agree that it's important for people to have the opportunity to</v>

171
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:10.500
pursue what they enjoy pursuing.

172
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.300
I think there's also an issue where we want people to

173
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:19.830
be more represented. We want more of that,

174
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.670
that kind of person that's interested in something when they might not

175
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:25.950
necessarily naturally gravitate towards it.

176
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:30.180
And it might not be that there's some impediments and that there's some

177
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:33.900
boundaries and some, some sort of a boys club that keeps them out.

178
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.780
And it might be more that they're just not that interested in that well,

179
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.210
that there also is a biologically been, that's been proven in studies.

180
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.510
<v 1>But I'm trying to make it a different point. Right. Okay. To me,</v>

181
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:49.620
what I'm trying to say is I made a mistake years ago.

182
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.760
I think of engaging in answering this point, which is,

183
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.420
you know, let's, let's, let's take piano competitions.

184
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.190
Why are piano competitions historically, uh, disproportionately, you know,

185
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.460
uh, let's say entered in one by Russians or chess, or who knows what,

186
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.250
what Russians are beasts in the way that they destroy children on their way to

187
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:12.300
the concert stage,

188
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.250
they will do things that most American families will not do to produce a concert

189
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:21.900
pianist. Okay. That's not an unfairness for the rest of us. I mean,

190
00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:22.830
I play the piano.

191
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.630
I can't get on stage with these guys because they're just amazing. It's not,

192
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.830
it's not an unfairness that right. I'm not represented on that stage.

193
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.130
Um, you know, if I told you that, um,

194
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.800
my intention is to become the world's greatest, uh,

195
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.470
jujitsu expert at age 53,

196
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.390
being overweight and not having any history in combat sports, you know,

197
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:46.920
and I know that it's not going to happen.

198
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.510
<v 0>With the right amount of drugs. Come on,</v>

199
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:55.120
Joe and engineering, we can do miraculous things. That's true.

200
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.860
We can make him better than he was. Yeah. We need 'em daily stem cells.

201
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.840
We're gonna, we're going to have to do some real X.

202
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.730
We're going to take a chance on cancer and all sorts of other diseases. Uh,

203
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.090
we can, we can achieve some things. Okay. But.

204
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.710
<v 1>The previous conversation that we were.</v>

205
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.190
<v 0>That you need to develop, you need to develop it.</v>

206
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.260
It needs to be a part of your well,

207
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.340
here's the thing that I always say about a striking sports striking sports are

208
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.860
probably one of the more interesting ones in that.

209
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.310
When you start out at an early age,

210
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.430
your body develops learning how to strike, right?

211
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.210
It's a gigantic advantage over someone who learns once they're they're

212
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.393
past puberty.

213
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.240
When you get someone who's learning how to strike and they're in their twenties,

214
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:41.830
it takes a real outlier to become super successful. It's very,

215
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:42.664
very rare.

216
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.230
<v 1>I remember being in a fistfight and throwing a punch and not connecting</v>

217
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.240
and hurting my arm. I was like.

218
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.883
<v 0>Oh.</v>

219
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.550
<v 1>I didn't understand if it's not free. You know, it's like a very, it's a very,</v>

220
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.750
now all you've got is your left arm and you got a really off person across from

221
00:12:58.751 --> 00:12:58.870
you.
