00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You got to put a tape over that camera. You do.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.330
I think there's probably you do right how much you should get. Should.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.980
<v 1>I mean, people should check this. This is again smart TVs. Uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.491
you know,

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:18.870
if you've got one that's of a recent vintage check and you'll see this a little,

6
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.160
little hole along the frame,

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.060
that's the camera and this is a microphone set up an audio system. Yeah.

8
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.850
Just put a piece of tape over that. That's your, whatever,

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:30.360
your low cost solution. Right. You can go in there and adjust and turn it off.

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.970
But you know, you try figuring that out, right?

11
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.880
That's like trying to program your, your VCR, right.

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.860
Trying to figure out how to get into your TV,

13
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.830
into the settings to change the smart interactivity.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.230
And then do you also want to trust that that's,

15
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.540
what's going to happen if you turn it off? So.

16
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.040
<v 0>Facebook that if you did, if you turn off location, they're still tracking.</v>

17
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.940
Yeah.

18
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.270
<v 1>Yeah. That's why I said I, again, going back to that same old thing,</v>

19
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.180
which is like, ah, the government's trying to screw us over the spying on us,

20
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.470
say, you know what? They, you know,

21
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.820
unless you're involved in criminal activity or terrorism, you know, they,

22
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.590
they honestly don't have any interest, but they also don't have the resources.

23
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.680
And the time available commercial side of things though,

24
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:11.370
is different because it drives what they're all about, which is making money.

25
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.550
<v 0>Especially when you sign those terms of agreements,</v>

26
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.040
that the terms of use agreements. Like most people just accept. It.

27
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.630
Don't look through.

28
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.790
<v 1>Right? Well, there's a, there's a regulation. There's a, there's active,</v>

29
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.560
there's a piece of legislation or whatever that Outlaws, you know,

30
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.710
uh, secretly videoing, you know, I forget what it was.

31
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.610
It was years and years ago. It was decades ago. Um,

32
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.400
but you, you, uh,

33
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.630
give up that right by clicking on agree on those user agreements.

34
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.080
But you know, I don't know anybody who's ever read a user agreement.

35
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.990
<v 0>What does this, Jamie, California, California, this year,</v>

36
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.850
consumer privacy act allows anyone who resides in the state to access and obtain

37
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.690
copies of the data that companies store on them and the right to delete that

38
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:02.580
data and opt out of companies selling or monetizing their data. Ah.

39
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.420
<v 1>Um, California leading the way again, only for residents of California though.</v>

40
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.710
<v 0>It lives somewhere else.</v>

41
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.140
<v 1>But you can't. Oh, well I'm moving from Idaho to California. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.560
<v 0>Good spots in California. Yeah. No, this isn't one of them.</v>

43
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.320
It's a good spot. Just too many people found out about it.

44
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.150
My worry is more of social media companies now than,

45
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:28.860
than anything. Um,

46
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.600
even in a lot of ways more than the government spying on us, I,

47
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:37.290
I worry about the power that something like Facebook has the insane amount of

48
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:40.920
influence that they have on people and how through the use of their algorithms.

49
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:44.130
They actually instigate arguments and try to get people because that's how

50
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:47.540
people respond. And that's what makes people want to click on things.

51
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:51.660
And that's, that's what generates revenue. So their algorithms encourage,

52
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.500
you know, and it's, you know, the idea is that they encourage outrage,

53
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.770
but they don't really, but people like outrage.

54
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.010
So encourage you to go seek out like Arusha fear didn't experiment,

55
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.770
where you use YouTube and he only searched for puppies.

56
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.200
That's always searched for it. Just puppies on YouTube.

57
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:10.480
And that's all YouTube would recognize that.

58
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.250
So all they were recommending to him was puppies and he's like, oh, okay.

59
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.080
So it's really not nefarious.

60
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.440
It's based entirely on what your needs are or what your interests are.

61
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.650
But so many people are interested in things that outraged them,

62
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.930
that it becomes a very profitable thing for them when their algorithm shows

63
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:32.260
these people what they want. But it's the problem is the people itself.

64
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.480
It's not necessarily the album. It's not like some,

65
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.010
the algorithm is some nefarious algorithm is designed to instigate strife.

66
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.070
<v 1>No, it's, it's taking advantage of, of human nature to some degree,</v>

67
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.270
but it's also, I mean,

68
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.050
you've raised a really important point because coming up on this election,

69
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.700
people are talking about, oh my God, they're going to hack in.

70
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.730
They're going to influence the vote.

71
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:53.350
They're going to now part of the danger is in the social engineering and the

72
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:56.500
way, and it's very clever. So let's,

73
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.610
if you look at like a recent something that just happened, actually,

74
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.970
it's really interesting. And, and you know, it's still being investigated, but,

75
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.120
um, our report came out from a, a group, uh, area one, which is,

76
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.070
um, uh, looking at at hackers and looking at,

77
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.190
uh, cybersecurity issues. And, and, uh,

78
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:19.450
it's not a particularly well-known group.

79
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.760
It's not like a spur ski or some of these others that are out there,

80
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.690
but they just came out with, uh, a report a couple of days ago,

81
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:29.860
basically saying that the Russians, a Russian entity, uh,

82
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.730
likely the former GRU, the military intelligence group of, of, uh,

83
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120
the Russian intelligence service hacked into Barisma number.

84
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.020
Charisma is a company in the Ukraine that hunter Biden was sat on the board of,

85
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.580
right. And now you think, oh, Russians hacked into it.

86
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.220
And so what happens almost immediately when this report comes out saying, uh,

87
00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:54.730
a Russian, uh, Intel operation hacked into Barisma, uh,

88
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.380
recently, uh,

89
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.280
as it was sort of becoming an issue and Trump was banging on about it and,

90
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:04.090
you know, a hunter Biden, and there was talk about you holding up Ukrainian aid,

91
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.610
if you don't investigate the Bidens situation.

92
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.900
So you'd look at this and if you just looked at it on a very simple level,

93
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.380
you'll go, wow. And I've already seen some of that narrative saying, well, look,

94
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.990
the Russians are working on behalf of Trump again, see,

95
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.191
that's what they're doing.

96
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:20.890
They're working on behalf of Trump there they're hacking into Barisma.

97
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:22.870
And that's what he was complaining about.

98
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.400
If you step back and you think about what are the Russians trying to do, right?

99
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:31.810
With all of their, uh, hacking efforts, all their social media engineering,

100
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.560
they're trying to create the scent. So now what have you got now,

101
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:39.220
you're ramping up this story again. Now, you know,

102
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.120
to what degree air area, one story or report is correct. I mean,

103
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:45.430
there's some discussion as to whether it's accurate or not,

104
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.260
but to that degree that you have to look at everything now with a very skeptical

105
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:52.330
eye and you have to say, okay, what is the purpose of it?

106
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.720
Why is this a timed leak, um,

107
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.820
of information right today intended to, in other words,

108
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.760
did the Russian Intel service, they don't do anything haphazardly, right?

109
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.880
Did they, do they do this with the idea that we're going to leak this out now,

110
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.210
because now it looks like we're still, you know, we're pushing this whole thing.

111
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.760
We're trying to help Trump. We're going to get that narrative going again.

112
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.510
Right. Because now we're getting into an election cycle. It's interesting stuff.

113
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.920
It's, it's like after we, uh, after Soleimani was, was smoked, um,

114
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.230
almost immediately after, um, social media posts, uh, you know,

115
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:28.790
sort of pro very subtly, but pro Iranian regime pro you know,

116
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.260
Sulaymani again, very subtle, but in that vein, they spiked.

117
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.240
And over the course of the next 48 hours,

118
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.950
massive numbers compared to what had been in the past of, of, uh, you know,

119
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.190
some sympathetic enough to turn people's thoughts, right.

120
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.110
To get that narrative going of like, well, oh my God,

121
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.330
they assassinated a foreign leader. Right.

122
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.090
That's all they're looking to do is create that in the Iranian cyber security

123
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.960
forces is increasingly sophisticated 10 years ago,

124
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:56.990
they probably wouldn't have been able to orchestrate sort of that sort of social

125
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:58.280
media work.

126
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.170
I guess my point being is that we look at things very simplistically, right?

127
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.500
We look at it cause we tend to look at it through this political spectrum

128
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.720
saying, I'm right, I'm left whatever, but you have to step back and think,

129
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.420
you know, what, what what's, what are they doing? What's,

130
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:12.890
what's the purpose of this?

131
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.720
And maybe it's more complex or layered than just simply accepting what it is

132
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:20.390
that's being said, which happens. You know,

133
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.630
that's the danger of social media is everyone takes at face value,

134
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.620
that they see on Twitter or whatever. And rather than stepping back and going,

135
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.020
I wonder if this story's even accurate, but then, you know,

136
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.840
somebody will post some half the time. It's, you know, it's just,

137
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.820
it's whether it's for the left or right. Doesn't matter.

138
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.200
Or whether it's from a foreign entity, you know, the state sponsored effort,

139
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.990
you take it and you run with it. Next thing you know,

140
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:46.130
it's got 10,000 likes and people are talking about it. Like it's crazy.

141
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.060
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.800
That's a real problem with today's social media is that these agencies like

143
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:55.910
the, uh, internet research agency in Russia did before the 2016 election,

144
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.980
they really can stir up dissent with these thousands and thousands

145
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.900
of social media accounts that they have.

146
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.560
And they can get people thinking in a certain way.

147
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:08.980
They can get people to argue things in a certain way. And you,

148
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:12.920
you hear those talking points that these bots and these, you know,

149
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:16.580
these companies that are designed just to stir people up,

150
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.590
you see those talking points repeated. So.

151
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.760
<v 1>Oh no, absolutely. And look, the Russians have been doing this, you know,</v>

152
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.230
years and years ago, decades ago,

153
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.830
they were buying off journalists to write favorable articles or articles that

154
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.290
they wanted to get the narrative out there for. Right.

155
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.770
So they would pay off journalists, whether it was overseas or here,

156
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.450
wherever it may be. And that was old school. Right. But the point of it,

157
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.900
right, th the, the, the reasoning behind it is still the same, right.

158
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:46.310
You're trying to affect a narrative. You're trying to affect a certain opinion,

159
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.450
or you're trying to foment the scent. You're trying to create some chaos.

160
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.200
And you're right here now with a lot of the social media that, uh,

161
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.260
foreign entities are doing,

162
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:58.010
they're trying to take advantage and trying to drive wedges in. So you get,

163
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.070
you get these things to try to drive, uh, and, and, and, and, uh, create a,

164
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:05.820
more of a racial divide as an example, whatever it is that they can do.

165
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.050
And sometimes, sometimes they're doing it just simply to create the chaos.

166
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.870
You know, sometimes they're doing it for, you know, a more specific,

167
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:16.470
focused reason, but we're not sophisticated. I mean, I think we're,

168
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.510
we're more aware of it now, uh,

169
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.150
because it's been in the news and we've been talking about it to some degree,

170
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:24.990
but we're, as, as a population we're not very sophisticated.

171
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.690
And so there's still going to take advantage of it.

172
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.720
And it's not just the Russians, it's it's any,

173
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.700
any nation that's got the resource or the ability and somewhat motivation and

174
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.450
sees it in their own best interest. They're going to be engaged in this.

175
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.230
So I'll have a cyber unit that's doing this sort of thing. So, you know,

176
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.530
li I don't know where it's going to go, but, you know,

177
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.520
you worry about sort of the, the impact that it has. It's not the,

178
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.320
you know, it's not the, the idea that they're going in there to, uh,

179
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.310
voting machines and switching up data. I mean, frankly,

180
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:03.000
we should be going to a paper-based system. I would, I would, you know,

181
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.860
if it was, if I was in charge, I would say, that's it,

182
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.530
no more paperless voting systems, get that out of here.

183
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:08.820
We're not going to rely on the internet.

184
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.770
You know what they're doing in Iowa for the caucuses,

185
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.560
it's all going to be internet based, uh,

186
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.510
voting reporting for the caucuses in Iowa, right? Yeah. I mean,

187
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.460
but again, you think that, you know, uh,

188
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.580
whether it's independent hackers or state-sponsored from China, Russia,

189
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.040
wherever that question are targeting this, you know,

190
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.530
and they're putting a great deal of resources into it, and they're there,

191
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.920
and they've already probably mapped out the entire infrastructure. So, you know,

192
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.020
Hey, let's get back to the old days.

193
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.760
If you're targeting a terrorist organization and, uh, you start having success,

194
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:42.330
picking up comms. So communications in, in, and, and gathering signals,

195
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:43.164
intelligence on them.

196
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.380
First thing they do is throw their phones away and go back to the old system of,

197
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:49.920
look, I'm going to hand write some message. I'm going to hand it to my cousin.

198
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.470
He's gonna hand it to his cousin. And that's all,

199
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.000
that's our communication system from now.

200
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.420
So we should dumb down and go back to the old days and just do a paper system,

201
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.410
you know, which takes longer and is a pain in the. But yeah, you can't hack,

202
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.860
it can act it. Yeah. Anyway, that's just me.
