00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, dude, I've bombed a lot. I just.</v>

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.920
<v 1>I believe that I don't, I talked to Joe,</v>

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.640
I had George Lopez on my podcast two days ago and he was talking about bombing,

4
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:15.320
but you're a Fred Rogie. Yeah, you're a Joe Grogan. He's he's George Lopez.

5
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.630
What the? How do you guys don't bomb? You have to.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.420
<v 0>Come up with new material and if you're going to come up with new material,</v>

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.260
some of them are going to be duds. That's just how it is. Yeah.

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.730
And also you have to take chances if you want to expand, like comedy is a,

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.490
there's a, there's a bunch of things going on, right?

10
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:34.790
There's you relating to the audience, there's a them liking you.

11
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.510
There's these concepts. You're trying to flesh out the,

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.990
and especially in a workout room, like the comedy store, like you,

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.720
you have to take chances. There's no way around it.

14
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.610
And sometimes those chances fall flat on their face.

15
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.910
But the good thing is those through those painful failures,

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.150
those are like the biggest springboards to improvement and growth.

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.980
Like every time I've ever had a bad set,

18
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:59.030
my next set has been amazing because you just feel the sting and you prepare

19
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.500
better. And also, like,

20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.540
I think my past bombings have prepared me to not bomb again because of the

21
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:07.430
fact that I know what it feels like to suck.

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.310
So I always explain it that it's like something what's bombing.

23
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:15.740
Like it's like sucking a thousand in front of your mother,

24
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
except there's probably someone out there that likes sucking a thousand father

25
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.350
and mother. No one likes bombing. You know, there's probably some guy,

26
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.300
I was just really into humiliation,

27
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.850
but I don't think there is just no one out there is in the bombing.

28
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.190
<v 1>Oh man. I just, yeah, but because it's like, Oh, well, listen, listen, well,</v>

29
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.320
what am I will bet you that no one is bombed harder than me.

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.850
Well, that's not possible. [inaudible] bro.

31
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.270
How's it possible that by the, we,

32
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.310
your trustee savant next to us young, Jamie will pull up.

33
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.310
Did you just stand up? We,

34
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:59.180
he can pull up me bombing in front of a billion

35
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.250
people. What did you do? The Academy awards. Ooh, you hosted it.

36
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.140
Well, here's the thing. So I talk about bombing.

37
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.380
My bigger than your Dick about um,

38
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.270
I'm 24, 24 years old.

39
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.400
I'm doing my movies.

40
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.470
The Academy awards asked me to do a

41
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:28.460
big opening number for them. I'm like, Holy. This is it.

42
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.370
This is a man will get pulled off of YouTube. Yeah. God.

43
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.810
See some look like I'll play it for us.

44
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.800
So when we were free to play before and I go, what context, what context.

45
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.223
<v 0>Stop.</v>

46
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.080
<v 1>Or I'll bomb again? I'll bomb right now again. So they say to me,</v>

47
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.560
they go, we want you to do, and I'm like throw this years as high honor,

48
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.370
86 high hot high honor, California. Sure.

49
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.850
And I should have liked thought

50
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.230
it through. Cause the idea didn't sound great to me,

51
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.040
but it's the Academy awards, you know, they know better than I do.

52
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.023
It's their show.

53
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.220
And the idea is it's going to be an homage to old time Hollywood.

54
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.170
And one of the earliest stars in Hollywood was, um, snow white,

55
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.260
the animated figure. So we're going to have a LA girl,

56
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.370
obviously playing snow white.

57
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.850
And we're going to do a duet because it's a big opening musical number of the

58
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.630
Oscars always used to open with musical numbers before there were monologues.

59
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.040
Really? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yes. This ended, it

60
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.020
ended it. Um, so, uh, I'm like,

61
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.740
okay. I mean it's okay. I mean, it's not like great. Okay.

62
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.230
And anyway, um,

63
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.070
Marvin Hamlisch is gonna write it Marvin Hamlisch I'm like nine old Marvin

64
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.990
Hamlisch as he wrote the staying down and, and then it,

65
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:57.220
while Scott Joplin wrote the staying,

66
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:00.550
but Marvin Hamlisch won the Academy award for that he's double Aw,

67
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.670
squeeze a genius. And you know,

68
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:08.110
I'm not going to tell Marvin Hamlisch should I think that the lyrics are cheesy,

69
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.420
but could do that. So when they get Ike and Tina Turner's proud Mary

70
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.390
and change the lyrics to did a lot of work for, well,

71
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.720
it is ni Ooh. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh no.

72
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.520
I'm saying it's about.

73
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.850
<v 0>Yes. And we're going to pause for the people at home. If you need to,</v>

74
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.630
if you need to watch this YouTube, um, Jamie, what is it? What does it mean?

75
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.310
<v 2>It's on the Hollywood reporters website. I don't know why it's there.</v>

76
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.070
It probably,

77
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.520
what is the title of the actual video blow bombs like that disastrous open?

78
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.390
I don't know.

79
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.080
<v 0>Rob Lowe and snow wides disastrous Oscar opening,</v>

80
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:47.850
February 20th, 2007.

81
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.260
<v 1>Actually the title for the people. It literally says disastrous. Okay.</v>

82
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.010
<v 0>Folks at home, Google this, watch it.</v>

83
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.670
And then we're going to pick this up after Robin. I've watched this.

84
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.890
<v 1>Yes. Is it Lily Tomlin at the end? Now that's a, that's a truncated version.</v>

85
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.720
Give you much of it, but, but can I tell you something where, but I,

86
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.130
I, that was the year that, um, Barry Levinson.

87
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.780
<v 0>I could tell just from the first bar, is that going to be bad? Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.850
When you were saying, did you take same lessons?

89
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.750
<v 2>Nah, the whole thing. What's that sound like? It's 11 minutes long.</v>

90
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.780
It's sheer terror on YouTube. If you want to look.

91
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.420
<v 0>Have 11 minutes that ruined Hollywood producer, Alan Carr's career forever.</v>

92
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.890
Hold on. We'll be right back.

93
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.920
<v 2>He's like, wait, hang on, hang on folks. I need, I need to see this.</v>

94
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.360
First of all, I get it. I get it. Okay. I look out in the middle of it.

95
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.520
I look at it in the middle of the audience.

96
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.230
<v 1>And I see Barry Levinson. So he's at this, on this Oscars.</v>

97
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:55.800
He's about to win literally 11 Academy awards as an actor.

98
00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:59.240
There's no one you would want impress more than Barry Levinson.

99
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.740
It's the year of rain man.

100
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.450
And I look out Joe in the middle of this and I see his face. I'm not kidding.

101
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:10.160
And he's, this is what he literally was going. [inaudible] what the

102
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.380
you see him actually make? I see him mouth, the words, what the.

103
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.560
And, and so I talk about bombing and I'm like, but you know,

104
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.440
we have to have our, our, our actors denial.

105
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.070
Like we can't get through a career without a healthy dose of denial.

106
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:31.940
So I'm like, you know what, Barry Levinson, what does he know anyway, that guy.

107
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.310
And I go backstage and it's in the green room and it's early because

108
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.420
it's early in the show.

109
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:42.770
And there's an older lady in the corner with like flaming red hair.

110
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.950
And I'm kind of looking at her and she sees me. She goes young, man.

111
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.760
I didn't know you as such a good singer. Come sit down. And it was Lucille ball.

112
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.700
And I went over and we sat down and she held my hand and we watched the

113
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:59.030
Oscars together. And you know what?

114
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.500
It made it all made it all almost worthwhile almost.

115
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.740
<v 0>Here's why that's not as bad as bombing doing standup. How is that?</v>

116
00:07:08.741 --> 00:07:12.910
Not as bad as bad because even though a billion people watched it a,

117
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.030
you didn't write it. And B you knew where you were going.

118
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.690
You could just sing the stupid song and get it over with. It's terrible.

119
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.980
It's bombing. It's bad. But when you're bombing doing stand-up,

120
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.450
you are the writer. You are the creator.

121
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.440
You are the performer, put it together, you edited it,

122
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.640
you prepared it. You got it ready. And then you're just up there eating.

123
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.770
And people are angry at you. They're angry. They're angry because they.

124
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.670
<v 1>Oh, they were angry. Oh, I'm sure they were angry.</v>

125
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.720
Here's the other thing they did that they never occurred to the Academy to

126
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:53.680
maybe, maybe that they needed to license the likeness of snow white.

127
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.770
<v 0>Oh yeah. Oh no. Oh yeah.</v>

128
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.120
<v 1>And, and you know how Disney is about likenesses? Oh, they're so easy going.</v>

129
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.280
<v 0>The other. So they're so generous, so.</v>

130
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.510
<v 1>Generous so that see, I would've thought I would've got,</v>

131
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.110
I think I would've gotten away with it a little bit in terms of history,

132
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.670
had there not been massive lawsuits the next day? Oh,

133
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.050
over the likeness thing,

134
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:19.570
which may then people thought about it and people went back and went,

135
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:23.530
wait a minute. That sucked way worse than I thought it did.

136
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.140
<v 0>What was the next thing you did after that?</v>

137
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.710
<v 1>I think let's see. Would it have been?</v>

138
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.550
I feel like it might've been bad influence with Curt,

139
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.380
with James Spader and crew one of my favorites.

140
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.890
<v 0>That's a great movie. I love that. That's a good way to bounce back.</v>

141
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.320
That was a good one. Let's look at the bright side. Yeah.

142
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.600
<v 1>No, listen. And it is a.</v>

143
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.600
<v 0>Did you consider saying no, no, no.</v>

144
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.130
<v 1>I ate people pleasing Midwesterner at</v>

145
00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:58.830
24 does not say no to the Academy of motion, picture arts and sciences.

146
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:03.420
They don't. And every year, every year I am treated to the honor,

147
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.100
the high honor of being on the list of most embarrassing Oscar moments every

148
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.450
year. And, and, and my thing is this is I go, Hey, wait guys,

149
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.970
you couldn't figure out how to announce the best picture two

150
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.790
years ago. And I'm the problem still?

151
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:25.880
Oh.

152
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.500
<v 0>Well it wasn't your fault. I mean, no one would have saved that. No one, no one,</v>

153
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.460
not in a human being could have jumped up there and sang that.

154
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.080
And had it made any sense, maybe Jim Carey, maybe yes. Maybe Jamaica,

155
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.190
Jim Carrey could have done it,

156
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.560
but he would have gone full ACE Ventura over the top and people would have

157
00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:48.300
been just laughing hysterically and how crazy.

158
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.190
<v 1>It's, it's one of my great, um, career,</v>

159
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.740
low light slash highlights. I, it actually,

160
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.290
it actually kind of makes me laugh with, with, with the, uh,

161
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.630
onset of perspective and history.

162
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.490
<v 0>That's the beautiful thing about failures.</v>

163
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.850

164
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.250
<v 1>Back at them. It only took 30 years. That's great.</v>
