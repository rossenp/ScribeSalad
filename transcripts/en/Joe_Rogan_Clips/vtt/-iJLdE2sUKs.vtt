00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. When you put together the Snowden movie,</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.370
what, what was your aim like? What were you trying to get out of that? Well.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.010
<v 1>I knew it was important story because surveillance had no,</v>

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.170
I never imagined surveillance at this level.

5
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:19.010
I realized that it could be every with this new technology we had that it could

6
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.160
be everywhere. I mean, beyond my imagination,

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.370
beyond anybody's imagination. And when I did the movie,

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.350
it was to reveal what he revealed, which was shocking in its implications.

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.540
We went even further and we showed how the control of information,

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.280
the use of information can destabilize many regimes and they went after regime

11
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.260
change became the new Mo the moot, new,

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.490
new modus operandi for the United States. It was okay to change.

13
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:48.230
Regimes were good at it.

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.860
And the way we did it with soft power subtle,

15
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.210
what happened in Brazil a couple of years ago, typical, you know,

16
00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:00.530
the whole forcing out the president of Lola getting rid of the Dilma,

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.950
bringing in this, well, this other guy came in from the right,

18
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.760
but essentially Brazil was completely changed. Completely changed.

19
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.210
They're still working on it in Venezuela. They D they got,

20
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.870
they worked in Bolivia. They got, they got rid of the guy illegally,

21
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.990
Honduras, Libya, Libya, Libya.

22
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.400
That's the most spectacular failure. Right? Well, that was one of.

23
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800
<v 0>One it's a failed state now, but.</v>

24
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.850
<v 1>It was, uh, yeah. But, uh, that,</v>

25
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.570
that comes down to our policy in the middle east. Yeah.

26
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.800
<v 0>When you make a film like that, um,</v>

27
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.080
how hard is it to put together? I mean,

28
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:39.300
the Stoughton film is so disturbing because it's, it's current, right? We're,

29
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.360
we're dealing with things that are happening right now.

30
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.060
How hard is it to put it down and make it this dramatic piece?

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.650
That's going to be enjoyable. It.

32
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.410
<v 1>Was hard. You have to judge that for yourself. I like the movie. I think it's,</v>

33
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.250
uh, it's, uh, it's tense and it keeps the,

34
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.620
it keeps the tension throughout the movie. Uh,

35
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.070
like of course I got to know sown very well and went to Moscow several times and

36
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:05.510
met with them. Oh, really? Yeah.

37
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.700
<v 2>Uh, we had arranged.</v>

38
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.260
<v 1>Well, uh.</v>

39
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740
<v 0>The bandana over your eyes. No.</v>

40
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.740
<v 2>I've done that too, but that was, yeah.</v>

41
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.410
<v 1>That was a terrorist groups in the middle east. But what was that for?</v>

42
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.910
That was for a persona, non grata. It was a documentary I did about, uh,

43
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.920
in 2003 for about, uh, the leader of the, uh,

44
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.780
PLO. Well, Arafat. Yeah, I got, yeah,

45
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.950
I did an interview with them.

46
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.620
<v 0>Wow. What was that? Like?</v>

47
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.580
<v 1>I was more, I didn't have, because of my connections.</v>

48
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.840
I had more contact with the Israeli side. I was in Romola. So, I mean,

49
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:47.300
I was talking to Netanyahu before he was prime minister.

50
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:50.840
I was talking to the leader, the ex prime minister at the prime minute,

51
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.940
all that. And then I went to Romola,

52
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.170
which was the capital of the PLO there. And, uh,

53
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.280
actually I was there the day Israelis.

54
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.200
Then the day before the Israelis came in and knocked out that knocked out

55
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.410
the lights and they isolated, uh,

56
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.230
RFID and the Romola power. We, we got out at the last second actually, but, uh,

57
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.180
we were seeing, we were seeing RFR and, uh, Ty showing his side of the equation,

58
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.690
showing what he was thinking. So as part of that, part of that,

59
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:26.500
I went to see a terrorist group. They became quite famous later.

60
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.340
Then they're well known. They were young guys and they had their masks.

61
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:35.320
And I went at midnight. I was more scared of the Israelis and them real,

62
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.140
the Israelis could be tracking with they're all there.

63
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.650
They have all this equipment, you know, bug the out of us when we're in there.

64
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.750
I was, that's what I'm scared of dangerous. You thought.

65
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.660
<v 0>The Israelis would do that, knowing that you were a filmmaker?</v>

66
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.660
<v 1>I don't know what they're thinking. You know, no me,</v>

67
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.210
I'm not sure that they knew what we were doing. We saw,

68
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.100
they saw people going into a underground bunker with people with masks and

69
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.420
who knows what they think they have great reconnaissance.

70
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.550
Now you have to be careful when you fight them.

71
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.540
<v 0>And so they requested that you wear a mask when they transport,</v>

72
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.420
not Israelis, but I mean.

73
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.630
<v 1>The transport of yes, but when I got there, I took it off. Did.</v>

74
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.030
<v 0>You, but with that decision, was that a tough decision to make,</v>

75
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:21.180
to let them drive you around with a mask on? Um, no.

76
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.170
<v 1>I was very anxious to meet them. They were, they were, uh,</v>

77
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.160
they call them terrorists, but you know, who's a terrorist these days, right?

78
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.280
Uh, yeah. You know, we can bomb other countries to death.

79
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:36.720
It's call ourselves the good guys,

80
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.440
but we kill a lot of civilians around the world with our bombing.

81
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.390
<v 0>This, that that's true.</v>

82
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.510
But this message that you have that you,

83
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.680
you you're, you're not just the guy who makes movies,

84
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:57.360
but you're a guy who makes movies and also a guy who's very outspoken about all

85
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.210
of these issues in the world. Ah,

86
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.260
do those two get in the way of each other sometimes. Yes. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

87
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.610
<v 1>There was people that think sometimes my outspoken,</v>

88
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:12.090
this overshadows my work and it might be true for, but.

89
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.500
<v 0>Well, they try to label you both ways too, which is really fascinating to me.</v>

90
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.100
<v 1>The world is complicated and I, uh,</v>

91
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.760
I did speak out and some people think that's, they say,

92
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:27.990
I'm a filmmaker stick to being that. But you know, it's very hard if you care,

93
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.183
you know, this.

94
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.030
<v 0>Well, it's, it's very important that you don't,</v>

95
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:37.050
and I'm glad that you have the courage to not stick to that. Yeah. I mean,

96
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:41.530
I think it's when, when someone, oh, sorry, please cut it Snowden. No, no.

97
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.110
<v 1>We couldn't get support for it. We,</v>

98
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.310
it was financed ultimately from France and Germany and Italy,

99
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.400
and we got some, some small money at the end,

100
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:54.480
from the U S with a small distributor. I mean, this is the biggest story,

101
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.100
one of the biggest stories of our time.

102
00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:58.910
And we couldn't get from any of the studios. We went to all of them.

103
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 0>Well, people are terrified of it. And.</v>

104
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.100
<v 1>That tells you a lot about what a mess we're in.</v>

105
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.780
We don't even have the guts to talk about stuff. We shut up.

106
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.230
We censor ourselves. We self-censor. Yeah. In the,

107
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.330
in the 1980s and nineties, I probably could have gotten it finance, but not now.

108
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.640
Well.

109
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.430
<v 0>It's such a tense time. And that, that issue is so polarizing.</v>

110
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:22.900
And I don't understand how it isn't,

111
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.150
but I don't understand how it doesn't have universal support by American

112
00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:31.300
citizens. Th th the, this story needs to be told. I mean,

113
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:34.990
even when he was discussed, um, as a podcast guest,

114
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.930
a lot of people were saying, you should really stay away from that. They don't.

115
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.380
<v 1>Understand. They think he's some kind of Russian agent is crazy. You know,</v>

116
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.150
he's very, been very clear about it.

117
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.493
<v 0>Well, he's,</v>

118
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.030
it's very clear when you listen to all of the interviews with him.

119
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.190
And then when I get a chance to talk to him, myself, he is who he says,

120
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:56.710
he is exactly a boy scout. Yeah. I mean,

121
00:06:56.711 --> 00:07:00.280
he has a story and it's a spectacular one. And it's, uh,

122
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.770
it's one of the most important historical moments of our time that we

123
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.150
recognize that this overwhelming surveillance state

124
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.050
has, has existed without us even knowing it. And.

125
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.490
<v 1>Cyber warfare too. It raises the whole issue of who's doing what to who you,</v>

126
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.330
we were very quick to say, they're doing that to us, China, Russia,

127
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:24.730
this that they're doing their steel, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

128
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.620
What are we doing? Yeah. Yeah.
