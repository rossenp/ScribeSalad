00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.080
<v 1>Experience, I would like to, to be there, to try to,</v>

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.680
to try to bridge that gap right. Of the,

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.720
the nons skating viewer who is interested and explain to them why,

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.280
you know, why this, this nuance is gonna score way higher than this other,

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.190
even though they look the same. Mm. To you. Yeah. Um, and I've done it.

7
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.550
I've done. Like they had the, uh,

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.590
vans park series all last year where we went to all over the world and

9
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:33.950
went to China, Brazil, uh, Canada, France. And, um,

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.190
they built these parks that they left there, but I was doing all the,

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.100
the commentary for the events and that of us kind of where that's,

12
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:44.220
where my strengths are is,

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.700
is being able to explain those things to nons skaters. Well, that's gotta.

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.140
<v 0>Be fun for you too, because it's an opportunity to sort of, you know,</v>

15
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.860
proselytize, let everybody know, like, like show them how cool this is.

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.450
Put, put words to your passion, this thing. And I mean,

17
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.770
that's gotta really spark up the interests of new.

18
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.930
<v 1>Skaters. I, I think that's the silver lining with the Olympics. I mean, there,</v>

19
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:12.730
there is a lot of controversy in the hardcore skate scene where it's just like,

20
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.970
we're not, we don't belong in limit.

21
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.730
We've always done this to be anti that type of thing anyway. Yeah. And,

22
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:19.170
and then it's just like, well, you guys,

23
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.040
all those things that you love about skating will exist. Right.

24
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.240
Of course you can still go hop fences and skate the hint,

25
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.680
or like that's not taken away from you. If anything,

26
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.360
it's going to bring it to a bigger audience that that is going to be interested.

27
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.200
Yeah. And I believe a, a more international audience.

28
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.640
I think that's the really cool part about.

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.040
<v 0>It. That's a thing though, man, when people,</v>

30
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.990
when things start going mainstream people is panic.

31
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.790
<v 1>Right. But that's the, the other thing is this, like,</v>

32
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.510
if you think that the competition element is what is somehow sanitizing

33
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:55.110
skating we've had, I grew up skating competitions. I,

34
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.270
I literally entered my first contest at age 10. &lt;laugh&gt;.

35
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.150
That is the only way you got recognized when I was a kid. Like,

36
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.900
this is not something new you to skateboarding.

37
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.860
It's just that now there are different opportunities in skating and there is a

38
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.580
way to make a living, even if you don't compete. And so, because that exists,

39
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:15.540
people are just like, uh, Olympics are a con you know,

40
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.580
that's a sport competition. Like, yeah. But we already have street league.

41
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:23.340
We already have the due tour. We already have X games. Those things all exist.

42
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:26.330
So we're gonna have this other big event. Once every four years.

43
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.610
<v 0>People always want on something that's different than what they're doing though.</v>

44
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.290
Oh, sure. It.

45
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.610
<v 1>Seems like, I mean, Hey,</v>

46
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:38.570
I I've lived with so much ridicule my whole life that I just it's like, yeah,

47
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.610
sure. Whatever you say.

48
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.330
<v 0>Well for you, I mean, you've crossed over to the other side.</v>

49
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.040
That's what's in interesting. I mean, you don't even need a thick skin anymore.

50
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.480
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, there's, there's obviously still haters.</v>

51
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.560
Like you're a sell out and whatnot, but it's.

52
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.520
<v 0>Like, do you read those comments? Don't read Twitter or anything? Do you? I, I.</v>

53
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.440
<v 1>Like, I, if someone's making enough noise, I'll see it. And you know,</v>

54
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:04.800
every once in a while, I like to see what the,

55
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:09.120
what the general vibe is on something. But, um, when I grew up, like,

56
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.240
I think my journey allowed me to really be prepared for that because when I

57
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:17.160
was a kid, I was doing this outcast activity. Right.

58
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.710
So I was already not cool in school.

59
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.350
And then I started skating and I was like a scrawny little kid with a really

60
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.790
sort of what they call robotic style because I was focusing on tricks.

61
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.430
So I was getting made fun of in the skate world.

62
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.510
So I was like an outcast in this outcast activity and it was really isolating.

63
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.910
And at some point I was just like, I love this too,

64
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.940
to listen to these people and not do it, like.

65
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.740
<v 0>Explain to me what you were getting on for, like you had a robotic style.</v>

66
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.900
<v 1>So basically what, in, in, when I first started getting into skating,</v>

67
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.580
especially pool skating to be a pool skater,

68
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.300
you had to be super cool, looked like you're surfing.

69
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.180
It was all about your style. Right.

70
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.090
And it was all about like how you flow and if you're doing aerials,

71
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:04.730
it's gotta look cool. And, and I was super scrawny,

72
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.170
super short kid. And so all I really knew how to do was to maneuver my board.

73
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.770
And so I was doing these tricks where I'd like,

74
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:15.490
spin my board under my feet and do these weird sort of hand plants

75
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.250
and, and aerial tricks and,

76
00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:20.840
and things where it just wasn't that wasn't the normal,

77
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.240
and it wasn't really considered the cool way to skate. And so they just,

78
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.360
they were like, there's, they call me a circus circus skater.

79
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.120
&lt;laugh&gt; they're like, oh, there's Tony with the circus tricks. Oh, wow.

80
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.640
And then at some point I just like,

81
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.880
I loved what I was doing and I didn't really listen to it. And then I got,

82
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.750
I got more confident and I got stronger. And then I started doing this stuff,

83
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:42.950
like way up high in the air.

84
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.230
And then it was sort of undeniable that it was like, oh, well that,

85
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.093
that is something.

86
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.910
<v 0>So was there pressure for you to change your style and sort of blend in?</v>

87
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.630
<v 1>I, I just didn't have, I didn't have the, the bulk to be able to do it anyway.</v>

88
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.260
So the physical bulk. Yeah. Like I just have that weight behind me.

89
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.900
And so what I did was when back then,

90
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.900
in order to do aerials outta pools, you had to like reach down,

91
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:12.020
grab your board and sort of muscle it into the air and, and above the coping.

92
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.020
And I learned how to launch into the air without grabbing my board and then

93
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:21.500
grabbing it at the peak. And that allowed me to get the height when I,

94
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.810
I was still really scrawny and weak.

95
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.010
And they said that technique was cheating.

96
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.490
Like they literally wrote that in Thra your magazine. It's just like, well,

97
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:32.890
Tony Hawk cheats, cuz he alwayss into his air.

98
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.690
And that way he can just grab it wherever. And I was just like, yes,

99
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.770
that's exactly it. That's what I'm trying to do. That's so weird.

100
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.520
<v 0>That's so weird. So they would you on like, that's so crazy,</v>

101
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.160
here's this invented thing, right, right.

102
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:52.160
This art form and then you are doing it your way and they're saying you're

103
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:53.240
cheating. Yeah.

104
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.600
<v 1>Yeah. I don't, it just,</v>

105
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.680
it was just like this old guard in skating and they just,

106
00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:03.520
they didn't like to see anything new or, or sort of fringe.

107
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.600
And then I started doing that. And then,

108
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.600
and then a lot of my peers who were my age,

109
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.480
they all figured that same technique out.

110
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:12.840
And then we just kind of took over &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

111
00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:16.790
that became the way to skate. And um, but, but then through years,

112
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.190
like in those days, you know, skating was still very much a novelty.

113
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.470
And then in the nineties, like X games came into play and then all of a sudden,

114
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.150
my name was, was being well was well known, not mainstream, but,

115
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:35.670
but getting there. And then our video game came out and then it was just like,

116
00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:40.180
oh, you're just a sellout. Wow. And it was like because of the video game,

117
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.500
because the video game, the endorsements that, that followed from that,

118
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.900
you know, I was doing stuff for Jeep, for McDonald's for Doritos.

119
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.340
And they were just like, oh, you're just a sell.

120
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.380
I was like it when I turned pro at age 14,

121
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.580
if McDonald's had asked me to be a commercial, I would've jumped on it.

122
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.130
Are you kidding me? Like I was eating McDonald's my whole life.

123
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.290
I still do &lt;laugh&gt; so it, it,

124
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:05.250
it was more like they thought somehow I changed my values and was just like, I,

125
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.730
I haven't changed my value system.

126
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.930
It's just that I'm getting these opportunities finally.

127
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.650
And I've been doing this for most of my life.

128
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.730
<v 0>For the most part. It's getting opportunities that they're not. So the,</v>

129
00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:18.280
the best way to dismiss that or diminish it is to say that you're a seller out,

130
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.320
cuz you're on a video game. Like that's so short sided.

131
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.040
<v 1>Sure. But, but you know, but, but so what I'm saying is that just sort of,</v>

132
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.280
that sort of steeled my resolve where,

133
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.360
so once social media came into play and people were talking online, I was like,

134
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:34.360
you're not getting to me, &lt;laugh&gt; through this,

135
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.470
you know this through this media, right. People to say this to my face,

136
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:42.670
used to write about this, this write about me in magazines.

137
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:47.110
Like you're hiding behind your Twitter username. I don't care. When you.

138
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.230
<v 0>First saw someone say that you were cheating by using that technique,</v>

139
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.910
how bad that must have sucked.

140
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.790
<v 1>Up. Yeah. And it was from a, it was from a,</v>

141
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.710
a skater that I really respected too.

142
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.580
Like he was quoted in the magazine and that was, it was crushing. Wow.

143
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.380
<v 0>That's such a approach. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, cheating.</v>

144
00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:08.700
Like that's so weird to me cause I never would've. I guess it makes sense.

145
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.980
Cuz there's always factions in any discipline or any art form or anything where

146
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:15.580
some people respect some things and other people on it. And,

147
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.850
but the idea that you doing it your way would some how or no they'd be cheating

148
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.530
to me. It seems so strange that doesn't make any sense.

149
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.810
<v 1>Like I said, it, it was,</v>

150
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.410
it was just weird because skating was such a small community at the time and it

151
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.010
was, it was like, why are you like, why are we fighting,

152
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.850
fighting right in our little tiny world.

153
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.170
<v 0>That's always gonna be that way. Yeah. That's just humans,</v>

154
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.920
especially when you're doing something different.

155
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.160
Especially if you're getting attention, doing something different,

156
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:46.600
they're gonna find some way to diminish you. Yeah. It was.

157
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.001
<v 1>Just, it was,</v>

158
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:51.480
it was harder for me because all I wanted to be was accepted as a skater.

159
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.640
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

160
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.240
I kind of given up on my peers and my school mates.

161
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.800
I knew I wasn't gonna fit in there. And so I was like,

162
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:02.320
I found this thing and then just like you guys don't like me the way I do it

163
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.483
rough.

164
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.000
<v 0>But look, you hung in there and came out on the other end.</v>

165
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.400
<v 1>Yeah. And I don't, I don't Harbor any elbow, you know what I mean?</v>

166
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.280
A lot of people are like, oh, you should go back to school, like go to your,

167
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.270
you. And I was like, I don't,

168
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.710
it's not some revenge for me. I just loved.

169
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.150
I'm just so thankful that I still get to do this for a living.

170
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.750
Like this is seriously living the dream. Like I get to do this for a living.

171
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.830
I get to come on your show because I'm a skateboarder.

172
00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:33.430
Like the stuff that I've gotten to do over my life is beyond any dream I could

173
00:09:33.431 --> 00:09:38.020
have ever written or imagined. And it's all because I just kept skating.

174
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.203
That is.

175
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.300
<v 0>The American dream to me, for the worldwide dream, the human dream. Absolutely.</v>

176
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.300
To be able to do what you want for a living and to continue doing it. Yeah.

177
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.460
And to support your family and to, you know, it's.

178
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.140
<v 1>Crazy the kind of stuff that yeah. That we've gotten to do,</v>

179
00:09:54.141 --> 00:09:58.050
especially as a family, like kind of trips we've taken and people we've met for.

180
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.250
<v 0>Skating. Yeah. For skating. That's crazy. That's amazing.</v>

181
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.490
Do you still talk to that guy with on you back then?

182
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.690
Do you know who that guy is? I mean, do.

183
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.370
<v 1>You know him? I think he, he fell on some hard times. I don't. Yeah.</v>

184
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.410
<v 0>That's how it usually goes with haters. Yeah. Sorry.</v>
