1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>There might be something to that. Why is it racist to say, why is it racist?</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.820
<v 1>They were smarter. Right? Just say something as less smart, but less. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.180
But no, we're the smartest ones. Maybe second.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.350
<v 0>Maybe the Chinese girl, you beat. Well, you know, Asians, this is,</v>

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:17.460
what's really crazy. Yeah.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.540
There's a real issue right now with Asians and university enrollments,

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.330
particularly in Harvard, they discriminate against Asians.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.033
<v 1>Asian, so many apply.</v>

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.150
<v 0>Because so many are kicking.</v>

10
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.540
<v 1>To get them out of them.</v>

11
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.470
<v 0>Yeah. And there's,</v>

12
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.270
there's like real talk about how this is crazy because Asian

13
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:40.680
people for BI, all right, this is a generalization and try not to be racist,

14
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.750
but generally speaking,

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.090
Asian students are known as working very hard and they're

16
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:50.340
very dedicated and they're very successful.

17
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.240
And the representation is overwhelming in terms of their numbers in the

18
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.180
population. And sure they're killing it, killing it.

19
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.270
And because of that and their,

20
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.640
their mindset is to just work really hard.

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.570
It's not to protest the things and not to shut things down.

22
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.920
It's just to work in the library.

23
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.690
<v 1>During all those protests that is in the library.</v>

24
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.850
<v 0>For the Indians, while this is all happening.</v>

25
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.830
I'm not saying that they're not socially conscious,

26
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.940
but while this is all happening,

27
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.230
they're not protesting it the way may be other groups that felt

28
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.980
marginalized, whether it was people of color or trans people or gay people,

29
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.770
whatever it is, don't feel represented or discriminated against,

30
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.770
they would be shutting down, you know,

31
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.360
conferences and yelling down speakers and shouting out in the hallway.

32
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.283
But the Asians,

33
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.300
the whole reason why they kick is because they don't spend any time on petty get

34
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:43.740
done. So because of that, the Harvard, Harvard Harvard is saying, Hey,

35
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.120
we're going to be racist against you.

36
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.210
Cause we know you're not going to complain. Well, why, what? Look at this,

37
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.010
pull this up, pull this up. Jamie.

38
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:54.720
I want you to pull up Asian students harder to get into

39
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:59.040
Harvard lawsuit. That's crazy. It's crazy.

40
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:00.510
And it's not a small amount.

41
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.410
They're discriminating by they're making their grades considerably higher in

42
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.420
order to gain acceptance. Really? Yes.

43
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.840
<v 1>Wow. Yeah. I mean, is that because of a natural breakdown of different races,</v>

44
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.793
you can't.

45
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.290
<v 0>You can't slow one down. And that.</v>

46
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.080
<v 1>Just means whatever would have less, less productive.</v>

47
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.170
<v 0>And graduates. It doesn't make any sense. It's a crazy way of thinking,</v>

48
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.970
but it's all in this idea of diversity.

49
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.010
Like instead of treating people as individuals,

50
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.420
instead of just saying human beings,

51
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.470
you have to have each class represented by a certain amount of people,

52
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.220
but it's not anti racist. It's like,

53
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:36.540
it's not a racist idea to want everybody to be treated as one.

54
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.651
It's just,

55
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:42.300
it can be done with an eye on avoiding all possible racism.

56
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.880
It can be done to people purely as individuals.

57
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.980
Here's the worst way that can ever be done.

58
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.790
The worst way is you tell the most successful people were complaining the least

59
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.320
that they have to work harder. You are getting by your genes. You,

60
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.200
the people in your past and your group, your little gene pool, two good.

61
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.610
You're doing too good in school.

62
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.980
So we don't make it harder than it is from my kids.

63
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.540
That's not literally what people are doing there because if they didn't Harvard

64
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.540
would, it'd be like all Asians, Asians would be dominating.

65
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.620
And the very reason why they think they can get away with this lawsuit, accuses,

66
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.710
Harvard have discriminated against Asian-American applicants in personal

67
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.120
ratings, personal.

68
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.953
<v 1>Writings.</v>

69
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.440
<v 0>I don't know what it is, man. They're making it more difficult.</v>

70
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.580
It says students for fair admissions has accused Harvard of intentionally

71
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:31.240
discriminating against Asian-American applicants by limiting their admissions

72
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.770
numbers. So they're limiting the number of, oh, and this many agents.

73
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.840
<v 1>That's super hard for like,</v>

74
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.700
let's say like Vietnamese or not the Chinese or Japanese, you know, Asian.

75
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.430
<v 0>The late. We don't know if this is true. We should say, you know,</v>

76
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.700
just to be really clear, this is a lawsuit. We don't know if this is true,

77
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.430
but this is the argument. And this is the argument that many, many,

78
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:55.180
many people have made. Now I haven't really personally researched this,

79
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:58.180
but I know a lot of like legitimate intellectuals have brought this up in

80
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.940
debates and conversations. And they're saying, look, this is an issue.

81
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.160
This is essentially,

82
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.630
this is sanctioned racism against one group because they're too effective.

83
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.613
So you're limiting.

84
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.980
<v 1>Or you're saying why we're trying to get more of an emphasis on like</v>

85
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.850
extracurricular.

86
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.380
<v 0>Should we get in or out based on being Asian or based on being</v>

87
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:18.910
European, that's crazy.

88
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.310
You should get in or out by you having merit and you being, oh,

89
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:26.860
a worthy student and difficult schools like Harvard are supposed to be

90
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.410
difficult. And if the cream of the crop all comes from Asia,

91
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.730
shouldn't we look at what the we're doing here. That we can't compete with them.

92
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.780
I mean, what is it? Wow there, do we want Asian students?

93
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.880
Do we want to compete with them? I mean, is it too much?

94
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.760
Or they were requiring too much of their life to be successful with their Stu

95
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.520
their schoolwork. I mean, that's the thing, too.

96
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.660
If you're going through college.

97
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.970
<v 1>You want a normal life. You want to blow up your normal life to.</v>

98
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.391
<v 0>What,</v>

99
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:53.830
if you're going through college and everything you're doing all day is studying.

100
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.761
And you literally,

101
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:59.260
you might have like some part-time job somewhere to make some money for food.

102
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.720
And then you're studying more, right? Maybe you have a part-time job,

103
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:04.510
a lot of people don't. So if you think about all that, that's not the.

104
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.400
<v 1>Kind of life I want for my kids. That's a.</v>

105
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.870
<v 0>Crazy life. And especially with some of the things are just for four years,</v>

106
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.420
some of the things it's not that anything you're really interested in,

107
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.150
but you have to get it on. You have to, you know,

108
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:19.330
you have to have a fully balanced education. So you have to take classes.

109
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:22.270
You're not even remotely interested in and you have to do it.

110
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.620
And it's this one way.

111
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:26.710
And this is how we can assure that you have enough knowledge that we can give

112
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:30.010
you a piece of paper that says you have a degree. I mean,

113
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.330
an Asians are killing it.

114
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.500
<v 1>Alec. They are killing it. That's the game. Okay.</v>

115
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.250
<v 0>Well, we'll just going to work 20 hours, dude. I, my friend junk sick.</v>

116
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.050
I've think I've told you about him before.

117
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.090
He was a U S national TaeKwonDo team member. When I was like, Hmm.

118
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.770
<v 1>I was less junk. Sec.</v>

119
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.960
<v 0>Indonesia, junk sick Chang he's Korean. He was going through his residency.</v>

120
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.380
He was going to be a doctor going through his residency and training for the

121
00:05:56.381 --> 00:06:00.770
national team. And he was running stairs, running stairs in the school,

122
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.830
in between studying. He would do studying the nude, run the stairs.

123
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.350
I got a hold of guy. I've got back, dude, you couldn't hold him back.

124
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.270
He slept four hours a night. That if.

125
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.180
<v 1>That's true, that's the same as like, he was always tired.</v>

126
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.080
<v 0>He's.</v>

127
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.120
<v 1>Always tired because he works hard. So, he didn't.</v>

128
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.650
<v 0>Give a. He was always tired. He would just show up exhausted and kick. Wow.</v>

129
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.650
And he wasn't physically talented either. This guy made it to the,

130
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.260
to the nationals and he,

131
00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:25.880
he became a national champion and he wasn't even like really,

132
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.110
really physically talented.

133
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.520
It wasn't like some freak athlete that just move super fast. You can't,

134
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:34.430
he's just unbelievably smart, unbelievably hard worker.

135
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.270
But I saw the way that guy was living as he was like,

136
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.740
I was a couple of years younger than him.

137
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.250
And he was going through his residency and training and doing all this crazy at

138
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:47.180
the same time. And I was, I was like, I'm exhausted just watching you. Like,

139
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:50.570
I can't see how the soup could be worth it to do all those things. Did you,

140
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.550
one of those things, maybe that's what I want to do.

141
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:55.100
I want to do one of those things, but you're doing two of those things.

142
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.660
He was doing what I was doing. And then on top of them more and way more,

143
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.040
way more. He was doing schoolwork. Dad was delivering newspapers and.

144
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.160
<v 1>Th if that's happening, they're just saying like,</v>

145
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.460
it's the same thing as like making it so white people get ahead. It's crazy.

146
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.370
It's like, oh, there's loitering laws. Now you're arrested.

147
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.204
If you don't have a job.

148
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.030
<v 0>That's it. This is where you can realize that all this stuff is crazy.</v>

149
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.900
You're S you're, you're being racist against a minority.

150
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.060
And you think it's okay because they kick so much.

151
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.960
<v 1>Cause they're a powerful, we can take them down south.</v>

152
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.250
<v 0>It's literally racist.</v>

153
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:31.880
Because if you're saying you can only have a certain number of these people in

154
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:36.410
there, it's crazy. That's racist. It's gotta be tough to say no,

155
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:38.690
we're trying to keep a diverse population.

156
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.210
It's not a representative population of the best of the.

157
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.040
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

158
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:46.580
they should take off any of their names off their applications or something like

159
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.010
that. And just be like, let's see what they got. Yeah.

160
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.010
<v 0>But I guess they'd probably judge you based on many things. Right.</v>

161
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.960
<v 1>You know, they try that for the old daily show with Jon.</v>

162
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.120
<v 0>Stewart. Just take the names off the application.</v>

163
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.790
<v 1>We don't want to see your names. Just so your writing sample. Oh.</v>

164
00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.690
<v 0>That's smart.</v>

165
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.760
<v 1>Yeah. That's smart. Well, here's what happened though.</v>

166
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.380
They hired only white males. Yeah.

167
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.600
And then John Stewart was like, okay,

168
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.830
I guess we're going in blind is not enough. I guess we up.

169
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.860
He didn't even say like, well, that just shows. It's not our fault.

170
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.770
That's just randomly. We had eight people and they happened to be white dudes.

171
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.030
<v 0>Here's the thing though. If you had movers. Okay.</v>

172
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:26.690
And you wanted to move furniture and you tested people for moving furniture,

173
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.350
is it okay to hire all men? It's okay. Why?

174
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.850
Because they're physically stronger physically right now. Um,

175
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.100
is it okay to hire someone who you think is going to be the best

176
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:43.220
at the job or do you have to have a certain amount of women?

177
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.850
So you wouldn't expect it from something physical, like a moving company,

178
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.400
but why should it be mandatory for something like a creative?

179
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.710
<v 1>Well, it's different a little bit because no one,</v>

180
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.860
except the client is appreciating the movers. So he's just like,

181
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.770
if I'm hiring on the only one who have to deal with it.

182
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.560
<v 0>Like say if you were saved, you were, um, doing a show like a woman's show,</v>

183
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:05.640
a woman's comedy show.

184
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.980
<v 1>What am I me now? Or am I a woman? You'd have to be a woman.</v>

185
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.290
<v 0>Okay, go ahead. And you want,</v>

186
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.710
you are a female executive producer and you want to have like a female voice to

187
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:21.300
it. So you want to just hire some really funny chicks and what guy is going to,

188
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.880
I know, obviously it happens way, way, way,

189
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:27.000
way more often the opposite way where women get discriminated against.

190
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.710
But what guy is going to say, no, that. I want a part of this. You know,

191
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.210
I should have a job here. You should.

192
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.363
<v 1>Go patrol.</v>

193
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.380
<v 0>You won't be equally represented male versus female.</v>

194
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.050
Cause that's what a lot of people feel like when it comes to men and women,

195
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.500
like someone was telling bird on his podcast that the comedy store should be.

196
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.810
<v 1>I know, I know that lady just, it,</v>

197
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.220
she honestly has no idea what American comedy is all about. She definitely not.

198
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.600
LA yeah. Yeah. She's speaking in an uninformed way. The white child does a lot.

199
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.020
I mean, it's ridiculous to, and it's not a joke. He's just not that smart.

200
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:01.020
You don't get to tell that whatever, but this one was the same as jail,

201
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:04.830
where she was like uninformed and just going full bore. Um,

202
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.300
and she wasn't doing to promote anything.

203
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:08.340
She was just doing it because she thought it was right. But it's like, oh,

204
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:12.660
you don't really understand how this works. Um, there's a process.

205
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.240
Or it's like, I saw a blog once said we need more women in,

206
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.460
in like hiring positions. And it's like, oh,

207
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.520
you mean the head of the comedy store? The head of the comedy cellar,

208
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.420
head of New York comedy club, uh, uh, Cole, Bayer,

209
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.390
like there's plenty of female bookers. Like you don't really know.

210
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.820
So when you tell them that, then, then you go, oh, okay. Oh,

211
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:30.654
I didn't realize that.

212
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.050
<v 0>Well, there's certain things that people love to say when they've done.</v>

213
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.420
Almost no research on what it actually is. Yeah.

214
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.450
<v 1>Yeah. So that lady, that lady had no clue. She just goes,</v>

215
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.440
I'm not getting in here. I'm a big comic. I'm not getting in here. It must be.

216
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.470
It's just not causation causality. She goes, it must be because of this.

217
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.060
I've had my agents call and it's like, oh no,

218
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:51.750
I worked for Mitzi when agents or managers call and say my client and she go

219
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.130
off. That's not the way we do things.
