00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.870
Did you get a chance to look at that chaos book that I, that I told you about?

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.830
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Tom O'Neill, who is a friend of my good friend,

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.240
Greg Fitzsimmons wrote an insane book that took him 20 years

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.320
about Manson and the CIA and LSD.

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.490
And what'd you think about all that? Uh, well.

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.080
<v 1>You've touched on some, I mean,</v>

8
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:28.760
it's it's or Tom touched on some really interesting things that, uh,

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.550
what I liked about his book and I went through it,

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.720
I read it is that he's, he's,

11
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.950
he's actually, I think very honest about the shortcomings right.

12
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:42.030
Of what he ended up doing. Right. And, and,

13
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.150
and the research that he went through and where he couldn't draw connections. I,

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.690
so I give him a lot of credit. I think it's, it's well worth the read. Um,

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.110
and you know, it's, it's a, it's a hell of a,

16
00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:56.990
just a personal story that it took him this long right.

17
00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:01.670
To make his way through with a variety of reasons. But, um, yeah. It.

18
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.050
<v 0>Luckily it's been a tremendous success. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean,</v>

19
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.100
it's really, he sold, he sold out almost immediately and, uh,

20
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:14.210
the paperbacks are sold out too. I mean, he's, I think Manson renting it,

21
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.520
huge draw. Right. But it's also, yeah,

22
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.440
it's a fantastic encount account of all the things that happened with the Manson

23
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:26.360
family and all those people that were alive back then about how this guy kept

24
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.480
getting out of jail and they, they kept arresting him and they kept saying,

25
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:30.940
this is above my pay grade and they would.

26
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.290
<v 1>Yeah. And that's, that's for me,</v>

27
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.530
that's the strangest part about the whole story, right. I mean, I, you know,

28
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:39.320
this idea that, you know, was Manson, uh, you know,

29
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.830
a lab rat for the CIA and you know, how, how,

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.680
how far down that rabbit hole do you want to go well,

31
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.920
is pretty clear about that. Right? It's uh, that's, uh,

32
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.890
not a particularly solid connection. It's a tenuous connection.

33
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:56.210
I think he called it, um, between one of the, what used to be a, uh, uh,

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.020
a contractor, a researcher for a,

35
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.580
that old Chestnut MK ultra John West. Yeah. Yeah.

36
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.180
<v 0>What did you think about all that? Like, I'm sure you know,</v>

37
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:11.590
about operation midnight climax and all this stuff. That's absolutely true.

38
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.973
Yeah. I don't know.

39
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.440
<v 1>It'd be interesting to know how many people are, are aware. I mean,</v>

40
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.240
I know some people that, you know, that that's what they.

41
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.010
<v 0>Do. Midnight climax operation,</v>

42
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:23.960
midnight climax was a CIA funded program where they

43
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:25.250
dosed up Johns.

44
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.260
They created brothels and dosed up Johns with LSD against their

45
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:34.700
knowledge. Yep. And, uh, without their knowledge and, uh, let them, uh, foreign,

46
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.880
uh, Kate and have a good old time with these ladies of the evening,

47
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.210
man watched them and filmed them and studied them. I.

48
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.280
<v 1>Know. And when you say it that way, I'm, I'm in,</v>

49
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:47.720
if you want money for produce that movie, but it's, um, I, it is actually, yeah,

50
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:51.020
it's true. Look, you have to, it fell under the, uh,

51
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.370
sort of umbrella of this MK altar, which is public knowledge. I'm not, you know,

52
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:56.900
obviously we're not talking to an attorney. Well.

53
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.120
<v 0>Let's also give them the benefit.</v>

54
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.040
The doubt when LSD was synthesized by Albert Hoffman,

55
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.010
they really needed to figure out what the this was.

56
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.850
And they need to figure out like, could this be used against Americans?

57
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.580
Could this be used against the president? Or what is this,

58
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.430
is this a truth serum? Like what, what are the benefits?

59
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.430
What's the pros and cons and what are the dangers of this stuff? Well,

60
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.970
that's a national security angle. It's very important that they did study.

61
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.150
<v 1>It. Right. And so from context, and again,</v>

62
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:26.340
we talked about that towards the beginning is, is, you know,

63
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.000
which something we don't normally do. Right. So you were,

64
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.860
we're judging people from history now, right. Under the UN.

65
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.720
And so we're not using context of, well, what was the,

66
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.690
what were the conditions if we're talking about the 1950s.

67
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.980
<v 0>The 1960s or.</v>

68
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.190
<v 1>Late forties, right? I mean, so, so what have you got, you got the,</v>

69
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.210
the end of the world war II, you got the cold war. Uh, it's the late forties.

70
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.450
Uh, you've got the Soviet union, um,

71
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.740
that is heavily invested in, um,

72
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.840
in a variety of experiments,

73
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:58.800
mind control brainwashing was this sort of the term of, of, of the culture.

74
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.460
Right. And, and brainwashing was a big issue, uh, w not a big issue, but it was,

75
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.200
it captured people's imagination back then. So the late forties, early fifties,

76
00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:11.970
it was Korean war. Um, yeah. W we had an existential threat,

77
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.420
right. We had nukes pointed each other. We had, you know, drills in schools,

78
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.950
kids hiding under desks. I mean, what the?

79
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.290
So with the fear that the Chinese or the

80
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.150
Soviets were going to develop a mind control abilities

81
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.870
was, uh, pervasive. And it sounds, I know, you know,

82
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.420
you talk about it now and everybody rolls her eyes and goes, oh my God.

83
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.650
But you're absolutely right.

84
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:38.310
That you have to understand the context with which then Alan Dulles,

85
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:41.160
who was the, at the time, the director of.

86
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.240
<v 0>The CIA, by the way, the guy who Kennedy fired yes.</v>

87
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.110
Wound up being a part of the Warren commission after Kennedy was murdered,

88
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:53.190
which was very strange. Oh, I like that.

89
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.970
I like where that could go. Um, so,

90
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.220
so anyway, uh.

91
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.120
<v 1>We got, uh, we got Alan Dallas who in 53,</v>

92
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.730
early in 53 says, all right. Um,

93
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.760
we have to understand what the, what the, uh, the Soviets are doing,

94
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.570
particularly the Soviets. Uh, but we also had, you know, uh, again,

95
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:18.120
I I'm sure some folks listening know all this,

96
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:21.990
but a lot of folks probably don't we had POW's returning American people,

97
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.690
but others were returning from Korea. That was a big issue, right.

98
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.560
Because some of them came back, um, again, quote unquote, brainwashed, you know,

99
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.800
and, and some of them didn't want to return because, you know, again,

100
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.040
brainwashing, you know, mind control that, you know,

101
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.760
perhaps the Chinese had developed these techniques. So, uh,

102
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.290
initially the idea was defensive.

103
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.160
How do we protect ourselves against this new threat within this cold war against

104
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:48.210
these enemies who appear to be devoting a great deal of resources against this?

105
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.570
Well, so initially it started out as a defensive effort.

106
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:54.750
MK ultra was the umbrella name for a whole bunch,

107
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:59.540
over 140 projects, sub projects underneath them,

108
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.770
MK ultra. And it was all based around, uh, chemical substances,

109
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:08.360
use of chemicals, use of drugs, um, behavioral, uh,

110
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.100
issues with, with human beings, um, creating false memories,

111
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.610
uh, deleting, uh, memory, uh, influencing the behavior again of, of,

112
00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.150
of individuals. Uh,

113
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.230
there were a variety of projects that fell under this MK ultra.

114
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:26.540
And it was again, starting out as a defensive issue,

115
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:30.050
but then quickly became a sort of an offense. How do we,

116
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.290
how do we become the leader in all of this, which is typical, right.

117
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.920
That's typical on how things develop. It's like cyber warfare, you know,

118
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:38.780
initially it's defensive and now you think, okay,

119
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:42.040
now we got to figure out how to make it work on our backs. And.

120
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.210
<v 0>Sometimes it's important,</v>

121
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:47.110
like when they shut down the Iran nuclear program with a virus,

122
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.790
essentially a computer virus.

123
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.960
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. And where this went off the rails in, in, in,</v>

124
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.600
in a handful of ways, in many ways, um,

125
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.900
was testing on unwitting subjects,

126
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.860
things such as LSD and in a variety of other substances. Yeah. Woops,

127
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.060
and those subjects, unwitting subjects ranged everything from, uh,

128
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.020
in federal prisons to, uh, state, uh, mental hospitals. Uh,

129
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.300
that's where Manson comes in and that's where Manson comes in and, and, um,

130
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.490
and a variety of other people, um, you know, who, it's just, it's, it's,

131
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.440
uh, I would recommend people, you know, dig in don't, you know, don't settle on,

132
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.600
um, just one account. And one of the things that people should also do,

133
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:34.150
if they want to read about this is read the,

134
00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:37.540
any testimony that came out of the CIA and the, and there was some testimony,

135
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:40.750
there were, there were documents written by the inspector general back in 50.

136
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:43.960
And this, this time period was about 53. Um,

137
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.790
through at least officially acknowledged 64, 19 64.

138
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.170
And then the program was wrapped up. Um, supposedly there were still,

139
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.623
um.

140
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.313
<v 2>Um.</v>

141
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.610
<v 1>Federal programs, military programs,</v>

142
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.650
others that we're still looking into issues related to, uh,

143
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.630
the use of, uh, chemical substances, uh, for everything,

144
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:15.280
again, from interrogation to, um, uh, behavioral,

145
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.770
uh, adjustment. And, and a lot of these things were, were funded, uh,

146
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.210
through cutouts. So you'd set up again. This is, you know, early fifties,

147
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:29.470
mid fifties, early sixties set up, um, uh,

148
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.220
financing vehicles, you know, through say, uh, you know,

149
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:37.990
what appear to be a non-threatening grant

150
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.090
programs, you know, from research institutes. So you'd, you'd,

151
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.800
you'd loop in academic institutions or researchers,

152
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.630
and MK ultra had at least acknowledged anyway, over 80, uh,

153
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.050
academic institutions and, and others, um,

154
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.140
that were either wittingly unwittingly working on their behalf in various

155
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.160
research programs. So yeah, this, this, uh,

156
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.770
midnight climax program, basically they'd,

157
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.840
they'd kit out a safe house as a brothel. Um, and they would,

158
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.970
uh, uh, have the hookers, uh, slipped LSD or whatever substance to the,

159
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.800
to the Johns. Um, and then behind a mirror, you'd have a,

160
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.440
supposedly like a researcher, right? I mean,

161
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.570
this is work out weird sitting there, you know,

162
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:28.710
having a drink and watching these, you know, the, the and the John have sex,

163
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.520
and then they'd be analyzing the impact of the LSD on them in terms of their

164
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:36.150
ability to talk. And, and would they hook her in on it? Yeah.

165
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:37.410
The was in on it and they.

166
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.400
<v 0>See an employee of the CIA, uh.</v>

167
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.420
<v 1>You know, you know, and, and it was, it wasn't just the agency, you know,</v>

168
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:46.740
like the army was involved in these things as well, but, um, they would get,

169
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.810
you know, cash payments and, uh, oftentimes the, uh,

170
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.890
the get out of jail get out of jail, free card. Um,

171
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.210
uh, you know, ladies, if you're out there, if you're out there.

172
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.770
<v 0>Listen to me, whatever you need, I'm forward, I'm here for you,</v>

173
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.730
but there wasn't a show. There was talk, you could wear a Boba Fett mask,

174
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.930
we'll hide your identity. But.

175
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.160
<v 1>I mean, just imagine, I mean, so it's okay. So this was clearly, you know,</v>

176
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.490
clearly, uh, was off the rails, right.

177
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:23.640
And they had one of the guys that was involved in this, uh, uh,

178
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.940
he was with what used to be called a federal bureau of narcotics, a guy named,

179
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.540
uh, white George White, um, was, you know,

180
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:36.290
involved in like the San Francisco cat house. And, you know,

181
00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:38.390
according to the stories, he'd sit there and, you know,

182
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:41.540
with a martini in his hand and watch the couple have sex. And then he,

183
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.530
and he would have like prepped the to say, okay, after sex,

184
00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:47.360
now this appears to be the best time to get them talking.

185
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.690
So ask them about their job. And let's see if they'll talk about their job,

186
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.710
the idea of being, could we influence and, and like, uh, and trap, uh,

187
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.210
potential assets over seas for operational reasons, you know,

188
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.070
was there some use, you know, for operational purposes,

189
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:03.890
but basically it was just, you know, George getting his rocks off,

190
00:11:03.891 --> 00:11:08.720
watching couples, having sex and, you know, very, very strange.

191
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.150
Um, but you're right in that. And so, again, this, this went on until 64,

192
00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:18.230
MK ultra, interestingly enough, not to, not to spend too much time on it, but,

193
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.210
uh, Richard Helms was the director at the time, uh,

194
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.200
in the early seventies. And, uh, he and a guy named, uh,

195
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.950
Gottlieb Sydney Gottlieb, who was the head of technical services at the agency.

196
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.170
They agreed that the smart thing to do in 73 before Richard Helms left and godly

197
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:39.080
left the agency was to destroy all the records.

198
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.820
So they purged all the records of MK ultra that they, they thought existed.

199
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.800
Um, this was investigating the church committee back in 75,

200
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.710
and then, uh, uh, 70, I think it was,

201
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.320
they found a bunch of financial records, you know,

202
00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:00.700
that had not been perched because they'd been kept, you know, um,

203
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.830
audits of, uh, and again,

204
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:05.740
you're talking about like 149 sub projects of MK altar.

205
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.680
So you can imagine each sub project has its own accounting,

206
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.200
and you gotta turn in your receipts for the LSD that you bought,

207
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:13.840
or the hokey you're paid off or whatever, you know, it's all, here's my receipt.

208
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.540
Can I have my $12 or whatever you paid for a back then?

209
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.950
And so probably not 12 bucks, um, but,

210
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.430
uh, they found some financial records. Um,

211
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.680
and so that became then the matter of another investigation up

212
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:33.730
on the hill, um, and Stansfield Turner at the time,

213
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:35.860
the CIA director testified at that point.

214
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.620
And that's why I brought my laptop is because Stansfield Turner's, uh,

215
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.610
testimony is actually pretty interesting, uh, as far as MK ultra goes,

216
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.590
and he talks about, um,

217
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.790
we've attempted to group the activities covered by the 149 sub projects into

218
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:56.020
categories under descriptive headings. Wouldn't you in broad outline,

219
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:59.770
at least this presents the contents of these files, uh,

220
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.720
the headings of the categories of all these various projects that ran under MK

221
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.320
altar. And this gives you a pretty good, quick sense of,

222
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:10.780
of what they were doing at the time research into the effects of behavioral

223
00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:14.230
drugs and or alcohol. There were 17 sub projects,

224
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:16.240
probably not involving human testing.

225
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.410
This is the testimony from the director of the CIA Stansfield Turner 14 sub

226
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:23.920
projects, definitely involving tests on human volunteers, volunteers,

227
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.350
19 sub sub projects,

228
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.890
probably including tests on human volunteers while not known.

229
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.130
Some of these sub projects may have included tests on unwitting subjects as

230
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:33.964
well.

231
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.970
<v 3>While not known well, not known. And then.</v>

232
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.500
<v 1>Six sub projects. It definitely involving tests on unwitting subjects, uh,</v>

233
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.770
research on hypnosis, uh,

234
00:13:42.771 --> 00:13:46.620
acquisition of chemicals or drugs aspects of magicians art.

235
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.050
Know what magicians are. Yeah, yeah. Like slipping them a Mickey or something.

236
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:56.430
You know, how do you do that? Slight of hand studies of human behavior,

237
00:13:56.431 --> 00:14:00.870
sleep research, behavioral changes during psychotherapy, um,

238
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.980
motivational studies studies of defectors assessment and training techniques,

239
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:09.690
polygraph research funding mechanisms for MK ultra external

240
00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:12.690
research activities, research on drugs, toxins,

241
00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:17.190
and biologicals in human tissue activities who saw objectives can not be

242
00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:20.970
determined from a valuable documentation. Anyway, it goes on,

243
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.530
but it gives you a sense of, of,

244
00:14:22.531 --> 00:14:25.590
of what the hell was happening during this period of time. But again, I,

245
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.670
this doesn't justify it, obviously it doesn't, but you're absolutely right.

246
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.330
That to have a full understanding of this, you have to look at the,

247
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.980
at the context of what,

248
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.440
where we were at the time and where we were with smack dab in the height and

249
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.380
elevation of the cold war, knowing that our adversaries,

250
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.610
our existential threats were engaged in this sort of behavior. Now,

251
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.640
George was not really a researcher or anything.

252
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.180
He would just sit behind a mirror, watching some people, you know, get off. So,

253
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.620
uh, clearly and all the unwitting subjects involved. I mean, but look,

254
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:05.070
they were slipping, uh, LSD to, uh, agency employees, right.

255
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:09.230
Without telling them really. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. And, and I mean, it's just,

256
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.683
yeah. It's so.

257
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.900
<v 0>Yeah, long ago, but it's not,</v>

258
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:17.530
we have to think about it in terms of the same way we thought about Abraham

259
00:15:17.531 --> 00:15:21.580
Lincoln, that in the context of the times,

260
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.680
this wasn't such a horrendous thing to do, they didn't know any better.

261
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.890
It was really, they didn't know what these substances would do to people.

262
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.440
And there wasn't a lot of ways to find out, you know,

263
00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:35.320
the Harvard LSD studies that they did that they believe in,

264
00:15:35.321 --> 00:15:37.810
in part were responsible for the Unabomber.

265
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.080
There's a lot of other that was responsible for the Unabomber,

266
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.070
including particularly his childhood. But they,

267
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.300
they did a lot of these studies because they, they didn't know. I mean,

268
00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:51.250
there's one way to find out. I mean,

269
00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:54.910
how do you get responsible human subjects?

270
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.100
How do you get people to do well?

271
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.920
Does not a lot of ways other than just test people. Right.

272
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.070
<v 1>And unfortunately, yeah. What, what this ended up being was, you know,</v>

273
00:16:03.071 --> 00:16:06.610
like using, using the most marginalized people out there, you know,

274
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:11.470
like sex workers or prisoners or whatever. Right. And oftentimes Johns, or just,

275
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.180
just, you know, but that whole thing, but where we're at Tom O'Neill's book is,

276
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.130
is, you know, is, is really interesting in a couple of ways is isn't it, if you,

277
00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:24.370
if you jump so MK ultra kind of finished up in 64 officially, right.

278
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:28.120
That's when, you know, the inspector general came out from the agency and said,

279
00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:30.310
this, you gotta, no, you can't, you can't do this.

280
00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:32.380
They had a new inspector general. And they looked and said,

281
00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:36.550
this is clearly not where we are supposed to be. Um,

282
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.510
but interestingly, uh, funding mechanisms, you know,

283
00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:42.190
that were used to, again,

284
00:16:42.191 --> 00:16:47.110
to Dole out grants or to provide a cutout between government and research

285
00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:50.800
that was being done, you know, did some of those continue to exist for other,

286
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.720
uh, programs, other research and in 67,

287
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:01.480
um, you know, you have, uh, the summer of love San Francisco, um,

288
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.180
and Tom O'Neill writes about this and it's very, very interesting,

289
00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:08.680
but you had the, the Haight Ashbury, uh, free medical clinic, right.

290
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.810
Which in part, uh,

291
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.890
was running a couple of projects that were, uh,

292
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.030
supposedly getting funding from the national Institute for mental health,

293
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.600
which had previously been a funding mechanism also for MK ultra, you know,

294
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.830
a few years in the past. And, um,

295
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.390
Roger Smith was, uh, a guy who was getting his PhD in criminology.

296
00:17:31.391 --> 00:17:34.000
He was working at the Haight Ashbury free medical clinic.

297
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.680
And he was also Manson's parole officer. And,

298
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.970
uh, to your point, Manson was like, it was like a,

299
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.440
a Brook trout or a rainbow trout that is in some catch and release stream.

300
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:52.140
Right. He was constantly arrested during the 67 68 period. And remember,

301
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.000
is the killings happened in summer, uh, August of 69.

302
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.840
Uh, and you know,

303
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:05.280
he kept getting released and he had been in prison, right. He came in 67.

304
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:08.250
He had early in that year, he'd been released from prison. Right.

305
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:12.000
So he was on probation, any violation,

306
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.210
certainly some of the things he was getting arrested for should've sent him back

307
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:16.440
to prison, but he wasn't.

308
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.950
So that to me is one of the most interesting parts of the book is this,

309
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:23.220
this is this revolving door that Manson was in.

310
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.690
And eventually we all know what happened to him. Um, but yeah,

311
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.940
working at the Haight Ashbury free medical clinic,

312
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.690
that's where Manson would go along with some of his followers and, and,

313
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.050
you know, they were, you know, part of a study and, you know, they were,

314
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:40.890
I'm sure, you know, getting their LSD from there. But, um,

315
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.480
also this guy jolly west who was involved in MK ultra,

316
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.070
uh, also ended up having an office at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic.

317
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:51.720
So, but again, to Tom.

318
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.610
<v 0>And it closed down about four months after Tom's book came out,</v>

319
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.420
been open for over 50 years. Right. What are the odds? Yeah.

320
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.890
<v 1>I know. What are the odds? I didn't see that coming. Uh, yeah, but I mean,</v>

321
00:19:03.891 --> 00:19:05.210
you know, again, it's, it's, I liked the,

322
00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:09.590
I liked the book because he does seem to be, um, trying to let the,

323
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.090
the facts of all his research lead the way. Right.

324
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.420
Rather than trying to prove a point that he comes up with at the beginning of

325
00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:17.930
his book.

326
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:18.290
<v 0>Well,</v>

327
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.880
it also exposed the prosecutor Bugliosi and all the issues that was going on

328
00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:27.740
with him that led to him wanting to follow the narrative that they

329
00:19:27.741 --> 00:19:28.580
had laid out,

330
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.380
that Manson was trying to incite a race war and right. You know,

331
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:38.360
and ignore all the other indicators that there was some deeper connections

332
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:38.900
and.

333
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.810
<v 1>Yeah. Was Mattson. Uh, uh, was he an,</v>

334
00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:44.720
a former for the bureau or for local law enforcement or, you know,

335
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.190
some other outfit? I, you know, that's a hard to tell,

336
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.900
hard to tell, but it's compelling in light of the fact that he

337
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.100
kept getting released. He competed seem to have a get out of jail free card.

338
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.790
You also.

339
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.420
<v 0>Seem to have an unlimited supply of acid. That was what's fascinating.</v>

340
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:07.070
And you also seem to employ the same techniques that apparently the CIA had

341
00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:09.260
employed when they'd done experiments on prisoners,

342
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.720
including the fact that he would, you know,

343
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.880
forced him into weird sexual situations and pretend to take LSD himself,

344
00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:20.180
but not really participate and then, you know, influence them.

345
00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:24.260
And he seemed to be doing things to them in terms of like trying to alter their

346
00:20:24.261 --> 00:20:27.170
behavior and getting them to do things that were outside the norm,

347
00:20:27.171 --> 00:20:28.004
including murder.

348
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.500
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, did he see, yeah.</v>

349
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.120
Did he have a sense from his time there at the clinic or dealing with, uh,

350
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.520
what's his name? Roger Smith, his parole officer, who again,

351
00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:41.750
was also a criminology doctor, a doctoral candidate, I guess.

352
00:20:41.751 --> 00:20:45.110
And so it was w you know, but look, Mattson was, you know,

353
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.280
he was not a rocket scientist. He was illiterate for the most part, right.

354
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:51.660
Until he ended up in prison in may, which is.

355
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.080
<v 0>Why it was so weird that he was able to manipulate so many people. So, well,</v>

356
00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.000
I hate it, but it was also it's like what he was the perfect Guinea pig.

357
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.440
I mean,

358
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.010
you're talking about a guy who spent half his life in federal penitentiaries.

359
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.020
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And, and,</v>

360
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.060
and also you're putting it in context of the time. Um,

361
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.300
what else did you have going on? You had sort of this, again, this, uh,

362
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.780
awareness of the impact of LSD on the, on the counterculture, right.

363
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.950
So you had federal agencies like the bureau, for example, worrying about,

364
00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:26.130
oh my God, what's the, you know, w w what are these hippies going to do next?

365
00:21:26.131 --> 00:21:29.370
You know, are they getting, and, you know, they were worried obviously about,

366
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.460
uh, the black Panthers, but it was also more than that. It was the,

367
00:21:32.461 --> 00:21:34.410
it was the anti-war movement.

368
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.840
It's just a general counterculture and the impact of drugs on it. And so it's a,

369
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.150
it's a fascinating, I think it's, I think it's a very interesting read,

370
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.100
and I think it's worth the read, because again,

371
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.970
he's spent so much time trying to make his way through and get this book.

372
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.930
<v 0>Yeah. It's a crazy story. And if you haven't heard the podcast,</v>

373
00:21:51.931 --> 00:21:53.460
please listen to it with Tom O'Neill.
