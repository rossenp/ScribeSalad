00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.520
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. So.</v>

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.440
<v 1>We set ourselves up for, I think, a currency crisis,</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.160
not just a financial crisis where, where mortgages are in trouble,

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.240
but where the dollar itself is collapsing, our money is collapsing.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.040
Prices are skyrocketing.

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.400
It's gonna really hit the average American much more than just the stock market.

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.030
It going down right when your money is going down, right.

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.910
When the cost of living is skyrocketing, right?

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.830
That is gonna be a big problem for a lot of people that that's where we're

10
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:33.070
headed. It's ultimately gonna be a dollar crisis. And that's really, you know,

11
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:36.110
like my, in my business and my brokerage firm and your Pacific capital,

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.670
that's what I'm trying to do is help people protect their wealth by getting out

13
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:40.670
of us dollar assets,

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.820
by investing in Singapore and Switzerland and New Zealand and Hong Kong and

15
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.420
other countries owning other assets, you know,

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.740
to try to protect themselves from this crisis that you know is coming, you know,

17
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:52.000
and,

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.380
and most people are gonna get blindsided by it just like they were by the last

19
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:55.680
one.

20
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.540
<v 0>So what is the crisis and what, how exactly do you feel it's gonna go down?</v>

21
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.810
Cause I did watch some of your videos about the in crisis from 2008.

22
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:05.130
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you're predicting it years in advance. Yeah. I.

23
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.090
<v 1>Mean, look, you know, things always happen. You know, I,</v>

24
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.810
I see things years before they happen. Cause I understand, and you're not.

25
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.730
<v 0>The only one, right? This,</v>

26
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.130
this is something amongst your peers and your colleagues.

27
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.650
You guys are all discussing this. Well, I mean, I mean, there.

28
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.483
<v 1>Are people,</v>

29
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.850
most people who feel the way I do maybe aren't they weren't on television saying

30
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:24.120
it. They were saying it, you know, to their buddies, you know,

31
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:26.760
in their own living rooms. And they were getting laughed at just like I was,

32
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:28.920
you know, cuz I used to get emails from people, Hey,

33
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.760
I've been saying now this is exactly what I've been saying.

34
00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:34.480
Everybody thinks I'm crazy. And you know, it's just, you know,

35
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:36.960
they're the same one. It's everybody else. That's crazy. That just,

36
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.400
it gets caught up in it.

37
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.190
But the what's going to happen is we are going to go back some point

38
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.590
into another statistic recession. I mean,

39
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.870
I think that we've kind of been in one this whole recovery,

40
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.790
cuz I don't think the government numbers are really that accurate.

41
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.870
I don't think that inflation is as low as they claim at least as measured by the

42
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.590
consumer prices.

43
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.630
So I think that the economy has actually been contracting during the years that

44
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:02.150
we've been pretending it's been growing.

45
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.020
But I do think at some point statistically,

46
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.100
we will go back into a technical recession where even the government admits that

47
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.300
the economy shrinking right where the GDP is negative for a couple of quarters

48
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:17.140
in a row. And then what is the government gonna do as a result of that?

49
00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:18.780
They're gonna do exactly what they did before.

50
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:21.980
They're gonna take interest rates and bring 'em back to zero from wherever they

51
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.330
are. The difference is no, normally they lower interest rates.

52
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.730
And then by the time there's another recession they're way back up four, five,

53
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.890
6% this time they, they,

54
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:34.690
they barely got 'em back to 1% and they kept them at zero for seven,

55
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:36.170
eight years, which is unprecedented.

56
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.050
And of course the mistakes that are made are a consequence of money being too

57
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:42.970
cheap. Right? The reason that we had a real estate bubble,

58
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.800
the main reason was because Allen green span lowered interest rates to 1% and

59
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.840
left them there for about a year and a half and then took about a year and a

60
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.560
half to rise them, to raise 'em back up to normal.

61
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.840
So you had a few years of artificially low interest rates and that gave us this

62
00:02:56.841 --> 00:03:00.880
huge housing bubble. Well, we had seven, eight years of zero. I mean the,

63
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.200
the mistakes that have been made under Obama dwarfed the mistakes that were made

64
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:04.980
under Bush.

65
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.880
And these are mistakes that are a consequence of money being too cheap of the

66
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:11.800
government, setting the price of money, as opposed to the free market,

67
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.880
you get too much debt, you get too much speculation.

68
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.830
And so we've got a much bigger bubble now and when the, the,

69
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.630
this one pops because it's so much bigger, right?

70
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.830
So then all of a sudden the fed has to cut interest rates again.

71
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.230
And now what happens to the dollar because see the dollar has been rising in

72
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:30.950
these past few years because everybody thought, oh,

73
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.630
the Fed's gonna normalize interest rates.

74
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.630
The Fed's gonna shrink the balance sheet when none of this stuff happens.

75
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.870
When the fed goes back to another round of quantitative ease,

76
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.660
when they gotta crank up the printing presses when they don't shrink the balance

77
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:45.620
sheet, but they blo it even bigger, right? It goes to five and a half trillion,

78
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.980
six and a half trillion. I think the bottom's gonna drop out of the dollar.

79
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.740
I think the dollar is gonna get killed.

80
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.940
The opposite of what happened in oh eight.

81
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.700
When the financial crisis hit oh eight,

82
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.860
the dollar had been falling for seven years. It was at an all time record, low.

83
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.090
And then when the crisis, it, it actually caused people to buy the dollar. Uh,

84
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:07.490
but I think this next crisis is going to be the big sell signal for the dollar

85
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.410
it's people are gonna rush out of the dollar.

86
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.250
As the fed has to go back to more QE,

87
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.010
as people realize that this is what I said for the beginning.

88
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.970
This is a monetary Roach motel, right?

89
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.250
The fed checked us in and they ain't checking us out.

90
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:22.920
There's no way to normalize rates. There's no way to shrink the balance sheet.

91
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.160
And when people realize that it's that this is a permanent situation,

92
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.880
the bottom drops outta the dollar and then commodity prices really start to

93
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:30.360
rise.

94
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.160
Remember when oil prices went from like $20 a barrel in 19 and 2001

95
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.120
up to 150, right? That was happening because the dollar was falling.

96
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.070
And as the dollar starts to fall,

97
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.390
all these commodity prices are gonna rise again.

98
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.830
And now inflation is really gonna pick up the way they measure it. And the,

99
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.030
the government can't do anything about it.

100
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:50.870
They can't raise interest rates because if they raise interest rates,

101
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.870
they collapse everything, all the banks that were too big to fail.

102
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:56.510
They're bigger now. And it would be even worse if they failed.

103
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.630
So they can't let rates go up because banks absorbed other banks,

104
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.933
they got bigger.

105
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.780
And now you have all these banks that have all these long term loans that have

106
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.300
low coupons on them. If interest rates go up,

107
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.140
all these big banks are gonna fail. I mean,

108
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:11.580
people think rising rates are gonna be good for banks.

109
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:14.460
They're gonna destroy the banks. They're gonna destroy the housing market.

110
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.420
I mean, and the government, this is the biggest thing.

111
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.100
Look at the national debt. The national debt is about 20 trillion, the,

112
00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:21.970
the bond of debt. And that, of course,

113
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:24.370
that doesn't even count all the unfunded liabilities.

114
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.770
That's just where the government has sold a bond, right? Treasury bond.

115
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.330
That's about 20 trillion. But what would happen if interest rates went to 10%?

116
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.011
Well,

117
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:37.730
it would cost the government 2 trillion a year just to pay the interest on that

118
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.210
20,000 on that 20 trillion, we don't have anywhere close to that. I mean,

119
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.600
right now how interest rates are almost zero and we're spending about 250

120
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.200
billion a year on interest.

121
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.080
But if interest rates actually went up because the fed had a fight inflation,

122
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.840
the treasury would have to default. They, they would have to tell the Crow.

123
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.720
We can't pay on these bonds. What are you showing me? Jamie?

124
00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:57.680
Is this the national debt?

125
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.960
<v 0>Current? Oh, that's national debt pro God, look at its spinning.</v>

126
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:04.400
Is it at 20 trillion yet? It's good. Oh, it's so pretty close. 19 9 73.

127
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.360
Look at its spinning. Oh God. Yeah, I know that's horrific. But.

128
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.720
<v 1>Um, and so, you know, obviously the fed has to keep interest rates low.</v>

129
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.000
So the government can service that debt. Look at.

130
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
<v 0>Medicare, Medicaid. Jesus.</v>

131
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.830
<v 1>You can find the capital. You.</v>

132
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.070
<v 0>Add it all up. That's not even a billion. Is that a trillion? Huh? What?</v>

133
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:24.590
That's not even a trillion at that right there. What is.

134
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.590
<v 1>That? No, that's 1.1 trillion. Oh.</v>

135
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.423
<v 0>It is. But that's.</v>

136
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.470
<v 1>Largest budget items. Those are budget items. Oh, that's the budget.</v>

137
00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:34.750
Social security. That's not the debt. That's what they're spending. Oh.

138
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.340
<v 0>See, look at them numbers. If you go down lower.</v>

139
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.380
<v 1>They'll probably have all the unfunded liabilities that on that page somewhere,</v>

140
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.980
you know? And then they break it down. Then they break it down per capita,

141
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.700
you know, per taxpayer. I mean, it's an norm.

142
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:51.380
But my point is that we've got like an adjustable rate mortgage on that national

143
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.860
debt. The government's got ultra cheap money. If interest rates spike,

144
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.420
there's no way that the government can pay that debt.

145
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.610
<v 0>This is hypnotic &lt;laugh&gt; it really is terrifying. I've never seen it before.</v>

146
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.890
I've never seen it before either. That've what I'm saying.

147
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.610
<v 1>Rico square Puerto Rico would be,</v>

148
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.450
it would be so idiotic for Puerto Rico to wanna join the union and absorb their

149
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:10.690
share.

150
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.850
<v 0>Of that debt. Now for the average person like myself,</v>

151
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.010
who has zero understanding of the financial system, you listen to Trump,

152
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.000
talk about the economy booming and it's it's on an upward thing.

153
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.040
And unemployment is down and jobs are up. Yeah.

154
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.640
<v 1>I mean. That's yeah.</v>

155
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:29.240
That's what's really bothering me about Trump is the hypocrisy because when

156
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:33.040
Trump was a candidate and he got elected because by and large,

157
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.200
he told the truth about the phony nature of the recovery.

158
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.510
Obama was out there talking about how great things were. And Trump was like, BS,

159
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.230
it's not great. Oh, you're talking about low unemployment. That number is bogus.

160
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.230
The real unemployment rate, 20% or 25%.

161
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.910
<v 0>Because people stopped looking for jobs and it doesn't count anymore. Yeah.</v>

162
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:50.070
People.

163
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.710
<v 1>Are, you know, they gave up looking so they don't have a job.</v>

164
00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:54.190
They're not counted as being unemployed.

165
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.710
And he pointed out that all the jobs like here, this is irony, right?

166
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.060
So what are the by of Obamacare?

167
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.420
Obamacare said that if you have a full-time worker,

168
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.300
you have to give him health insurance. Right.

169
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.420
And full-time was anyone that worked 30 hours or more well employers aren't

170
00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:14.740
dumb. They can do math. Hey, if I, if this guy is working, uh, 40 hours a week,

171
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.140
I gotta, I gotta give him health insurance, which is very expensive.

172
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.090
But if he works 29 hours a week, I don't. Right. So what happened,

173
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.850
employers started transitioning their workforces from full-time workers to

174
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:29.730
part-time workers. Well, what happens if I'm gonna have only part-time workers,

175
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.250
I'm gonna have more workers, Greg, cuz each one is working fewer hours.

176
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.130
So I'm gonna have to have more I'm I have more jobs, right? If I have,

177
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.520
if I had 500 part-time jobs, but now I a thousand, I mean,

178
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.160
if I had 500 full-time employees,

179
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.040
but now I have a thousand part-time employees that's twice as many jobs,

180
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.680
Obama got credit for all those extra jobs. Right. As we were,

181
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.280
as we were destroying full-time jobs and replacing them with two part-time jobs,

182
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.080
we got all these jobs. So Trump was honest as a candidate,

183
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.960
these are low paying jobs. These are crappy jobs, you know,

184
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.680
and a lot of the people that were getting jobs were older.

185
00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:06.920
People who don't want jobs,

186
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:10.840
they were retired and now they're working at McDonald's part-time because they

187
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:13.720
can't live on their retirement money. And in fact, you know,

188
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.430
when you look at the lake labor force participation rate that he would talk

189
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.750
about, you know,

190
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.750
where labor force participation is collapsing is with young people,

191
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:25.070
people in their twenties and thirties can't get jobs. Meanwhile, 70,

192
00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:27.630
80 year olds are working in record percentages, right?

193
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.590
Cuz they can't afford to retire and their grandkids can't get a job.

194
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.380
But so Trump was telling the truth about how bad the economy was.

195
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.220
And that resonated a lot of blue collar guys. A lot of, uh,

196
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.500
Democrats in the Midwest voted for Trump because he got it.

197
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.060
He understood their, he felt their pain, right?

198
00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:48.900
Like bill Clinton and Obama was in a fantasy.

199
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.300
I mean Hillary was pretending that everything was great under Obama and people

200
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:57.290
didn't want four more years of that. So they, it for Trump. And also, you know,

201
00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:58.370
when Trump was a candidate,

202
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.330
he talked about the stock market cuz oh the stock market was going up when Obama

203
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.810
was president and Trump said, well,

204
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:08.290
it's a bubble who cares about the stock market. This is a big fat, ugly bubble.

205
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.410
Wait till it pops. Okay. He was right about that. Now he's president,

206
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.930
what is he saying? Every time I see him, this stock, market's a new record high.

207
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.160
This is fantastic. You know, it's all because of me. This is great.

208
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.920
And when the jobs numbers come out,

209
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.200
oh this is look how low the unemployment rate is.

210
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:26.000
This is the lowest it's been in 15 years, I'm doing a great job.

211
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.960
I'm doing nothing has changed. This is the exact same economy he inherited.

212
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.120
It's the same crappy jobs. It's the same stock market bubble.

213
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.950
The only difference is he's not a candidate anymore. He P president.

214
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.950
And now he's trying to market the same crappy economy that Obama had and

215
00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:43.990
pretending everything is good. And I wish he was,

216
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.190
he would stay true to the candidate and admit, you know what?

217
00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:51.310
The economy is still a disaster because nothing has changed. Right?

218
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.350
He was gonna drain the swamp. Instead.

219
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.780
He just poured more water in the same swamp. Let you know, but actually drain.

220
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:01.020
It means to really shake things up and in a way he's shaking things up,

221
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.700
but not the way that's gonna gets meaningful change for the country. Right.

222
00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:08.380
That the shaking up that he's doing is not what people were voting for. Right.

223
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.300
We really need real substantive economic change,

224
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.820
but the president is not able to deliver it.

225
00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:16.540
He's surrounded himself with the same cronies that,

226
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.130
that were round in the Bush administration. I mean,

227
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:20.330
what good is going back to Bush.
