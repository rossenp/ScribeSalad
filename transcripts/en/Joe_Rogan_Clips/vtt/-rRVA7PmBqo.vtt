00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. There's also guys,</v>

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.020
I'm not going to go into details, but I met,

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.470
I feel like I shouldn't even say this, but it's fine. Cause it's fine.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.690
So I met a kid once who moved to Las Vegas

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.050
when he was it's this crazy story to tell

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.940
that is a good story. Okay. I won't go into details.

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.490
So he moved to Las Vegas when he was 12,

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.220
he moved there because he wanted to meet a specific person who is considered

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.900
the best card sheet ever. Meaning the guy,

10
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.400
this is a guy that, the reason that Vegas has those,

11
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.150
instead of like the dealer peaking the, the down card,

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.880
they have to put it into a machine and push a button.

13
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
He's the guy that the movie casino was built around with the computer and the

14
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:59.670
shoe. Like he was the, the best card she ever.

15
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.290
But among magicians,

16
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:05.820
he's like a phenomenon because he's working on moves not to entertain anybody

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.620
he's working on move. So he doesn't get his hands smashed up against the wall.

18
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.550
Binion's right. Yeah. So he's working on Mussa.

19
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.390
He's not going to get killed survival. Yes. So he,

20
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.730
so this kid at the age of 12 knows about

21
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:28.500
him, moves to Las Vegas and buys a craps table.

22
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.440
He puts the craps table, Tim and his mom, right as my single mother and him,

23
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.900
they live in this small apartment,

24
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.540
very close to the man I was telling you about,

25
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.850
and this kid throws dice 15 hours a day on

26
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.300
this crap, stable, by the way, their little bed is like under the table.

27
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.690
You know what I mean? It's a small space and it's a real crap stable,

28
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:52.620
like a nice one.

29
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.810
The only thing he does is repetitiously throw that and he can helicopter

30
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:01.230
spin the dice. So you can't see them doing this.

31
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.260
They have such force going around this way, that when they hit the wall,

32
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.330
one dye won't break the number and he can throw it exactly to this part of the,

33
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.060
of the table, missing this from across the table.

34
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.270
So that one died locks in every time he can guarantee that number.

35
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.900
He did that every day for almost a decade,

36
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:22.980
until he could throw dice better than any other human being in the world.

37
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.930
Then he went and got a job at one of the casinos that texts for car cheats and

38
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.470
worked in the craps tables. It's all he did.

39
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.680
And as soon as he turned 21, he went out,

40
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.910
travels the world and wins the exact amount of money that he wouldn't playing

41
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:43.320
craps where you're not detected, but, but you can. What is the exact amount?

42
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.030
I mean, I under, you know, probably under a million, probably a few million,

43
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.060
a years of up saying, it's not like he's going in and getting a degree.

44
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.610
It's very smart and structured. Yeah.

45
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.460
And that's different places and he can throw dice.

46
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.710
Like I've never seen anybody throw dice.

47
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.130
<v 1>It's terrible. Yeah. I'm a definite addict. And I got to watch it, but this,</v>

48
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.890
the sex addict thing. I mean, I just think that that's one,

49
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:10.420
that's unchecked for so many people and so acceptable. And,

50
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.890
um, porn addiction. I mean, I can't get off without watching porn.

51
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.260
<v 2>You can't get off at all. Not.</v>

52
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.230
<v 1>Even close. I wouldn't even try if my internet was down,</v>

53
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.170
we had a power outage the other day at my house and it was just like, okay,

54
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:27.280
well that's, I would be screwed without I couldn't do it. I mean,

55
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:31.030
I would figure out a way I think I would manage. But if my,

56
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.360
if my toys aren't working and aren't plugged in and if I don't have corn,

57
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.570
I'm just not getting off. I've never been someone who can do it manually. And,

58
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:38.770
and with my imagination,

59
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:43.590
it's really a problem because the porn I watch is like not good.

60
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.403
<v 3>Joe.</v>

61
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.170
<v 1>Joe, Joe, Joe, Nick, Nick, and Nikki. Um, dude, it's bad.</v>

62
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.750
Well, no. Oh, that's tame. Are you kidding me?

63
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.690
<v 3>Yeah, really?</v>

64
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.490
<v 1>I mean, I got a threat on, um,</v>

65
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.170
like a DM from just some troll a while back. That was like,

66
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.610
if I put out a hit on the dark web for you to be gang raped and asked to pay the

67
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:15.720
guys a hundred thousand dollars to do it, I can, I can make that happen.

68
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:19.260
And you know, someone would accept that. And I was like, jokes on you.

69
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.420
That that's my fantasy. Now. I don't really mean that.

70
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:29.040
Please do not do that. But I was also like, though, that's I, I'm not joking.

71
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:33.420
Like that tends to be the stuff that I watch is like really aggressive gang

72
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:37.680
bangs. And like women tied up. I, I pay for my porn cause I feel so bad.

73
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:39.000
What's happening to the women in it.

74
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:41.370
I hope that they are being compensated for it.

75
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.310
So I pay like 30 bucks a month for kink.com.

76
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.420
I'm watching really up stuff. Um,

77
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.010
and I've always been, been into like being tied up and like, uh,

78
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.780
I'm someone who doesn't feel like I deserve pleasure without like having pain.

79
00:04:57.781 --> 00:04:59.850
Like I don't ever celebrate anything.

80
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.020
I can only celebrate or like relax if I put in so much work that I'm just like

81
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.550
debt. So I can, it's really hard for me to like enjoy myself in life.

82
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.610
I always have to have it's. I have to punish myself first.

83
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.060
And so orgasms are not something that like, I feel,

84
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.440
I feel it's hard for me to give myself one and let myself have that much.

85
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:22.380
It's like, it's too much. It's like Christmas. And you're like,

86
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:23.940
you have to wait a year for Christmas.

87
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:26.790
You can't give yourself Christmas every day. So I feel,

88
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.600
I like to be tied up and like forced to have Christmas. And like,

89
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.620
I that's what I that's what I tend to like is like,

90
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.640
you have to do this. And because I'm so I don't like losing control either.

91
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.800
And the orgasm is like the most you can lose control. I just feel like I don't,

92
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:46.890
I don't like being that out of control and I don't know what's going to happen.

93
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:49.980
I'm scared. I'm just going to like everywhere or something.

94
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:51.960
Like I'm totally scared of. Everywhere.

95
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.700
<v 4>Is no one else scared of that.</v>

96
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.400
[inaudible] a bunch of ketamine and stab herself. [inaudible] got his.

97
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.520
<v 2>Cooties on it. It went through his arm. I don't even think we cleaned it. Good.</v>

98
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.900
<v 4>Did it really go through his eyes? Oh,</v>

99
00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:11.680
if I push it through and then push it through for a second. Yeah. We, I hit.

100
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.870
<v 2>A nerve the first time. Then I had to back out and do it again.</v>

101
00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:15.520
I didn't want to do it. One frog.

102
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.600
<v 4>Live frog is fine. He shut the frog out. He threw it up in my hand.</v>

103
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.820
Do you know that there's a book called eat that frog.

104
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.970
That's like about getting your work done in the morning. And it's just funny.

105
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:27.850
You literally eat the frog, eat it. Just like, get it over,

106
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.210
like get the worst part done. Any, I have swallowed away. We were

107
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.320
taught a lot. Honestly, not even a sharp iceberg. This is,

108
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.200
did it make a sound at all? No.

109
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.790
<v 2>Just was like puncturing. Yes.</v>

110
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.080
<v 4>And it wasn't you picked the spot that you stack pointed.</v>

111
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.110
<v 2>Me towards his arm. Like what areas of better place to go through,</v>

112
00:06:47.111 --> 00:06:49.510
but it was bleeding. I mean, do you think it would taste like elk?

113
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.140
I don't think so. I think people taste like pigs. Ooh.

114
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.070
That's a really the cannibals call people long pigs.

115
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.010
That's literally a nickname.

116
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.130
<v 4>Did you notice that, uh, Blaine, whenever he would have you do something,</v>

117
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.490
he would first like doubt himself. It's almost like a, uh,

118
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.740
power suggestion thing where he'd be like, no, no, it might be fake.

119
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.860
Test it out. It might be fake. Remember the frog.

120
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.600
It might not be a real frog or the, this might be weighted.

121
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.300
<v 2>So you can see it right there. That's where I'm going through his arm.</v>

122
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.740
Whose hand is that? That's his, that's his hand. That's his hand.

123
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.390
He's like pushing on the skin.

124
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.140
<v 4>Darkest weight. He gets tan. He's got a lot of money,</v>

125
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.880
psychological. You're very poor or very rich of your dad.

126
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.530
Your face. Is there something psychological about him doing that? Like touch it.

127
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:40.420
Maybe it's fake. Make sure it's not fake.

128
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.351
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.400
I'm sure it does that with cards and I'm sure I don't know anything about magic,

130
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:48.790
but I would imagine anything you can do to overload the brain.

131
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.470
Like if you are a distract. Yeah. If you're sparring with someone or fighting,

132
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.780
one of the things you're doing is you're trying to overload their brain.

133
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:58.900
So you're moving, you do things, you faint, you fake,

134
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:00.280
like you're going to punch and then you kick them.

135
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.470
But what you're doing is you're with their heads.

136
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.910
You giving them too many things to think about.

137
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.430
He's kind of doing that to check the cards out.

138
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.120
And he says things and he kind of doubts himself and asks you if you're sure

139
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:13.890
there's so many techniques involved with it, but he is a master.

140
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.420
Amazing him doing that too. He had,

141
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.290
so he did a card trick with one guy holding one of his wrists and another guy

142
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.150
holding on another risk. Like he couldn't do anything.

143
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.730
His sleeves rolled up and he did a cartridge for us.

144
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.040
<v 4>Someone I know you're not supposed to say how magic happens, but I don't,</v>

145
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:31.090
I don't think that this counts is like, but uh,

146
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:32.350
there was this guy that I knew that did. Yeah,

147
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.660
afraid you're gonna get in trouble. She was like,

148
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:39.370
I'll never go to the magic castle again. It's going to be so mad at me.

149
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.500
It's coming for me. But sometimes they call it holes into their hands, uh,

150
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.080
like flaps of skin. And that's where they put the coins underneath.

151
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:48.130
Like they actually, yeah,

152
00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:50.620
they carved like little divots in their hands and that's how they hold the

153
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:53.470
coins. How the can you give it in your skin?

154
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.590
And then you let it heal scar tissue.

155
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:59.670
And that's how they're able to hold the coins. Crazy. I don't know. Really.

156
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.950
