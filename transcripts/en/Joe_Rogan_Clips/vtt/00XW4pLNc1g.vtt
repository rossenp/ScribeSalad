00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 1>He was one of, uh, Nick's training partners.</v>

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.320
He's been a training partner of Nick's forever. Nick, Nick Diaz, that guy, Joe.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.280
<v 0>Shelling. Oh my God. I thought you meant the guy that got knocked out. I.</v>

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.200
<v 1>Was like, no, no, wait, what the? Joe shelling. Yeah, he was there,</v>

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.040
the Diaz fight. And, um, you know, my thing about Nick Diaz is like,

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.670
when I looked at him physically, I was like,

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.030
I don't know how much he's been training. Like when Nick was in his prime,

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.630
he was like really lean. And he was, you know, I mean, he's definitely,

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
he is like an older guy now. And how old though? I think he's like 30.

11
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.510
I don't know how old is. 38. 38. Is he really? Yeah,

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.150
but the thing is like,

13
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.220
I don't think you can just jump back in that easy after six years outta the

14
00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:48.780
sport. I think you'd probably need more time to prepare. I don't know. He kind.

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.693
<v 0>Of got, right?</v>

16
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.101
<v 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:54.060
I don't know how much time he had to prepare and why they agreed to do a fight

18
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.420
on short notice. Cause I think it was only like six weeks notice,

19
00:00:56.421 --> 00:01:00.500
which I think was, is fine. If you are, you know,

20
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:01.460
Michael Chandler,

21
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.810
if you're in like peak form right now and you're ready to go and someone gives

22
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:06.770
you six weeks, I bet you can get ready for a fight.

23
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.330
But if you're a guy who's been off for that long, you're gonna need more time.

24
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.690
I think I'm just guessing. I don't, I don't know how much time it took him,

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.450
but my point was,

26
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.770
he didn't do that bad for a guy that was out six months. Yeah. You know,

27
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.640
Robby Lawler was pressuring him, him and he was putting it on him.

28
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.360
And he was definitely getting the better the exchanges,

29
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.840
but it's not like Nick Diaz didn't have his moments and he definitely did.

30
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.680
He would just have to have really like way more time to prepare he and

31
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.240
he would have to really be like ready to go.

32
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.120
Like the old Nick di like the Nick Diaz fought Anderson Silva.

33
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.790
Like the Nick Diaz, if for George St. Pierre,

34
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.990
like the Nick di that fought Paul Daley. And Strikeforce, I mean,

35
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:51.350
that dude was a killer. It's just like, can he still do that at 38? Well,

36
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.830
maybe we don't know if you just have one fight, you need time.

37
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.990
Like about if your body hasn't been used to this stuff and you haven't been

38
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.950
training as much as you were when you in your prime.

39
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.900
If you still wanna to do it again, like legitimately, physically,

40
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.740
you probably can. But it's like, you know, you've run a marathon. Yeah.

41
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:11.860
When you start out and you run a mile and you're dead and you're like,

42
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:13.860
I can't believe anybody could run 26 of those.

43
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.740
But if you do it over and over and over again, you build up.

44
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.740
I don't think you had a chance.

45
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.060
I don't think Nick Diaz has had a chance to build back up after being off for

46
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:26.090
that much time. I think you get back to where he was Nick Diaz in his best.

47
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.570
You gotta like, he's gotta have some time.

48
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.930
<v 0>Those Diaz's brothers were great for their, their pace.</v>

49
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:33.970
They could last the whole fight. Cause they're cardio.

50
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.930
<v 1>Well, it's, they're, they're always in the triathlons and.</v>

51
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.450
They got CRO Gracie into that too. Really? It's yeah.

52
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.010
It's one of the reasons why he's so good is his cardio. I.

53
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.440
<v 0>Did triathlon most terrifying thing I've ever done a my life. Oh my God, man.</v>

54
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.760
I'm running the New York city marathon. When's that? November 6th. How.

55
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.400
<v 1>Are you doing that? Like this? I don't know, Joe.</v>

56
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.440
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what the are you doing you? No, no. You saw.

57
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.000
<v 0>Saw, saw stand up into the cage. I figure out, figure it out. Robb.</v>

58
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.120
The won't be there. &lt;laugh&gt;.

59
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.120
<v 1>Why did you just, uh, make yourself smaller first? I don't.</v>

60
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.790
<v 0>Know. We should do another cocktail. I'm gonna try to lose weight.</v>

61
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.750
I'm gonna try to lose weight.
