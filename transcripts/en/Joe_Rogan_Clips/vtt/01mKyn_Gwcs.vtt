00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.890
but if you look at the multi-verse and I've had a,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.810
I've had a one or two particular, uh,

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.400
multi-verse experiences where a time and reality has

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.050
changed in a way that I cannot explain it's. So what do you mean?

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.960
It's so incredibly profound that I still cannot wrap my mind around it. And, um,

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.480
these are psilocybin experience of psilocybin experience.

8
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.920
So I think the psilocybin experience might be a one world

9
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.360
portal, and I'm going to sound like Terence McKenna. I'm a vendoring in the,

10
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:44.250
to the, multi-verse the idea that, uh, time, uh, can be bent,

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.660
uh, that there are multiple universes occurring simultaneously in different

12
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:49.494
realities.

13
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.720
And I've had one experience in particular that is just unfathomable to me. Um,

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430
I don't know how to explain it. Um, okay.

15
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.440
I'll give it a shot then you've already blown my mind 50 times

16
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:09.300
today. This is a very deeply personal experience to me, but, um, I was,

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.630
um, I was going to the evergreen state college.

18
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.990
I had the drug enforcement administration license. My brother,

19
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:20.910
John went to a Yale, uh, university. Um, he got a graduate, uh,

20
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.820
scholarship in neurophysiology at the university of Washington.

21
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.840
He came out to Washington state in Seattle. I was living in Olympia, Washington.

22
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.180
Um, I had a cabin, uh, up in the mountains near Darrington Washington.

23
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.410
Uh, then the summertime for three years, I set chokers. I was a logger.

24
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.700
I really believe in the school of hard knocks and the blending of academia with,

25
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.780
with blue collar hard work. I love chopping wood. I love running a chainsaw.

26
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.770
I love hard labor.

27
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.270
I think it gives my mind some respite to be able to think

28
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.340
so I'm in this highly academic environment. My brother, John is a,

29
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.430
he died unfortunately two years ago. [inaudible]

30
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.720
he got me involved in mushrooms as I'm going to segue and set the stage here,

31
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.940
but I needed another two minutes to set the stage here.

32
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.870
So I'm growing up in a small town in Ohio called Colombiana.

33
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.090
My brother John goes to is going to Yale.

34
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:17.040
He comes back one day and he gives me a book that he uses

35
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.460
for his class, but he's on break. And he says, I I'm really fascinated.

36
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.480
And John went to Mexico.

37
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.910
Columbia came back with a great stories of eating salts.

38
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.410
I have mushrooms and it was my older brother.

39
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.220
I just idolized him and his book called altered states of consciousness.

40
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.050
And so I said, John, can I borrow your book? He said, sure. And I said,

41
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.150
but Paul, and get back, you know, after my break is over,

42
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.570
I'm going back to college. This is part of our textbook. So I bought his book,

43
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:42.330
altered states of consciousness. I'm just fascinated reading it. You know,

44
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:45.600
about all these different ways of expanding your consciousness and 14 years of

45
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.190
age. And so my best friend, Ryan Snyder says, oh, can I borrow your book?

46
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.600
We're hanging together all the time. I go. Yeah. But my idea back.

47
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.740
And so he borrows my book and he doesn't return it a day. You know,

48
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.310
several days pass a week past, you know,

49
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:02.260
two weeks past my brothers coming back on break.

50
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.600
I thought I needed that book ball have, uh, back Paul. I go to Ryan. I go,

51
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.750
Ryan, I need my book. I need my book. And Ryan kept on avoiding the,

52
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.260
answering the subject until I finally give me my book. And Ryan goes,

53
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:18.940
I can't give it to you, Paul. I said, why? He says, my dad burned it.

54
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.990
I see your dad burned my brother's book.

55
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.520
I go WTF and use this phrase back then. I said,

56
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.250
oh my God. And I have a shout out to Ryan Snyder's father. Uh,

57
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.940
because of that event,

58
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.850
it stimulated my interest in older states of consciousness,

59
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.340
even more so that is,

60
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.900
so John goes to Yale and it goes to the university of Washington. I have this,

61
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.420
uh, DEA permit and I'm at the evergreen state college.

62
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.830
John calls me up and he says, Paul, I think I found some suicide mushrooms.

63
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.990
Uh, John said, you're really smart.

64
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.650
You've been collecting sloppy cubensis and Columbia and Mexico. But you know,

65
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.080
this, there are much more complicated up here. Think I said,

66
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:01.930
let me ask you a few questions. I said, okay, John, can you take us corporate?

67
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.370
And he goes, yes. And I go as a spores. Purple brown. And he goes, yes,

68
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.850
they are. Purple brown. I go good. Okay. Now John,

69
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.390
does it have a separable gelatinous pellicle and then he goes, what's that?

70
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:16.060
And I go, well, break the cap. These are growing on wood chips.

71
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.910
Great break the cap. And in separate the cap very slowly.

72
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:22.510
Do you see a little skin this translucent? And he breaks it and goes, yeah,

73
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.380
I see that skin or the John, the growing and woodchips and he goes, yes, I go,

74
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.790
are they turning blueish? He goes, yes. They're standing really bright blue.

75
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.770
I go, wow. I said, John, how many did you find? He goes,

76
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.930
you would not boom. Believe it. It was a huge amount. I said, wait,

77
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.440
I say buddies, Paul, they're in a very sensitive place.

78
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.730
You better come up here right away.

79
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.750
So I jumped in my car and I drove up from Olympia to Seattle, about 60,

80
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.610
70 miles. I get to his house and I, and John's there. And I go, well,

81
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.360
where are we going? And he goes, well, we need some grocery bags, you know? And,

82
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.130
uh, let's get on our bikes and let's go down. There I go. Well,

83
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:06.010
why all the secrecy and the, and the problem is, is we'll you'll see.

84
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.840
And I was the end of boats street and right at the university of Washington, uh,

85
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.420
right off of university avenue, there's boat street.

86
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.260
And we get there and right across the street as a police substation.

87
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.480
So we're there. And it was an eruption of this mushroom that had to be 10,000,

88
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.310
30,000 mushrooms. I don't know.

89
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.240
It was about 50 feet by 30 feet with all been mulched woodchips there was an

90
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.600
eruption that picked up, you know, trash and, you know,

91
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.650
debris that picked up six inches with solid mushrooms or mushrooms everywhere

92
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.160
I've to this day, never seen so many mushrooms in one concentrated area.

93
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.910
So we waited until the police cars went away and we're kind of idling there.

94
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:44.930
And then the police cars would go away. And from the substation,

95
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.340
we'd start picking mushroom, pick them up and we fill up groceries bag,

96
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.430
a bag or two, and then the other students were walking by, what are you doing?

97
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.520
Oh, nothing. You know? And then we eventually got, eh,

98
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.560
there's plenty for everybody, you know? So, um, so it was like pretty soon,

99
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.830
everyone's just all hanging out as a little group, like at the bus stop, right.

100
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:02.570
We're not really waiting for the bus, right.

101
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.190
We're waiting for the police cars to go away.

102
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.280
And then we picked all these martial misses out here.

103
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.290
We got about eight or 10 grocery bags full of these mushrooms,

104
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.191
help helpers on it,

105
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:14.150
turned out to be a new species called [inaudible] named after Daniel species,

106
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.900
new species. Uh, hadn't been discovered before,

107
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.630
had never been described in the scientific literature and before.

108
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.680
So you picked a mushroom that no one knew existed. There hasn't been,

109
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:26.360
hadn't been described scientifically.

110
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.020
We had known about it for about three years, but this is a largest eruption.

111
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.560
And from that collection became part of what, uh,

112
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:37.550
of the type collection that the anchor of the species taxonomically.

113
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.690
So I think some of the specimens still exist in her barrier around the world

114
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.520
because it's the reference standard.

115
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.830
So we go back to the house and it's like, we gotta dry them.

116
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.620
So we lay out newspapers and the whole, the whole, uh,

117
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.060
newspapers were just covered with mushrooms. And, um, and so that night,

118
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.930
you know, we, there's about four guys from Yale, all neurophysiology,

119
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.860
all scientists on scientists, track them and eat them.

120
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.370
And so, I mean, this is not very potent. Um, they're one 10th,

121
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.840
the potency of cubensis. So we made smoothies and uh,

122
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.740
oh my gosh. Talk about the gag reflux. So we had to make these spoons.

123
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:21.700
We had to eat 50 of them in order to have, uh,

124
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.970
a dose equivalent equivalent to Westlawn speak events. This would be,

125
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.160
so I knew that. So he made these incredibly distasteful, milkshakes, and, uh,

126
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.100
and we chugged them and we drank them. And, um,

127
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.540
and then a amazing experience. I bonded with my brother. It was beautiful.

128
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.320
And then you're peeking at the experience you look around and there's like tens

129
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:46.700
of thousands as Marshall. It was like, oh my gosh, I'm all for science. Um,

130
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.710
and so I go to bed and I'm, and I'm laying in bed and,

131
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.330
um, you know, full blown experience and, you know,

132
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.710
can barely sleep because all the colors are,

133
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.270
are keeping me awake and my mind is racing. And then I have a lucid dream

134
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.750
and I'm dreaming and I wake up and I go downstairs and I go,

135
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.340
I had this crazy dream and what's your dream? And I said, uh,

136
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.600
I saw thousands of cattle, dead baking in the sun.

137
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.250
I said, I think there's going to be a nuclear war. Well,

138
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:24.800
what could kill all these cattle? You know,

139
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.100
there's a time that the Reagan administration and, and all that, you know, the,

140
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.410
the, the attention was really high between the Soviet union, the United States.

141
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.910
And they said they were joking with me saying, oh, well, okay. You know what?

142
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:38.744
It's about to happen. I go,

143
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.860
I know I was in Olympia and I needed to rush up to Darrington,

144
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:45.650
to stay in my cabin because my books were up there. My manuscript is up there.

145
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:50.030
I need to save, save my research. So they laughed and they laughed. They said,

146
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:53.900
well, when's the world going to end Paul? And I go, well, it's not this weekend.

147
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.610
I was like, in two days, it's next weekend.

148
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.990
So they wrote on the calendar December 1st, I put it in my book.

149
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.990
I think it was 1975, the end of the world.

150
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.160
They wrote Paul predicts the end of the world. So we forgot about it.

151
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.380
Massive rains, the next week, huge amounts of snowfall.

152
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.040
And then on Wednesday, Thursday, temperature inversion,

153
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.020
and it flipped to 75 to 85 degrees. All the snow started to melt.

154
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.850
All the rivers were flooding. And my little cabin was right next to this river.

155
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.750
That would swell from the date of a morning tonight.

156
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.870
It would go up six feet just from the snow Melton. I mean,

157
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:37.710
because really close to this volcano and big glaciers as, oh my gosh,

158
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.900
I'm gonna lose my manage cup. All my research. I need to get up there.

159
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:40.734
I need to go up there.

160
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.410
And so I'm watching the news on news and the roads are being closed.

161
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.000
So I had to go through rock port Washington,

162
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.560
the back way in order to get back to my cabin.

163
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:51.060
I get to my cabin and the bank eroded about 10 feet. I was only about 10,

164
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:52.590
12 feet away from the, from the river.

165
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:56.100
Now my cabin was on the verge of falling into it, but I thought my manuscript,

166
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:58.920
I got all my books. You know, I rescued all the material I had,

167
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.310
but I couldn't get out of there because the roads open closed.

168
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.600
And so I had to wait, wait, two days, two days. And the roads then, uh,

169
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:11.430
opened up and I drove out out of the valley into Snohomish

170
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:15.690
valley. And I went around the bend and there the sun,

171
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.150
it was a brilliant sunny day, a warm day.

172
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.560
And they're floating in the fields where hundreds and hundreds of dead cattle.

173
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.810
How do you explain that? I entered, I think, into the multipurpose.

174
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.930
<v 1>Now, as a scientist, you realize when you say something like that,</v>

175
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:40.260
you open yourself up to ridicule. Do you feel hesitant to communicate these.

176
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.070
<v 0>Well and to a degree? Yes, but you know, I'm 62 years of age and you know,</v>

177
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:48.540
at one point I just don't care. I just don't care. You know? Um, this is true.

178
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.400
This happened to me. And, um,

179
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.180
I can push the envelope on the ideas because the credibility of my research is

180
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.230
well established. I can save the bees. Do you care whether I, uh,

181
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.190
have taken silicide mushrooms, if I can save your farm, your family,

182
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:05.700
your country, or the world, billions of dollars in protect biosecurity.

183
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.720
I care more. I care more that's right. So I'm telling you things,

184
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.380
I'm not making these up, I'm making this up. I don't have to. I just, um,

185
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.920
but just because you can't explain, it does not mean it's not true.

186
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.380
And I think that we need to accept the fact that the reality is not limited

187
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:24.780
to the perception that we have traditionally used.

188
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.310
<v 1>That's a beautiful.</v>
