00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.320
What is your take on WikiLeaks and Julian

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:08.154
Assange?

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.460
<v 1>What happened with the, with his arrest and all this stuff that just went down?</v>

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.043
Um,

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.150
I think poses a great threat to our freedom of the press

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.310
and to our freedom of speech.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.290
We look at what happened under the previous administration under Obama.

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.510
You know, they were trying to find ways to go after a Sanje and WikiLeaks,

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.490
but ultimately they chose not to seek to extradite him or

11
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.320
charge him because they recognized what a slippery slope that

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.850
begins when you have a government in a position to,

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.580
uh, levy criminal charges and consequences against someone who's publishing

14
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.090
information or saying things that the government doesn't want you to say,

15
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.980
the government does in sharing information,

16
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:00.810
the government government doesn't want you to share.

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.580
And so the fact that the Trump administration has chosen, um,

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.320
to ignore that fact to ignore how important it is that we uphold our

19
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:14.190
freedoms, freedom of the press and freedom of speech and go after him.

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.320
It has a very chilling effect on both journalists and

21
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:22.230
publishers. And you can look to both those in the traditional media,

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.120
but also those in new media, uh, and also on, on every one of us as America.

23
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.660
And it was, it was, uh, kind of a warning call saying, look,

24
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.720
what happened to this guy? It could happen to,

25
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.220
you could happen to any one of us.

26
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.980
<v 0>Well, it's very transparent too,</v>

27
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.910
because there's no real compelling crime for them to be going after him the way

28
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:45.560
they are. There's not one thing that stands out and the latest one is hacking,

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.550
right?

30
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.490
<v 1>What's not even hacking it's conspiracy conspiracy charges.</v>

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.150
<v 0>That doesn't make any sense that they would spend that much time going after</v>

32
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:54.590
that guy for those charges. Yeah.

33
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.520
It's obvious and very transparent that there's another alter motive.

34
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.270
That ulterior motive is that he leaked a bunch of things that were incredibly

35
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.170
embarrassing. That's right.

36
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.650
<v 1>And not only that, but I think it was secretary Pompeo,</v>

37
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:11.090
secretary of state who said that they wanted to

38
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:16.040
designate Wiki leaks and assigned as a foreign intelligence

39
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.310
agency. So once you do that,

40
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:21.830
then you're talking about a whole different category.

41
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:24.050
So they're pushing out information once again,

42
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:29.000
that the government didn't want pushed out. And if the government then says, oh,

43
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.850
well, now we're going to reclassify you as a foreign intelligence agency.

44
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.960
Then there's a whole different set of rules of engagement that apply there.

45
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.700
Then you're no longer protected under, uh, you know, the freedoms that we hold,

46
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:41.930
dear, the freedom of the press.

47
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.490
<v 0>It's just such a disgusting way of framing things like, you know,</v>

48
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:48.800
he's on a foreign intelligence agent. Yeah. He's,

49
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.200
he's a guy that got information and released it to the general

50
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.350
public that the government wanted to keep private. It's really that simple.

51
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.250
Yeah. Um, Edward Snowden. Yep.

52
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.190
<v 1>Was it similar, similar situation, similar situation? I don't think,</v>

53
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.110
um, I don't think we, you know, I, I remembered the very day that I woke up,

54
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.300
uh, in DC,

55
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.720
looked at my phone and started looking through the headlines and saw those

56
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.460
headlines about how the NSA was mass surveilling.

57
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.400
All of us in collecting our phone records,

58
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:28.570
collecting our cell phone records and Verizon at T and T T-Mobile.

59
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.760
And I was, I was shocked. So that was something that Snowden uncovered,

60
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.620
uh, and released, uh,

61
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.440
something that I don't know that even as members of Congress who would have been

62
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:43.140
aware of. So now that we were aware of it, then, Hey, we can take action to,

63
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:46.480
to close those loopholes, to change those policies,

64
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.040
to protect our civil liberties,

65
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.330
to protect our fourth amendment constitutional rights as Americans,

66
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.070
but was the NSA going to disclose that information voluntarily on their own?

67
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:57.904
Absolutely not.

68
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.540
<v 0>No. We would have had no idea we would had suspicions, but then again,</v>

69
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.590
we'd have tinfoil hats on. And there was a gentleman who was,

70
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.850
who left the NSA very early on, uh,

71
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.440
hill was that was his last name,

72
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.750
but he was one of the first ones to discuss this.

73
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:16.240
This is post nine 11 when they first started doing it.

74
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.130
But Snowden was the guy that really made it abundantly clear to everybody

75
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.980
that not only are they doing that, but they're also lying about it.

76
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.690
And even Obama was talking, oh, we just collected metadata metadata. No,

77
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:32.050
you're not reading messages. You can do anything.

78
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.340
This is just not an accurate assessment of what was going on. No,

79
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.650
and it was outrageous to me.

80
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.090
<v 1>And you had a, I think he was the,</v>

81
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:42.970
the director of the department of national intelligence at that time,

82
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:43.691
James clapper,

83
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:48.310
who sat before a committee in the United States Senate and blatantly

84
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:52.840
lied. He was asked very directly, are you collecting this information?

85
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:57.100
And he said, no, are you collecting this information on American citizens?

86
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.000
And he said, no.

87
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.460
And yet he's somebody who you see on TV almost every day as

88
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:06.550
an expert in this country, without any consequence lying to the American.

89
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.870
<v 0>And I think that if you pull the American people and you ask us to vote on it,</v>

90
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.590
you,

91
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.180
I w I think it would be a gigantic landslide victory for Edward

92
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:18.850
Snowden to be exonerated and brought back to the United States.

93
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.300
We've got this guy he's in Russia now hiding, like,

94
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.880
it's crazy that he lives over there and he can't leave.

95
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:25.720
And if he does come over here,

96
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.640
they're going to immediately going to lock him up. Yeah.

97
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.140
What would you do as president?

98
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.860
<v 1>One thing that I think I want to answer your question,</v>

99
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:36.790
but one thing that I think, um, speaks to the Dane,

100
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.320
the dangerous nature of this culture that we're living in now, uh,

101
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.150
uh, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer had done an interview on, I dunno,

102
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:48.790
one of the major networks. And I think he was,

103
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.210
I think he was talking about Trump when he said, be careful,

104
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.800
you don't want to challenge the intelligence agencies,

105
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.230
basically putting out that threat. I don't know if,

106
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.880
if you can pull that exact quote up,

107
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.310
but I was shocked when I heard him say that,

108
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.720
because it basically makes out that these intelligence agencies are their own

109
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.270
separate branch of government. And that if any,

110
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.620
one of us as Americans or elected leaders in this country dares to challenge or

111
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:17.780
exercise oversight over them,

112
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.060
then we will suffer the consequences. Uh, so as president,

113
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.190
I would change that culture of leadership that,

114
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.560
that leadership starts at the top.

115
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.210
And when you have people in positions of leadership who continue to

116
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.740
perpetuate that culture of unaccountability of complete

117
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:40.730
disrespect and disregard for the constitution of,

118
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.300
of not understanding that, yes, we need to keep our country safe.

119
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.090
We also need to protect our constitutional rights.

120
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:51.800
This is not a choice between the two, which is so often how it's framed. Well,

121
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:53.450
if you want to protect us against terrorists,

122
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:57.050
you've got to give up all of your rights as Americans and your civil liberties

123
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:01.250
and your privacies, and, and just let these intelligence agencies run, uh,

124
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.980
run free and run rough shot over us. Uh,

125
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.700
and so that's the kind of change in leadership that all bring.

126
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:11.480
There's a whole host of policies that, that we can look at. Uh, for example,

127
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:15.020
with the Patriot act, the Patriot act is up for reauthorization in Congress.

128
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.243
This year,

129
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.120
there have been different sections of it that we have worked to try to change

130
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:24.770
and reform to make it so that agencies like the NSA cannot collect our

131
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:27.950
private information as Americans, without a warrant,

132
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.490
but there is far more that has to be done, uh,

133
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.100
to undo the damage that,

134
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.620
that we've already seen the abuse of our,

135
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.930
of our rights and privacies that we've already seen.

136
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.690
<v 0>Did you ever listen to that Kennedy speech about secret societies?</v>

137
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.830
Kennedy had a fantastic speech, uh,

138
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.600
before he was assassinated where he was discussing this very thing. And, uh,

139
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.600
he apparently, uh,

140
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.160
had notions of disbanding, the CIA, and, um,

141
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:06.200
he was very concerned with the power of people like, uh, JAG or Hoover chorus,

142
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.980
and that this was all happening while he was president.

143
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:14.450
And he felt like there were people that were involved in these secret societies

144
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:18.560
and these secret meetings, and that there was a lot of conspiracy going on.

145
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:21.890
And he thought that the very idea was repugnant. It's a fantastic speech.

146
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.740
The president and the press is what it's like. It's got a title,

147
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.650
it's a fantastic speech. I'll check it out. Um,

148
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.660
but this has always been the real concern that, uh,

149
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.460
people have that when you give someone the ability to surveil

150
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.120
the general population, when you give,

151
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.540
they're going to use some of that information to aid in their allies and to work

152
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:45.650
against their enemies. Yeah.

153
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.280
<v 1>That is, I mean, it's a valid concerns. And I mean, this is what,</v>

154
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:50.840
unfortunately we've already seen.

155
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:55.530
This is what has been revealed by some of that information that was released by

156
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.130
Snowden and how, for example, the Pfizer court,

157
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.080
as we have it now is a secret court that has been, um,

158
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.450
has been abused for that purpose,

159
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.710
allowing for that surveillance of Americans violating our civil liberties and

160
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:14.250
privacies. And that's something that we've got to fix that whole,

161
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.930
that whole Pfizer court from top to bottom and how the different judges are

162
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.030
appointed to people. It's, it's basically, it's a, it's a,

163
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:25.830
a secret court that was appointed, uh, I believe, uh,

164
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:30.690
created back in the seventies with the initial objective of

165
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:35.580
providing oversight over the executive branch, um,

166
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.570
mass surveillance that was happening at that time or illegal surveillance that

167
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:43.320
was happening at that time. Unfortunately, uh,

168
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.000
especially since nine 11.

169
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.470
Now you have this Pfizer court that is both used to

170
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.240
approve surveillance and surveillance programs on, uh,

171
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.430
foreign targets, uh,

172
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.990
but also on Americans as well. Uh, the,

173
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.880
one of the many problems with this is it's a secret court where

174
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:09.600
you have a judge and you have someone representing the government,

175
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.200
whether it be one of the Intel agencies or the DOD or whatever,

176
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.760
coming before this court and making their case to try to get this warrant

177
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:19.200
approved by the judge.

178
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.190
There is no advocate there for the people.

179
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:27.180
There is no civil liberties or privacy advocate there. Uh, it's,

180
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:30.780
it's a one sided conversation. Uh,

181
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.320
and the information being provided by the government is the only information

182
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:39.060
that's being given to the judge. Uh, so this is one of the big problems there,

183
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.230
and, and we've seen over decades now, and especially since after nine 11,

184
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.000
that there have been very, very, very few, um,

185
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.560
applications for these surveillance warrants that have been rejected by the

186
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:54.570
judges. So, you know,

187
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.930
a rubber stamping of these applications for warrants is,

188
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.890
is really what appears to be happening. Um, you know,

189
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:04.920
there's a few different ways that we're looking at trying to fix this.

190
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:07.350
There are some who are arguing, uh, to,

191
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.570
to take away the Pfizer court completely.

192
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.930
One of the concerns about that is that if we do that,

193
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:17.850
then there has to be some other entity in place to exercise oversight over

194
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:22.080
the executive branch and not allow them to, um,

195
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.250
conduct this surveillance, you know, Willy nilly as, as they please.

196
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.860
Um, so it's figuring out exactly what,

197
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.180
what are the best reforms to meet that objective of providing that,

198
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:36.390
that oversight making it so that those warrants are given,

199
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.980
um, you know,

200
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.570
as needed and making sure that all in all the information is being presented.

201
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.190
And again, that, that Pfizer court was initially put in place to go after, uh,

202
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.210
take, to get warrants, to conduct surveillance on foreign targets, um,

203
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.230
not Americans.

204
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.120
And that's been one of the biggest problems here with a lot of this mass

205
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:59.410
surveillance is it's collecting our information as Americans illegally and

206
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:00.700
unconstitutionally,

207
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.810
because you can't do that unless you go through this process and you actually

208
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:07.330
get a warrant based on evidence.

209
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.620
<v 0>What would you do about Julian Assange? What would you do about Edward Snowden?</v>

210
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.710
<v 1>Uh, as far as what I'm doing, dropping the charges.</v>

211
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.710
<v 0>President of the world right.</v>

212
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.330
<v 1>Now dropping the charges.</v>

213
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.920
<v 0>He dropped the charges, but yeah,</v>

214
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.550
they're still going after him for something from Sweden, uh,

215
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.900
in Juliana Sonja's case.

216
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.740
And so Edward Snowden would be the only one that you would be able to write,

217
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.120
because unless you would influence.

218
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.220
<v 1>The charges that the Trump administration is, um, uh, Right,</v>

219
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.910
exactly.

220
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.450
And it remains to be seen whether or not they will push for extradition.

221
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.740
<v 0>There was another charge that was, I think it was today. The Sweden decided to,</v>

222
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.300
uh, go after him again for some sexual thing.

223
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.980
They had decided to go after many, many years ago. Um,

224
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.110
Edward Snowden,

225
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.270
what he's doing right now is essentially living day to day,

226
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:02.643
hold up in Russia,

227
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.660
in hiding and w the charges against him stem from,

228
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.070
again, this illegal operation that he, in many ways,

229
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:16.840
he's very patriotic. I mean, he let us know and at great costs. Yeah.

230
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.420
So you would give him a pardon. Yeah.

231
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.620
<v 1>Yeah. And I think address, we've got to address why he did the things,</v>

232
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.880
the way that he did them. And you hear the same thing from Chelsea Manning,

233
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.130
how there is not,

234
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.310
there's not an actual channel for whistleblowers,

235
00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:39.110
like them to bring forward information that exposes

236
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:43.820
agregious abuses of our constitutional rights and liberties, um,

237
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.340
period. I mean, there's,

238
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.460
there was not a channel for that to happen in a real way.

239
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.910
And that's why they ended up taking the path that they did and suffering the

240
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.210
conflict.
