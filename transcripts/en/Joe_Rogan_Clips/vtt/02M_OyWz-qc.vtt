00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>My uncle, like wasn't married or had kids. I was always like, huh,</v>

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.020
what's up with them? Smart.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.280
<v 1>That guy that's partying seems to go on the bill Maher route.</v>

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.163
Do you burble?

5
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.670
<v 0>Was that getting me into the alarm? Do you have a bill Martin? Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.530
<v 1>I saw you. Did you?</v>

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.580
<v 0>One of those people who thinks you wouldn't have those people, you're not okay.</v>

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.710
Okay. You don't you're wrong. There's no,

9
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:29.510
God. Okay.

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.100
It's very like, ah, I know everything. I do agree with that.

11
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.503
He says.

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.870
<v 1>Yeah, he's smart guy that shows a weird show.</v>

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.380
Everybody talking over each other five people on a panel,

14
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.850
whatever it is for over the phone. So many people. Do you see the, uh,

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.320
Ben Aflac one?

16
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.040
<v 0>Yes. With Sam Harris. Yes. Sam's a friend of mine. I.</v>

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.830
<v 1>Love Sam too. That was hilarious. I think Ben,</v>

18
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.400
I think Ben Affleck was roided up. He was playing Batman.

19
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.770
<v 0>That's right. I really had that energy.</v>

20
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.730
<v 1>Well, he also was like kind of red and thick. Yeah. His neck was thick. Like,</v>

21
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.000
listen, when you're 40, whatever the age he is.

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.570
And you want to pack on that kind of muscles. There's only one way

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.620
you got to take that plunger. Yeah.

24
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.671
That's what I think.

25
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:27.290
I think he was juiced up and I think he just was hyper aggressive virtue

26
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.160
signaling and really didn't even know what the he was talking about and clearly

27
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:32.600
picked the wrong guy.

28
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.560
<v 0>Oh my God. I would never argue with Sam Harris. I think.</v>
