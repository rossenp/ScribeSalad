<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 2>Did I ever tell you? I used to be on the radio.</v>

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.933
<v 0>The radio.</v>

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.500
<v 1>I've told you.</v>

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.030
<v 0>This before in another life?</v>

6
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.720
<v 1>No, when I was like seven years old, I was on, um, kiss FM.</v>

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.513
<v 0>I have.</v>

8
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.880
<v 1>Yeah, Ryan T most of it probably. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.980
<v 0>Why did I not remember that? I don't know. Cause.</v>

10
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.480
<v 1>It wasn't good. Yeah. I mean,</v>

11
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:26.280
I had a job working as a radio personality for like four years from third

12
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:31.050
grade until sixth grade. Yeah. Making prank phone calls.

13
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.360
<v 0>No, I don't think you told me this. Did you tell me on the air now?</v>

14
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.330
You told me real life. I told you in real life. I don't know if you did.

15
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
I don't remember. Do you remember this? I may have heard her talk about before.

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.930
<v 1>But I was like a mini. I was like a little mini celebrity in my hometown.</v>

17
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.790
You know, like my dad would, he,

18
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.060
I remember one time he had to get a rental car and they were going to give him

19
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.150
like, you know, a Toyota or something. And he's like, do you listen to kiss FM?

20
00:00:57.151 --> 00:01:00.030
Do you know a little alley to my daughter? Can I get a convertible?

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.130
Pick me up from school in a new, like a nicer rental car or something. Yeah.

22
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.290
But I mean, even that was hard. And that was like nothing. I called in randomly.

23
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.740
My sisters listened to kiss FM. When we would get ready for school,

24
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.390
we'd listened to it. I was.

25
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.460
<v 0>Seven. No one's watching you. My.</v>

26
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.300
<v 1>Dad was home. My dad was home and my sisters were home probably. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.460
<v 0>Just grabbed the phone and started dialing numbers.</v>

28
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.160
<v 1>I asked my sister, I said, I want to call into the radio station.</v>

29
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.580
I want to like request a song or something. And my sister's like,

30
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.920
I'm not giving you the number. You're going to embarrass me.

31
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:36.210
All my friends listened to this station. And so she tries calling in.

32
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.640
She doesn't get through. My dad takes her to school,

33
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.020
me and my other sister at home.

34
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.290
I press redial on the phone and I immediately get through.

35
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.840
And now I'm panicking. I don't know what to say. And I'm like,

36
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:49.470
can I get Brittany Spears tickets talking to Ryan T crest? And he's like,

37
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.940
can you sing a Brittany Spears song?

38
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.600
So I'm like seven years old singing toxic by Britney Spears,

39
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:55.840
just being like the taste.

40
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.120
And after I sing the song, he's like, oh, we don't have Brittany Spears tickets,

41
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:07.140
but we have American idol tickets. And I was like, I'll only go if they're VIP.

42
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.390
<v 0>And then we're.</v>

43
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.270
<v 1>Just having a conversation back and forth. He's like, where are your parents?</v>

44
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:16.200
I'm like, I don't know. Dad's out. It's like seven in the morning.

45
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.980
And then I ended up getting a job, making prank phone calls for them.

46
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.730
How did it end? It ended with me not being little anymore.

47
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.300
And no, I was too old. I was like, 12.

48
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.093
<v 0>Is that really what happened?</v>

49
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.360
<v 1>They, yeah. So I had a contract that would like, you know,</v>

50
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.880
expired and then they wanted to renew it,

51
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:39.720
but in a different way and sign on to Ryan's production company.

52
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.060
<v 0>But my dad had to pimp you out. Yeah. Whoa. You want a PCU? Yeah,</v>

53
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.750
really?

54
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.180
<v 1>Yeah. I think piece, I think they want like 20%.</v>

55
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.570
<v 0>Of everything you do from there on out. I think so. Wow.</v>

56
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.420
<v 1>And my dad was like, that's too much. And so we didn't.</v>

57
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.840
<v 0>End up doing standup career. Took off you be Ryan Seacrest.</v>

58
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.060
So for the rest of your career, if you had signed that it might be for life.

59
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.120
<v 1>But I don't think it would have been for a wife.</v>

60
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.130
<v 0>Forever if you're just the Kardashians show. Right.</v>

61
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.601
<v 1>I always tell my dad,</v>

62
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.090
we could have been the Makowski is keeping up with them with cough.

63
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.680
<v 0>Skis, up dad.</v>

64
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.710
<v 1>No, but I'm so grateful because I mean,</v>

65
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.980
I don't know if anything would have come of that or anything, but like,

66
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.130
I'm glad I got to eat lunch in the bathroom alone in high school.

67
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.690
And like have all of those, you know, just weird, awkward,

68
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.613
uncomfortable.

69
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.400
<v 0>And the funny that at the time you think of them as being the worst thing ever,</v>

70
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.210
and then later on you realize there's kind of a gift in some of that weird
