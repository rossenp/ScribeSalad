00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience when people, you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:07.310
like the idea of backpacking hunting,

3
00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:09.110
that's what they're liking is the idea of it.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.920
Cause Kim glamorized the out of it, but again, painful.

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.420
<v 1>He's not, he's not a normal human. You can't go by his standards, his ideas,</v>

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.890
they say that sheep on things, the hardest they say that, uh, like,

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.100
like Alaska sheep hunting in terms of like just the difficulty of the

8
00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:32.270
terrain and the dangers of it. Yeah. Um.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.100
<v 0>Somewhat. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:37.700
I would say the I've only been on a couple sheep hunts in Alaska, right?

11
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:42.140
Most of mine have been in lower 48 or the NWT, um, uh, Northwest territories.

12
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.760
The thing with Alaska that's easy is you're not gaining that much altitude

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.900
distance as far. You're not, but the weather is bad.

14
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:52.460
Like generally the weather is pretty bad.

15
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:54.290
And then that the amount of pressure now, and again,

16
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:55.850
I'm not an expert on Alaska.

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.450
The pressure is much worse than it's ever been in Alaska.

18
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.370
<v 1>In terms of the amount of hunters, hunters. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.110
A lot of hunters out there and then animals, Grizzlies and. Yeah.

20
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.250
<v 0>Which is a real, you've seen us get charged on video.</v>

21
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.970
<v 1>When you were at the gritty Bowman. That was terrifying. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:15.650
It was crazy. I.

23
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.880
<v 0>Uh, tell them I'm an adrenaline junkie. I'll tell the true story. Okay.</v>

24
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.170
Because it's not, I thought I were calling him moose and I'm like, look in.

25
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:27.890
And I'm like, I think there's a moose coming in a grizzly pops out. I'm like,

26
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:28.724
Hey.

27
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.680
<v 1>Get your camera. Let's call this thing in.</v>

28
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 0>It's the true story. Right? Cause we made it sound like it was, you know, oh,</v>

29
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:37.820
here comes a grizzly. So I thought it was going to get to that stump and stop.

30
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.630
Right. You called the grizzly in on please coming into a moose call. Right. So,

31
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.170
oh no. I'm like, Hey, can I have the cameras? Let's get this on video.

32
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.790
Cause he was looking for our moose calls.

33
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.360
So this big pitch gets you out of that log. And she stands up,

34
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.100
she's looking around and I'm like, oh cool.

35
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:55.460
You can hear my shutter on the video. it hit the ground.

36
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:57.680
And it was coming and I'm like, oh well.

37
00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.810
And immediately me I've been charged enough to where I'm,

38
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.840
I'm an adrenaline junkie anyway, I'm desensitized. And I'm like, well,

39
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:05.420
he's going to eat this other dude. Anyway. So I'm like,

40
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.020
you can see my camera's shifting right. A little as I'm taking these photos,

41
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.390
I didn't have a weapon at a bow. And so here pretty quick, I'm thinking, shoot,

42
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:16.970
this. It's like 15 yards from us.

43
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.980
He fired off a round at its feet. And I knew his gun jammed on the second round.

44
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.980
Uh, sometimes. So I'm like, oh,

45
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.750
brownie eight jam on this second one or whatever it was. Right.

46
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.080
I'm not saying a Browning's bad. Well it stopped. Do you remember?

47
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.650
And it came again. I think it was like 12,

48
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.240
10 yards when it finally turned off and got.

49
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.640
<v 1>Away. But 10 yards is nothing. Well,</v>

50
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:45.170
I tell you like that's almost like that wall. Yeah.

51
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:46.004
It was big.

52
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.571
<v 2>For example,</v>

53
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:51.170
I start the book with a quote from the head of Phillip Morris who says,

54
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.160
who knows what you would do if you didn't smoke, maybe you'd beat your wife.

55
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.060
Maybe you drive cars fast. And you know, that that's part of,

56
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.690
I think the tobacco industry approached to this, they would,

57
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.400
they would imagine this sort of counterfactual, uh, where, you know,

58
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.680
a world without tobacco, without cigarettes.

59
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.770
And then they would imagine what that would be like.

60
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:16.410
And of course they'd always imagine it was much, much worse than smoking. Yeah.

61
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.300
<v 1>I read that part. And also the,</v>

62
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.540
the man in question wound up quitting cigarettes, so.

63
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.150
<v 2>Right. Yeah. He, he had to quit fairly quickly.</v>

64
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.130
<v 3>And what did he do.</v>

65
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.530
<v 2>Right, exactly. Yeah. That was the question.</v>

66
00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:30.180
And we never really did find that out.

67
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.990
<v 1>Such a strange way to live your life,</v>

68
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.290
to be deceptive in a way that you know, is going to, I mean,

69
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.120
there's, I don't know how many people have gotten cancer from cigarettes,

70
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.190
but it's probably yeah. Well, and it.

71
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.670
<v 2>Isn't just cancer. It's our heart disease, et cetera. So millions, I mean,</v>

72
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.410
I've seen an estimate that in the 20th century smoking killed,

73
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.360
I want to make sure I get this right.

74
00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:57.750
I think it was a hundred million people more than,

75
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.100
more than maybe both wars, world wars,

76
00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:04.620
but together it's 7 million a year, I think is the,

77
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.010
is the global death toll in the U S it's

78
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.170
480,000 a year. Yeah. Directly to attributable. Right.

79
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:17.670
They trace it. They trace it to, to, uh, directly attributable. Now, you know,

80
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.590
it, these are extreme examples. Tobacco's the most famous and extreme example.

81
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:27.210
And I talk about a lot of other examples, but I think it's actually, you know,

82
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.860
a fairly common thing for people to go pretty far down the road of denial when

83
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:35.250
they are working in an industry. And, and this is sort of the process.

84
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.820
I try to explore a little bit in the book, they're working in an industry,

85
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:42.570
they're confronted with some accusation that they have caused harm.

86
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.340
They check their gut and their gut says, no, we didn't intend to cause harm.

87
00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:48.480
We don't feel guilty.

88
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.580
And so their mind starts to come up with reasons why it must be wrong and

89
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.140
their tribal instincts,

90
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:59.430
which are never more than just a millimeter below the surface for pretty much

91
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:04.020
any of us, but certainly in this case get triggered. So,

92
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.300
uh, they immediately think, well,

93
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.200
these people accusing me must have an ulterior motive. They must be,

94
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.110
they want money. They want power. They want attention.

95
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:17.760
They've got some sinister political objective. Uh, and then the,

96
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.570
the other part of that tribal dynamic as they start thinking about themselves,

97
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.650
uh, and, and their truly lofty mission, which isn't just to sell a product,

98
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:28.440
but something else it's to protect freedom.

99
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:32.850
Or if you're a slave trader it's to rescue the Africans from terrible lives in

100
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:35.940
Africa and bring them to the comfortable plantations.

101
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.850
<v 4>Uh, micro assault would be, um, you know, making a small,</v>

102
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:45.690
but you know, racially salient comment in the presence of a person.

103
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.180
<v 1>Of that race. So it's not even not necessarily.</v>

104
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.160
<v 4>Racist. No, it's not an assault. No,</v>

105
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:53.490
these people that violence is all words and, and discursive. So.

106
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.670
<v 1>Micro assault can just be an insult.</v>

107
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 4>And they're all insults micro. Everything has to just be like,</v>

108
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.280
words are standing in the wrong place. Oh boy.

109
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.850
<v 1>Jamie just pulled it up here. Uh, Microsoft is an explicit racial</v>

110
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.180
derogations characterize. What is that? Look at that expression.

111
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.190
A microassault is an explicit racial derogations.

112
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.500
<v 4>So you've put somebody down on purpose. I.</v>

113
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.711
<v 1>Know,</v>

114
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:25.630
but that's a weird way of describing an explicit racial derogations

115
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.370
plural. Yeah. Someone who reaches singular. Yeah, it doesn't sound right. Yeah.

116
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.650
Darian editor derogations Puro characterized primarily by verbal or nonverbal

117
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:39.100
attack meant to hurt the intended victim through name calling there's your

118
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:44.080
hyphen avoidant behavior or purposeful discriminatory

119
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.490
actions. The armor on that's broken all the pieces. It's a mess.

120
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.260
And that's a K zu.edu, reason.ksu.edu.

121
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.130
Nice. I mean, they didn't even bother like editing that. Look at that.

122
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.470
<v 4>There's so many of these things that are like for education that are like this,</v>

123
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.400
and it's like, they say stuff like themself and it's just like,

124
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.420
this is supposed to be for education. It's barely literate. What is going on?

125
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.320
That's a problem when you're.

126
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.980
<v 1>Using the vein them as well. Right. So we're using they, them pronouns,</v>

127
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.380
which are really supposed to, I mean,

128
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.270
for the most part indicate multiple people. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right.

129
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:25.250
Yeah. Say they, you know, so this guy, what you could say,

130
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.500
they thought, or they thought they would get away with it. I mean,

131
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.510
you could say it, you could say right.

132
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.510
But it's hard to use it that way all the time.

133
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.700
<v 4>Right. It's hard to use it intentionally actually.</v>

134
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.850
It's it's it comes up naturally sometimes, and then that's fine.

135
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:43.220
But it's hard to use intentionally. Yeah. If a person.

136
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.960
<v 1>Wanted to go to the store, they could go.</v>

137
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.980
<v 4>Right.</v>

138
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.180
And so there's something like kind of totalitarian about making people do things

139
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:51.140
like that that are difficult,

140
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:53.690
like jumping through these little hoops and then holding them to massive

141
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:57.380
account. And it's like, I mean, even like the black lives matter thing,

142
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.390
like black lives matter as a sentence is obvious forcing somebody to say an

143
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:05.660
obvious thing. That's a great name because you can't argue with it.

144
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.570
You also can't argue because what are you going to matter? And of course it's,

145
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.180
I mean, it's so complicated because there's like, if somebody asked me,

146
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.540
they said, okay, do you support black lives matter, James,

147
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:16.010
do you support black lives matter? And of course,

148
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:17.960
they're gonna try to catch me on this. And it's like, which one?

149
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.780
There's at least five. I support one of them.

150
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.520
And I think the other four are nuts.

151
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.160
<v 5>I was at his house, uh, January of last year, January, 2019,</v>

152
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.600
Tiffany Haddish took me to his house. And, uh,

153
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.290
it was this night that I was really not supposed to be there. I wasn't invited,

154
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.570
but Tiffany was like, come with me. And I'm like, hell yeah.

155
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.220
So I went and it was,

156
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.870
it was this incredible night at Eddie Murphy's house where, um,

157
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.370
I walked downstairs. The first person I see is Jamie Fox. I was like, Hey man,

186
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.450
I was like that whole night. I honestly didn't say a word to anybody.

187
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.480
I was just in shock. The entire time was just like,

188
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.470
I know every time I turn my head and then I was standing in the doorway like

189
00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:40.760
that and it's, it's me standing beside Eddie and then Chris rock,

190
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.230
Jamie Foxx and Neil Brennan.

191
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.270
And they're all trying to convince him to do standup again. Wow.

192
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.130
And I'm just there, like, I have nothing to add to this conversation.

193
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.980
Like I'm not on Jamie's level, not of Chris's level, you know,

194
00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:58.910
Neil credit spells. I'm like, I'm just there, but they didn't make me feel like,

195
00:10:58.911 --> 00:11:01.460
what are you doing here? They made me feel included. So that was nice,

196
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:04.670
but that is nice. But uh, they, you know, there was like, Eddie was like,

197
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:08.270
