00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 2>I, I I'll tell you this flying into Texas, right? Um, on,</v>

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.040
on aircraft, I was on, um, one of the flight, uh,

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.440
attendants came up and kind of tapped me on the shoulders.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.760
We were getting ready to land and said, well, be careful because you know,

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.400
you know, Texas has gotten rid of the mask bandaid. So, and, and,

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.270
and the point was from the flight attendant was, you know,

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.870
did she just say it to you? Yeah. It's gonna be like the, she likes you. Yeah.

9
00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:28.270
It's a wild west. It's gonna be the wild west. Well.

10
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.430
<v 1>You know, she's like Mr. Baker, you.</v>

11
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.270
<v 0>Be careful out there because, you know, it's, I like you. Yeah. And, uh, and so,</v>

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.630
but, but the point my wife was sitting right next to me,

13
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630
there was nothing on tour. It wasn't like you, no,

14
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:40.310
we were not engaged in any shenanigans, but,

15
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.580
but the point was was that they looked at it and they go, oh, you know,

16
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.260
governor Abbot said this and it's political. Right. But I,

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.580
my point of my story is I walked off the plane. Everybody was wearing a mask.

18
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.860
<v 1>Yeah. This is the thing. The government AB governor, rather Abbot said, he said,</v>

19
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.980
I encourage you to wear a mask. You should still wear a mask,

20
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.970
but I don't want the state to tell you what to do. Right. Right.

21
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.170
That's what I support.

22
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.930
<v 0>And if you don't want the state to tell you what to do,</v>

23
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.610
you shouldn't want the federal government exactly. Telling you what to do.

24
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:12.730
Exactly. Exactly. But everybody I've seen in Austin wear, wear a mask. Yeah.

25
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.610
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, until you go to a restaurant and then you sit down,</v>

26
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.530
then there's no mask. And I don't understand that. Well,

27
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.043
the whole thing is nonsense.

28
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.930
You have to wear a mask and you go to pee and then you don't wear a,

29
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360
when you come back and sit, sit down at.

30
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.600
<v 0>Your table, like, okay. I mean, cuz you know, to be fair, they've got, you know,</v>

31
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:28.520
mostly six foot distance. You know,

32
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.880
they haven't the places that I've been here in Texas. Uh, they,

33
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.720
they keep the social distance. But I guess my point was like, you get this and,

34
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.400
and we talked about this earlier off, uh, before the show,

35
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.870
but was the idea that some people just like to suffer and they suffer well,

36
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.873
right.

37
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.340
<v 1>They enjoy the fact that this is, this is hard and bad and that's really sad,</v>

38
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.340
but it's true. There's people that they enjoy being depressed. It's,

39
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:58.860
it's a hard thing to, to even say, because you don't want it to be real.

40
00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.701
You don't,

41
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:03.820
you don't want there to really be people out there that like when there's some

42
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.810
people that when we got shut into our homes and everyone was sad

43
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.170
and everyone was scared,

44
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.730
they enjoyed it because that's how they live all the time. Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.690
<v 0>Or that's just, it, it, it's their time to shine. Some people have,</v>

46
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.730
have really shown during the pandemic. Yeah. And it's like,

47
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.360
I saw this post from this, this, uh, individual who is a professional,

48
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.120
uh, clearly from their job. And they, they posted, ah,

49
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.280
I'm dealing with such anxiety now because of the possible return to normal and

50
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:36.640
the idea that, oh, I'm gonna have to travel.

51
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.800
And I won't be able to have dinner with my kids. And I'm just like,

52
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.040
and I'm thinking, you you've had the,

53
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.800
it was clear from the post that they've had the luxury of working from home.

54
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.110
Yeah. And not losing their job and they could teach their kids.

55
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.190
And it's this idea of not opening the public schools,

56
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.630
these kids out here who don't have wifi,

57
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.680
who don't have laptops who have a one parent home who has to work. Yeah.

58
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.880
All those can't afford a tutor. Can't make a little pod to teach their kids.

59
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.040
You know, those people aren't doing well. Right. And those kids are suffering.

60
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.240
And then you get like the,

61
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.360
the people who can afford to set up a private pod for their kids and bring a

62
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.240
tutor in and have strong wifi and can do all those things.

63
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.830
How have English as a first language and they're doing just fine.

64
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.070
And they're like, well, we should not go back to school.

65
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.150
you kids have disappeared off the radar during this past year.

66
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.990
And the schools don't even know where they are in places like New York and

67
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.950
Chicago and other places. So it's, it's up.

68
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.270
<v 1>Yeah. You know, it's, there's narratives out there.</v>

69
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.910
And the problem with these narratives are,

70
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.340
it's not that they're all completely inaccurate. The problem is when you say,

71
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:48.060
when you, when you espouse these narratives in a very condensed, processed way,

72
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.940
like social media, you get a bunch of people that support it.

73
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:53.500
And a bunch of people that argue against it. But if it's a narrative,

74
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.740
like we should stay home. We should all wear masks. Yeah.

75
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.730
Pretty hard for people to fight against that. Right. So people, they, they,

76
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.250
they pile on and then,

77
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.010
and then people get addicted to like the reactions and the interactions on

78
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:10.810
Twitter. And it's like, it becomes this weird method of communication,

79
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.090
the method of discussing ideas. And they get,

80
00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:18.490
people get really attached to whatever, whatever they believe in,

81
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.800
whether they believe the kid should be in school the end of time and all,

82
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.000
all interactions should be done through zoom or that we should all throw away

83
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:27.640
our masks and achieve herd immunity.

84
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.760
And you should take vitamin D and go out in the sun and exercise and be

85
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:32.594
healthier. And.

86
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.600
<v 0>You can do, you can do all of it. Right. You can wear a mask because you know,</v>

87
00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:39.080
okay, fine. I who, my, my freedoms aren't infringed by wearing a mask.

88
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.070
Don't give a. It's not that big ill. Yeah. But at the same time,

89
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.710
do I want my kids back in school?

90
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.910
Do I think it's healthy for my oldest boy's Slugo to, you know, be wearing his,

91
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.190
you know, pajamas or his sweatpants all day long and learning from distance. No.

92
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.750
And I think that it's just, so there are, I, I, you know,

93
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.870
I do agree with the idea that there, there are people that, that suffer well,

94
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.860
they're kinda wielding this whole thing as, as a sort of justice. Yeah. So.

95
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.620
<v 1>Well, you know, a good example,</v>

96
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.300
the comedy community is an interesting example because one,

97
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.300
one of the things that, uh,

98
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.500
a lot of my professional comedian friends have found is that there's a lot of

99
00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:19.300
people that never worked. And when I say never I'm exaggerating,

100
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.530
but they weren't there weren't successful. They didn't,

101
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:26.570
they weren't selling out clubs and theaters. They weren't doing well.

102
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.650
And they're so angry that some comics have decided to go on the road again,

103
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.010
because a lot of places have opened up. Texas has opened up,

104
00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:36.170
Florida's opened up, you can go and do shows, but that's.

105
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.170
<v 0>A chance to do work. Right. I.</v>

106
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.450
<v 1>Mean, so it is, but they're angry. And they, they, they want the narrative.</v>

107
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.520
Is that doing these super spreader events?

108
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:47.560
People even got mad at me and Dave Chappelle because Dave and I were doing these

109
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.760
shows at stubs, uh, amphitheater in Austin outside.

110
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.040
There's no evidence whatsoever that the, the, that the virus spreads outside.

111
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.840
Right. And I mean, literally none, there's no evidence. And then on top of that,

112
00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:01.520
we test everyone in the crowd. It's expensive.

113
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.480
It takes a long time that people get there early, we test the entire crowd.

114
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.360
<v 0>Are you doing temperature.</v>

115
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.160
<v 1>Checks or you doing no, we're doing, we're doing, uh,</v>

116
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.320
antigen tests for the entire crowd. That's.

117
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.000
<v 0>Crazy. Yeah. I mean, that's great, but it's.</v>

118
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.680
<v 1>Crazy. It's expensive, but it's the way to do it.</v>

119
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:17.750
And we had a great time and we're doing it in again. And,

120
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.550
but some comics have been mad at that.

121
00:06:20.551 --> 00:06:24.310
But if you go and look at the comics that are mad, they're all unsuccessful.

122
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.190
Yeah. Yeah. Or super liberal. And they're virtue signaling. They're looking to,

123
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.190
to, to like tag on to this idea that what you're doing is bad.

124
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.710
And then what we should do is all stay home and lock down.

125
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.820
Like you can go outside. And by the way,

126
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.420
most people like 99.9,

127
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.300
whatever percent survive,

128
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.700
there was a recent study that showed that 78% of all the people that are

129
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.380
hospitalized from COVID are overweight. Yeah.

130
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.260
<v 0>Have you seen that? Yeah. I've seen that. Yeah. They have issue.</v>

131
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.570
<v 1>Where, where this shame in that all these people are talking out fat shaming.</v>

132
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:00.810
Right. You wanna talk about the super spreaders? Yeah.

133
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.290
It's people that have ignored their health and those people need help and they

134
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:05.450
need support and they need love.

135
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.210
But there's a reality to the people that are getting sick from this.

136
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.890
If everyone was healthy,

137
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.010
this would almost be a non-issue now that's not a health shaming thing.

138
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:17.970
Like we should be shaming people that are in poor health or people that are poor

139
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.480
worn with, you know, um, uh, comorbidity factors like diabetes and whatever.

140
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.473
Right. Of course, of course. Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.600
But the re we're not looking at this thing a hundred percent objective if we

142
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:30.800
were, we would have a completely different take on.

143
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.200
<v 0>It. Well, look, there's no science. There's, that's an example. I I'm focused.</v>

144
00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:36.520
Cause I got the, I got these three knuckleheads at home. Right.

145
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:40.070
So I'm focused on like the, the, the education side of things as well.

146
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.350
And so as, as, as are you, but they it's,

147
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.270
there's no science people believe science. Well, of course believe science.

148
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.870
That, that that's one of the funniest narratives believe science. Well,

149
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.390
who the doesn't believe? I mean, that's fine, but it's a political issue. Right?

150
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.030
So, but I think that, uh, there's no science that shows that, that, you know,

151
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.420
a six foot distance in public school for kids right. Is,

152
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.780
is, is, uh, is essential to their health. So in fact,

153
00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:09.540
the science shows three foot. That's fine. And what that does though,

154
00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:11.060
the importance of that is logistics, right?

155
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:13.780
Because it allows for you to get the schools open. Again,

156
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.540
people will talk about the six foot distance.

157
00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:18.500
We can't get the kids back into their classrooms with six foot distances.

158
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:21.010
We can't get enough of them in their it's the little things,

159
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.810
it's the logistics of it saying, well, get it down to three foot,

160
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:27.050
which is what the science supports. And then you can get these schools,

161
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.250
you can start opening these places back up in a responsible manner. Honest it,

162
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.730
God, we're gonna look at this thing in, in, in a year or two.

163
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:36.570
Maybe we won't because we're not gonna be honest with ourselves, but we're,

164
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.890
if we actually did an honest, hot wash of this reaction to the pandemic,

165
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.840
our reaction has been pathetic right over, over this past year. I,

166
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.640
this has not been a shining moment for.

167
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.240
<v 1>Us. Don't we think part of the problem is we started out with a different idea,</v>

168
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.273
what the virus is.

169
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.200
We started out thinking that it was gonna be like the next Spanish flu and that

170
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.840
it was gonna kill. I mean, everyone was terrified. And me included,

171
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.480
I was scared of it in the beginning.

172
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.880
I thought that it was gonna be something that kills 10% of the population,

173
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.680
you know, and it didn't turn out to be that way,

174
00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:06.960
but we never made an adjustment.

175
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.280
<v 0>Yeah, no, I, yes. I think that's true. And I think also part of it is,</v>

176
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.350
is you can't negate the, uh, or minimize the political reaction.

177
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.310
Right. If, if, if Joe Biden had been president, when this thing broke,

178
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.590
I guarantee you, the reaction would've been somewhat different.

179
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.870
The fact that Trump was in there yeah. And created so much emotion, um,

180
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.470
and there was such animosity.

181
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.390
<v 1>Uh, thank God. Trump wasn't Provac would be &lt;laugh&gt; because, you know,</v>

182
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.900
he pro so many other therapeutics and they're like hydroxy, Chlo,

183
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.260
queen racist, you know, like, yeah, thank God.

184
00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:46.580
He didn't say anything about ivermectin or vitamin D or Corin or any of the

185
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:48.460
other things that we've been or zinc. Yeah. But.

186
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.020
<v 0>I, I do think that, you know, that was a big issue was, was like, uh.</v>

187
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.380
<v 1>See, he's.</v>

188
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.300
<v 0>So polarizing and we can't, and we can't trust the,</v>

189
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.410
the vaccines because you know, that were developed under Trump. Right. Oh, it.

190
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.244
Believe the science,

191
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.010
it would develop by companies that have nothing but scientists and doctors and

192
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.650
engineers that working inside them. Yeah.

193
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.970
And so if you believe the science and you better believe that they were

194
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:11.810
developing vaccines, that you should have been happy about. So, you know,

195
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.930
I, you know, I don't know, it's, it's the, the political nature of, of this guy.

196
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.401
And, and again,

197
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.080
going back to what we were talking about earlier with the Russians and the

198
00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:22.040
Chinese, they see that and they just keep,

199
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:25.360
they keep sticking the mic poking at us. Yeah. And, and the more they do,

200
00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:28.000
the more they tear the threads of, of our belief from the system.

201
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.920
And the more polarized we get and the more yelling that goes on and the more

202
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.480
people believe when they read social media and they don't bother to say, well,

203
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.870
who wrote this? Right. Right. And is this actually a,

204
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.270
a scientific piece of work or is this just, and, and what's the origin of it?

205
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.510
What, what's the outlet, right?

206
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.590
And half the time the outlet is overseas someplace,

207
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:47.830
and then you gotta dig into it. It's,

208
00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:50.310
it's like an asset tracing exercise who owns that company. Right.

209
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:53.350
Then you find out it's owned by some, you know, Russian entity.

210
00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:55.750
That's got an operation outta Cyprus, whatever.
