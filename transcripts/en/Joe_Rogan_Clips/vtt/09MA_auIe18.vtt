1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.560
<v 0>You know what I mean? It's coach Eddie over here. Yeah. It's like, relax.</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.400
Everyone's everybody's blow up sponsorship, logos all over.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.800
I have no sponsor puts on a Reebok hat. The,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.240
I have no personal sponsors. Hey.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 1>Are you working with Tony? Absolutely. What you been doing with.</v>

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.040
<v 0>Him? Same. We've been preparing for KIB for a long time. for the, uh,</v>

7
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.070
da on your fight. We were preparing for him, but we were also preparing for,

8
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.110
we're always preparing for the worst case scenario and KIB is the worst case

9
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.510
scenario. He's probably the best ground and pounder wrestler ever.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.430
Right? This is the tough, the toughest challenge ever for,

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.740
um, in MMA or 10th planet. That's for sure. This is the, I mean, this is it.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.540
This is, this is the worst case scenario that I've been talking about.

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.860
This is what I prepare for every me personally, my,

14
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.660
my Abu Dhabi is at,

15
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.860
at the gym when we have drop-ins and since 2003, every who,

16
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.260
who knows who's gonna drop in that night and challenge me.

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.850
So I always prepared for the worst case scenario, some drop in who's one 90,

18
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.410
who wrestled his whole life really in jujitsu. And what am I gonna do with him?

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.690
That first round? The, the only round we go with probably one round, maybe two.

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.850
I'm just, I'm just focusing on stuff that he's never seen.

21
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.760
Cuz if I come at him with stuff he's seen, then, uh, that's not a good,

22
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.400
that's not a good strategy. I'm gonna, I'm gonna pull him into some,

23
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.920
some uncharted territory. And that's what we're doing.

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.480
That's what I've been doing with Tony is prepared. Just uncharted territory.

25
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:36.720
We're gonna, you know, we, the thing with Kabe KIB is, um,

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.120
I mean he's undefeated, no doubt.

27
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.630
One of the best fighters probably of all time. You never lost around. Yeah.

28
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:51.070
Yeah. One like, you know, Connor round three, but you gotta remember this too.

29
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
I Quinta maybe there, there are some, there are a couple KIB fights.

30
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:56.750
We watch all the KIB fights where you do see where he,

31
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.870
you don't see the classic KIB like with Gleason Toba that didn't go down like,

32
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.053
like, um.

33
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.340
<v 1>Aw. Thick kid. Crazy heavy way. FIY got knocked out.</v>

34
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.420
Think boy nation got knocked out. Jamie's over here. Sorry. Watching the fight.

35
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.420
Millennials mullet.

36
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980
<v 0>Like Theo. what? I was so many reasons. Watch that.</v>

37
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.180
What I was saying was there are some fights where it could be wasn't human

38
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.330
looks, human. There are a couple there's you also look at the, the San's fight.

39
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.970
He clearly won that,

40
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.450
but there was things that he couldn't do that he could do with other people

41
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.330
still San Joseph's. He couldn't get past E's guard.

42
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.170
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know what I mean?

43
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:37.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it wasn't that easy to take down. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

44
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.170
you know, and Tony, you know, his, when you compare like, you know,

45
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.080
the Conner fight with KIB, you know, um, Tony wrestled this whole life.

46
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.240
Well Tony's phenomen wrestling. There's a, there's uh,

47
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.920
a light year difference between, uh, Connor's wrestling and Tony's wrestling.

48
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.560
Right? So you got that. Um,

49
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.040
Tony will throw DARS standing and from all different angles and,

50
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.000
and while you're trying to take him down, so Cobb's gotta worry about that.

51
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.440
There's gonna be Darius coming on the feed don't hatch.

52
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.080
Everybody knows that you can watch that.

53
00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:09.000
Everybody knows that I'm only giving away stuff that you could watch on. Yeah.

54
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.280
You know what I mean? I'm I'm yeah. Are you gonna be in Brooklyn?

55
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.223
<v 1>What was that? You gonna be in.</v>

56
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.480
<v 0>Brooklyn for that? Yeah. Yeah. And, um, so we're, we're focusing on the stuff,</v>

57
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.190
you know, when, when KIB has his way, when he,

58
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:25.470
when he's in a fight where everything's going, his way, you, he, you know,

59
00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.310
it's against the fence, it's a title there there's,

60
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.350
there's a look against the fence that he always has. It's that same look.

61
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.150
And then when he drags the guy down, it's that same look.

62
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.670
And when they are halfway back up, there's that look,

63
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.500
and then they're back on the fence. There's that position? That look boom.

64
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.500
So when it comes to KIB, I'm, it's, it's gonna be the hardest challenge ever,

65
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:45.580
right. For both guys though. Yeah, for sure. For sure.

66
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.060
But the advantage that we have is we know exactly where the fight is gonna be.

67
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.020
If KIB gets like, you know, is successful, if he's successful and, and there's,

68
00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:57.060
there's different phases. There's the standup phase. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

69
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.490
there's the clin, there's the, um, the fighting against the fence.

70
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:03.730
There's the dragging. And then there's like in between the fence and dragon,

71
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.650
we know where the fight can be. Um, you know, um,

72
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.170
the one thing we don't know is how is it gonna look? Is it gonna look like, um,

73
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.560
you know,

74
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.930
Kabe has his way and passes Tony's guard like he has against other opponents?

75
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.760
Or is it gonna be like Gleason to bow or he is having a hard time taking him

76
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.920
down and he's having, he's never getting side control,

77
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:28.120
never passing the guard against, uh, Gleason. Yeah. Is it gonna look like that?

78
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.600
How is it gonna look? They could look so many different ways.

79
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.880
We'll never really know until they match up. You just don't really know.

80
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.480
I can't wait, but I will. I will promise you this.

81
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.910
As we got all sorts of landmines waiting for is we know where the

82
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.990
fight, where he wants to take the fight and there's gonna be some traps there,

83
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.910
all sorts of them. And no one knows about him. We're not talking about him,

84
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:51.790
but we've been working on this for, for a while. Jesus,

85
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.830
who knows what's gonna happen. Kabe has all, you know,

86
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.550
has my respect a million percent, that guy, that guy's insane. Tony, Tony,

87
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.900
Tony, to be crazy. Oh yeah. Tony, can't be my friend. Tony,

88
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.180
Tony has so many weapons.

89
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.740
So many. He might have more weapons.

90
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.300
He might have more weapons than anybody in the history of the UFC. That's fair.

91
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.260
He might have weapons. It's hard are that's about.

92
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.090
<v 1>Great scrambler too. Think about so many different areas. Get everything.</v>

93
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.050
<v 0>Think about this in the history of MMA who is known more for</v>

94
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.730
daring than him. No one, nobody even close. No, one's.

95
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.370
And.

96
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.170
<v 1>He catches him late in the fight when everyone's covering sweat and blood.</v>

97
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.930
Like Barboza. Yeah. Yeah.

98
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.970
<v 0>And, and he, the Dar the Dar is one of those techniques.</v>

99
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.880
It is, you could learn really. The learning part is the easiest part.

100
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.200
Like learning how to do a Darce can, you could be like two minutes,

101
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.143
like two minutes,

102
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.640
but mastering it and mastering it enough to be known for it and getting grown

103
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.040
men who are experts at, at, at ground fighting on it.

104
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.160
That's a whole that very few people, uh,

105
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.880
reach that status again. They were DARS. Everybody knows the Darris,

106
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.080
every grappler in Abu Dhabi, like the last Abu Dhabi, 2019,

107
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.560
every grappler on the card knows how to do a Darris. They know how to teach it.

108
00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:15.320
They could do a seminar, but no one did it. Only one guy. Uh,

109
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.910
the Rutolo one of the Rito twins.

110
00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:21.870
He's from OTOs that guy like he was Daron. He was,

111
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:24.870
there were Daron all over the place. Why everybody knows how to do him,

112
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.390
how come he was only able to do him because he's strategizing for it.

113
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.390
He's looking for it. And, and,

114
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.470
and the strategy is not like a thing that he's thinking about consciously it's

115
00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:38.060
in his DNA. Yeah. That's the difference he does because he's always,

116
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.140
he's looking for it. Subconsciously it's in his strategy. It's in his DNA.

117
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.140
That's how, that's how Tony is Tony man. And now we're not,

118
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.460
I'm not satisfied with him just knowing it. Dude, we work on,

119
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.900
he already has a mastered,

120
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.340
but we're working on it even more and making sure that if Kabe is caught,

121
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.970
one of those things, we're makings,

122
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.650
we're making sure that that thing is full and strong.

123
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.970
<v 1>You imagine must have so excited when Poer caught him in that guillo team.</v>

124
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.890
Cause Poer had him in a guillo team. PO's a black belt too. Yeah.

125
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.570
He had him in the gua team. Yeah. Who's a good.

126
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.650
<v 0>One too. You know what tight anybody can lose. You know what I mean?</v>

127
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.440
Cab's not invincible. There's some fights where he'd look like you said human.

128
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.800
Yeah. You know, and we watch those fights and we, we see, we see where, um,

129
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.680
you know, uh, he has, um, you know, uh,

130
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.000
not quite an yeah. They're exactly.

131
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.320
<v 1>The big thing too is Tony's cardio is just ridiculous. Yeah. Second, none.</v>

132
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.030
Second to none cardio. It's so good. Literally ridiculous. Yeah.

133
00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:45.990
Cause he'll have a crazy, super high, fast pace fight. And then you look at him,

134
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:49.070
he's not even breathing heavy. His stomach's not even moving. He loves it.

135
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.430
<v 0>And, and he, he throws elbows more than your average UFC fighter. Oh yeah.</v>

136
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.830
He like elbows are like, I think, I.

137
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.980
<v 1>Think depend what KIB wants to do. Um, no matter what happens in this fight, I,</v>

138
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.660
I, I see KIB and Tony fighting a few times.

139
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.580
I think it's one of those classic kind of, Hey, who knows? Trilogy ones, man,

140
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.700
who knows? They match up so well together. Just please gods of war.

141
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.580
Get them together in April. Well, I saw Tony jump over tires. It's old. It's oh,

142
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:18.660
is that old? Oh, thank God. Yeah.

143
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.450
<v 0>Man. There's this is awesome. Tony meme where it says where they,</v>

144
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.770
they show this guy from like,

145
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.330
it's like in the middle of a canyon in some like forest and there there's

146
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:30.890
like a tight he's like walking a tight rope.

147
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.450
It's like some dude is walking a tight rope with like a balancing pole.

148
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.810
You know what I mean? It's something like Tony when Tony trains or something.

149
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:42.800
It's &lt;laugh&gt; cause he, he he's he's extreme. And um, that's what makes.

150
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.880
<v 1>Him who he is. Yeah. What kind of wacky is he doing when you're training with.</v>

151
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.760
<v 0>Him? Dude, he's got, you know, he's man, he's got this.</v>

152
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.400
I don't even know how to explain it. I don't even wanna talk about him.

153
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.760
Can't really can't either.

154
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.480
<v 1>Can he give up secrets? He's.</v>

155
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.600
<v 0>Just on top of like the latest.</v>

156
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.960
<v 1>The latest, you know, just the latest, uh, training, instincts,</v>

157
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.160
training reaction. He's super into like, like. The NBA would, uh,

158
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:09.520
be doing like what? Um, uh, I can't even explain it.

159
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:12.040
You're not trying to get away. Are you not supposed to talk about it?

160
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.790
I don't wanna talk about it. Okay. I don't. I get it. Yeah. After the fight.

161
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.110
Yeah.

162
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.750
<v 0>Please tell. All you need to know is Dar elbows.</v>

163
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.190
<v 1>Poster. Dar elbows is great. That poster's amazing.</v>

164
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.510
Although Tony is taller. It's weird. They have it like that.

165
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.830
Tony's actually way taller. It's quite a bit taller. Yeah. It's weird.

166
00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:31.470
They have mine. He's got super long.

167
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.990
<v 0>Arms too. That's why it's a Dar those arms dude.</v>

168
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.860
Those aren't those Dar is coming from everywhere.

169
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.580
<v 1>That poster's amazing. Put that poster up again. That poster's dope.</v>

170
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.660
That poster gives you a hard on that's all you need. Oh dude, look at that.

171
00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:47.980
That's the best fight in the UFC. Go make it. So it's a normal size.

172
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.350
Yeah. Look at that. They got that one. Right? They got that one. Perfect.

173
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.660
That to me is the greatest fight ever in the light, the lightweight division.

174
00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.220
A hundred percent. The greatest fight ever.

175
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.140
<v 0>Arguably arguably greatest fight ever. Yes. Yes. Come on. Yes.</v>

176
00:10:02.141 --> 00:10:05.180
That's the greatest ground in pounder, right?

177
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:08.580
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; took out Connor choked his out, everybody up.

178
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.940
And then here comes Tony,

179
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.900
the wild enigma coming at you from a thousand

180
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:16.570
different angles. That.

181
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.650
<v 1>Fight gives me chills, man.</v>

182
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.290
Just stop and think about what Tony's been able to do to people too. Like,

183
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:23.610
think about what he did to cowboy. He just,

184
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.450
he just takes guys that look like world class fighters and he makes em look like

185
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:31.050
they have no business being in there with em, thinking about pets. Yeah. Josh.

186
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.210
<v 0>Josh Thompson. You know what I mean? That was a great fight too. Kevin Leeman.</v>

187
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.560
DEOs do you remember when he threw that spinning elbow and then he threw another

188
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:43.200
one right after nuts. He's so creative. Yeah. That's his, that's one of his, uh,

189
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:47.280
that's one of his most powerful weapons is that he does,

190
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.480
he does not hesitate to pull the trigger. He's never cautious. You know,

191
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:53.200
a lot of guys, you know, you hear about these guys,

192
00:10:53.201 --> 00:10:57.240
like the goal is to take what he does in the gym, out to the room.

193
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.590
That's the goal. If we could do that, he's gonna be unstoppable. Tony,

194
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:01.590
that from day one,

195
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:04.510
he was he'll anything he does in the gym he's gonna do in the ring.

196
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.510
No hesitation. You know what I mean?

197
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:09.230
There's he doesn't ever hold back on pulling the trigger.

198
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.150
<v 1>It's a very exciting fight. It's the.</v>

199
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.310
<v 0>Best fight. You spinning elbows in a row. It's nuts.</v>

200
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:15.830
Has anybody ever done that nuts?

201
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.620
<v 1>I mean, probably you, but no one at a level that Tony's fighting at. Yeah.</v>

202
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.700
<v 0>I don't think in the UFC anybody's throwing two,</v>

203
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.420
I can't think of elbows man in a row. He don't give a, dude. He.
