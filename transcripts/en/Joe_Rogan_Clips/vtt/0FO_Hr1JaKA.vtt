00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.800
<v 0>Process.</v>

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.600
I believe because things are meant to get hard after they come outta of course

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.480
quickly. And it didn't exactly, man. It's like watching porn hard, fast.

4
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.280
<v 1>You're eating some mush that doesn't turn into mold.</v>

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.200
<v 0>I, uh, I went vegan post heart attack, but I'm certainly, it's not a ethical,</v>

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.800
uh, thing. Like my kid's vegan cuz she's like, I love animals,

7
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.590
but I want vegan cuz they were like, you know, if you go PlantBased,

8
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:26.310
you've got a really great chance of dropping your cholesterol.

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.030
And my kid had been bugging me to go vegan for like three years and stuff and

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:31.310
not, but honestly not bugging me.

11
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:33.390
She would just make comments every once in a while. Like not your mom,

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870
not your milk whenever I was drinking milk and like that. Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670
So after the heart attack,

14
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.260
nutritionist was in the hospital room with me and going like a hundred that

15
00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:43.980
blockage man, you definitely time to change your diet. I was like, yeah,

16
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.900
you're right. And what were you eating before? Like just,

17
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.780
not even like everything.

18
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540
<v 1>But you lost a lot of weight and when you lost a lot of weight,</v>

19
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.220
I remember you were doing a lot of juicing.

20
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.300
<v 0>Yeah. I was doing a, a bit of that.</v>

21
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:59.220
Which vegetable juices they've since told me is not good because

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.970
you're supposed to tribute the juice of whatever with the fiber mm-hmm

23
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.930
&lt;affirmative&gt; while eating the fruit and stuff. This juicing thing.

24
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.210
<v 1>Is it? So it depends on what juice, I mean it,</v>

25
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:12.850
vegetable juice is not really an issue, but, but it is but.

26
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.490
<v 0>Lot content sugar content. Yeah. Like,</v>

27
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.890
like I'm part of now I'm a weight Watchers, ambassador.

28
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.560
<v 1>Even people that, um, believe that like they, they like vegetable juices.</v>

29
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.480
They say that you really better off with like a vegetable smoothie, right?

30
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.200
Like we, you get the fiber. It is.

31
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.400
<v 0>All about the smoothie. It keeps some of the fiber in it. The, all the,</v>

32
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.840
and all that jazz, you go buy points and like that. Right? Some like you can,

33
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120
if you eat a banana, no points.

34
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.360
If you juice a banana or blend a banana,

35
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.470
then it as points because then it's no longer about the fiber.

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.390
It's all about the sugar.

37
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.350
<v 1>At that point. Eggs don't have any points anymore. Huh?</v>

38
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.590
<v 0>No. They took points away from like eggs, Turkey and chicken,</v>

39
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.790
which broke my heart. Cuz I used to love Turkey and chicken.

40
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.830
Then I realized I didn't love Turkey and chicken as much as I thought,

41
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.710
like I went on in order to, after the heart attack. Um,

42
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.980
I read, uh, well I listened to it on tape. Um,

43
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.140
and not even on tape digitally, uh,

44
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.500
Penn Gillette's book Presto about how he lost a hundred pounds after his heart

45
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.140
episode. And it's a fantastic book. I'm sure. You know, did he ever.

46
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.180
<v 1>Set, hit a similar issue? Like a heart attack? Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.580
<v 0>But he didn't have a heart attack. They were like,</v>

48
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:23.500
you're on the verge and they were gonna give him a bunch of bypasses and then a

49
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.330
into his was like, instead all that.

50
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:29.130
Why don't you just try eating radically different? I can propose a way for you.

51
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.850
Ray C Croney he, he has a diet called just sides. And so in Penn's book,

52
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.130
Presto, he details how Ray was like for the first two weeks. Just eat potatoes,

53
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:38.931
nothing but potatoes.

54
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.210
You have as many as you want eat as many potatoes as you want,

55
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.610
but can't put anything on him. You can't fry him.

56
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.960
It's just bake the potato and eat it, eat everything.

57
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.320
And you can have nine if you're in a sitin,

58
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:52.560
but you can't put any butter on 'em no salt, nothing just flat out potatoes.

59
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.800
So it's but for me, that sounded for me. your diet. Well,

60
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.440
I just come off the heart attack. So I'm like, I'd rather not die. Right?

61
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.720
So I'll try. So.

62
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 1>How many weeks have you just potatoes? Two, two weeks.</v>

63
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.080
<v 0>Weeks straight up. Just potatoes did eat. 'em raw, not raw, like on cooked.</v>

64
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:11.560
You can bake, but you can't use anything to cook. Em,

65
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.320
you can't wrap in tinvoil with butter and salt or anything like that. Just.

66
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.200
<v 1>Flat up plain. You just baked them and then ate em. You must have been pour as.</v>

67
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.960
That's.

68
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.670
<v 0>What happens. A trick of the diet, at least in my estimation is that, um,</v>

69
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.630
you you're allowed to eat as many potatoes you want. Right?

70
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:26.870
And you think you like potatoes.

71
00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:29.630
When I was reading Penn's book or rather listening to Penn's book, I was like,

72
00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:33.070
oh my God, I can do that. Like I, I dig potatoes.

73
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.310
And then you realize you don't like potatoes as much as you like butter and salt

74
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.700
and milk and everything that goes into like mashed and stuff.

75
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.260
So it's in the beginning.

76
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.500
There's a sense of satiety because potatoes have some girth to and stuff,

77
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.140
but they're mostly water. So it's an excellent diuretic.

78
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:52.140
So you're like a race horse. And that's dropping weight.

79
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.420
Like the more water outta your body.

80
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.260
<v 1>Some good vitamins in the skin as well. Absolutely. A lot of potassium, right?</v>

81
00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:57.780
Vitamins.

82
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.420
<v 0>Some people like when I was telling 'em, you know the most,</v>

83
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.210
when you tell people what you're doing, you know,

84
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.450
everyone's got their advice about how to diet and.

85
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.570
And when I was talking about I'm doing this potato diet people,

86
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.650
you can't eat potatoes. It's carbs, man. That'll, nuts's too much. It's bad and.

87
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.530
But in two weeks of eating, nothing but potatoes, I lost 19 pounds.

88
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:14.690
Just like that. 19 pounds.

89
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.690
<v 1>Just dropped off. Wow.</v>

90
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.050
<v 0>And a lot of it water, weight. Absolutely.</v>

91
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.720
But at the same time it taught me something more. I, and then like,

92
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.800
I hate potatoes. It taught me to fast mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

93
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.000
it taught me to like now I eat a meal a day.

94
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.920
I don't eat in the morning when I get up,

95
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.520
I don't listen to the propaganda of like,

96
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.880
you gotta eat a breakfast and like that. Not at all.

97
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.320
My body has enough stored energy.

98
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.280
I don't need to eat eggs and orange juice in order to feel good in the morning.

99
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.750
I just have to wait my body to be like, nothing's coming in great.

100
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:45.310
We'll hook over to the stored energy and like that. And I.

101
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.470
<v 1>Got a lot of that. So you're doing like intermittent fasting.</v>

102
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.390
Is that what you doing? It's.

103
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.710
<v 0>It's not so much intermittent.</v>

104
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:53.590
It's like I eat once a day and then some days if I'm like, yeah,

105
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.390
I don't feel the need to eat. Like you go through it.

106
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.790
You hit a wall every once in a while, like generally about nine o'clock, 8 39.

107
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.700
I get a first Pang of hunger. My instincts are, are like quick. Fix it.

108
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.540
And then I remember like just in 10 minutes, it's gonna pass.

109
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.340
And then in 10 minutes, absolutely it pass.

110
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.220
<v 1>You talking about nine in the morning. Yeah. So, um, you're eating one meal,</v>

111
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.380
like typically dinner, uh, generally.

112
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 0>About three o'clock in the afternoon. And.</v>

113
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.460
<v 1>Then you go a long time before you eat again. Yeah. Yeah. Dude.</v>

114
00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:23.770
That's the way to eat. A lot of people think that's the way to eat. I.

115
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.090
<v 0>I think so smarter people than I like Ray who created the just sides,</v>

116
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.450
diet and Penn who followed the diet and stuff and.

117
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.130
<v 1>Led to it. They do the same thing. One meal a day.</v>

118
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.690
<v 0>Uh, Penn, not. So I, I, I can't, I'm trying to,</v>

119
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.490
I don't think he's down to one meal a day.

120
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.810
I think he just eats better than I do.

121
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.480
Like he was able to keep up up with Ray's diet. I couldn't,

122
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:47.200
after the two weeks it was like, okay, now eat corn. And I was like,

123
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.480
I've never eaten corn in my life.

124
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.600
<v 1>Wait a minute. He's telling you just eat corn. No, he.</v>

125
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.440
<v 0>Was saying to add corn to the diet and they were adding more things after the</v>

126
00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:57.080
first two weeks. It wasn't like potatoes now, just corn now this, oh,

127
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.080
so this just sides.

128
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.600
<v 1>That's his hook is that you're eating the sides. Essentially.</v>

129
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.080
<v 0>You're eating everything. That's kind of, it's all plant- based and stuff. Hmm.</v>

130
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.040
And so I couldn't, I was hoping that I could, you know,

131
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.120
go the distance and be a vegetable guy. I hate vegetables.

132
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.640
And so I had to figure out a way to be vegan, hate vegetables, hated so much.

133
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.000
How.

134
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.950
<v 1>Could you be a and hate vegetables?</v>

135
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.870
<v 0>You find a very thin corridor in which you know,</v>

136
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.670
to live and exists.

137
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.390
<v 1>Scooping up thats a towfu.</v>

138
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.270
<v 0>Pretty much, uh, eating Pinto beans, eating black beans.</v>

139
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.390
<v 1>Good source of carbohydrates. Right?</v>

140
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.410
<v 0>Um, what else?</v>

141
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.750
You know what I've fallen in love with and never ate before in my life are chick

142
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.520
peas.

143
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.020
<v 1>Chick are great, such.</v>

144
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.180
<v 0>A great go-to snack, full of protein.</v>

145
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.300
And in vegan comfort food cooking,

146
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.580
they use it as a versatile ingredient. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so like,

147
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:50.540
if you go to one of my favorite restaurants in town is crossroads.

148
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.220
They got like this, uh, they got Travis bark's place, right?

149
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.330
<v 1>Is that the, I believe it is. I believe Travis bark or the drummer. He, uh,</v>

150
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.170
he that's his place that I believe so. Pretty sure, they.

151
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.850
<v 0>Got a meatball sub there, dude. I would I'd suck a Dick for it' so good.</v>

152
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.650
It's to be and immersively, they don't make you do that. They just make you pay.

153
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:10.050
That's.

154
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.010
<v 1>Very sweet of them. It's a good, it is a good business model.</v>

155
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.570
It's supposed to be a very good place like it. One of the best places.

156
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.000
<v 0>Fantastic. Fantastic. This meatball sub's Travis's place tastes alog meatball.</v>

157
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.800
<v 1>About about five miles from here.</v>

158
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.680
Maybe a little bit more called follow your heart.

159
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:24.160
Have you ever been to that place? Yes.

160
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.920
<v 0>I have. That's where I too met Ray, uh, to talk about the, the diet the.</v>

161
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.880
<v 1>First time. Yeah. They have some killer pancakes, man.</v>

162
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.721
I don't know what they're doing.

163
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:34.840
What kind of voodoo they're doing to make a vegan pancake takes that good.

164
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.600
In New York.

165
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 0>They got a place in Brooklyn called champs diner,</v>

166
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:41.910
which is also of like all plant-based vegan food, but they do comfort food.

167
00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:43.550
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, you know, like you can get a,

168
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.510
like an impossible burger or beyond burger bread or like you're eating meatballs

169
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:50.750
and you think about it. You're like, all right, the bread is most of it.

170
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.070
The sauce is the next biggest part and meatballs themselves.

171
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:56.350
Aren't really that packed with meat.

172
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.990
It's much more breading than meat and stuff. So I,

173
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.620
you have to do is find something that'll stand in for the meat.

174
00:08:01.621 --> 00:08:04.700
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; drench it and marinara sauce and put it between a,

175
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.140
a nice soft roll. And they use like RI Ricota like, uh, cashew,

176
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.300
RI Ricota to like kind of finish it off. It is bliss dude. Now, you know,

177
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:16.580
it's just like, it's vegan comfort food. So you can't do that every day. Right.

178
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.290
But it's nice to know that if you're ever like a, I miss real food,

179
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.530
I want to eat a animal.

180
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.410
They can hand you something that's like close to the approximate.

181
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.570
Now the good news, cuz I know a lot of people like veganism.

182
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.970
And you're absolutely right. It's no fun for me at least.

183
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.090
But after a month of plant based, uh,

184
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.970
I was on a series of medications after the heart attack and still am.

185
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.400
And it was on a full dose of lipid tour, which is a, you know,

186
00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:44.600
cholesterol cutter and stuff like that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so my doctor,

187
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.280
I was telling him about this potato diet and he's like, I don't trust this.

188
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:49.080
He's going. I wanna do your labs. I wanna do your meds.

189
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:51.200
Gimme some of your blood. So he takes me. He's like,

190
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:52.880
I gotta make sure you're getting all the nutrition. He's like,

191
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:54.640
you can't get it off from a potato. I'm sorry.

192
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.880
So he did my labs and came back and he was like, you're fantastic.

193
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.440
He's going nutrients wise. You're great. Everything across the board's great.

194
00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:03.480
Except for your cholesterol. I was like,

195
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.080
well I did just have a heart attack and he goes, no,

196
00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:06.840
your cholesterol's on the toilet. He's going.

197
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.280
So I need you to break your Lipitor in half. He's going, you,

198
00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.960
you can't take that much Lipitor anymore. So he's like,

199
00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:13.960
what have you done different? I was like, I'm just eating potatoes. He.

200
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.070
<v 1>Goes, so you cholesterol dropped so radically that he was worried.</v>

201
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.710
<v 0>Yeah. And enough to take me off of my half, half my prescription, when is.</v>

202
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.470
<v 1>See, I, I don't understand enough about cholesterol levels. This is what.</v>

203
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.710
<v 0>They told me. So recently that I found fascinating. I thought I was like,</v>

204
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.510
is this Lipitor? It's gonna eat up the cholesterol. He goes, no,

205
00:09:31.511 --> 00:09:34.070
it's in your system forever. And I was really, and he goes, yeah,

206
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:36.940
it can loosen it up, move it about, but then we have to be careful,

207
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.740
make sure it's loose and soft. And,

208
00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:40.780
and gloal the cholesterols in your system forever.

209
00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:44.740
So it doesn't go into your brain. Oh Jesus dude. Uh, if hard pieces like,

210
00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:45.660
you know, I don't know if, uh,

211
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.460
you ever pull like grit off your teeth after you've eaten or something like

212
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:53.260
that. Compacted, you know, that's plaque technically, I guess,

213
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.970
but that's kind of. That's up in your, your veins. When that gets hard,

214
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.890
it gets super hard. Like the, the, the cholesterol that was blocking up,

215
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:04.810
my L a D my man had to drill through it to get the stent in there.

216
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.650
<v 1>And you keep that cholesterol forever.</v>

217
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.410
<v 0>Now, I, I can't say that a hundred percent,</v>

218
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.010
but that's the way it was communicated to me. Cuz I thought I was like,

219
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.010
this magic drug will eat up the cholesterol. That goes, no,

220
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.850
we have to be very careful with the cholesterol because it moves throughout

221
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.440
system. Geez. So I guess maybe eventually it moves out of your system,

222
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.400
but if it's in your blood system, right,

223
00:10:21.401 --> 00:10:24.080
there's a chance that it goes up near your brain eventually.

224
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.960
So maybe that's what they're trying to keep that.

225
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.200
<v 1>Yeah. All idiots talking about medical stuff. I know but's's.</v>

226
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.400
<v 0>All out right now. We can't, you can't be an expert on everything, Joe.</v>

227
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:34.520
Sometimes you have to like take shots in the dark.

228
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.360
<v 1>Yeah. So, um, for.</v>

229
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.191
<v 0>Know your audience,</v>

230
00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:40.030
you know the audience sitting there right now going like this irritates me.

231
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.350
If they're not gonna speak truthudes and hard facts, &lt;laugh&gt; don't.

232
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.310
<v 1>They understand medical science. We.</v>

233
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.270
<v 0>Don't, we don't. That's.</v>

234
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.910
<v 1>Why we wouldnt enterta. Um, but when you are, um,</v>

235
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.830
or you you're getting a full blood panel done and all these different things,

236
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:54.910
they're checking all your, your writing. I've also become.

237
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.590
<v 0>Yeah. And ive become the guy that does.</v>

238
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.460
<v 1>Were algae and not.</v>

239
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.860
<v 0>Algae, but there were two pills that this, uh, Ray turned me on to this doctor.</v>

240
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.300
I bet you know his name, but his name escapes me who formulated this, uh,

241
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.020
these are the nutrients you need.

242
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.420
I guarantee you've probably talked to this guy, his name escapes me,

243
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.860
but Ray was like, get these supplements. They'll cover everything he's going,

244
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:18.290
cuz you're no. Or a meat eater.

245
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.970
Anything you need that would come outta meat comes out of this. But you know,

246
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.610
it was kind of explained to me when I was like, I don't know,

247
00:11:24.611 --> 00:11:27.290
like my kid was going, you could do it. Dad. I'm like kiddo.

248
00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:30.450
Like we were raised differently. Like I granted, I,

249
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.810
I wasn't raised with flaming Yon.

250
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.730
I did eat steakum through most of my childhood, but that's kind of a meat.

251
00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:39.320
Like it's tough to separate from something that you have lived with for so

252
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.080
long. And she was like, you gave up cigarettes. And I was like, oh alright,

253
00:11:42.081 --> 00:11:42.914
you're right and stuff.

254
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.320
So it's nice to be able to go to places where you can eat food.

255
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:50.440
That's not just like grass and roots and can and like.

256
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.640
<v 1>That. What did you eliminate? This is what I'm want to concentrate on because I,</v>

257
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.593
I cheese.

258
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.040
<v 0>Dairy, all dairyies cheese. So cheese milk. I, I was drinking, no.</v>

259
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.600
A two gallons of milk a day. So that one, yeah,

260
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.200
that might have been part of the reason I wound up having a a attack.

261
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.800
So milk went away. Cheese went away. Um,

262
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.680
animal food products went away. So no burgers. I wasn't a big burgers guy,

263
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.110
but I did like burgers. And what about bread? Bread, pasta. Bread can stay.

264
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.230
Pasta can stay. Pasta can be, they can stay. Pasta can be vegan. But I mean,

265
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:20.230
it shouldn't that you shouldn't overdo it. Right.

266
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:21.670
You can't eat a ton of bread and stuff.

267
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.430
<v 1>Right? You shouldn't. No. So that's just.</v>

268
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.510
<v 0>And honestly they prefer a went away. Yeah. Like most doctors aren't like,</v>

269
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.790
Hey man, eat all the bread you want. Right. You know,

270
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:32.950
it's it's as part of weight Watchers, it,

271
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.900
it has a value to it that you can eat bread,

272
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.780
but it takes up like a quarter of the points you can have. Is it harder.

273
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.300
<v 1>To do weight Watchers as a vegan? Is it tricky?</v>

274
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.140
<v 0>No. Interestingly enough weight Watchers is so simple because they, the app,</v>

275
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.540
it's all app based now. Like I was part of it when I was a kid, like at age 14,

276
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.820
I was part of weight Watchers.

277
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.890
And I was like the lone male in the group and stuff.

278
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:01.050
Now it's so technologically based that if you're in a food store and

279
00:13:01.051 --> 00:13:03.250
you're like, oh, I want those,

280
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.810
but I wonder how many points you just scan the barcode and it tells you,

281
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.650
and so you can enter things like Pento beans, boom.

282
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.650
It tells you there's zero points. So anything you enter,

283
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.320
I don't really have a value for even fast food chains.

284
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:19.480
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it's, it's shockingly easy to use.

285
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.920
Take weight Watchers outta the equation is being vegan difficult. Yes.

286
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.920
Like I watched my kid go through it where I'm like, you have no choices.

287
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.200
You're really limited to the places you can go in life and go out to eat.

288
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.630
But if it's a choice between winding up and the emergency room again and you

289
00:13:36.631 --> 00:13:38.590
know, eating whatever I want to eat,

290
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:43.190
which is what I did for 47 years and then wound up nearly dying closest.

291
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.750
I ever came to death. I'm okay to go plant based for, for a while.

292
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.870
Like I told the kid, I'm doing it for at least a year.

293
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:50.630
And if I can live like this, I I'll keep going.

294
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.670
<v 1>What? So you cut out, uh, milk, cheese,</v>

295
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.620
animal products and sugar. So all.

296
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.260
<v 0>Your meat, you cut out sugar, sugar. I cut out prior, prior to this.</v>

297
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.460
<v 1>Now' when I first met you. You were a candy junkie.</v>

298
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.020
<v 0>Yes. Oh my God. And look, I'm still a candy junk eat heart.</v>

299
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.220
I just can't vibe anymore. Right. I'll always be a candy junkie.

300
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:11.060
I'm I'm a dry drunk right now. I'm just like,

301
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.660
I' so eat all the candy if you presented it, but.

302
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.130
<v 1>Not, it was mostly the dairy and in the meat.</v>

303
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.730
<v 0>That, that I had to say goodbye. Big.</v>

304
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.610
<v 1>You cut out. Yes. That was the most, the, the biggest percentage of your diet.</v>

305
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.650
<v 0>Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Especially dairy. Now what about exercise?</v>

306
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.970
Exercise after the heart attack,

307
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:29.610
they don't want you to do for like the first month.

308
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.770
So this is only three months ago that the heart attack happened.

309
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.530
So once the doctor gave me the Akay,

310
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.160
then I was back to walking the dog up the hill the way I always did. Um,

311
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.720
I haven't gone harder than that. Um, and,

312
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.760
and I don't honestly like I'm so lazy at heart. &lt;laugh&gt; that? I,

313
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.880
it doesn't like, I know some people are like,

314
00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:50.920
I love getting out there and it helps me think. And my blood's not me.

315
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.000
I can think just fine at home'm smoking a joint sitting there,

316
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.800
watching Colbert or something like that. That's.

317
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.560
<v 1>What you and I separate. Right? You like.</v>

318
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.440
<v 0>The physical, like the, you know, you,</v>

319
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.200
you like the rush you're you're like the adrenaline junkies who have kind of

320
00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.280
raised their level. And so it's not enough for you to just sit in one place.

321
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.910
Like you could do this and shocking that you'll do for three, three hours.

322
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.510
But then after this you probably do something like raola bear knife, hunt, uh,

323
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.670
of species. Do any of.

324
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.750
<v 1>Those things. But I do, uh, I run Hills. Is that what you do? Yeah.</v>

325
00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:24.030
I run Hills in the morning. That's how far a couple miles is the most I do.

326
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.190
Cause I'm it's real steep stuff. Do you listen to anything or are you today?

327
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.870
I did today. I cheated. I cheat when I listen to things,

328
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.340
I think it's cheating music. Why ISN' cheating music.

329
00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:35.300
You're supposed to be alone with yourdaughter. Cause you're supposed to be, uh,

330
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.180
in a meditative state where you're just pushing yourself at a certain pace.

331
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.740
And when you're listening to something, especially something cool,

332
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.940
it distracts you to the point where you hear how heavy you're breathing,

333
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.980
but you don't think negatively about it cuz you're thinking about whatever the

334
00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:49.740
music you're listening to is you like, it's really interesting cuz it's,

335
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.410
it's a nice trick cuz you can actually, uh,

336
00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:55.610
work harder and not be bothered by it. Right? Cause you're,

337
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:58.970
you're so tuned into the music that you listen to or whatever it is,

338
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:01.970
you're really captivated with that. You can keep pushing.

339
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.690
But most of the time I like to do it where I don't hear.

340
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.890
I just hear the pounding of my footsteps and my breathing.

341
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.240
And also I have a little logical fear of mountain lions. &lt;affirmative&gt;.
