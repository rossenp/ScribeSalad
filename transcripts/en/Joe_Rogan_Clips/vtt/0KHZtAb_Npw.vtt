00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.920
When you make the title of this book, talking to strangers, are,

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.320
are you, do you have a goal that you're trying to achieve?

4
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:15.760
Are you trying to illuminate certain aspect of communication?

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.720
Are you trying to highlight issues that people have had with these stories?

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.790
Like the Michael Brown story or.

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.150
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to,</v>

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.510
I wanted to sort of start with the premise of why are we so bad

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.590
at, you know,

10
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:36.350
like I tell the story in a book of the Larry Nasser case at Michigan state,

11
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:39.990
which one's that that's the guy, remember the doctor for the gymnastics team?

12
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.420
Oh yeah. It turns out to have been sexually molest pedophile. Yeah.

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.283
Huge pedophile.

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.740
So there you have a case where everyone thinks they know this guy,

15
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:50.580
he's their friend, he's this gifted doctor.

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.340
The parents are willingly bringing their kids to, to be treated by him.

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.500
The parents are in the room while he is abusing

18
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.810
their kids and they don't see it.

19
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.650
The kids are saying something weird happen and the parents are dismissing it.

20
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.931
So I wanted to,

21
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.090
that's a good example of a phenomenon that I wanted to try and explain,

22
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:12.370
which is how is that possible?

23
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.010
How can we think we know someone and be so completely, um,

24
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.760
wrong? How can you take your kid to a doctor and think that doc is the greatest

25
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.600
possible doctor. And in fact,

26
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.480
what he's doing is abusing your child in front of you, right?

27
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.040
And that's a very similar kind of problem to Bernie Madoff.

28
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.080
People invested their life savings with this guy. Not,

29
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.320
not little old ladies in Dubuque, sophisticated savvy,

30
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.310
incredibly intelligent investors handed over millions of dollars to this

31
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.830
guy who was not even tr I mean,

32
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.590
the Madoff fraud was so outrageous. He didn't even bother to,

33
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.230
he didn't even put it in T billslls. I mean, he just spent it.

34
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.590
It was just like crazy what's T bills.

35
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.650
<v 0>Treasury bills.</v>

36
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.580
<v 1>Oh, I mean, he, he wasn't even, he was, he was a 100%,</v>

37
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.820
uh, sociopath fraud. Yes.

38
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.820
And people over the course of 20 years wrote check after,

39
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.060
check after, check after, check to him thinking was this brilliant investor,

40
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.820
you know, it's like, that's a puzzle. That's what I wanted to get at.

41
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.250
<v 0>People did recognize that something was wrong. Right? Yeah. There,</v>

42
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:30.050
there were financial analysts that were saying that this doesn't make sense.

43
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.050
<v 1>A few of them, but it's funny. There's a, the, my favorite story,</v>

44
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.390
um, on the,

45
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.410
in the Madoff chapter is the greatest hedge fund in the world is Renaissance

46
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:40.931
technologies.

47
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:45.880
These are the guys out in long island who have had like 30% returns

48
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.840
for 25 years. They're like all PhD are, you know,

49
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.040
AI genius, literally geniuses.

50
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.120
And they found themselves years before badoff was busted.

51
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.280
They found themselves with, I think,

52
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:03.560
$30 million in a Madoff fund because of some complicated transaction

53
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.800
and they're all geniuses. So they look at what Madoff's doing. And they're like,

54
00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:10.240
mm, that don't look good. Like that doesn't make any sense to me. And so like,

55
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.060
what should we do?

56
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.120
We have 30 million stake in a fund and we don't understand what the guy's doing.

57
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.240
And you would think logically they would sell their stake.

58
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.350
They don't cause it's returning. No, it, in fact,

59
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:25.630
it's not even returning that their own legit returns are twice.

60
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.630
His illegitimate returns really they're making,

61
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.710
they actually make the point that his returns are really low for us.

62
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.230
Like there's no reason for us to keep their money &lt;laugh&gt; but they don't sell

63
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.310
what. So that's what I was trying to understand. Like they can't even, you know,

64
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.260
there's this notion I talk book is called default to truth,

65
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:44.020
which is this idea it's from a, a researcher called Tim Levine,

66
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.780
which is as human beings, we're trusting engines.

67
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.580
We are evolved to give people the benefit of the doubt.

68
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.940
And once you understand that and why do we do that? Because it's the right move.

69
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:57.860
99% of the time, most people are being truthful.

70
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.730
And if you have as your strategy, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

71
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.370
I'm gonna believe what people say. It makes you a fantastic friend,

72
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.130
a wonderful person to work with. It means that you can, you know,

73
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.570
skate through the world with a minimum of, of fuss. If you're a, the paranoid,

74
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:14.130
person's a person, whoses life is a nightmare, right?

75
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:16.210
Because they are suspicious of everything that moves.

76
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.680
So we evolved to be trusting engine because that makes

77
00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:25.120
your life easier. That's the best part of human people. Wanna mate with you?

78
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:28.400
Like if you wanna talk in evolution in terms about who passes on their genes,

79
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.640
nice people pass on their genes,

80
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.800
given the choice between having a child with a crazy suspicious,

81
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.520
paranoid person or a loving, trusting person, you choose a loving,

82
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.350
trusting person. &lt;affirmative&gt; a hundred percent of the time.

83
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.030
So multi out times, a million years of human history,

84
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:47.510
you realize trusting genes,

85
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.750
beat paranoid genes every day of the week. Right? So that's what we are.

86
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:56.390
We're incredulous by, by, by evolutionary choice.

87
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.300
So those guys at, in the, uh, Renaissance months,

88
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.220
they're, they're no different. They may be smarter than the rest of us,

89
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:09.380
but they're not constructed differently. Their inclination is to believe people.

90
00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:12.020
And they're like, wow, I don't know. Guy says, he's a good investor, man.

91
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.980
Why not? Let's hang onto to it. See what happens. Mm. Right.

92
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.860
Mm-hmm that's their motive. They don't, they don't, you don't get to,

93
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.660
to run a organization as successful as Renaissance' technologies.

94
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.410
If you're some, is he paranoid person, right.

95
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.930
How would you even invest in anything? If you were crazy and paranoid,

96
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.530
there was.

97
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.970
<v 0>A lot of people that were really intelligent that invested in bernieie Madoff's</v>

98
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:34.850
hedge fund too. Steven Spielberg was one of '. He lost a, a ton of money.

99
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.490
Oh yeah.

100
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.650
<v 1>I mean, look at the roster list. There isn't a,</v>

101
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.570
you cannot point to an unsophaviisticated investor on the list of people who

102
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:45.160
lost them on is money from every one of them is smart. That's so strange.

103
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.520
It's so great. It is crazy. Like, think about it. Like, and by the way,

104
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.960
getting a decent return in the market is super easy. You, you go to, you know,

105
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.200
Vanguard and they, you know, they'll give you the market return.

106
00:05:58.201 --> 00:06:00.360
You're in your, it's not that hard. But these people are like,

107
00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:04.040
they wanted to do something fancier and they, and that's what happened.

108
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.583
<v 0>Well, he,</v>

109
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.880
when you realize what a sociopath actually was is in the

110
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:12.440
interviews after he is caught,

111
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.680
or he is demanding certain things and complaining about certain things,

112
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.190
he doesn't seem to have any remorse. Got it. And he wants better treatment.

113
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.470
He wants better food. He doesn't seem to have any remorse that he's, you know,

114
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:27.310
literally robbed people of their retirement. Yeah. Yeah. Ruined the,

115
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.990
the last part of their lives,

116
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.950
where they thought they were gonna have a considerable sum of money to sit back

117
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.310
and just mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; enjoy their grandchildren. No.

118
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.910
Now they're broke now. Now they're poor. Yeah.

119
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.420
Now they have to figure out a way to get by and eat. He doesn't give a.

120
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.340
<v 1>He does. He doesn't. In fact, what's weird.</v>

121
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:46.100
There's so many things weird about the Madoff case. Um,

122
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.340
one of them is we forget that he doesn't get caught. He turns himself in.

123
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.180
Right. And he turns himself in because, uh,

124
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.370
not because he's screwing up, but as he quote unquote, so good.

125
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.330
Cause remember the financial crisis hits in 2008 and his clients are

126
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:09.330
losing so much money on their legit investments that they go to

127
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:11.290
madup and say, can I have some of my money back from you?

128
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:16.090
I gotta pay off all the stuff I've done. That it's gone sour. So like in effect,

129
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.480
no one ever caught him. He gets caught by a once in a,

130
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.020
you know,

131
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.600
one in a million circumstance where he's the only one making any money for his

132
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.400
clients. So they come after him. My point is, if you,

133
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.600
if you're totally rational and you look at this,

134
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.400
you say here's a guy who managed to bamboozle the most sophisticated people in

135
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:38.480
the world to the tuna, billions of dollars for 25 years.

136
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.590
He only gets caught because we had a once in a lifetime financial meltdown.

137
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.510
Isn't the rational lesson of that, that we should all be Bernie Madoffs. Right.

138
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.350
He's like super easy. It's like, not that hard I could, all I have to do is,

139
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.310
you know, he dressed really nicely.

140
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.790
I get really nice office space on the east SED of Manhattan. What.

141
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.900
<v 0>What did he, he do, nothing really didn't invest in anything.</v>

142
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:05.380
He just moved other people's money around and he ran a Ponzi scheme. Well, he.

143
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.213
<v 1>Spent.</v>

144
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.820
<v 0>A lot of it. And how did his sons not catch onto this? That's a good question.</v>

145
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.220
Cause they're not being well.

146
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.900
<v 1>One of them committed suicide ever. Right. That's right. Um, and then,</v>

147
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.290
so it's an open question of how much they, how much anyone else knew. Um,

148
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.650
I, you know, the older I get,

149
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.890
the more I believe in the powers of particularly within,

150
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.530
within family denial is something.

151
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.290
Now I don't find hard to believe. Hmm. So your ability,

152
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.520
I've now heard so many stories of, you know,

153
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.600
a parent is some kind of monster and family members

154
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.840
just won't see it. They just can't bring themselves to go that.

155
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.240
So did they know something?

156
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.000
Everyone knew there was something slightly fishy in what Bernie was doing,

157
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.720
but they never went so far as to think that he was just making it.

158
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.560
<v 0>Up. So they knew something was up,</v>

159
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:03.240
but they didn't know it was a hundred percent horses.

160
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.640
<v 1>They thought that he was so there was some people thought that he actually</v>

161
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.480
had investments, but he was, there was a suspicion for example,

162
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.830
that he was front running that because he had a larger business, um,

163
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.950
uh, uh, sort of managing the,

164
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.830
the deal flow in the NASDAQ that he would get advanced word of where money was

165
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.230
flowing. And he would jump ahead of the queue,

166
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.270
buy stocks before other people did and profit off the,

167
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.150
when the stock would rise, he would just sell and profit off that difference.

168
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.420
So there was a feeling that he had a dubious kind of

169
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.140
illegitimate strategy that nonetheless legitimately made him a lot of money.

170
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.580
So people were like, well, if,

171
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:46.740
as long as he can get away with it and I could profit off it, I'm fine. Right.

172
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.140
But the truth is he wasn't doing that at all. And truth is, he was just, he was,

173
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.580
he had his, he had some Confederate in the attic of his company,

174
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.650
essentially making up trade orders from scratch. I mean,

175
00:09:57.651 --> 00:10:00.050
they were just making up. Did, did.

176
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.090
<v 0>How many people got arrested?</v>

177
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.290
<v 1>I forget. I think they took, I can't remember the exact number.</v>

178
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.010
I think they got, he had two Confederates, I think who went down with him.

179
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.210
That's it? I think it's what it was in retrospect. It's a really,

180
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.960
it's one of these crazy, it's one of these crazy. You think it, you know,

181
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:20.840
that whole institutions would've fallen. Yes. No.

182
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.280
<v 0>Did you ever hear the conversation that he had? I,</v>

183
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.520
I believe it was recorded somehow on a phone or something,

184
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:32.640
or maybe it was after he was in jail where he was talking about trying to get

185
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:36.320
money back from one of his biggest investors.

186
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.350
The guy had gotten like a billion dollars from him over the years. That's right.

187
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:41.950
That's right. That's right. Yeah. And he is like,

188
00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:45.550
you gotta give the money back and he's like, you. I'm not giving you. Yeah.

189
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.300
And you know,

190
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.550
then there's this crazy conversation where he is basically telling this guy,

191
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.590
look, you knew this was.

192
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.310
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you were making money off this and now, you know? Yeah.

193
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.790
Yeah.

194
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.260
<v 1>Its so you, so this is like the clever, so if you think about this, that guy,</v>

195
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.100
I know you exactly what you're talking about. Yeah. So,

196
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.660
so game the stew let's let's let's do a, let's do a, um, a uh,

197
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.100
a hypothetical scenario. Okay.

198
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.780
You have a friend who's an incredible salesman and has gone around Europe,

199
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.610
into Saudi Arabia and whatever, and raised a $20 million fund 20 billion fund.

200
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.170
And they're promising a 20% return a year on your investment, right?

201
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.410
So you give 'em a million, you're getting $200,000 a year back from this thing,

202
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.130
you know, it's all, but no one else does.

203
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.010
What is the rational thing for you to do?

204
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.130
The rational thing for you to do is to take your on your million dollar

205
00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:40.040
investment take the $200,000 that is made,

206
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.920
made in quotation marks every year out of the fund. So you say most people,

207
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.640
you know, when you invest in stocks, not only what you do is you check the box.

208
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.560
I want my, I want any dividends or earnings reinvested in the fund.

209
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.320
Don't check the box, take the real cash.

210
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.800
So if you're investing with this phony friend of yours for 20 years,

211
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.360
you're gonna get $200,000 a year for 20 years. That's 4 million.

212
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.480
You will make 4 million clear of your out of your

213
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.470
1 million initial investment, uh,

214
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.190
in 20 years. Right. That's smart if you know what's going on.

215
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.950
So that's what some people did with Madoff. They're like, yeah,

216
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.030
I don't know what he's doing. These returns are pretty fantastic.

217
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.190
I'm just gonna take all my earnings off the table every single year.

218
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.350
So they are the ones who,

219
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.020
the real winners of this whole thing with those people. Yeah.

220
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.820
Cause this money's not real that money's coming from other investors there's,

221
00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:38.654
nothing's being made.

222
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.020
<v 0>Actually what happens with them?</v>

223
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.700
Like if a guy does make all these millions of dollars, like that one guy he.

224
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.740
<v 1>Had to, so he had to give some of it back. Yeah.</v>

225
00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:50.380
So what happens is they appoint, remember they appoint a, um,

226
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:55.050
after the scandal breaks and made up his invest, they bring in a,

227
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.610
a kind of supervisor,

228
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.210
financial supervisor who has the power to claw back winnings from

229
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.210
money from the people who took, who took cash off the table. So,

230
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.250
but not everyone had to claw back. And the question was, how far back do we go?

231
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.170
So if you were investing,

232
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.200
if you were investing with 25 years ago and you took, you know,

233
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.280
10 million off the table between 1990 and 1993,

234
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:23.880
do you have to give that up too? Like it gets complicated also.

235
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.640
<v 0>How can you prove that he was doing the same activity back then? Exactly.</v>

236
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.863
Exactly.

237
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.933
<v 1>Oh.</v>

238
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.760
<v 0>It's gone the conversation. I,</v>

239
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.440
I really wish I could remember where I was hearing this conversation,

240
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.110
but somebody had, had recorded Madoff talking to this guy, telling him, look,

241
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:40.310
you gotta give that money back. Yeah, yeah.

242
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.670
<v 1>Yeah. My Schwab fund looks better and better all the time. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

243
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.910
<v 0>It's just so scary to me that,</v>

244
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.190
I mean finances and the stock market and all that stuff has always looked like

245
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:53.150
magic. Like what is going on there? What are they doing?

246
00:13:53.151 --> 00:13:54.070
They're moving these numbers around.

247
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:57.060
Like when you see the tick or tape it roll by like what, what is all that?

248
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.300
If you don't have any understanding of it, it's like a foreign language. Yeah.

249
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.860
And so you're hoping that all these geniuses can't be duped.

250
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.540
All these people throwing their tickets up in the air and everybody that's like,

251
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.620
go buy, sell. They all know what's going on. You don't know what's going on,

252
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.780
but Hey, there's a lot of things that you know, that they don't know.

253
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.500
And this is just how the world works. Yeah.

254
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:19.330
Turns out no turns out the people that were involved in this crazy.

255
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.570
Very difficult to understand thing. Didn't know it either. Yeah.

256
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.170
Like they barely can understand it.

257
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.650
And this guy was just stealing money in some weird way.

258
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.090
And if the stock market didn't crash,

259
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:36.010
if we didn't have some sort of a depression who knows how he might still be

260
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.000
in today.

261
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.120
<v 1>He would. So without, without the crash in 2008, there's a very,</v>

262
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:44.800
very strong possibility that Bernie Madoff would still be going gangbusters.

263
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.560
All he has to do to keep surviving is to take in enough money

264
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.880
to cover withdrawals. Yes. So there's some, like we say,

265
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:55.640
there's some portion of people who are withdrawing their winnings.

266
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.720
He just needs to make enough to get new enough new money to cover the

267
00:15:00.721 --> 00:15:01.161
withdrawals.

268
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:06.160
So he's got a 50 billion hedge fund and let's imagine there's a

269
00:15:06.161 --> 00:15:09.520
billion in withdrawals coming out every year. He's gotta raise a billion. Now,

270
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.470
if you're burning and you already have 50, it's not that hard.

271
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:13.304
You raise another.

272
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.950
And particularly because he had people all around the world and he was giving

273
00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:21.110
them these huge fees to raise money for him. So the that's the other way,

274
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:21.810
the rip,

275
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.590
the people who really made money from him were the people who had,

276
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:27.550
I forgotten what it was.

277
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:32.580
But you would be say your you're Joe,

278
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.140
the financial guy in Zurich, you have a whole bunch of wealthy European clients.

279
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.980
Bernie would let for every, for every million you raise for Bernie,

280
00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:44.060
Bernie would let you keep I forgotten what it was a hundred grand.

281
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.580
That's a nice base. That's real money. Yeah.

282
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.540
So you just kick back 900 to Bernie and keep a hundred grand and that you're

283
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.930
free and clear. No, one's claw that back. Right? Right.

284
00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:57.170
That's those guys got very, very, very well, very, very wealthy. Ooh, that's.

285
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.690
<v 0>Weird money. You're sitting in your house that stealing built.</v>

286
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:03.890
God, that's gotta be strange.

287
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.930
So what can be learned in terms of communication from the Bernie Madoff story?

288
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.193
<v 1>Well, the,</v>

289
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.800
the Bernie Madoff story and the all, you know, all of these ways,

290
00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:20.360
but this one in particular goes to this question of,

291
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.920
we really think we're good at spotting liars and we're not.

292
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.680
So virtually every profession that is invested in, you know, in,

293
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.510
in, in investigation of human beings has belief that, you know,

294
00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:37.950
we know how to figure out his likes. Yes. And the truth is nobody does.

295
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.670
And if someone tells you, they are good at spotting liars,

296
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.790
there's a 99% chance that they're lying. &lt;laugh&gt; so the,

297
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.630
the evidence that the,

298
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.430
so you could think if we did an experiment here where I had a hundred people

299
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.500
prayed through this office right now, the studio right now,

300
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.580
and every one of them made a statement in front of you and some would lying and

301
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:01.580
some would tell the truth. And I asked you, Joe, tell me who's lying.

302
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:05.900
And who's not your accuracy rate. Your success rate would be,

303
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.780
uh, 52 to 54%. In other words, slightly better than chance.

304
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.410
You might as well flip a coin, um, slightly.

305
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:16.410
But if you don't and that's not about you,

306
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:22.130
anyone in that chair watching these people parade in front of us is

307
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:24.290
gonna do a slightly bit better than chance.

308
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.250
And the reason we're slightly better than chance is there are a small fraction

309
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.650
of people who are such epically bad liars, that there's just,

310
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.280
we're not gonna lose those people. Like we, those are, are.
