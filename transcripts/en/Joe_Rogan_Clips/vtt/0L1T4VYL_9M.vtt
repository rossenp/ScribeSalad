00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 2>That just shows you what a cracker Dustin [inaudible] is the fact that max</v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:10.140
Holloway, who beats the out of Calvin cater and says, I'm the best boxer in the,

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
in the UFC. And Dustin's like, hold on, hold my hot sauce.

5
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.070
Do you not remember what the just went down? Dude.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.940
<v 0>Just hold.</v>

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.770
<v 1>On here. That's important. He's a bad. He's a bad. He really is.</v>

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.130
<v 0>He texted me after the fight because me and Theo, Theo is a big Dustin your fan.</v>

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.720
Cause we're both from Louisiana and RCI. I'm a Conner Dick rider. And so,

10
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.090
and I love Dustin I'm way closer with Dustin, but just, you know,

11
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.670
just for the show, it's fun to bet. And so I bet, uh,

12
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.240
Theo a thousand dollars cash. Whoa. So as soon as Dustin,

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.670
I don't know why thought this, as soon as he got backstage,

14
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:44.730
he must got to this phone, text me, pay Theo as money.

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.670
Like yeah. Congrats. That must.

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.820
<v 1>Have been on his head.</v>

17
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.410
<v 0>[Inaudible] it's all love, man.</v>

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.560
<v 1>I can't wait to tweet. Yeah. You can't say that with a fighter.</v>

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.410
You bet against a fighter. You can't say it. They get mad.

20
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.000
<v 0>They get mad to get personal.</v>

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.960
<v 1>They do well. They're very emotionally invested. So they should be. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.640
<v 0>What do you, what do you do with us the next.</v>

23
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.960
<v 1>Well there's two options. No, I have not.</v>

24
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:16.740
But there's the purest option with the purest options. Charles Olivera,

25
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.370
as if you're a purist, you want that fight. And I think I want that fight.

26
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.420
That should be the right thing to do.

27
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.510
If you want to make a shitload of money before Conor fight someone else,

28
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.080
you have the rematch because oh no, you can't do that. Well, here's the thing.

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.880
If Conor fights Michael Chandler next, which is a possibility if Dustin fights,

30
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.140
um, uh, Charles Olivera and then Connor fights, Michael Chandler,

31
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:39.270
what are the odds of Connor beats? Michael Chandler?

32
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.990
I think Michael Chandler is a favorite in that fight. A hundred percent. Yeah.

33
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.480
And w which is very dangerous for your money.

34
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.470
If you want to make a lot of money, what you do is you,

35
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.640
you allow Connor to have some time off you.

36
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.790
How,

37
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.760
what you figured out a way to market this in a way that you explain a way

38
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:03.510
that Connor could figure out a way to beat Dustin. Good luck, good luck.

39
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.140
He did beat him in the first fight and did rock him in the second fight and

40
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.260
Connor actually, or excuse me, Dustin actually admitted.

41
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.550
There was one point in the first round where he was hurt. And he was like,

42
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.040
if Connor followed up, it might've been in trouble. Uh,

43
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.860
but that might be Dustin also saying like, I would.

44
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.600
<v 0>Like, he knows what's up.</v>

45
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.590
<v 1>Might want that rematch, rematch.</v>

46
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.790
<v 0>I, you in this pains me to say this,</v>

47
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.120
I think you got to take Connor out of the equation. He's out. He sent me.

48
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.440
<v 1>Let me throw one more variable. Go ahead. The COVID restrictions get lifted.</v>

49
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.560
Dublin, Ireland, soccer stadium.

50
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.730
<v 0>Nope. Here. Hear me out here, dude.</v>

51
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.700
And it pains me as soon as I love where your head that you got,

52
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.760
you gotta take Connor, other equation of the, for the race, for the title.

53
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.110
Cause you got, what you're going to have is Charles Olvera, DUS employee,

54
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.100
Michael Chandler, Justin Geechee, and then Connor they're over here.

55
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:58.770
They're out of the tournament. You're you're going to have cannabis, Nate Diaz,

56
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.610
trilogy in Dublin. Go ahead and do that.

57
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.170
But they're not in the race for the title.

58
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.680
<v 1>Honor versus Nate Diaz is an excellent option.</v>

59
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.180
It's an excellent option because that doesn't offend anyone like myself was both

60
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.660
her time off. Yeah. Give him some time off. Um,

61
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.430
it doesn't offend anyone and Nate is not the kind of kicker that

62
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.151
Dustin is.

63
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:23.440
He's much more of a boxer it's falls into Connor's wheelhouse more.

64
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.110
And Nate is also insanely durable.

65
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.800
And Nate also has a finish over Connor.

66
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.170
Connor does not have a finish over 8 55.

67
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.350
<v 0>Where this thing should be settled. Yes, I'll do that in Dublin.</v>

68
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.840
But they're out of the conversation of title titles.

69
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:39.970
Charles Olvera just engage you Michael Chan.

70
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.170
<v 1>Yes. That's what a lot of people are very offended that Charles, that excuse me,</v>

71
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.040
that, um, uh,

72
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.960
Michael Chandler gets an immediate jump right into almost title

73
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:52.450
contention with one knockout over Dan huddle. Then.

74
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.250
<v 0>You don't know the history of Michael Chandler.</v>

75
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.210
<v 1>That's true. But.</v>

76
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.970
<v 0>Talking about a former multi-time world champion, Bella,</v>

77
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.090
tour's fighting the who's who over there, how to finish over Ben Henderson.

78
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.960
<v 1>But Patricio pit bull knocked him out. How long ago? Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.900
<v 0>And who's a smaller guy, but he's also has a win over him.</v>

80
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.870
<v 1>Too. He does. Well, no, he has a one over his brother. Oh, that's right.</v>

81
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.370
Key PIP. That's right. He killed his brother and then Patricio, uh,

82
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.470
uh, got revenge,

83
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.090
