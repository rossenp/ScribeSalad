00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Let me tell you something.</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:08.490
The one cop I faced on Facebook and started torturing him. He dumb,

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.090
he try to, he lives, he lives in tele, right?

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.580
And he was involved in the JonBenet Ramsey.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.690
So when I mentioned his name on a podcast,

6
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:20.510
one time people started sending me messages. They go, you know,

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.830
we'd go to school with his kid. His kid's a moron, right? So

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.150
I feel like his kid like became a criminal,

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.320
but the dad has gotten them out of trouble. All his life. The kids are criminal.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.910
Uh, so they taught the same people from Facebook hit me when they,

11
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:41.510
they go your buddy, the cop retired. So I sent them an email. Hey,

12
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.890
on Facebook, Hey, listen, congratulations on your retirement. Check out,

13
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:50.090
Joey Dee is on YouTube sucker. And I know you read it,

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.620
but he didn't reply. You know what I'm saying? That's Larry dog.

15
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.690
Listen to what I did to that dude just, there was two of them are right.

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.680
There was a big white dude that the white dude,

17
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.490
this is the crazy thing I was not wanted,

18
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.800
but I was questioned on the credit card situation. In August of 85,

19
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.360
somebody had destroyed that mall with a credit card. And somebody said,

20
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:18.410
I fit the description.

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.780
So these two cops with uniforms kept asking

22
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:28.600
me questions. I worked at foot locker and they keep showing up every day.

23
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.410
And we talk to you. Yeah. The jewelry store said to you, listen, pretty soon.

24
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.540
You know, they didn't have cameras, Danielle.

25
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.550
<v 1>Uh, so they kept saying pretty.</v>

26
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.330
<v 0>Soon, we're going to start getting a receipt and you're gonna have to go in for</v>

27
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:44.060
whatever. And they would come in every day and shake me down.

28
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.540
And I would go guys, if I was a credit card thief,

29
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.920
would I be working for Footlocker? So I was just buying time.

30
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:56.600
I knew they were going to catch me eventually that one cop even came to my house

31
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:59.870
on a Sunday night and knocked on my door and said,

32
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.010
w we're getting the Jean sizes tomorrow. You might as well train yourself.

33
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:07.640
And I'm like, no, you gotta want and get the off my doorstep. That night,

34
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.630
that morning I went to San Francisco a year later,

35
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.720
I got arrested for kidnapping. He gets promoted to detective.

36
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.620
He doesn't remember me from the credit card thing.

37
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.210
The whole time I'm sitting there going,

38
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.530
what is this cop gonna remember me from the credit card thing?

39
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.660
So you gotta remember. I turned myself in,

40
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.920
when I turned myself in Doug and I pressed that buzz and they opened that door.

41
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.710
All the cops drew their guns on me and said,

42
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:36.890
get on the floor because that was one of the, for kidnapping and kidnapping too.

43
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.310
They didn't know what I was packing. What type of person I was.

44
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:43.520
So they handcuffed me, put me in a room that was white,

45
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.390
made me wait for a half hour. And then they came in and played the technique,

46
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.810
which I've been doing to people all my life. You know,

47
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.020
I'm the one that would break into Joe Rogan's house and steal one shoe.

48
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.890
You could do.

49
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.020
<v 2>That to somebody. You take an ounce.</v>

50
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.430
<v 0>Of cocaine, you steal one shoe, horrible. Oh, that's horrible.</v>

51
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.360
You steal that one. Favorite pair of shoe.

52
00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:05.010
You take one shoe and you throw it away.

53
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.430
That destroys people psychologically for years.

54
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.990
They'll keep looking for that one shoe. What happened?

55
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.190
And then every time you see him, you you'll find that shoe. No,

56
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:18.420
I the search tab. I'm the dirtiest bastard.

57
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.250
I know how to flip flop yet.

58
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.530
<v 1>So these guys get you in an interrogation.</v>

59
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.810
<v 0>Into the interview room and they asked me what's going on?</v>

60
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:28.260
And I'm talking to them. I go, I don't know what happened. The guy showed up,

61
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.130
the guy pulled the gun. Next thing you know, I was home. And they're like,

62
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:34.860
so what happened to the guy with the machine gun? I don't know.

63
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.540
Did you know him? I don't know. You know? So how did you get there?

64
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.810
I had a bike. Well, you just said you drove. Yeah.

65
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:46.170
I drove to get the bike to, I was just with them.

66
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.700
Cause I wanted to get out because Don Johnson was married and she went Eastern

67
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:53.730
on Miami vice that night. I had to be home by nine that's.

68
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:57.300
All I cared about was his wedding. So I'm with the cops. I'm like,

69
00:03:57.301 --> 00:04:00.600
I'm just going to go in there and talk to them. Tell him the truth that, yeah,

70
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.930
I went over there. They was selling drugs and I left.

71
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.590
I had nothing to do what kidnapped, but what are you talking about?

72
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.010
So we went back and forth like six hours.

73
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.840
And I still remember them sitting there,

74
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:16.440
like with their hands down and me talking about like, you know,

75
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:21.180
my uncle came from Cuba in 1952 and he worked for this guy.

76
00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:22.410
And they're like, what's this got to.

77
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.950
<v 2>Do with what we're talking about dog. I told her,</v>

78
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.840
and then.

79
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.640
<v 0>I agreed to give the guy information and I would just give them like red</v>

80
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:35.910
bands, drivers pre,

81
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.540
and I would give him Jamie's license. Like Jamie's not a drug dealer,

82
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.860
but I would tell him that Jamie was running kilos internationally from Europe.

83
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.680
They would, they would go through Jamie's life. Imagine if Jamie was doing that,

84
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.190
then they wouldn't find nothing. So they would figure out the Jamie.

85
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.500
I was playing them. I was just giving.

86
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.650
<v 1>Them fake license plates. How long did you do this? For six months.</v>

87
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.980
<v 0>They thought they would leave the real, this,</v>

88
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:03.810
this guy telling me he runs a big Coke from Colombia.

89
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.460
He knows the Choa brothers.

90
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.110
<v 1>Yeah. So you were just making up this crazy narrative of oh, yokels.</v>

91
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.460
<v 0>I was tormenting these two cops. I wasn't going for it.</v>

92
00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:17.810
He didn't like me personally. I don't let him know that.

93
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:21.750
I didn't like him personally. It's a movie. It was a firefighter. Let him know.

94
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.310
I hate him more than what he hated me. That's what I did.

95
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:29.700
I let him know like, Hey, the more and every time we went to court,

96
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.230
he would sit there across from me.

97
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.020
But I had to go to attorney and it was burning him up.

98
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.140
Cause he wanted me for kidnapping. When I'm like, nah, dog,

99
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.030
you didn't find no fingerprints on nothing. Sorry, Charlie, not this time.

100
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.940
So if he was chomping at the thing,

101
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.260
he went to all the hearings and said that, you know, they're like,

102
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.120
we don't see nothing else on the record.

103
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.980
So if there's nothing else on the record, this is you against him. No,

104
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.330
doesn't work that way. He kept saying I was violent.

105
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.360
I was going to kill the community. You know,

106
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.730
he was one of those white evangelist type guys.

107
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.160
He even was so mad at me that he joined forces with my ex wife in court

108
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.490
afterwards for like child hearings and like that. It's how crazy it got.

109
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.330
Oh my God.

110
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.020
He was there when I went on one day Cuban style and that's the last time I saw

111
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.360
him. Oh one. The last time I went to court,

112
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.400
remember the last time I went to court, my wife,

113
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.440
it was the same judge that sentenced me. Oh no, only he was in civil court now.

114
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.830
But here's the beauty. I kept writing him letters every month.

115
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.480
Cause that's the type of. I am.

116
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.240
We write them letters from the minute I got sentenced to jail.

117
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.130
Well the letter say how you doing judge Belafonte? And my name is Joey Diaz.

118
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:46.390
Thank you for your sentence.

119
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.400
I'm starting to learn what it's all about to be a man for the last 28 years.

120
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:53.110
I've been running a muck every month,

121
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.770
every month on the first he got a letter from me. When I got to the jail,

122
00:06:56.771 --> 00:07:01.480
I doubled up, I got a job as a warm car salesman. I really enjoyed it.

123
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.970
Thank you for giving me the I never, never,

124
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:09.910
but I wrote him. Letters wrote him. Letters, wrote him, letters,

125
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:13.930
wrote him letters. I got out of jail, February of 89. I wrote him letters.

126
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.750
I went in front of him in may of 95 and he was a civil judge.

127
00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:23.710
I was still writing them letters. I told them I was trying comedy.

128
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:26.530
I was getting divorced. My wife was breaking my balls.

129
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.160
We ended up in court in front of him.

130
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.860
The boyfriend's got a steak over his eye.

131
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.540
Cause I smacked him cause he called me a speck. So I smack them in the face.

132
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.370
<v 2>Of safe. So they're trying to get me for assault. Oh yeah.</v>

133
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.830
Tremendous afternoon Joe say.

134
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.300
<v 0>And the judge goes, number one, you gotta throw your case out because it's uh,</v>

135
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.960
it's the city limits of Boulder. You can't use a racial slur.

136
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.800
If you use a racial slur in the city limits, somebody can just beat your.

137
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.020
You get it's called the JJ Flannigan law. And number two, he,

138
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:07.030
then he attacked my wife. He was like, listen, you, uh,

139
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.480
come back in here again with this. It's contempt of court.

140
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:12.910
And.

141
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.160
<v 1>So all those years of writing paid off all.</v>

142
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.200
<v 0>Those years. So my wife got mad.</v>

143
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.910
The ex got mad and I'm a walk out of that was when I did

144
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:26.170
something that till this day I regret it was that bad.

145
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:28.150
Like how bad I went off.

146
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.010
But it was four years of getting tortured.

147
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.110
Think of you torture me for four years. I'm financially done.

148
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.730
I'm financially ruined.

149
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.800
I'm trying to feature and I'm getting heat because I'm dirty.

150
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.410
<v 1>Oh, I remember those days. You know what I'm saying?</v>

151
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.200
Like everything like that's the hard road, right? So I.

152
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.120
<v 0>Was featuring in dirty bars,</v>

153
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.910
but they would make me MC at the clubs and they made me work clean and read the

154
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:57.750
announcements and the.

155
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.220
<v 1>And they was just didn't want you on the show. A lot.</v>

156
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.580
<v 0>Of comics didn't want me on the show. You know, I wasn't that. No, no,</v>

157
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:09.660
I wasn't throwing the heat though. No, I just was doing well. I was holding my.

158
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.680
<v 1>Own. Even when, when I met you, when in the beginning you were dirty.</v>
