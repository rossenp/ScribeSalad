00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:06.060
[unintelligible] Like I listened to your interview with Matt Tybee and,

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.780
and you know, the point I was thinking about it,

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.710
cause you were talking about it politically,

5
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:15.150
how we're just living in echo chambers now. So you go on social media,

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.080
you're Republican. You're only going to see stuff about that,

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.580
that caters to your view.

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.570
And the algorithms are even optimized for that because they know that you'll

9
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.990
click on that more and that will lead to more ad dollars. So,

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.200
but it's similar with nutrition. So, you know, if you're a vegan,

11
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:32.160
you go on YouTube,

12
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:35.400
you're going to see tons of vegan videos and vegan perspective,

13
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.280
same with your Facebook feed, et cetera. And to be fair,

14
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.810
it's the same for people who are into keto or low carb or carnivore or whatever

15
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.460
they're into it's, it's the same thing.

16
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:49.050
So you're just getting this reinforcing confirmation bias, you know,

17
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.430
supporting, uh, access to information. That.

18
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.740
<v 1>Is a weird thing about social media algorithms,</v>

19
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.320
whether it's YouTube algorithms or Facebook or any of these things,

20
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.440
is that they're giving you what you want to say, which you would say, oh great.

21
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:03.470
Well, that's what I want to say. Yeah. But the problem is like,

22
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.420
there's there's so there's so many counter arguments,

23
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.880
like, especially when you're talking about nutrition science,

24
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.950
there's so many discussions on both sides of the fence and it seems like both

25
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:19.400
sides are preaching to the choir. Yeah. Well.

26
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.060
<v 0>You know, I mean, we're biased as you said. Uh,</v>

27
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.800
my story is a lot of people know is I was vegan and, and somebody.

28
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.760
<v 1>Said up, the videos use are the most vegan sounding non.</v>

29
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.970
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, I was a vegan. I was vegetarian.</v>

30
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:40.280
I was a raw food vegan. I was macrobiotic vegan.

31
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:42.860
I have a lot of friends who are vegan. I have patients that are vegan.

32
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:47.480
I have nothing against vegans and I totally get the reasons that people become

33
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.860
vegan, but I like many others and my patients and my community,

34
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.880
my health was harmed by that. And, and now, I mean, how was your health harm?

35
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.760
Can you explain it to people? Yeah. I mean, I, I,

36
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.530
I lost weight and as you can see, I don't have a lot to lose to begin with. Um,

37
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.040
I, my digestion got really screwed up. I got depressed.

38
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.390
I'd never been depressed. Like I've never been a person who gets depressed. Um,

39
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.140
I felt anxious. I, uh, you know,

40
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:17.630
it just was clearly not working for me. And again,

41
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.180
I that's not to say it can't work for some people. Do.

42
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.390
<v 1>You think the cause of depression had something to do with the diet because of</v>

43
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:25.030
the lack of cholesterol? It's.

44
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.290
<v 0>12 Hormones. Iron. Yeah, for sure. Um,</v>

45
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.420
but you know now, like, I mean, it's funny to some, I don't actually,

46
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.390
I make a point of not reading comments usually,

47
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.940
but occasionally I'd come across some on Twitter or something.

48
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.560
The comedian told me, so, so, uh,

49
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.380
you know, people are like, oh, he's such a, you know,

50
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.430
he's going to get on there and just low carb, low carb. That's totally like,

51
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.130
I don't, I'm not a low carb guy and never have been. I, in fact,

52
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:58.850
I'm in trouble with the low carb community because, you know, I pushed,

53
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.610
I don't think it's right for everybody.

54
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 1>I don't think it's right for performance. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.540
I don't see any evidence that for elite athletic performers,

56
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.750
that it's the way to go. And I don't know anyone.

57
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.600
That's an elite athletic performer that follows those diets.

58
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.840
<v 0>Maybe endurance, endurance runners, Zach bitter.</v>

59
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.670
<v 1>Zach, and Zach flies in the face of all this stuff. And you know,</v>

60
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.900
if you want to include someone like that guy that ran the Appalachian trail and

61
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.450
48 days or whatever he did, you know what I mean?

62
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.000
Which is no small feat for sure. But I mean,

63
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.010
Zach bitter ran a 20 F he ran a 100

64
00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:39.090
mile race in 11 hours and 40 minutes,

65
00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:42.900
which is 40 something minutes, which is banana.

66
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.130
<v 0>Running after that. He's a Savage, all he eats rib-eyes.</v>

67
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.140
<v 1>That's what that guy said. The main,</v>

68
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.350
he talked about the main food in his diet is ribeye steak.

69
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.110
<v 0>He's mostly Quito. So yeah, I mean, anyways, my point was just like, I'm trying,</v>

70
00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:59.640
I try, I'm not super dogmatic. I'm just like,

71
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.450
I I'm interested in what works for the most people essentially.

72
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.690
And you know, uh, you mentioned Scott,

73
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:11.100
Jurek a Belgian, Dennis shattered his record by five days,

74
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.360
a couple of years ago.

75
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.010
And that guy was eating like Snickers and tons of crap. So I'm,

76
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.330
I'm not saying that that shattered his record by five days. Yeah. Oh Jesus.

77
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.890
I'm not saying that that's what I'm shooting.

78
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.940
I'm not saying that's what you should do,

79
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:29.580
but I'm saying there's more to athletic performance than food.

80
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.971
<v 1>I guess.</v>

81
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:33.030
That's not really deceptive because he did break the record when he broke it,

82
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:34.200
he did break it. He broke.

83
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.200
<v 0>It. He's a phenomenal athlete. We don't want to take that away from him.</v>

84
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.870
And then like Michael Phelps, you know,

85
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.490
guy who's pizza guy eats 12,000 calories of like sugar sweets,

86
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.220
French toast pizza. Um,

87
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.660
same bolt in the Beijing link. The Olympics. When he shattered those records,

88
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:54.270
he Fe he ate a thousand over a thousand chicken nuggets.

89
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:58.170
I think somebody calculated. So I know there's more,

90
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.420
there's more to it than that. When you're at that.

91
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.980
<v 1>Level of performance, you are burning off such an insane amount of calories.</v>

92
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.430
It doesn't matter so hard. You can kind of almost eat anything when you're,

93
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:10.680
when you're in that mode. Yeah. Yeah. When we,

94
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.220
and this is obviously not comparable, but when we did sober October last year,

95
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.670
we had this fitness challenge. I was doing cardio. No, no joke.

96
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.270
It minimum five hours a day, sometimes six and seven. It was insane.

97
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.930
And I was eating everything. Boxes of cookies got bought bottles of soda,

98
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.150
probably lost weight too. I did well. Not really.

99
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.430
Cause I lifted a lot of weights too. Yeah. I kind of maintained.

100
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.080
Maybe I lost a couple of bounds, but I was drinking like giant, like coax,

101
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.580
like a, like a, I was drinking like a cream soda. I never drank that,

102
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.370
but it's like, my body wanted sugar. It's like, give me some sugar.

103
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:45.020
You just did seven hours on a elliptical machine. Right. And it was,

104
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.630
it was so ridiculous, but those guys are working out even harder than that.

105
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:49.920
So imagine like, what.

106
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.870
<v 0>Do you need? 12,000 calories.</v>

107
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:54.780
You're not getting it with paleo and you're not getting it with vegan diet.

108
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.060
That's important. No, that's important. So let's go,

109
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.940
let's rewind a little bit to the protein,

110
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the RDA protein that's super important.

111
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.100
So 0.8 kilograms per grams per kilogram of protein

112
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.420
per day is the RGA. And again, that's just the basic minimum.

113
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.630
That's not the amount that's needed for optimal health and performance.

114
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:18.590
That's just the absolute basics for not for avoiding malnutrition. However,

115
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.930
even that number now, uh,

116
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.340
that's based on outdated nitrogen balance studies for determining the RDA.

117
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.540
And there's a newer method called the indicator amino acid oxidation technique,

118
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.880
or I a O um,

119
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.010
and this suggests that the RDA should be 1.2 grams per kilogram. And again,

120
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.650
just the basic minimum bare minimum, not optimal.

121
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.760
So it's now gone up from 0.8 to 1.2.

122
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.860
And if you use that number, if you pull up slide eight, Jamie,

123
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.320
um, that's only enough for an adult that weighs less than 130 pounds.

124
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.053
<v 2>Really?</v>

125
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.520
<v 0>So the sorry, the, you know how he said,</v>

126
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.050
and James said in the study, the average vegetarian gets 71 grams a day,

127
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.030
which is not only, you know, the RDA, but 70% more, that's using the 0.8 number.

128
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.570
But if you use 1.2 grams per kilogram per day,

129
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.850
then a lot of people are going to be protein deficient on a vegetarian diet.

130
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.690
And we're not again, not talking about optimal amount for athletes.

131
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.570
We're just talking about the RDA basic bare minimum.

132
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.880
<v 1>Vegetarian,</v>

133
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.630
you should say vegan crap because you're not talking about egg protein.

134
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.810
<v 0>No, this study was vegetarian. They weren't referring to vegan. So you.</v>

135
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.430
<v 1>Actually could get egg, protein.</v>

136
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.270
<v 0>Dairy and dairy protein eggs.</v>

137
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.650
<v 1>Are a far superior in terms of their Mino assets, then vegetables. Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.600
<v 0>So for vegans, it would be different. Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.330
<v 1>I taught, I brought up eggs to a friend of mine. I was uh,</v>

140
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:53.540
saying this really recently, why don't you try eggs? And, uh, they,

141
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.560
they looked to me like I was talking to them about poison. Yeah. Like people,

142
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.700
there's plenty of people that are vegan or vegetarian and you bring up eggs to

143
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:01.960
them and they look you like, why would I eat.

144
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.020
<v 0>An egg? Yeah. So, so that's, you know,</v>

145
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:09.400
1.2 is the RDA with, if you use this newer method. Um,

146
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.650
but for athletes, uh,

147
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.210
James to his credit does acknowledge in the film that athletes need more protein

148
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.190
than, than regular non-athlete people. But he doesn't say how much more. So,

149
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.330
uh, again, if you use these IAO method, they've done,

150
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.490
they use this newer technique to look at athletes.

151
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.350
And they've found that the range is somewhere between 1.4 to 2.7 grams

152
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.340
per kilogram. So we're now way higher than that 0.8 number.

153
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.310
And just for people who aren't familiar with kilograms,

154
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:43.600
let's say we take the median number there 2.1 grams per kilogram per day. Well,

155
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:46.390
anyone who's ever been in the bodybuilding weightlifting community will

156
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:50.980
recognize this that's one pound of protein per pound of body weight a day,

157
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.190
which has been the common recommendation in that community for one.

158
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.830
<v 1>Gram of protein, sorry, one gram of protein powder.</v>

159
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.360
<v 0>One gram. And in fact, even Arnold in the movie says, I weighed 250 pounds.</v>

160
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.870
I used to eat 250 grams of protein. You know, like that's,

161
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.650
that's the recommendation, but it turns out that's actually based on science,

162
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.000
you know? Um,

163
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.560
so a 200 pound athlete would need 200 grams of protein a day.

164
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.080
And Jamie, if you pull up slide 10,

165
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.010
this is what you'd have to eat on a vegan diet to get that amount of protein.

166
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:27.840
And again, we're just talking about quantity.

167
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.920
We're not talking about being an athlete. That's me. I went to an athlete.

168
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:36.000
So you have to eat three, three cups of cooked lentils,

169
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.110
three cups of chickpeas, two cups of keenwah,

170
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.590
three ounces of almonds, three slices of silken tofu,

171
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:45.960
and 10 tablespoons of peanut butter.

172
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.590
<v 1>That's the whole day. That's the day I could that up in a day. Yeah.</v>

173
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.720
<v 0>You could. But the problem is the BA the D the DIA score for all of those,</v>

174
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:59.610
like the bioavailability in the amino acid profile would be horrible compared

175
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.910
to meat, eggs, dairy. So.

176
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.720
<v 1>I have to do, because I know they've done this study.</v>

177
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.100
There was a study that I had read or had heard about, I should say, um,

178
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.030
where they compared a rice protein to whey protein.

179
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.350
And they found that at a certain level of grams,

180
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.830
like whatever it was, they had an equal effect. Is it lutein,

181
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.240
leucine, leucine, the muscle protein synthesis? Yeah.

182
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.800
An equal effect should give credit to the video that I was watching this, um,

183
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.420
gentlemen, I was watching this video today, um,

184
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.620
Dr. Ryan Lowery,

185
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.810
and that they were saying that what that means is that correct me if I'm wrong,

186
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.670
what it is is when you get it, once you hit a certain level of leucine,

187
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.040
it's a point of diminishing returns and there's no,

188
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.970
there's no added benefit to having more leucine in your diet.

189
00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:56.210
So if you hit whatever it is, I think it was 48 grams or something like that.

190
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.450
When you have 48 grams of this and 40 grams of that,

191
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.870
you put the two of them together. It's essentially the same,

192
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.320
this the same effect. Well.

193
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.570
<v 0>I'm not sure about that, but I mean,</v>

194
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.460
leucine is very important for anabolic signaling and muscle protein synthesis.

195
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.960
It's, it's one of the essential,

196
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.590
it's the essential amino acid that's thought to be the most important for that.

197
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.970
And it's, it's low in plant proteins. And, uh,

198
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.950
the other issue with plant proteins that you have is that they have limiting

199
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.671
amino acids.

200
00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:32.210
So these are amino acids that actually interfere with muscle protein synthesis.

201
00:11:32.211 --> 00:11:36.440
So, uh, because the levels are so low in that food. So lysine,

202
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.410
isn't a limiting amino acid in grains like wheat and rice,

203
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.130
maybe that's there was leucine and lysine discussion maybe there,

204
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.510
and then methianine insisting are limiting and legumes like soy.

205
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.490
So Jamie on slide six,

206
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.120
I made a chart comparing the amino acid profile and beef,

207
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.340
several different plant proteins, like white beans, soybeans, peas, and rice.

208
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.770
What you can see there is beef is higher in

209
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:06.550
every single amino acid. Um,

210
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.680
other than every plant protein that's compared there with the exception

211
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.700
of, uh,

212
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.100
soybeans are slightly higher in tryptofan than beef look at leucine.

213
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.240
So beef it's 2.23 versus

214
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.970
0.58 for white beans.

215
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.890
1.3 for soy soy is higher and leucine than any other plant

216
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:31.990
protein, which is why it's often used.

217
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.960
And then like 0.3 for peas and 0.01 for right. Yes.

218
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.590
<v 1>If you get to a certain number or a certain level of all these.</v>

219
00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:45.060
So if you ate enough food that you would pass a certain marker, would,

220
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:49.830
would it be possible to have the same effect by eating cooked peas or

221
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.353
soybeans?

222
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.770
<v 0>For sure. So I agree with that enormous amount of that, as you can see,</v>

223
00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:56.820
because of the levels,

224
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.500
and this is why a lot of vegan bodybuilders and athletes end up using protein

225
00:13:01.501 --> 00:13:02.100
powders,

226
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.810
because you can get to those amounts easier by using the powders.

227
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.570
And you can also blend like a P you know,

228
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:14.100
70% P with 30% rice to get the right amino acid

229
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:16.290
ratio easier with powders.

230
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.760
So like Patrick [inaudible] is a good example of that, you know? Uh,

231
00:13:20.761 --> 00:13:25.290
did you see the video that Bobby Geist made of his, uh, oh,

232
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:28.650
so there's actually a video. Is that the one that you sent me? Yes,

233
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.300
I did see that there's video that Patrick made himself of his own diet, um,

234
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.570
on, you know, what he eats on a daily basis.

235
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:41.550
And it turns out to be a boatload of protein powder and just shakes with all

236
00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:44.970
kinds of powders and supplements and things like that. So, yeah,

237
00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:45.751
we can go through it.

238
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:50.130
So he starts with a bunch of different supplements in the morning, multivitamin,

239
00:13:50.131 --> 00:13:54.750
nutritional yeast, glucosamine, magnesium, calcium, B12, and iron.

240
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.940
Then he has a protein shake with soy protein powder, creatine, and beta alanine,

241
00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:03.420
which probably is because he's aware of the research showing lower levels of

242
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:07.140
muscle creatine and carnosine and vegans, um,

243
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.980
beta alanine, and creatine would address that.

244
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.540
Then he has a post-workout smoothie with Sawyer, pea protein powder, glutamine,

245
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:18.060
beta alanine, creatine, and drag greens.

246
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.560
And then his first solid meal of the day is fried falafel, French fries,

247
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:25.920
soy sausage, fried peppers, and tomatoes.

248
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.410
And then he has some more protein shakes and smoothies throughout the day.

249
00:14:31.411 --> 00:14:35.340
So I don't know that doesn't strike me as a super healthy way to eat.

250
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.400
<v 1>What, what do you, what problem do you have with that?</v>

251
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.021
<v 0>Well, first of all,</v>

252
00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:43.770
I think we should primarily get nutrients from food whenever we can.

253
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.310
I'm not against supplementation. I think there's a role for it. Of course. Like,

254
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:47.641
you know,

255
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:50.700
especially with things like vitamin D that you might not be able to get enough

256
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.660
of from food or a therapeutic supplementation,

257
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.600
if you're dealing with a health problem, but like getting them,

258
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.130
like eating a diet that is not sufficient in the amount of nutrients that you

259
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.100
need, and then using supplements to make up, you know, to,

260
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.800
to address that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

261
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.930
<v 1>Well, in his situation, he's got a very unique situation that he's a,</v>

262
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.160
he's a strength athlete. That's all he's doing is trying to lift really,

263
00:15:15.161 --> 00:15:18.800
really heavy things. So he needs to maintain a certain amount of ball. Yes.

264
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.970
<v 0>Seven normous amount of protein. Yeah. And normally smell.</v>

265
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.260
<v 1>Protein has to be, and he's very heavy, you know, and that,</v>

266
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.880
that sport is also, that's a steroid sport. I mean,

267
00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:33.850
it's just one of those sports where it's like bodybuilding much everybody's

268
00:15:33.851 --> 00:15:37.660
steroid sport. Um, so you're eating massive amounts of quantities.

269
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.770
You taking chemicals. Yeah. It might not be the healthiest thing,

270
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.940
but it's also like just the sport itself might not be the healthiest thing.

271
00:15:45.941 --> 00:15:49.510
I mean, you've seen them carry people on the, he was doing that in the film.

272
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.130
That's not good for your.

273
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.840
<v 0>Back. That's crazy. But it works.</v>

274
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.620
<v 1>For what he's trying to do. Obviously it's working for what he's trying to do.</v>

275
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.060
There's no dispute in that.

276
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.270
See what he's doing as almost like the intelligent way,

277
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.090
if you want to be vegan and do what he's trying to do. Right.

278
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.140
I don't know if he could eat just vegetables and pull that off.

279
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.120
<v 0>But that's kind of the point.</v>

280
00:16:13.121 --> 00:16:17.350
There are a lot of other strong men that do just Robert Oberst you get.

281
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.990
<v 1>On the show? Yeah. He just eats meat and rice, right.</v>

282
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.220
That guy it's pounds and pounds of beef and rice simple, you.

283
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.580
<v 0>Know, accessible form of carbohydrate and a lot of protein.</v>

284
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.300
<v 1>An unfair comparison in Obers talked about him on the podcast before they're</v>

285
00:16:31.301 --> 00:16:32.860
much lower. He's much larger.

286
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:38.170
<v 0>The strong man, huge like the guy who played Gregor, uh, in game of Thrones,</v>

287
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.430
right? Yes. He's was like six, eight or nine. Yeah. He's a normal house.

288
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.960
And Patrick.

289
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.650
<v 1>Is not, he's not nearly that size five, six or five seven or something.</v>

290
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.570
So the comparison between him and a guy like Oberst in those legit,

291
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.920
top of the food chain, strongest man in the world competitions, it's not,

292
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.120
it's not comp.

293
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.100
<v 0>Totally different way class he's well.</v>

294
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.350
<v 1>Robert is enormous. He's so much bigger,</v>

295
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.760
but the problem is in the film, they don't make that distinction.

296
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.600
And they try to pretend that this guy is one of the strongest men in the world.

297
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.510
He's not, he's very strong, no doubt.

298
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.190
And he definitely has broken some records in some competitions and, you know,

299
00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:20.410
and, you know, have different weight classes and different,

300
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.730
but you're not talking about a guy who wins those, you know, Magnus,

301
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.150
Von Magnuson competitions, where they're carrying trucks and.

302
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.420
<v 0>Well, I mean, I guess my point too was like,</v>

303
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:36.070
is it the best example of how an athlete can thrive on a plant-based whole foods.

304
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.660
<v 1>Diet? It is though, because for him, for his size, you know,</v>

305
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:44.500
for it to be a guy who's five foot seven and is carrying that enormous amount of

306
00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:44.621
weight,

307
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:47.980
he's obviously doing something that's very impressive and he's doing it while

308
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:50.460
he's on this vegan diet. And again, I mean,

309
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.080
just the discounting, all the illegal supplementation,

310
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:57.630
because I don't think it is illegal in that sport. It's kind of,

311
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.020
you kind of have to do it because you want to get that big there.

312
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.810
But if you want to do it and do it as a vegan,

313
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.420
he is showing you that it's possible. So in that sense,

314
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:09.210
I defend what he's doing, because I think that he, like,

315
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.350
that's the only way in that,

316
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.550
but this is a very sport-specific area of performance.

317
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.890
He's just talking about lifting insanely heavy.

318
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.080
And he's doing that and thriving on a vegan diet. Yeah.

319
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.030
<v 0>No doubt, you know, enormously strong and he's succeeding. Um,</v>

320
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.980
I would argue that he might do even better if he was eating meat, you know,

321
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.960
nutrient dense, more nutrient dense food,

322
00:18:32.961 --> 00:18:37.190
and he might need to take fewer supplements and drink less powder. Um,

323
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.050
but I think from his outfits, I'm more like a whole foods person.

324
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.850
And, you know, that's where I'm coming from.
