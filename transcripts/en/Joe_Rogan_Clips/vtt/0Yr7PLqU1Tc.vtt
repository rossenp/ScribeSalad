00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>Well, the Joe Rogan experience. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 1>There's a stigma. There's a, do I really need this?</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.710
It just is hard to pick up and.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.180
<v 2>You don't want to, the person that wants help all the time, like, Hey, figure.</v>

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.510
<v 1>It out yourself. And can this person really helped me. Who's this going to be?</v>

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.800
How do I find that therapist?

7
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:19.150
That's the most frequent question I get from my friends and family and people

8
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.760
I'm thinking I might need to see someone like, how do I go about doing that?

9
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.730
Get the question all the time. So yeah,

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.660
for cops it's even bigger because that whole control thing. And also,

11
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:31.730
like I said before, if their job is on the line.

12
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.730
<v 2>So for these cops that are in that situation. So when they say, look,</v>

13
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:42.050
I need to take some time off you, you basically just leave Malone and say,

14
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:46.520
if you want these resources here they are. Or did they, I mean is,

15
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.600
well.

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.190
<v 1>Again, it's going to vary by department.</v>

17
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.150
<v 2>That's kind of crazy that it does vary by department. Yeah. Drives me nuts.</v>

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.370
And is, has this discussion been, had like nationwide, oh.

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.233
<v 1>There's,</v>

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.320
there's so many good things and pieces of advice and recommendation out there.

21
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.760
One of the things that's kind of painful right now is, you know,

22
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.830
every morning I get a news recap from the international association of chiefs of

23
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:14.840
police. They send this email out to all the,

24
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.280
all the members of there and they have,

25
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.790
you have the psychological services group. And so you get these updates and I,

26
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.540
I usually just kind of pass them over, but lately with all the police reform.

27
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.610
So it just headlines from around the country.

28
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.690
And the piecemeal randomness of,

29
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.170
of this city is doing this and this city's doing this and this city is doing

30
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.540
this and this, and it's all over the place. You know, same,

31
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.670
that's driving me nuts because I'm like,

32
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.690
there's already been groups that have studied and reported and told us what we

33
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:44.070
need to do to help the, the,

34
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.090
the world of policing rise up and do better.

35
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.230
We've done information's out there from, from wonderful, brilliant people.

36
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:54.620
Who've come together and have laid it out for us. It's there,

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.120
but yet we don't have that national standard.

38
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.940
Each state has certain, you know, uh,

39
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.040
most states have a group like in California, it's a California post. Um,

40
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.740
you know, it's the police officer standards and training.

41
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.740
So they set all the rules for, um,

42
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.250
draining require minimal training requirements for all the departments in

43
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.860
California. So all the agencies,

44
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:21.680
police agencies here in this state are, you know,

45
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.890
need to comply with all of the post recommendations, but they're all, you know,

46
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:26.000
it's a minimum standard.

47
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.750
And our post California post is kind of heads and tails ahead of most of the

48
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.250
country. Some,

49
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.480
some states don't actually have that organization most do have something similar

50
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:38.330
to like what we have. So they do set some standards,

51
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.220
but there are so many things that are not included in that. Um,

52
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.360
and so it is a bit random. It's hard,

53
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.910
I think to make a one size fits all.

54
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.580
Everybody must do this because if you think about it,

55
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:57.470
I think there's about 18,000 different police agencies in the U S

56
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.920
and I, I read about 50% of those have 10 or fewer full-time officers.

57
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.360
So, you know, when you've got pulled out tiny little town in the middle of,

58
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.860
you know, the Midwest in a very rural county that that's, you know,

59
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.550
that's a whole lot different than LAPD, right? So it's,

60
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.480
it's hard to have everybody on the same standard and the same expectations when

61
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:23.590
we've got a lot of different makeups for a lot of different departments that

62
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:28.330
said there are some fundamentals that I think every department should be

63
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:33.100
held to. Um, and, and one of those is the debriefings after an incident.

64
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400
And the one that, that almost no one is doing,

65
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.320
that's been talked about for awhile is regular mental wellness checks. You know,

66
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.190
at this point you get a psyche Val when you're hired or before you're hired.

67
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.380
And if you're in a critical incident, you may or may not get one more,

68
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.970
more are starting to do that.

69
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.480
And then the only other time you're going to be required to see the psychologist

70
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.500
is if you have messed up and you're in trouble and you're referred for a fitness

71
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.980
for duty evaluation. And at that point, your job is on the line.

72
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.860
Someone is saying that they think you're not fit for duty.

73
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.900
And that is a scary evaluation to have to be a part of because then you're going

74
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:13.900
in. And, and yeah, if the psychologist,

75
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.580
judges and decides that you are not able to go back out well, then you're,

76
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.330
then you're off duty until you can fix whatever that problem may be. Right.

77
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.120
<v 2>Well also just for the public's health and welfare, it's important to do that.</v>

78
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.110
I mean, there clearly are a lot of police officers that are unfit for duty.

79
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.830
How, how do we stop?

80
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.640
What happened in Minneapolis? How do we stop that from,

81
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:41.220
from happening or at least mitigate it?

82
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.900
<v 1>So, I mean, again, I, I see everything through my lens as a psychologist,</v>

83
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:50.340
as a police psychologist. So I'm sure there are things beyond my realm that,

84
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.530
that also answer this question. But for me,

85
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:55.530
the things that I think we could be doing different that would really make a

86
00:04:55.531 --> 00:05:00.300
difference are the regular annual

87
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.350
mental wellness checks. If, from my perspective,

88
00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:08.190
when I look at people like, you know, Derek, Shovan the, the officer that,

89
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.110
that murdered George Floyd, and we see what happened there. He,

90
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.050
I would say I would be willing to guess, and I don't know him.

91
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:16.890
I've never met him.

92
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:20.150
I don't know much about his career other than what I've read in the news and

93
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.870
whatnot police officers that get to that place become

94
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:29.130
that. They're not that when they're hired to get hired as a cop,

95
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.600
you have to go through what often takes a year long application process,

96
00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:36.990
where they are digging and poking into every aspect of your background.

97
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:37.390
Your life.

98
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.040
<v 2>Be clear though, that's in some places and other places it's pretty easy.</v>

99
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.300
<v 1>Again, smaller departments that don't have the resources. Probably, probably.</v>

100
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.290
So, yeah.

101
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.380
<v 2>I wouldn't, I shouldn't say pretty easy in comparison.</v>

102
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.190
<v 1>In comparison. Yeah. But the vast majority of departments have a pretty,</v>

103
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:55.260
you know, have a similar process in that.

104
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.580
You're going to go through the application, have to pass a written test.

105
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.360
There's going to be a background investigation, which really,

106
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.840
I think is a hugely powerful key part. It,

107
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.350
that it should be a well done background investigation. Um, you know,

108
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:12.200
they're talking to people who, you know, people from your past, your landlord,

109
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.300
your ex wife, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your.

110
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.480
<v 2>Do that for every single candidate they do. Now.</v>

111
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.920
<v 1>Some agencies take far more care than others. Um, the,</v>

112
00:06:20.921 --> 00:06:24.440
the wide variety of people that I see that have passed their backgrounds,

113
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.970
some agencies I work for send me the most amazingly clean candidates and others

114
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.840
that are trying to hire a lot less squeaky clean, but they've,

115
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.930
they've all gone through. And it is, you know, gone through this background.

116
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.280
They also do a polygraph. They do social media checks. They, you know,

117
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:43.190
they make you list all your tattoos and, you know, so they're,

118
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.600
they're looking for, and if there is somebody who is just flagrantly,

119
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:52.400
racist has, you know, been out there, toting white supremacy,

120
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.490
like they're gonna, they're gonna see that somewhere in that digging around.

121
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.890
So th the blatant racist folks are likely weeded

122
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.660
out during a good background process.

123
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.570
Let's say maybe they're not as openly because, you know,

124
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.980
we all know that people know better than to admit to such things most of the

125
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:13.190
time, these days, and it could be more subtle. So at that point,

126
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.340
what comes next? You've got oral interviews with, you know, police,

127
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:20.150
administrators, um, uh, polygraph, you know, coming along in there.

128
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:23.180
And once they pass all of that, that's when they come to the last,

129
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.070
they get their conditional offer of employment.

130
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.130
So they're basically like as long as you get through these last two steps,

131
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.870
you're, you're good to go for the academy.

132
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:33.560
And the last two steps are the medical evaluation and the psych eval.

133
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.250
So by the time we get them, they have been heavily vetted,

134
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.080
poked around, you know, and, and, and, and looked through in their past.

135
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.650
And we get a, we get a pretty clean group of people,

136
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.660
but then we get to do more digging.

137
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:50.660
And we get to ask questions at this point that they're not able to ask before.

138
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.380
So about mental health and background and psychological treatment and history.

139
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.420
And so, you know, by that, and then if they get through these evaluations,

140
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.080
then they go on to the academy. So for us, that vetting process,

141
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:05.480
that psyche Val is a really important place.

142
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.080
And I've had a lot of conversations with other psychologists, you know,

143
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:12.770
in the past few months, like, what are we missing? I've had,

144
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.670
I taught a workshop a couple months ago for other police psychologists on,

145
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.540
you know, some of the things we do in these preemployment and had someone say,

146
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.550
how do we screen out the cops who kill? And I said, we can't.

147
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.950
And that was not a good answer that we can't, we, we can't, because we have to,

148
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.010
what we're doing here is predicting the future, right, where we're saying,

149
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.570
how do we know who is going to be that person who does that later

150
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.910
predicting the future's incredibly hard,

151
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.180
figuring out who maybe

152
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.130
subtly racist or bias is also incredibly hard.

153
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.310
So that said, we do a whole lot of things.

154
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:54.260
We've got our psychological tests that we give.

155
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:58.890
We ask a lot of crafty questions and we dig as deep as we can to try to, again,

156
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.690
weed out anyone who we think could potentially become that person down the

157
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:06.450
road, who could be a cop who kills, or who, you know,

158
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:10.020
is racist and bias and is treating people in properly. So, you know,

159
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.770
that's one big thing that we want to be very cautious and make sure we're doing

160
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:17.180
a good job of screening upfront, but I would say, um,

161
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.470
and so much more to say about the tests and the screening,

162
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:21.780
but gets really nerdy and detailed.

163
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.950
I would say that the officers who end up having the most problems are the ones

164
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:29.610
who once they get on are in a department where that is the culture,

165
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.080
that is that, that, that those types of behaviors are acceptable.

166
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.410
So as a young officer.

167
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.490
<v 2>They learned at that, have you ever seen the documentary of the 75? I have not.</v>

168
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.040
It's a great documentary about Michael Dowd,

169
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.350
who has been a guest on the podcast, who is a,

170
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.570
he was a terrible cop and talks openly about how he was corrupted and

171
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:52.250
how his first day on the forest. He,

172
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.660
he witnessed corruption and was told to shut his mouth and further,

173
00:09:56.661 --> 00:10:00.800
went on to become a drug dealer and robbing drug dealers. And just,

174
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.100
it's a crazy documentary. You would enjoy it,

175
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.200
particularly from a psychological perspective,

176
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.830
because he's talking about it after having served time. Right. Um,

177
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.270
just showing the, the images from the time and telling the stories,

178
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.920
it's the culture of each individual department is

179
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:23.870
different and some are great. There's a great video of, uh, Floyd, uh, Flint,

180
00:10:23.871 --> 00:10:27.380
Michigan, where, um, these police officers,

181
00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:29.630
after the George Floyd death,

182
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.500
they show up for these protests and tell these people,

183
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:36.260
the protesting we're going to March with you. Like,

184
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.410
we're a part of this community too. Like we are, we're your friends.

185
00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:42.230
Like we are police officers, but we are not the person who did that thing.

186
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:43.370
And we wouldn't do that thing.

187
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:46.280
And we want to show you that we support you and that we're here to help.

188
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.620
That's what, that's what really we want. It's beautiful.

189
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.090
It's so cool to see them all marched together and they're hugging. Um,

190
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.190
that's what we want that is.

191
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.550
<v 1>And, and I think that one of the biggest things, when we, you know,</v>

192
00:10:58.551 --> 00:10:59.960
how do we prevent these,

193
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.160
these issues is we need to look at the individual officer level.

194
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.510
But I think,

195
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.440
I think that is very limited because I think the racist,

196
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.010
angry cop who kills has developed that way over time.

197
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.710
And I think one of the pieces is the culture in the department.

198
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.310
Is this something that's acceptable? Is there corruption in that department?

199
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:23.840
And so certainly better oversight and tracking is a really important thing. Um,

200
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.660
you know, that that should happen. But the other piece,

201
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:30.500
and the one that th that I focus more on from my end is the wellness, you know,

202
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.300
is this somebody who is burning out?

203
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.800
Is this somebody who has gone into a dangerous place, you know,

204
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:40.340
psychologically that they started out and they were fine when we screen them

205
00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:44.930
upfront, but you know, over five or 10 or 15 years, they've seen so much.

206
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.891
And, you know,

207
00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:50.720
there's some one there things happen in your brain that changed the way you

208
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:53.950
think and see, and perceive the world when you do this type of work. Right?

209
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.370
And when you get to a place where those, where that those processes have,

210
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:01.900
have really taken their toll, and somebody has gone down this kind of dark path,

211
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.810
it's hard to come out of that. And the,

212
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:08.680
and the way they react to the world and the individuals that they see on a daily

213
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:12.130
basis is going to be very different than what they look like when they were

214
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:12.964
hired.

215
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.650
So for not regularly checking in and seeing who might be at risk

216
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:22.450
for going to that dark place, that bitter and angry place,

217
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.170
you know, we're not able to catch them before something happens.

218
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.940
And that's where, you know, for me, my,

219
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.090
my big platform is regular wellness jacks.

220
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.280
I'm not the first one to come up with this idea.

221
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:37.480
It's been suggested by task forces and study groups and people who know a whole

222
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:41.650
lot more than I do for, for a while now. But in reading,

223
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.980
there was a wonderful, um, uh, uh,

224
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.670
report to Congress that was put out, um, by the cops,

225
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:51.550
which is community oriented policing services.

226
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.590
So they sent this like 60 page report to Congress, March of 2019,

227
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.720
and described in detail, you know,

228
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:01.600
all the things that we should be doing to pay attention to officer wellness.

229
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.411
One of which was,

230
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:05.230
we seem to think that some regular checkups would probably help,

231
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.790
but the problem is no one's doing them. And we have literally zero research on,

232
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.870
you know, what, what are they helpful? Can they prevent this?

233
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.530
And I believe they are. So my, you know,

234
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.740
my next big thing is to go and explore and,

235
00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:24.730
and do that research so that we can show, Hey, this does help. We can, we can,

236
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.190
if we're touching base and we're getting people in,

237
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.160
then we can catch the problems as they develop.

238
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.450
And before they become a major problem where someone's interacting with the

239
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:36.940
community and they go awry and do something awful,

240
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.130
let's take care of them along the way and catch the problems before they,

241
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.530
um, you know, before they become behaviors that are problematic. Okay.
