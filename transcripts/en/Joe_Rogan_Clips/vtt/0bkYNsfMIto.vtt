1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.760
<v 0>Um, what, so let's get back to the Frank Neir case. Frank ne tested positive.</v>

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.560
Was it.

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.200
<v 1>Also, oralable also same thing, long term metabolite of oral ball.</v>

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.480
Here's the difference? Frank Meir was the same as John Jones.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.240
His first time through was sanctioned.

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.360
John didn't get off the first time that showed up in his system, he got,

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.870
you know, he was looking at potential four years, went to arbitration,

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.510
presented evidence,

9
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.550
enacted some other clauses in the policy that reduced his sanction.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.310
What does that mean? Uh, well, one of them was, uh, um,

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.150
substantial assistance where he assisted ATA in some way,

12
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:41.860
shape or form. And he got a reduction for, for doing that's in what way?

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.820
So I don't know. And this is the exact reason why I do this.

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.820
So I insulate myself from that interaction between USADA and the

15
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:55.540
athlete. They are the sodidjudicator in this. They do not, you know,

16
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.540
get me on the phone, say, Hey, we're thinking about going this way.

17
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:01.380
They adjudicate completely in a vacuum and you are you're.

18
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.170
<v 0>Just so people know your title is safety, health and.</v>

19
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.690
<v 1>Safety athlete, health and performance, vice president of athlete,</v>

20
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:09.890
health and performance. Yeah.

21
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.730
<v 0>So you no longer work.</v>

22
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.850
<v 1>For yada, I've never worked for USADA that that's a big misconception.</v>

23
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.250
A lot of our fighters think that I've never worked for USADA.

24
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.970
I was a federal agent for 22 and a half years. Um, the latter part,

25
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.040
my career got involved with all these P E D distribution cases,

26
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.160
2015 lorenzofertitada and Dana white through a mutual, uh,

27
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.720
friend contacted me and said, Hey, would you come out and kind of talk to us,

28
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.280
we're contemplating maybe putting our own program together.

29
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:42.200
We've had some recent high profile positives. So I came out to Vegas, uh,

30
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.010
with them.

31
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.270
And a week later I get a phone call asking if I want to come work for 'em and

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.710
kind of implement this new program, but I've never been an employee of USADA.

33
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.190
Okay.

34
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.690
<v 0>So that's,</v>

35
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.270
that's good to know because that's been stated by some public figures that you

36
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:58.550
used to work for USADA, and now you work for the UFC, never worked for in.

37
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.873
<v 1>Shell.</v>

38
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.260
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; that's one of my favorite words you never worked for USADA,</v>

39
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.753
you, uh,

40
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.580
brought youada to the UFC or communicated with USADA and facilitated

41
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:11.414
this agreement.

42
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.660
<v 1>Correct? So I, I never worked for USADA. I did work very closely with USADA.</v>

43
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.140
So USADA, when I first started these series of investigations back in 2002,

44
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.570
look, I knew all about how to work a heroin distribution organization,

45
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.290
a cocaine distribution organization methamphetamine,

46
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.970
but when it came to performance enhancing drugs,

47
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.050
there was no class that myself or really any other federal agent or,

48
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.210
or law enforcement agent goes through surrounding distribution of performance

49
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.044
enhancing drugs.

50
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.040
So I was examining the discarded garbage of bowel every week

51
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:49.520
when they put it out to the curb, began seeing notes, rappers,

52
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.280
all these substances. I had no idea what these things were.

53
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.160
I didn't know the difference between testosterone epitestosterone

54
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.760
erythropoietin, HCH. I knew nothing.

55
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.760
So what I did is I figured out who those experts were,

56
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.560
who were the people that could very quickly get me up to speed on what I was

57
00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.000
looking at. Um,

58
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.360
Dr. Katlin who ran the UCLA Olympic lab was one of the first and he started,

59
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.600
um, you know, kind of walking me through this.

60
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.110
He put me in touch with USADA and, you know, they began educating me as well.

61
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.550
So, um, over the course of those investigations, um,

62
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.830
I got a lot from them in terms of educating on these substances.

63
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.670
They were bringing some of their cooperating witnesses to me,

64
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.310
and then we go off and running on criminal investigations. Um, but never,

65
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.270
never worked for them. So.

66
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.110
<v 0>You saw to correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

67
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.740
but the way they would work would be very compartmentalized.

68
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.580
Like they would not specifically communicate with you on all of the details of

69
00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:46.740
this.

70
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.980
<v 1>Correct. And they don't know. I mean, they don't thats,</v>

71
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:51.180
so you don't the independence aspect. I don't,

72
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.540
as these deliberations are going on, what they're looking at. I don't know.

73
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.810
<v 0>Cooperation mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just for me to be Frank would in,</v>

74
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.090
in my eyes would mean that something was done purposely illegally,

75
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.170
and this person had some knowledge of purpose purposeful,

76
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.530
illegal activity,

77
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.210
and that they would somehow communicate this to facilitate some sort of,

78
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.930
uh, catching of someone involved in a criminal act or in an act of cheating.

79
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:19.450
Yeah. That.

80
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.320
<v 1>That would make sense to me too. Yeah. So that would.</v>

81
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.840
<v 0>Be what we we're talking about.</v>

82
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.720
Youada would allow John a shorter suspension if he actively

83
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.160
participated in helping them catch people that were cheating. That.

84
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.120
<v 1>That's the understanding. I don't know that be implied. That would be implied.</v>

85
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.720
I don't know to what level that was done.

86
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.360
I don't know if it was that or if it was, Hey,

87
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.230
here's how this drug in more general, here's a,

88
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.430
I don't know what it was I purposely, but would be.

89
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.150
<v 0>That would mean that John would have to know about cheating.</v>

90
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.150
If you were saying like this, this is how this ju drug works.

91
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:53.030
This is how I used it. I mean, this would, he would, that,

92
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:55.990
that would mean his initial defense would've to be thrown out the window because

93
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:56.824
it wasn't an accident.

94
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.950
<v 1>Well, I, I mean, I don't know about that. If he knew something separate from,</v>

95
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.420
you know, this, he wasn't someone else doing someone else. Yeah. And again,

96
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.860
I don't, I don't want anybody to reach that conclusion.

97
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.940
I have no idea what his substantial assistance entailed none. Right.

98
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.660
Um, and that's a slippery slope. It is a slippery slope.

99
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.420
And look transparencyencies important in any program, but you know,

100
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.930
only to a certain level, look, if you were transparent out what everyone's,

101
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.730
you know, cooperation or substantial assistant was,

102
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.650
and the whole world knew about it,

103
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.050
you're never gonna get anybody after that coming in and, and, and cooperating.

104
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.850
I saw this definitely on the criminal side with, you know, informants,

105
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:36.451
you don't,

106
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:40.250
that's not something that's that you want to be transparent about or disclose.

107
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.230
Right.

108
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.240
<v 0>But there's gonna be a bunch of people that have a real issue with that.</v>

109
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.440
The idea that John Jones, you know,

110
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.720
one of the greatest fires of all time is actually working as an informant.

111
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.560
I mean.

112
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.560
<v 1>It's, it's listed in the, in the, you know, in the McLaren's ruling,</v>

113
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.800
that that was one of the reasons for the,

114
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.040
the mitigating factor and the reduction. But I don't, again, Joe I'm,

115
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:00.760
since Neith you, I have any information.

116
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.520
<v 0>Nothing about it. Just leave that alone, nothing about it.</v>

117
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.760
It's been stated we know what it is. Okay. Or, or we know that it's a thing. Um,

118
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.280
when it comes to the John's initial test

119
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.520
where he was sanctioned and was, uh,

120
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.190
suspended for a determined period of time,

121
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.910
Frank Meer also was sanctioned.

122
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.030
And he was for a determined period of time as well. He was two years.

123
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.590
He was two years. John was shorter than that. John was shorter.

124
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:28.430
John cooperated didn a bunch of other deal. Two thingss, two things.

125
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.710
<v 1>He, you not only cooperated, he went to arbitration and put on a defense.</v>

126
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.310
He put on a defense that look,

127
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.340
the evidence here shows no intentional ingestion of fact,

128
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.100
McLaren gave him a further reduction based on,

129
00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:43.900
there was no evidence that this was intentionally done.

130
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.420
Frank Meir didn't put on any. He had every right to go to arbitration,

131
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.620
put on his own offense. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, didn't.

132
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.220
<v 0>Do that. What about Josh Barnett?</v>

133
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.380
<v 1>Uh, Josh Barnett, you know, a completely different set of facts.</v>

134
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.810
His came from a contaminated supplement. It was, was a different substance.

135
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.850
He went to an arbitration, hearing the arbitrator ruled with Josh and said, yep.

136
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.890
You know, based on where we are now,

137
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.010
based on the care and effort that you took you're right. You deserve to,

138
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.570
to have time served at the time of that arbitration. So again,

139
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.890
I think that's a good example of the checks and balances in place here.

140
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.920
You've got me overseeing the program,

141
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.360
taking a look at how these things come out.

142
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.200
You've got the ability from the athlete to go to McLaren's group and

143
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.000
judge, you know, the set of facts. And in that case, McLaren's group said,

144
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.800
youatada, I think maybe you overreached a little bit here.

145
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.360
And I believe Josh and Josh is, you know, basically time served.

146
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.190
You know, you wanna see, you wanna see them get it perfect right. Every time.

147
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:43.930
But you know,

148
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.790
and the reality in the real world is that doesn't necessarily happen.

149
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.230
And that's why you have these checks and balances available.

150
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.470
<v 0>Um, Josh Barnett's take on the matter is that they tried to paint him as guilty,</v>

151
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.630
even though he was not. And that he,

152
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.460
he feels like he definitely got a bad deal and that he was labeled

153
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.820
as someone who was taking this substance,

154
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.860
he was suspended for a long period of time while he was going through this.

155
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.340
And although he was found not guilty,

156
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.500
that he feels like not enough emphasis was put into

157
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:17.660
establishing that he was not guilty and that, you know, he,

158
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.450
he feels like they chased him down over something that he didn't do.

159
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.531
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, well,</v>

160
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:27.170
well here's what he did do is he used a supplement that if he would've listened

161
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:31.050
to anything that we educate on, that youata sends out regular reminders,

162
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.690
our fighters are required on a quarterly basis to go through videos and their

163
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:38.050
whereabouts filing that deals with these issues.

164
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.400
If he would've followed any of that of vice,

165
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:41.960
when it came to his supplement choices,

166
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.200
he would've never chosen the supplement he used. I, you know, when,

167
00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:49.320
when I heard about that supplement and what was on the label and how it was

168
00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:51.440
marketed, I said, okay, well, that's,

169
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:54.680
that's likely the candidate of where it came from. Yeah. So I mean,

170
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.000
the analysis would be, Hey, you know, that pool, be careful.

171
00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:00.640
There's sharks swimming in that pool. They can eat you.

172
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.480
And the person jumps in the water anyway, saying, look,

173
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.720
I didn't wanna get eaten by a shark, but a shark comes up and aid, em,

174
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:10.560
it's like, Hey, we told you that this was the case. You didn't follow that. Now,

175
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.070
there also needs to be a differentiation between someone who intentional

176
00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:18.350
cheating, intentionally cheating and someone that's just, you know,

177
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:21.670
makes a naive supplement choice. There,

178
00:09:21.671 --> 00:09:24.950
there needs to be a differentiation between that. And there was in that case,

179
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.990
Josh didn't get, you know, the full penalty of what was, what that substance,

180
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.230
you know, would've rendered. But he did have to go.

181
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.710
<v 0>Through a long period of time where he was unable to fight.</v>

182
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.340
<v 1>He did, but you know, again, he had the prohibited substance in his body. Um,</v>

183
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.380
youata has to look at, Hey, even though you did, didn't do that on purpose.

184
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.980
Did that give you a performance enhancing benefit?

185
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.100
Did it allow you to recover a little bit better?

186
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.380
Did it make you a little bit stronger? And you know,

187
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:55.770
that's why those strict liability provisions are in there. Other wise,

188
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:56.250
people would.

189
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.250
<v 0>Just take these prohibited supplements and say, oh, I didn't know exactly.</v>

190
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.970
<v 1>Just it was an accident. Exactly. And meanwhile, they're getting a benefit from.</v>

191
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.970
<v 0>It. Exactly. So they have to have some sort of penalty in.</v>

192
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.410
<v 1>Place. I think so. Yeah. Now I also think, again, there needs to be, uh,</v>

193
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.410
a differentiation between the intentional non-intentional and we do have that in

194
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:14.020
our policy.

195
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.440
There are definitely mitigat factors available in our policy that if you didn't

196
00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:21.560
do thing on purpose, you're not, you know, you're not sanctionous high.

197
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.120
Tim means is a great example there. Yeah.

198
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:26.400
So Tim means used a relatively benign supplement.

199
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.920
It was a creattin creattin, you know,

200
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.760
generally doesn't have an issue as, as,

201
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.200
as opposed like testosterone booster supplements.

202
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.480
We tell our athletes stay away from the,

203
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.390
anything marketing as a testosterone booster.

204
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:43.590
It's one of the most common with contaminants or purposefully spiking purposeful

205
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:47.990
spikings Tim means uses a creattin. It had, uh,

206
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.150
oine in a very small amount. Uh, we founded in there, you know,

207
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.910
oine is a two year sanction. He got six months, um, you know,

208
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.660
so back, relatively quickly. So I think that Wass the same thing with.

209
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.493
<v 0>Joel Romero.</v>

210
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.740
<v 1>So correct. Joell Romero used a natural diuretic product that had, um,</v>

211
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.660
a arm in it. Um, in all these cases,

212
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.220
not only does the,

213
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.740
the prohibited substance need to show up in what the athlete has says,

214
00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.700
they've used already to pro,

215
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.170
but to protect against making sure the athlete isn't purposely spiking,

216
00:11:20.171 --> 00:11:25.090
it youata will go out on their own on the market independently procure,

217
00:11:25.091 --> 00:11:28.850
hopefully the same lot of product. And in the case of Yoel and Tim,

218
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.450
they were able to do that, test it completely independently of the athlete,

219
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.770
determine what level, the prohibited substances in that,

220
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.010
based on the interview with the athlete of how,

221
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.800
how much did you use when's the last time you used it relative to this test,

222
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.280
do the science calculations just to make sure an athlete's not saying, well,

223
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.680
I know this creattin is spiked with oine,

224
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.720
so I'm gonna go use oine and then I have a built-in excuse when I test positive

225
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.720
for Aing in order to be able to match contamininate levels with what's being

226
00:11:57.721 --> 00:12:02.440
excreted in the urine, you would literally have to have PhD chemistry degree,

227
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.280
and I'm not aware of, of any of our athletes having that. It' be very,

228
00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:07.200
very difficult to do that. And so these.

229
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.680
<v 0>Detection levels, again, we're talking about nanograms,</v>

230
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.000
we're not talking about large quantities that.

231
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.550
<v 1>Would, or P keikagrams keikagrams. Okay. Correct. Now.</v>
