00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. When you see David Blaine manipulate cards,</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.650
you realize like, oh, okay, like there's levels to everything.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.150
Like David Blaine can do crazy with cards. Like he did with my daughter.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.570
Like he like did these card tricks and I was watching everything he did.

5
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.090
And I have no idea how he did it. Like, well,

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.660
he did things where like cards would he have a stack of cards and he'd keep

7
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.900
tapping the stack and the stack would go smaller and smaller to those like two

8
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.990
cards. And you have no idea how he did it. He just looking at him like,

9
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.120
what are you doing? Like, it's like,

10
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:37.200
he's got access to time-travel and he's like pulling those cards out when you're

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:40.620
not looking. And then coming back to normal time, like it didn't make right.

12
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 1>I, I know how to do a couple minimal card tricks and I'm not very good at them,</v>

13
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.850
but like, I have an idea of what's happening.

14
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.613
<v 2>You need trick decks and.</v>

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.780
<v 1>For the ones I know. I'm not like the it's not, I'm not good at them,</v>

16
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:53.730
but he was freaking me out. I was watching him do, when I swear, I was like,

17
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.400
I'm going to catch him. Right. I'm going to catch him.

18
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.300
I was two feet from him and he did something. I don't even, it just disappeared.

19
00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.930
Well, the.

20
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.970
<v 0>Ones we did where the guys were holding his wrist,</v>

21
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.880
we had our security guys hold each of his room. He asked them to do it,

22
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.050
hold each of his wrists.

23
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.520
He rolled his sleeves up and he made these cars disappear. And you're like,

24
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.490
what is happening? Oh my God, what are you masters?

25
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.780
<v 1>More than just car. It's like psychology. And like, yeah.</v>

26
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.710
Misdirection mixed it all together at a level that we can't understand.

27
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:23.540
He's so advanced. Yeah.

28
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.040
<v 3>I took one writing gig like six or seven years ago with Justin Willman.</v>

29
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:32.510
Who's a genius. Great magician. He, he puts he's the Netflix guy now.

30
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.490
And, uh, um, I took the job because,

31
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.350
uh, Robert Morton,

32
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.730
who used to be the executive producer of Letterman was the VP of this. Anyway,

33
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:46.940
I take the job just cause it's a short two, four week.

34
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.340
We're making a pilot for this magician and I'm like,

35
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.910
I like magic magic school and Morty's the EAP.

36
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.030
So this'll be a cool thing to work on. Right. Short job.

37
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.490
So I show up day one and basically we're all in a big writers' room or whatever.

38
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.090
And I go, yeah, you know, I'll and they're like, we got Tony here. Cause he's a,

39
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:05.451
you know,

40
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.930
he's going to add some edge to the comedy on this show because it was a comedy,

41
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.920
it was comedy. Central's first ever magic comedy show the pilot.

42
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.770
And, and I go, yeah, you know,

43
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:20.060
I'll punch up whatever you guys show me the tricks that you want to do.

44
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.870
And I'll write jokes around the trick. And that's when I,

45
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:27.080
this is when I realized how cool this job was about to be. They go,

46
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.820
the main guy goes, no,

47
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.890
you write the trick and you write the jokes. And I'm like,

48
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.230
so you'll be able to do whatever my imagination thinks would be a cool magic

49
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:42.530
trick and like him and like four other magicians,

50
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.650
which was basically the rest of the creative staff at the same time. We're like,

51
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.190
yup. And that's what excites them is

52
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.440
me. Cause they can't even think of things. You know what I mean? They can,

53
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.880
but they want to hear what a different mind thinks would be impossible.

54
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.960
<v 0>And then they figured out how to do it. What, what's an example? Well,</v>

55
00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:04.590
we ended up.

56
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.030
<v 3>Because it was a pilot of a show.</v>

57
00:03:06.031 --> 00:03:10.500
We ended up having to figure out a theme for just the pilots.

58
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.040
So that for example, the, that was technology.

59
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.230
So one of the things was him versus him versus a

60
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:23.580
3d printer. Uh, um, in making things,

61
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.450
things appeared. It was really funny because there was this kid,

62
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.170
they went to this,

63
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.370
we ended up finding this like nerdy smart school where this kid was excited

64
00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:36.120
about his 3d printer. And basically it was,

65
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.830
it was just him making things appear out of absolutely nowhere.

66
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.380
Well, one kid was still printing.

67
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.060
One thing with a 3d printer took forever and he ended up just pitch and pitch

68
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.030
and pitch and pitch and car, car, car, car card, like it ended up being,

69
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.040
you know, it's a comedy. So, but um, I'm trying to think of what other ones,

70
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.240
there were some really crazy ones. I think it's a whole world.

71
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.480
<v 0>Where there's, there's things that they understand.</v>

72
00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:07.980
They know where the average person, like you look at a deck of cards.

73
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.700
You have an idea of what's possible with that deck of cards,

74
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:15.900
but they have just 10 X,

75
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.230
times more options, how to hold them, how to move them,

76
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:22.890
how to maneuver those cards. How to distract you with the other hand. Yeah.

77
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.010
I mean, I'd like to hang around with David Blaine for a few months. Yeah.

78
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.023
And watch him do that.

79
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.840
<v 3>It ended up being one of the most fun gigs I ever worked on there was just,</v>

80
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.870
I'd get home after a day of work.

81
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:35.990
And I'd find like the seven of spades in my shoe.

82
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.200
<v 2>I'm like, this guy forgot to finish that one. He stuffed a folded card.</v>

83
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.500
<v 0>Under Jeff's a band. Wow. And he's like,</v>

84
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.610
where's the card. And he's just like, where did it go? He goes,

85
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:49.110
look at your wrist. And he's like, woo.

86
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.180
And he like realized like it was folded and stuffed under his watch pan.

87
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.950
And he has a G shock. Right. So it's, it's not like a loose,

88
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.960
crazy watch band. It's a tight buckle, rubber strap,

89
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.250
watch band. He stuffs it in there and he's like, what the? And I'm like,

90
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.930
what the? No one saw it. Yeah. And that Jamie, what you were feeling,

91
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:15.780
some of it, right. Did you film some of it? Other.

92
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.720
<v 1>People did that. So I was wondering, I was a big,</v>

93
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.000
I was a big fan of his growing up.

94
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.410
Cause I was like a huge fan of magic David Copperfield.

95
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:26.190
But like after I figured out all the fake that was moved into street magic,

96
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.530
cause it's a little harder to do, you know? And that's what he was big on.

97
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.060
So I waited my whole life to watch him up close and he's got to be two feet

98
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:36.640
from, like I said, and I wanted to just, I wanted to try to catch him. And he,

99
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.480
he was so good at it. He did like seven tricks in front of you. Can't get it.

100
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.310
<v 0>A really nice guy. Really nice guy, Mike genuinely nice on camera,</v>

101
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:48.540
off camera with everybody, with security guys, with my family,

102
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:52.950
with everybody, like you can tell it's just really nice, friendly, genuine guy.

103
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.710
But some of the stuff he does is weird.

104
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.250
Like you made me shove an pick through his bicep.

105
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.370
<v 4>Yeah. What was that like? I mean, what, here's the thing.</v>

106
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.233
Yeah.

107
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.590
<v 0>Um, it's not a trick, right? It's just pain.</v>

108
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.570
And um,

109
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.760
I think pain is just a sensation. Right.

110
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.750
And if you could just tolerate the sensation, it's not deadly.

111
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.810
And one time I hit a nerve and we had to back it out and do it again.

112
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.510
I had to do it a second time. Cause I got in there and he said, stop, stop,

113
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:30.430
stop. Like he hit the nerve. So I had to back out and do it again.

114
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.710
I think it was supposed to be more disturbing and

115
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.670
impressive than I reacted to it because,

116
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.560
um, first of all, I'm used to pain, you know,

117
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:47.350
I've been doing martial arts most Mo so I'm always hurt.

118
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.240
I've had a bunch of surgeries and also I've butchered animals.

119
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.220
Like I understand muscle tissue and I'm not, it was just like,

120
00:06:57.221 --> 00:07:01.180
why are we doing this? So it was more why we doing this then? Oh my God,

121
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:02.380
I can't believe we're doing this.

122
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:06.220
Like that one was not a good one for me because it's like, okay,

123
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.580
like I could do that too. Like if you want to shove that through my arm,

124
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.070
I could just sit here while you shove that through my arm.

125
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.430
I wouldn't like it though. Did he bleed? They bled a little bit. Yeah.

126
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.280
We had to stop and refilm because he had like a little bit of a hematoma. Right?

127
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.070
Jamie, wasn't it like a little building up. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

128
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:29.020
And so the security guys had have put like a bandaid on it and and check it

129
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:31.720
out. Some, one of them is a medic. How do you think he,

130
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.950
do you think he went through the.

131
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.480
<v 2>Muscle? I pushed it through his arm dude. Like his muscle a hundred percent.</v>

132
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.420
Not between the bone and the muscle. No, no.

133
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.350
<v 0>I shoved it through his muscle 100%, but you can do that.</v>

134
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.370
So the needle, it was an ice pick,

135
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.090
but I'm telling you, you can do that. You know, there's guys,

136
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:57.460
this is one of the things that we found out during the show that I didn't know,

137
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.310
there's guys that use that would shove swords through their body.

138
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.410
Their whole gig was shoving swords through their body. And we watched it live.

139
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.550
We, I mean, not live.

140
00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:10.750
We watch videos of these guys shoving swords through this one guy's body.

141
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.830
Who's famous for it.

142
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.780
So it would take like a long thin sword and they shove it through his chest and

143
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.100
would come out the other end.

144
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.630
And he'd just be standing there with his sword thrill. Yeah. So here's me.

145
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.450
Did you see this? No. So here's me shoving.

146
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.093
<v 4>What? Yeah. I.</v>

147
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.970
<v 0>He's like showing me how to do it. Push through here. Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.290
Just shove it through. No, yeah. Poked it right through a 100% real.

149
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.850
But again, that's not the best one for me,

150
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.010
because if you're a person who's like,

151
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.630
doesn't necessarily see a lot of, um,

152
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:52.090
pain or you haven't, you still like surgery or someone getting,

153
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.590
but like if you did that to a doctor, right. The doctor would be okay.

154
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.440
I see what you're doing is pushing something through the muscle.

155
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:03.060
And it probably hurts. Right. It's not a good joke or a trick.

156
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.140
It's not a, it's not an illusion. You just doing something that hurts. I go,

157
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:10.100
okay. Like Steve Oak would do that. Steve has probably done that a hundred.

158
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.450
<v 1>He does things like that.</v>

159
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.360
Even with the critical didn't you go to clown college or something like that,

160
00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:15.194
I think. But.

161
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.040
<v 0>Yeah know climbed in a tree and had lions come chasing after him. Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.630
<v 2>Like he's he's the best. Yeah. He does a lot of. That frog thing too though.</v>

163
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.780
<v 0>That was a different thing. He swallowed a frog,</v>

164
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.430
he swallowed a shitload of water. So during the podcast, he probably drank.

165
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.070
<v 2>15.</v>

166
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.760
<v 0>He probably drank 15 bottles of water or something crazy.</v>

167
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.260
And then he swallowed his frog and the frog is in his stomach with all the water

168
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.850
that he swallowed. And then he spit up the water slowly but surely in a buck.

169
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:51.680
We had an ice bucket on the table and then eventually got to the point where he

170
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:56.330
felt the frog coming up and he spit the frog out into my hand. Okay.

171
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.910
<v 4>Good. Yeah.</v>

172
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.260
<v 0>I mean he knows how to do it.</v>

173
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.080
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

174
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.200
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

175
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:10.370
They're going to be available everywhere,

176
00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:13.970
but after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

177
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.960
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

178
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.030
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking is go download Spotify much.

179
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.290
Buh-bye.
