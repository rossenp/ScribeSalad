00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.270
<v 2>So John Kavanaugh who's Khan, rugger, excuse me. Who's Conor.</v>

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:10.470
McGregor's coach said that that's Laura, Laura Sanko is a,

4
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:13.890
one of the UFC, uh, commentators. And she, uh,

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.540
did an excellent interview with Kavanaugh and they went over all the things that

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.210
happened. And one of the things that happened in training camp was, uh,

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.950
they think it probably cracked in training camp and, uh,

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.470
he got it scanned. And, uh, you know,

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:30.120
they said that there might've been something there,

10
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.630
but it's hard to tell it's probably some sort of a hairline fracture. And, uh,

11
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.440
they did their best to just stay healthy until they get into the fight.

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.300
But if you go to Laura's interview, it's really excellent.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.400
And Kavanaugh explains that and it looks like a John Wayne

14
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.290
Parr picked up something too.

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.450
It looked like the shin was compromised on one of the leg kicks to not the one

16
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:56.040
that Dustin thought Dustin thought that probably it was probably damaged more

17
00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.750
than once because a Dustin checked one of the kicks and then pointed

18
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.670
to Connor's shin.

19
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.060
<v 0>Like I know that hurt or that hurt you, but there's one.</v>

20
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:10.410
This is from John Wayne pars page. He throws his kick. If you watch Connor shin,

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.170
see, look, it kind of buckles right there. See that.

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.930
That's definitely something right now, right after it buckles there.

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.630
This is what John put up right afterwards.

24
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.140
Connor then throws a front kick and that's it right there.

25
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:29.430
And that front kick hits the knee. Now, as it puts it down, his knees,

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.690
his shin is shot. Now. Now he goes to throw a punch. He throws a punch,

27
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.340
and then as he steps back, he doesn't have it on his,

28
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.610
if you go to mine, you'll see that. If you go to mine,

29
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.160
go to my Instagram and you'll see, um, I repost it from, uh,

30
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.070
Eric Nixon from, um, uh, extreme Coture. So he's,

31
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.030
he throws this front kick. And as he throws the front kick,

32
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.290
it hits the elbow at the points. He's throwing it up,

33
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.160
see that and bam, it catches it. And then it goes down.

34
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.580
And right now he's standing on that fractured. So he puts it behind him,

35
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.820
watch he puts it behind him and then he throws the punch.

36
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.200
And then when he goes to throw the punch, he picks the foot off the ground,

37
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.530
right? Here's the left-hand that almost looked like it. But watch this,

38
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:21.450
it did bend back, but watch this bang,

39
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.840
then it just gives out completely see it folds over. Wow.

40
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.450
So it was snapped above the ankle. It wasn't actually the ankle.

41
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:33.030
It was above the ankle. Here's what's really crazy.

42
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.770
There's been so many fights in the UFC

43
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.910
and to have all these breaks in a row,

44
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.390
there's been a shock. Ray Soza got his arm broken. Chris,

45
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:46.860
Weidman got his leg broken.

46
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.820
This has been a ton of breaks over and over and over again, over the last,

47
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:54.510
going on, just people are getting good at breaking people's bones.

48
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.880
People like it's really, really what it is, you know?

49
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.320
And the Chris Weidman was a freak accident. The craziest is.

50
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 1>Chris Weidman. There's only been,</v>

51
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.140
I think 1, 2, 3, 4,

52
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.210
there's been four leg breaks like that in the UFC and the history of the UFC.

53
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.920
Chris Weidman's been involved in two of them. The odds are insane. Insane.

54
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.310
Anderson Silva threw a kick. He checked it, Anderson, broke his knee.

55
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.330
He threw a kick Uriah hall, checked it or Anderson broke his leg. Rather.

56
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:27.070
He threw it. Uriah hall check. Did he broke his leg? Crazy. It's crazy odds.

57
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.780
The odds of these things happening like in this, this number are nuts.

58
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.040
