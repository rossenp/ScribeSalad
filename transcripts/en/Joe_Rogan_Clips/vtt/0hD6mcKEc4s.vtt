00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But drugs are up in general, man.</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.670
Like I just want to say rest in peace to DMX. That's a sad one.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.980
Rest in paradise, man. There's

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.190
Time you see the video when they were getting his body out of the hospital.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.230
<v 1>NA.</v>

6
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.870
<v 0>And I wanted to tell you amazing. I want the fans outside.</v>

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.770
They were playing his music while they're driving the car with his body out of

8
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:27.270
the hospital. I believe it was in white Plains. It's wild. That's crazy. Just,

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.310
just rabbit filling the streets.

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.160
<v 1>I wish I was able to tell him this story. I'm about to tell you,</v>

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.200
cause this is real deal. And it's like, he means so much to my family is crazy.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.720
It sounds nuts. Not only did I grow up on DMA,

13
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.730
I love DMX, but

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.300
my wife was in labor for 18 hours. And she had the doula them.

15
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.770
I told you they're on some spiritual,

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.600
a mother Peruvian flute playing for

17
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:02.550
17 hours straight. The Peruvian flute music.

18
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:03.271
I wouldn't, you know,

19
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.830
the one would sound like they came into my sixth grade class and we made a

20
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.960
flute, 17 hours in the Andes,

21
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
the ones that bro, she starts freaking out. I'm like, yo, listen,

22
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.760
we have an hour left. Are we going to have to do a C-section or whatever?

23
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.000
And she's no chance. So

24
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.440
turn the Peruvian flute music off.

25
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.150
And I put DMX on stop

26
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.440
trap. That mother jumped out of her.

27
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.970
I swear on everything. It's on camera. It's out of film.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.800
As soon as the Peruvian flute, music step DMS, Kayvon,

29
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.150
he heard the dog and he came out. He just jumped out.

30
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.820
I just amazing. It hurts my heart that I was never able to tell him that,

31
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.460
oh man, like man,

32
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.490
that's it's like the Cray it's the,

33
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.830
the doctor was going nuts because everyone was just sick of that everywhere.

34
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:08.790
I was going to jump out of here.

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.600
I wanted to jump out of the window from the music I was laid out on the floor.

36
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.440
Farting. Yeah. Cause I had like,

37
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.600
I had hospital chips. Oh no hospital chips, but you know,

38
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.370
that's shut down flushing hospital for us. Nice little area. It was beautiful.

39
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.440
<v 0>And so it just changed the vibe of the.</v>

40
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.880
<v 1>Room, man. He popped right out on everything. Like it's on camera. I couldn't,</v>

41
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.860
I can't make that up. That would have been good. One.

42
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.600
When he came out on the hit, stop drop, shut up, down,

43
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:43.890
open up shop. Woo.

44
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.820
<v 0>He had some jams. He had some champs.</v>

45
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.770
<v 1>And nothing, but he and what? A voice.</v>

46
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.840
<v 0>Just a man, what a voice he had the dog drugs,</v>

47
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.010
man. It's.

48
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.330
<v 1>Up. It's.</v>

49
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.080
<v 0>Taken up.</v>

50
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.060
You think about all the great artists that have been that have lost it,

51
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.530
lost their lives because of drugs. I mean it's, it's astonishing. And you,

52
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.190
you go over it, all the musicians. So many.

53
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.920
<v 1>So artists are touched and then they're the ones that are most vulnerable to</v>

54
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.180
drugs that touched.

55
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.250
There's a lot of pressures and lots of you itself. Yeah.

56
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.190
You pretty much put it on yourself when you become, because you,

57
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.860
some people don't know how to handle it. You know,

58
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.170
I've always been told that I'm good at it.

59
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.490
Like I'm good at being who I am because I'm me. Yeah.

60
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.300
I'm don't get nervous up there. I don't overthink. I'm just,

61
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.080
you know what I mean? You got a good vibe. I'm just vibed out. I'm not,

62
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm not worried about all these things. Everyone.

63
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.970
I like putting a chain on my neck.

64
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:46.240
Doesn't excite me putting fancy cars. Don't excite me.

65
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.920
I like having the things I like, but I'm, I'm here. I'm with everybody.

66
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:54.640
I'm down here with, I'm happy being who I am.

67
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.850
And it's just like the most happy place I am.

68
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.720
<v 0>It's very complicated for people also because a lot of people are judging you.</v>

69
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:04.030
And so you get confused as to who you are all day.

70
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.290
That's what happens with a lot of famous folks. A lot of entertainers,

71
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.700
you get so many voices. So if you're a person like DMX,

72
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.280
you literally have millions of people talking about you.

73
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.560
Good and bad in both ways. And oh, he's terrible. He's the.

74
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.850
He's a God, he's a bomb. He's a loser. He's one.

75
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.130
Who's my favorite confusing. And you just, if you get the, this,

76
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.740
you let these people influence who you are as a person. If you let that in,

77
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:39.280
if you take that in and then you think about the pressures of fame and

78
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:43.150
maintaining fame, and one of the things about the rap world in particular,

79
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:47.260
at least until recently is, uh, like there was,

80
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.150
it was a very short-lived fame.

81
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.260
And there was something about guys when they got to a certain age where nobody

82
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:54.880
wanted to hear from them anymore. You're right.

83
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.110
