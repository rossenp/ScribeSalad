<v 0>You good walking. Great. You look totally fine.</v>

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.280
<v 1>Oh yeah. I was, I told you guys,</v>

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.200
I was &lt;laugh&gt; I had an apple party after the fight.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.720
I was booing I was the party slide. Yeah. Chain smokers. They, uh, they was,

8
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.910
they was actually at excess. Well, well, I,

9
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:23.630
that they had their concert thing at and uh,

10
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.190
they told they bring me up into their booth and I was trying to get him to let

11
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.390
me jump on and off the stage with him. Cause he looked like he was having fun.

12
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.583
&lt;laugh&gt;.

13
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.270
<v 0>That's amazing, man, because your left leg, it looked like,</v>

14
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.990
at least during the fight it was getting busted up. Yeah.

15
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.980
<v 1>Yeah. You know, it' you just used to it. Yeah. It is what it is, you know? Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.740
I, I heard, I saw, I got to watch the fight a little bit over, you know, and uh,

17
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.700
what youre not talking about the fight.

18
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.860
A lot of people actually about the press. Conference-hmm when I said,

19
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.620
I thought I won. I think so people, I, uh, people was taking it, uh,

20
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.100
taking it the wrong way. A lot of his fans taking the wrong way.

21
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:01.890
It's like when I was in there in my mind, I thought I won because I,

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.170
when you think about it, I,

23
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.890
I thought I was landing more damaging shots to the head and body, you know,

24
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.650
I know leg kicks. He was landing here and there,

25
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:13.130
but I didn't think it was too much until after I saw whatever happened,

26
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.010
you know, but at, at the end of the day, you know, it's like, it's what I said.

27
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.760
I just, my, my legs went, fire went to the after party. I danced. And, and if,

28
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.200
if I put it in this way, you know, of out of my, all my ti fights,

29
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.520
this is the least damage I took in a ti fight and I lost my tap

30
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.354
belt. So.

31
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.800
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; you mean into the face, into the body? Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.520
<v 1>To the face into the body, you know? And he hit me, some of the,</v>

33
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.320
I know he was landing some leg kicks and, and some, um, some was power and,

34
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.510
but then a bunch of other ones I, I thought, so it was like, you know,

35
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.350
I didn't know that there, it was landing that much to that, to that extent.

36
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.710
And um, then again, this is, uh, it's not a street fight, you know? Right.

37
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.590
It's not a street fight. It's a, it's a,

38
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.790
it's a game and he help pointed me in the game. So, you know, good for him.

39
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.990
<v 0>Yeah. It's, it's an interesting game when it comes to scoring. Right.</v>

40
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:04.700
Because like, what should be scored more punch is, or leg kicks like, uh,

41
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.060
you know, it's, it's hard. Like leg kicks are damaging. They mean a lot. I mean,

42
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.780
fights have been stopped on leg kicks. Uh, you know, but barbboza,

43
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.140
I think stopped two people.

44
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.220
<v 1>Leg kicks, two people at the yeah. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.380
<v 0>Um, but it's just, it's I think the system sucks.</v>

46
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.580
The 10 point must system it's boxing system. Yeah. It's not our system,

47
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.970
which shouldn't have that system. Yeah.

48
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.450
We should have a more comprehensive system that, that recognizes everything.

49
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.770
And.

50
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.170
<v 1>Then sometimes it's weird too, you know, especially like, uh,</v>

51
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.850
not technically my fight, but like other fights, like people,

52
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:36.610
you see people who stick and move nice and this and that.

53
00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:39.810
And just because the guy walking forward, he's winning a fight. Right. Right.

54
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:42.530
And then like you see them getting into, uh, uh,

55
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.880
you see people getting into scuff and then one guy bounceed back,

56
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:49.400
it looks like he's retreating, but he's actually not. He landborn the scuffle.

57
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.480
And then he, since he bounced back to like, oh,

58
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.520
I think that guy that was staying there was actually winning the fight.

59
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.880
So it's just, it's what you said. It's just super like, you know,

60
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.080
some guys like they, they favor a little bit more thing than another thing. And,

61
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.560
uh, it, I.

62
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.240
<v 0>Think there's a real problem with judges, not even being martial artists.</v>

63
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.720
<v 1>That's why that's a giant problem. That's why bet Watson say don't,</v>

64
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.320
don't leave pitch to judges don't but.

65
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.280
<v 0>That's easier said than done.</v>

66
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.080
<v 1>It is. Especially when you fight the best guys in the world too, you know.</v>

67
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.440
<v 0>You can't expose it. It's not smart. It's not a smart way to fight you.</v>

68
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.190
The way you're fighting is the best way to fight. But the,

69
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.110
the judges should at least have some martial arts experience.

70
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.590
And I know theres a bunch of 'em that have never even trained. I, I,

71
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.470
I just took some courses.

72
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.750
<v 1>I was talking to, uh, some people was talking to, uh,</v>

73
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:36.790
that was behind the scenes talking to, uh, they,

74
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.700
they came from the DC was the DC Fanon of ours on y'all. And uh,

75
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:44.700
some of the commission there at the DC event was like I heard was, was crazy.

76
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.260
Like some people was just not like, they didn't know anything. Yeah.

77
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.300
Not supposed to be there. I was like, what is going on? And like, uh,

78
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.580
to put it in perspective for people out there, it's like, you know,

79
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.140
like it's all I do for a living. Right. It's all I do. So like, to me,

80
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.250
I gotta put the trust in someone that doesn't yeah.

81
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:04.050
Know what they're doing when I'm over here sacrificing my time. It's,

82
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.650
it's kind of hard, you know, I'm not talking about my fight again.

83
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.250
I'm just talking about other people in terms, in terms a bad, you know, it just,

84
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.530
it's just tough, you know, it's horrible.

85
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.490
<v 0>It's horrible. And they don't do anything about it.</v>

86
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:16.730
And there's people that have put in bad decision after bad decision.

87
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.600
And then you see them still, uh, being listed as judge. And you're like,

88
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:24.160
this is crazy. Like, I want to ask them questions. &lt;laugh&gt; I wanna show them a.

89
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.840
<v 1>Video. I know,</v>

90
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.800
heard that I heard after last time we was inside right before I did my, uh,

91
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:30.960
press conference and stuff. &lt;laugh&gt; I heard, I heard you go,

92
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.200
who is judging this? We need to fire.

93
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.960
<v 0>Everyone. They do need to fire everyone. They, you know what they should do,</v>

94
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.480
man. They should hire X fighters. You should. They should.

95
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.470
<v 1>Should. I was, uh, I talked to, uh, Frank tri before he moved off of Hawaii.</v>

96
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.470
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and um, he was trying to become a, become a, uh,

97
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.630
he's ref he's Reing and now he finally got to Betor and U I think so he just did

98
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.990
UFC for the first time, a couple, a couple weeks ago, a couple months ago.

99
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.270
And I was telling him like, why would they not just let you put in there?

100
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.140
There was like, oh, you there's a time system. You need to do this. I was like,

101
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.260
you like fought for a championship belt in the highest organization. What,

102
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.020
what I know who in the right mind is being like, yeah, this guy's not qualified.

103
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.580
I would, I would want you sitting or judging my fights a hundred percent.

104
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:18.580
You know what I mean? A hundred percent. Like, just because someone okay.

105
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:21.770
Maybe they did take a class, but it's like, it's like license, you know,

106
00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.730
just because you drive your li pass, your license test doesn't mean you could,

107
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:26.570
you should be able to allow to drive on the.

108
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.210
<v 0>Road. You know? You know what it's like, it's like passing a written test,</v>

109
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.970
but never having driven a car. Yeah, exactly. That's what it's like,

110
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.930
here's your driver's license. You don't even know how to hit the gas. Exactly.

111
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:37.690
You don't know how much break you should apply when you,

112
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.930
you see some of these people that are judging, you can, you know,

113
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:43.360
they've never done anything. They've never done any, they don't,

114
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:44.920
they don't have any idea what's going on.

115
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.640
They just have a cursory understanding of fighting and that's not acceptable for

116
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:50.120
the highest level of the game. Yeah.

117
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:54.240
There's so many ex fighters that would make amazing referees or judges and

118
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.840
there's so, well, I don't have much of a problem with referees.

119
00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:58.120
There's a lot of great referees. Yeah.

120
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.240
But there's so many people that could be great judges.

121
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.080
There's so many super fans out there that have been training their whole life.

122
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:08.520
That just, they they're really, really into the sport.

123
00:06:08.521 --> 00:06:10.800
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the, a lot of these fan, these, these, uh,

124
00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:12.600
judges rather not even fans. Yeah.

125
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.920
They're just people that are doing it for a job. They're getting a paycheck.

126
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.910
<v 1>And then, and yeah. And yeah. And then getting to watch the,</v>

127
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.670
the fights for free live, you know, front row.

128
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.990
<v 0>And they don't even care. Like they're not even fans. It's, it's ridiculous.</v>

129
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.853
Yeah. It's.

130
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.590
<v 1>It is what it is. It's livingd.</v>

131
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.390
<v 0>Life there. I love that saying though. It is what it is. Yeah. It is what it is.</v>

132
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.710
<v 1>What is it's life? It is life. Yeah. It's like every anyway,</v>

133
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.710
&lt;laugh&gt; after the fight, we walking around with me and my son the next day on,

134
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.900

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.060
&lt;laugh&gt; I walk into New York, New York. There's Hawaiian. I love Hawaiians.

136
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.980
I love my Hawaiians. They greatest fans in the world.

137
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.980
She comes up to me and she rubs my back and she's like, oh, I'm so sorry, boy.

138
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.780
And blah, blah. I'm like for what? She's like, you lost your fight. I'm like,

139
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.570
and alive. I didn't die. It's okay. You know, we're gonna get the belt back.

140
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.530
You know, it's just a fight. It's one fight. We be back. But yeah,

141
00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:07.130
a lot of people talking to me like, it's my funeral or something. I'm like,

142
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:10.810
guys, I'm okay. I'm gonna be back. I didn't take no real damage.

143
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.050
I'm just happy that I'm not injured and out for a long time. And, uh,

144
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.610
I can get back to do what I love and, and that's punching people in the face.

145
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.480
So at the end of the day, I I'm happy. You know, I like, like I said, I,

146
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.920
I didn't need the belt to be a champion. I know I'm a champion.

147
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.400
The belt was just to let people know that look, I'm,

148
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.160
I'm one of the greatest guys to ever do it, you know?

149
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:32.360
And my plan is just to be one of the greatest of all time. And, um,

150
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.880
whoever's whoever you guys think it is. Let me know.

151
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.440
I illll go knock on the front door right now and be like, Hey, let's says.

152
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.270
<v 0>That up. Yeah. Well, you, you just need to make some adjustments for a rematch.</v>

153
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.630
I mean, to this, the whole thing was him attacking your legs. Yeah. That was,

154
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.230
he was getting close. It was a smart strategy. Yeah. It was real good game.

155
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.550
<v 1>Of inches. You know, he did what he did it did, you know, like, like we said,</v>

156
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.310
it's not a street for it. It's not street fight. He, he did the points.

157
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.870
Know he nice. You sweat.

158
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.180
<v 0>Better than anybody. You you're really good at switching while you're fighting,</v>

159
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.820
you switch stances, you switch Orthodox,

160
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.940
but you were forced at certain times in the fight to fight south Paul because of

161
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:11.020
the leg damage. Right. Uh-huh &lt;affirmative&gt;.

162
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.340
<v 1>I not really because of leg damage, cuz I just felt when I was going south Paul,</v>

163
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.530
uh, against him, I just felt more like he was just, uh, he waiting a lot more.

164
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.930
Like as soon as I went regular, it was funny cuz like I was like, uh,

165
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:27.090
I could hear, I hear, I could hear, uh, his teammate style bend, hear his coach.

166
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.290
As soon as I go, I go to softball then they're not really saying anything. Mm.

167
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.970
And then as soon as switch back to regular, I hear the word dragon,

168
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.410
dragon and dragon was lake kick. I was like, oh Lincoln coming.

169
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.640
Oh his dragon tails. I don't know what, what they was calling,

170
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.000
but Theyre saying dragon. It was like a late kick. So I could hear it in there.

171
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:47.800
And I was like, okay, well let's go SOPA. See what they start calling here.

172
00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:50.000
And they wasn't really calling anything. They was just like,

173
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.880
you need to punch now or you need to move now attack.

174
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.720
So I guess so they wasn't really ready for a cell. Paul max,

175
00:08:55.721 --> 00:08:59.120
more than a regular cuz as soon as I went back regular, they was screaming.

176
00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:01.680
Jagging like it was religious or something. So it was crazy.

177
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.000
&lt;laugh&gt; it was crazy.

178
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.880
<v 0>What did you think he was gonna fight? Like what,</v>

179
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:08.080
what did you think his strategy was gonna be coming into the fight?

180
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.360
<v 1>I, you know, I thought so. I thought so he was gonna, uh,</v>

181
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.120
I knew he was gonna do that a lot of faints for sure. You know,

182
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.070
thought he was gonna do like how he did,

183
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.630
although maybe little bit more get me against the fence,

184
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.630
but I think so he is kind of tripping out when, uh, he,

185
00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:23.950
when he got me there and I was able to get off and some, some of 'em um,

186
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.270
I think so he is tripping out that he couldn't take, like he, he was gonna,

187
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.510
I thought so, uh, they was playing the narrative.

188
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:31.830
Like they was gonna take me down ground upon me and stuff, you know?

189
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.700
So I don't know. I don't know what we did. I think so I, we did good.

190
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.340
And then he just did better in, in one aspect with the leg kicks and uh,

191
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.633
it all added up.

192
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.020
<v 0>Yeah. When I have to watch the fight again, but I don't remember him landing a,</v>

193
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.260
a, like a real significant punch that had you hurt. It was nah, nah,

194
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:50.060
not really was, it was good punches,

195
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.380
but it was just his leg kick work was excellent though. I mean, he, he,

196
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.300
he did a lot of, some of.

197
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.330
<v 1>Great work. Some of the first ones in the first one, some of the first ones was,</v>

198
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.970
was great was, was good in the early rounds. But uh,

199
00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:03.450
some of the other ones was just like,

200
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.450
we was super close and then he' would just throw it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you

201
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.810
know, like I would just we'd end up, uh, uh,

202
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:11.410
getting into a tango and he would just end with a lake kick just for,

203
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.810
just to even touch me, you know? So at then end there, I was like, oh,

204
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.280
I guess I was the get implants is too like.

205
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.840
<v 0>Kick up. Well, you gotta get a rematch. I mean, you are without a doubt.</v>

206
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:24.080
The most accomplished featheraway champion of all time. I mean, if you,

207
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:28.080
you look at your career, you beat Aldo twice, you beat, basically everybody,

208
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.120
you beat everybody in the division, Ortega,

209
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.040
you beat all the up andcommercers you beat all the veterans, you beat,

210
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:35.760
everybody was there. And so in, in my eyes,

211
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:39.870
like a rematch makes sense and its a very exciting fight.

212
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:40.990
It would be a great rematch.

213
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.190
<v 1>Yeah. You know, to sell. Yeah, yeah. Is gonna sell for.</v>

214
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.230
<v 0>Sure. Because there's no one really compelling. Yeah.</v>

215
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.310
That's you know there's no, it's not like, you know,

216
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.110
you lost the title vconoski beatcher but there's another guy who's been like

217
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.750
begging and pleading and, and right there with everybody wants to see.

218
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.750
<v 1>Five 4,000. Yeah. V voski was that guy V.</v>

219
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.540
<v 0>He was that guy. Yeah. I mean there's good guys in the division. Yeah.</v>

220
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.180
But you've beaten. Most of the guys like Ortega was the big guy, right? Yeah.

221
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:04.780
He was the one that everybody wanted to see you fight.

222
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:09.060
Cause he was undefeated and he would win in such spectacular ways. But you,

223
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.100
you know, you've you deserve a rematch. I I really feel.

224
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.180
<v 1>Like, yeah, we see what happens. You know? I can't wait if they, you know,</v>

225
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:17.730
I heard a little bit, they didn't hit me up yet. It,

226
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:20.810
but I heard Dana saying something in Australia or whatever, but yeah,

227
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.090
it is really, that'd be fun. It'd be huge. You need to move. And um,

228
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.050
we see what happens, you know, I I'm just,

229
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.770
you know how it is and I got this never backed down attitudet care.

230
00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:30.490
Do you believes that.

231
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.290
<v 0>A used to be 240 pounds? How crazy is.</v>

232
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.010
<v 1>That? That, that is crazy. You know, he was a tank.</v>

233
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.000
<v 0>Man when he was playing rugby. Yeah. Like a bulldozer.</v>

234
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.520
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know how someone that tall is that heavy. &lt;laugh&gt; thats crazy.</v>

235
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.680
You know, you know good for him, man. Like a,

236
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.360
like an Andrew release on her hands for a little bit. You. Well, he was.

237
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.320
<v 0>A yeah. Well he wasn't that fat though. He was just huge. Yeah.</v>

238
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.720
He was just jacked. He just huge. You still see it in his legs. He's got giant.

239
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.440
<v 1>Legs. Yeah. He's Digg. Yeah. He's the big boy.</v>

240
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.800
<v 0>He's a tough guy, man. It's it's interesting to see this, uh,</v>

241
00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:06.120
city kickboxing gym, you know, from style bender and Dan hang, uh, hangman.

242
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.920
<v 1>I was like, you know, I was like a big. Yeah. I was a big fan for a while. Yeah.</v>

243
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.230
For a while. I've been to him since he was four. When he was in 45,

244
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.070
I was watching him. I was like, I was like,

245
00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:18.750
we're probably gonna end up fighting each other when we was at 45 and he went to

246
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:22.390
55 and it was like saying he's a big 45 and I mean 55.

247
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.710
He make these 55 guys look small. He's pretty. He's huge. Yeah.

248
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.430
He's I love watching the style. Yeah. He's had one.

249
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.830
<v 0>One bad fight where it didn't go his way. That was the fight against Barb.</v>

250
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.020
But he just, he stood with barbboza,

251
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:39.700
which is just a terrible idea for most people. Barbbos a kick. So good. Yeah.

252
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.260
He's a, he's the fastest switch kicker I've ever seen in my life. Yeah.

253
00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:44.700
You never seen anybody throw a switch kick.

254
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.220
<v 1>I never did. I always try to. I always try.</v>

255
00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:50.020
Like I watch his fights and then I always try to go to the gym and mimic it.

256
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.420
I'm like, yeah, it's not &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah.

257
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:55.130
I can't be doing this &lt;laugh&gt; I don't even know how he can balance that.
