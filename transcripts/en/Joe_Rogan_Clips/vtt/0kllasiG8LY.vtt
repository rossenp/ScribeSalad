00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Ackroyd's crazy.</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.420
<v 1>In the UFO's he's like one of the main celebrities they,</v>

3
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:11.730
they pull up when people start talking about, uh, like UFO, real believers,

4
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:16.380
he's done like little clips where he narrates things, do UFO shows and.

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.613
He blows.

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.030
<v 2>Well, didn't they just release that.</v>

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.270
There's even more belief now by your phones. Ah.

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.650
<v 1>Yeah, it's fun. I don't know if it's real, but uh, it's fun.</v>

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.880
That's how I feel.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.400
<v 2>Doug. I did a podcast with Jim Florentine and I explained to Jim Florentine</v>

11
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.360
that what people don't know is that Hudson county,

12
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:42.410
New Jersey more than New Jersey is the number one place in the country where

13
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:47.210
they have the most UFO sightings, really Northern New Jersey.

14
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.120
Look it up. Jamie, if you get a minute, please not to be rude,

15
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.080
but isn't that like near a couple of airports? No, it's closer to like,

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.741
you know,

17
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.500
like when you live on New York city on and you look at the Hudson river,

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.260
they say that people go on their balconies and drinking coffee.

19
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.570
They talk on the phone and they'll see a little flying saucer goodbye.

20
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.370
And I know for a fact that in 1976 little one,

21
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.530
whatever the they are, I know for a fact that in 1975 and 1976,

22
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:16.940
you could check me out on this. Are you a full landed in Hudson county park?

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.230
I was a kid. And the next day the feds locked off the park, that yellow tape,

24
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.920
they had samples go look it up dog. They said you at fault.

25
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.900
There's a that's you see that? That,

26
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.430
that that's called the north Bergen is where I'm from. That's called.

27
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:34.610
I forget what it's called. But it was so there was, it's a circular building.

28
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.510
So they did so much Coke there in the eighties. They called this the grinder.

29
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.560
<v 3>That's what they called it because it was shaped like the Stonehedge Stonehedge.</v>

30
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.680
I.

31
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.400
<v 2>Have a couple of friends that lived there.</v>

32
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.710
People that lived in that building have seen UFO's for years.

33
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:53.030
And if you go to YouTube, there's an actual Northwestern park UFO.

34
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.960
They dug up. They even, they came out the Mar there's a liquor store.

35
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.660
And the liquor store guy says you seen the lights.

36
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.270
You heard like the organ music that they play.

37
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.720
They landed a couple of Martians,

38
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.200
got out and took samples and got back in the thing and took off.

39
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.130
There's a YouTube, Danglies a history channel, special about it.

40
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.960
And I still remember being a young.

41
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.540
<v 3>Kid. Did you find anything? Jamie, not GIF.</v>

42
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.230
<v 4>That that was what's popping up all this stuff about that building and</v>

43
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.270
anything that says that UFO landed that that's the story I'm reading right now

44
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.860
is what he's saying. Yeah.

45
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.010
<v 2>And witnesses, you know, it's not just one guy that says,</v>

46
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:31.850
I don't know who you are at fault.

47
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.450
It's people who got knocked on the door and said, do, did you see anything?

48
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.410
Anything at 11, 10 at night? I said, you know what? That,

49
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.950
what lights flashing outside?

50
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.390
They contact the police departments to see if there was any, they went full 10.

51
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.540
The FBI came in, circled. The park closed.

52
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:52.070
It was by the little league field and Hudson county. But it is like,

53
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.000
you'd think it was area 51. You think it was closer to the Northern Las Vegas.

54
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.940
The number one place to see UFO's is Northern New Jersey.

55
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.920
They even made a reference to it.

56
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.710
And the Sopranos when he said something and he goes,

57
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.030
what are you talking about last week?

58
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.800
You said you going to your phone and Hackensack.

59
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.710
<v 1>Because that's where they're at. Hackensack.</v>

60
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.700
<v 2>Boondocking. All those you're going to have more in New Jersey.</v>

61
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.370
A lot of ugly people, a lot of people with big heads. The only good thing.

62
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.230
<v 3>Back in New Jersey is Segovia Spanish restaurant. It's.</v>

63
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.080
<v 2>Been there since 19 slim Mansky. I don't know.</v>

64
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.300
But that's the only good thing about Monache.

65
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:33.190
I think those people in Monache been abducted and they put them back

66
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.024
as big headed.

67
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.760
<v 3>I did a gig there a couple of times. Oh yeah.</v>

68
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.070
<v 2>They used to be like a bar. There's a bar that did something.</v>

69
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.780
<v 1>Was that a Bob Gonzo gig?</v>

70
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.140
<v 2>Yes. Outside of the sea club. Well, that's it. Yeah. It's outside. No, no, no.</v>

71
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.420
I think Bob is more down.

72
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.720
<v 3>The shore and stuff, but, well, he had gigs, all the gigs all over Bob.</v>

73
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.310
<v 2>How I met Bob was he did a gig in Romanos Italian restaurant in my hometown.</v>

74
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.210
And my buddy's like, Hey, aren't you a comedian? Let's take you up there.

75
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.270
And we went up there and Bob was like, I don't know. You know, he said,

76
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:04.900
I'm known and next to him. Bob came up and was like, oh, I gotta put you out.

77
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.130
Cause my friend just threatened me.

78
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.390
So Bob put me up and we've become friends ever since. That's awesome.

79
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.290
I think I follow him on Facebook. We have a chat from time to time on Facebook,

80
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.100
but yeah, for you UFO looking at into Northern New Jersey,

81
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.220
that's stop mother load of them.

82
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.270
<v 1>That's interesting. I had read that before,</v>

83
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:29.100
but I kind of go 51 51 UFO sightings in 2018.

84
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.290
I, as a you get biased because the story is always

85
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.440
some person in the woods and they get abducted.

86
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:40.320
They see a UFO in some strange town in the middle of nowhere,

87
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:44.130
the aliens land of duck people. You always think about it being a rural thing.

88
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.840
But if I was an alien.

89
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.410
<v 3>Of course, I'd go to New York city. Of course, I go to New Jersey. What the?</v>

90
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.340
Why wouldn't.

91
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.270
<v 1>You? You want to go see the craziest thing we have. You got like</v>

92
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.860
7 million people stuffed together on a tiny island.

93
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.330
And in comparison to the rest of the planet of stuffed stacked on top of each

94
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:06.990
other awesome, amazing buildings and all these lights at times square.

95
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.470
Look at all these people mulling around traveling over these bridges to get to

96
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:13.620
this one. Hub is one hive of humanity. Of course.

97
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.190
<v 3>If I was an alien, I would check that out. Why would I look at a barn?</v>

98
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.000
You know what I mean? You.

99
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.710
<v 2>Used to have a joke that the United States is the Tijuana of outer</v>

100
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:26.310
space and space like that. Like, what are we doing this week? I'm on a,

101
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.950
they come down when they're up and they want to see a show.

102
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.290
<v 1>That was the whole bit is that I think aliens come here when they're high,</v>

103
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.610
they just get up. They're like, come on, let's go, go check out the monkeys.

104
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.170
This go, dude, come on. Let's have duck duck. A couple of them have a good time.

105
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.083
That's good. See.

106
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.390
<v 2>I never saw a UFO or I.</v>

107
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.280
<v 1>Want to, I never have though.</v>

108
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.670
<v 2>I want to see it land. And I want to see one of those green dudes get out.</v>

109
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.550
<v 1>So yeah, I think I S I thought I saw some when I was a kid, but as I got older,</v>

110
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.720
I thought that was like a fighter jet or something. That's what that was like,

111
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:05.750
there was something, God, it's a real sketchy memory.

112
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:06.560
It's one of those memories.

113
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.750
<v 3>That's like barely active. But I remember.</v>

114
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.920
<v 1>Thinking for like a day or two, when I was a little kid, maybe I saw UFO,</v>

115
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.640
but I think I was trying to convince myself of it. You know, I was bored,

116
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.260
but I think it was a jet. I think it was something, something fast and unusual.

117
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.730
Have you ever seen one of those stealth bombers that looks like a UFO?

118
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.560
You're seeing one of those things in the sky? No. Yes. It looks like a star.

119
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.360
<v 2>Wars. When you go to like a blue angel thing, those points.</v>

120
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.730
<v 1>No, those are like, I think those are F eighteens. That's what I think it is.</v>

121
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.300
I think that's what that is. I flew in one of those. I had a bit about that too.

122
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.800
Yeah. You got to do that. You hold onto the hand. You gotta do you hook either.

123
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.210
You either hold onto your handle.

124
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:53.110
If you're steering the plane or you hold onto your straps. If you're a pastor,

125
00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:55.780
I was a star. I was in the passenger seat. So I grabbed the whole,

126
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.550
my straps and you have to go like this

127
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.790
and you have to force blood in your brain. Stay awake. That's how much G-Force,

128
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:06.520
you're going through. It's insane. Wash.

129
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.810
<v 2>Blood and your brain to stay awake. That's that's one of those stealth bombers.</v>

130
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.890
I saw one of those in the air over, I guess it's Edwards air force base.

131
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.310
Is that what.

132
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.970
<v 1>The one? It is? That's his, Edward's the one that's out near Palmdale.</v>

133
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.430
I think that's it. Yeah.

134
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.420
Cause we used to film fear factor in Palmdale and we saw that they fly overhead

135
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:26.680
like that. Look at that thing.

136
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.010
Tell me that doesn't look like it's from another planet when you're on the

137
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:34.930
ground and you see that fly overhead. You're like, what the is that?

138
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.810
So I think that's responsible for a bunch of the things that people saw.

139
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.280
I think it's military craft. Can.

140
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.330
<v 2>I ask you a question on that article? You pulled up to 51 sightings,</v>

141
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:49.540
what type of sightings do you have? This thing? What is considered,

142
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.160
what is considered a siding?

143
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.470
<v 1>Well, the thing is like, you just see, but how do you know?</v>

144
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.110
What are you doing in it? These are the sightings. Okay.

145
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.550
We'll go back to that video. Look at that thing. I mean, come on.

146
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.010
If you're just sitting on the ground, you saw that you liked their comment.

147
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.910
The galleons are coming. That does not look like it's from this world.

148
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.650
That thing is madness.

149
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.020
<v 2>Especially with those two guys next to him, God.</v>

150
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.310
<v 1>It's beautiful dough. It's like what? A, an amazing design,</v>

151
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.270
that thing flying through, it looks like something on a keyboard. You know,

152
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:26.080
it's like a symbol on a keyboard and it's just flying perfectly through the

153
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.780
ADAT. Looks like the future. I mean,

154
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:31.360
that really does look like it's from another world.

155
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.460
I would imagine like little blue dudes and black eyes talking to each other and

156
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:41.260
that night going through wormholes and.

157
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.320
I mean, that's what that thing looks like. And what's the,

158
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.330
what's the thing that they're going to have a hundred years from now.

159
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.850
Just imagine that. Yeah.

160
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.860
<v 2>I just want to know what the,</v>

161
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.940
what the logistics is for it to be considered a legitimate,

162
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.230
a legitimate citing legitimate site and legitimate site.

163
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.350
<v 1>This means that someone saw it. You know why you don't like if you're a lawyer,</v>

164
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.431
okay. And you see something,

165
00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:07.640
and then you convince yourself that what you saw was something extraordinary.

166
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.550
And you need to have the feeling that you're looking at something from another

167
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:11.384
world.

168
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.800
But if it's just some drone or some military vehicle,

169
00:09:15.801 --> 00:09:17.870
and then you look at it and then you convince yourself,

170
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:19.820
then it becomes a bigger and bigger deal in your head.

171
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.380
That's a problem with people.

172
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.810
It doesn't mean that everybody that sees something is seeing that,

173
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.930
but people are kind of full of. Well, let's see you see,

174
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.900
let's say there's a one 800 call Marsha. All right.

175
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.090
<v 2>I see a thing. I call that one 800 call call Martian. Okay. Whatever the.</v>

176
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.520
1-800-MARSHES, right? The fall off stop ringing. Okay.

177
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:42.860
The phone won't stop to stop ringing. It will never stop ringing.

178
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.510
It'd be people talking to Martians.

179
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.050
My concern is when do they consider it a credible?

180
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.580
What does it take for it to be credible for me, for it to be credible.

181
00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:55.990
I got to see the land. My.

182
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.450
<v 1>Uh, my take is usually military guys. Um, when,</v>

183
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.610
when you have military fighter pilots,

184
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.940
that's an extraordinary human that's. Uh, you know,

185
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:09.500
if you can be one of those guys that flies one of those B12, B twos to,

186
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:13.480
for them to trust you with that billion dollar spaceship, dude, you gotta be,

187
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.690
uh, an exceptional human. There's no room for someone who's full of.

188
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.930
You're going to be a top flight fighter pilot.

189
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:25.520
You're going to fly around with gunfights in the sky because that's what they

190
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:27.650
do. They have gunfights in the sky.

191
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:30.710
Those guys are exceptional human beings.

192
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.050
So when they see something,

193
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.310
that's when I listened for sure everybody else. I'm not that,

194
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.280
not that I wouldn't listen, but I don't know. You know, you might be crazy,

195
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.400
but if, and you might be crazy, even if you're in the military,

196
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:46.100
you might be crazy. If you're a fighter pilot, it's a hundred percent positive.

197
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.911
<v 2>It's fighter pilots.</v>

198
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:50.480
And all those air force pilots had to do test runs or whatever. They, they see.

199
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.830
They say that they certain things.

200
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.660
<v 1>A bunch of signings. None of that thing,</v>

201
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.560
a bunch of sightings is a bunch of sightings from these really credible guys.

202
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.590
What is it? Fleet of UFO's followed us. Aircraft.

203
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:05.360
Navy pilot says May 29th. See these guys that are talking about these things,

204
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.180
these aren't guys with histories of embellishing things. There's a, I mean,

205
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:14.900
they have this, whatever that is, is that radar, what are they looking at?

206
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.560
Is that infrared? Like, what is the screen that they're looking for?

207
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.710
Does it say what kind of image it is? Cause it's like a weird look.

208
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:23.720
It's not like a photograph, right? It's like a weird

209
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.180
computer image because it's, um, it's,

210
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.960
it's detecting it right with some piece of equipment, right?

211
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.200
Isn't it like tracking on radar or something like that.

212
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.573
<v 4>I know what you're saying.</v>

213
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.800
Cause I feel like I've heard that description of it too. But this,

214
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.090
this article just says it's video of two aerial encounters. That's tremendous.

215
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.290
<v 1>It doesn't look very clear. Why isn't it clear? My phone does a better job.</v>

216
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:48.860
They're.

217
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.980
<v 4>Not very good cameras on those. I mean, they have good. I mean,</v>

218
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.120
they don't have good ones,

219
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.060
but like in order to catch movement at that high speed up there, yada yada,

220
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.913
all that stuff.

221
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.130
<v 1>Oh, so it would require some exceptional gear, I.</v>

222
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.280
<v 4>Think. And it could also been at night. I don't know what time of day it was.</v>

223
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.730
<v 1>So convenient, so convenient that they never have a clear picture. That,</v>

224
00:12:08.731 --> 00:12:12.660
that drives me crazy. It drives me crazy. Cause if it is real,

225
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.160
I am I'm. I love, I want it to be real, honestly.

226
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.840
I really do. But when I look at ICO, God, so many people are so crazy.

227
00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:22.860
And so many people are so full of.

228
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.680
<v 2>You personally believe in soda.</v>

229
00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:30.120
Why don't don't that there's other galaxies out there. There has.

230
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.660
<v 3>To be. Well, it definitely the galaxies, other civilizations civilizations.</v>

231
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.590
<v 2>Some form somewhere out of the nine planets has got to be dude,</v>

232
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.280
there was something I don't know what I'm not going to sit here and tell you

233
00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:44.580
what that called or whatever. But there has to be something at this point,

234
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:45.270
you have to believe.

235
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:50.010
<v 1>That the universe too big, it's just too big to discount to say, Nope,</v>

236
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.480
doubt it. Like that's so crazy to say because we haven't seen it yet.

237
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.680
It's so big.

238
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.840
<v 4>Explanation of what he caught and what.</v>

239
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.590
<v 1>He said that though, tracking equipment,</v>

240
00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:05.520
radar and infrared cameras on his aircraft detected UFO's both times he was

241
00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:08.820
unable to capture them on his helmet camera. Okay.

242
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.440
<v 4>So maybe he couldn't look at it, get it and good vision or whatever,</v>

243
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.370
or that's a good reason why I.

244
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.860
<v 1>Would imagine as fast as those things are going,</v>

245
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:21.090
it must be really hard to get a camera,

246
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.840
to be able to constantly focus in and out. And that's interesting.

247
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.550
<v 2>He says that Lieutenant Ryan Grimes, graves, graves, whatever,</v>

248
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.710
a squadron of UFO followed his Navy strike group up and down the Eastern

249
00:13:34.711 --> 00:13:38.760
coast of the U S for months, that's I'm telling you that little,

250
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.420
I read something about the Hudson river,

251
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.660
that all those people that live across the Hudson river,

252
00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:49.710
whether on the Weehawken Edgewater side or the west side of Manhattan,

253
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.400
those are where the people on that balcony see all that. Look.

254
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.850
<v 1>At this. We did have issues with them. And we went to the middle east,</v>

255
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.390
Lieutenant graves said, Ooh,

256
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.680
imagine them following the war. Imagine if you were there were aliens.

257
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.480
And they came down to follow the war.

258
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:10.590
So they see the war going on and how crazy Afghanistan come down and they're

259
00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:11.424
checking it.

260
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.860
<v 4>Just to go on the cynical side of this.</v>

261
00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:17.010
They're not necessarily saying they are an alien ship.

262
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.830
They're saying it's a UFO. So it's something they're not sure of.

263
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.640
What if there's some sort of awesome drone that some middle Eastern company has

264
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.880
an, it can just follow or possibly test or something.

265
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.300
<v 1>I don't know. It would be the more likely explanation, right?</v>

266
00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:33.270
Terrestrial would be more likely that someone has advanced.

267
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.140
We know they have advanced. I mean, we know they have incredible drones.

268
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.760
You know what I mean? The stuff that they can.

269
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.860
<v 2>No, they got drone</v>

270
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.060
that green Berets are seals.

271
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.490
You put razorblades on him and they slit your throat when you're driving.

272
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.820
Whoa. That's how good the technology is on those troubles.

273
00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.610
<v 1>Jesus Christ. I wouldn't be shocked if they could do all kinds of things.</v>

274
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.390
<v 2>Me standing there and they could take the adrenaline to just come down,</v>

275
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.210
they put razorblades on him or some.

276
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.710
<v 1>Well, you could totally see someone having a small drone, like a small thing,</v>

277
00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:14.470
like the size of a cheeseburger that has poison in it.

278
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.440
And you just slam it into somebody's. You could,

279
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.750
I could see that this [inaudible] what you're seeing.

280
00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:24.910
When you're seeing stuff that's flying around the sky,

281
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.010
most likely is made by a person.

282
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.580
Cause people make stuff and people know how to make stuff that flies around the

283
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:33.880
sky. But then when you get this like defies physics,

284
00:15:33.881 --> 00:15:36.610
like some of the things these fighter pilots, see that's when he got to go,

285
00:15:36.611 --> 00:15:41.590
wait a minute, you see these extraordinary feats of

286
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.870
traversing distances. Like they can get from one place to another place.

287
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.340
So fast, it looks like they disappear. This is something they all talk about.

288
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.940
They all talk about the insane speed at which these things can go.

289
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:59.050
They can just change angles. They can just go and then take a tarred, right?

290
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.150
Angle turn. They can do stuff that, nothing that we know how to make,

291
00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:08.680
can do. That's where it gets to be like, whoa, like nothing sounded like,

292
00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:11.200
it's like, oh, that's like a fighter jet, but like really fast.

293
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.040
You know what I'm saying? It's like an alien car. Oh, it's like a car,

294
00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:18.100
but it's way faster. You know, it's an alien car,

295
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.810
but this is not like anything that we make, these things. They fly this way.

296
00:16:22.811 --> 00:16:27.370
They say flat like a, like a plate hovering over the ground. Or,

297
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.710
but when they go to fly, when they go to take off,

298
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.680
they flip up sideways and they have like,

299
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.460
the bottom of the spaceship is pointing towards where it wants to go.

300
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.500
And it does something to space and time make some sort of magnetic

301
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:45.520
gravity connection, insert big spooky words, whatever they know.

302
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.590
They don't know how the it does it. Right?

303
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.750
Push this thing can go like insane distances and insanely small amounts of time.

304
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.710
Then when they all report the same kind of behavior of these.

305
00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.450
So many of these reports are like that.

306
00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:01.450
They're talking about this thing that goes insanely fast turns on its side.

307
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.940
They lived like a tic TAC. It looks like a saucer.

308
00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:06.910
It looks like they're trying to figure out what the the shape is because it's

309
00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:11.170
moving so fast, but it's doing stuff that nothing we know how to make can do.

310
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.490
I don't know if it's from another planet it might be from here. That's exciting.

311
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.080
It's exciting. I, I want it to be from another planet. That's what I want.

312
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:24.010
Like unbiased. Like what? My honest, what I, what I would love.

313
00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:28.540
It just be completely honest. I would love it if it was aliens, but it was,

314
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:32.500
people have even more scared because my God people can do that.

315
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.310
People can do that. And no one knew like,

316
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.840
so if you could imagine a person who can make a spaceship that

317
00:17:40.841 --> 00:17:45.220
defies all of the rules that we know about

318
00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:49.090
travel about air travel, they can make something that defies all that.

319
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.480
And somehow now that keep the whole development and production of it a

320
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:57.270
secret and then have this thing and take it off.

321
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.980
And no one knows how the they did it.

322
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.220
That's almost more impressive than aliens because

323
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:10.170
that's what these things are doing is if these pilots are accurately reading

324
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:13.020
what's happening and they're telling the truth.

325
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.460
The thing that's remarkable is their stories are very consistent.

326
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.140
There's a lot of very similar stories from different people that they're make a

327
00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:26.790
living flying super fast war ships. You know, they see things,

328
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.940
they know what the they're looking at. They see something they don't know.

329
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.480
They're like, what in the is that? When they see something like that,

330
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.480
that freaks me out. That's when it gets me.

331
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.470
Cause when some kids riding his bike to school and he looks up and he sees the

332
00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:43.620
UFO, okay, maybe it did happen. Maybe it did happen.

333
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.400
Maybe the kid's being a hundred percent honest or maybe he was bored.

334
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.240
Maybe he was bored and decided to make up a crazy story and stuck with it.

335
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:52.530
And then after a while telling it,

336
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:56.550
maybe he believed in himself that happens to people, see things.

337
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:57.361
They don't know what they're seeing.

338
00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:00.180
And they decide that it's a different thing. I've said this before,

339
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:04.320
but it's a true story. When I was in, in Alberta there's wolves there.

340
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.250
And I thought I saw a Wolf for like a whole second. It was a squirrel.

341
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.920
It was a squirrel, but I saw gray for movement,

342
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.660
Wolf squirrel.

343
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.760
Like if you're dumb or if you're compromised or if

344
00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:24.480
you're, you know, you're a little drunk, maybe a little tired, you know,

345
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:27.980
maybe just saw something that looked really weird because of, you know,

346
00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:32.280
w whatever weather conditions that are affecting some part of the world,

347
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:36.330
you live in these things called ball, lightning flies through the air. You know,

348
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:38.040
it's a, it looks like a UFO. You ever see that.

349
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.140
It's like a real natural phenomenon.

350
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.980
Somebody might see something like that and then add a bunch of other to it.

351
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.220
And that's where you get a lot of these stories and you get like natural

352
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:51.870
phenomenon and then people adding a bunch of to things. But then on top of that,

353
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:56.370
you have credible stories and you can't throw out any of them. Like you gotta,

354
00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.010
when you look at all these things,

355
00:19:59.011 --> 00:20:02.880
you can't decide just cause there's a bunch of crackpot stories about UFO's that

356
00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:06.630
the ones by legitimate fighter pilots, that those aren't real.

357
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.510
Can't look at it that way. It's crazy to look at it that way,

358
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.910
because it's more likely there's something out there than there isn't

359
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:16.560
something out there. It's way more.

360
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.630
<v 2>Likely when I was a kid and that happened, Hudson county park, I wrote it off.</v>

361
00:20:20.631 --> 00:20:23.570
I didn't even pay attention. I remember riding my bike up there,

362
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.780
seeing the fed tape and seeing people with those, uh,

363
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.010
orange protective suits on, because I didn't, I was like,

364
00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:32.570
these people them out of my mind.

365
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.500
Then one night I got high five or six years ago.

366
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.330
And I saw it if somebody had posted on Facebook or YouTube and I

367
00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:46.310
read more and more into it and I discounted it until I read the accounts of

368
00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:49.330
the 28 people. Yeah.

369
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.570
In that building the liquor store,

370
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.990
it was a guy who had just got dropped off a bus from New York.

371
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.720
There's buses drop you off there from New York.

372
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.470
The bus driver said there was a flash. He couldn't, you know,

373
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.480
there were just so many people with, uh, stories that, you know,

374
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.220
they didn't see a guy get out. Only three people. So people get out,

375
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.580
everybody else discounted the lights and the noise and other that went with

376
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.680
it. I would've shipped my pants.

377
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.230
If I lived in that building and saw pretty little Martians get out,

378
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:28.060
or it could just be hold, hold on. Who knows? Who gives a? Yeah,

379
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.800
man. You just wanted to tell you that that's where it.

380
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.210
<v 1>And get freaked out and they can, you know,</v>

381
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.570
they can think all kinds of things that didn't really happen.

382
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.180
<v 2>Hey, one night I was on acid. I thought it was a,</v>

383
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.740
I put the FBI was out there with dogs the next day it was a fire hydrant.

384
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.850
I dumped the ounce of Coke down a toilet. Oh my God.

385
00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:51.720
Because I hallucinated because when you do an Coke, more than 10 hours,

386
00:21:51.721 --> 00:21:54.600
you start hallucinating. I started hallucinating.

387
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.160
It was dogs and it was a fire hydrant. You know how stupid I felt the next day.

388
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.530
<v 3>Pretty stupid. Oh.</v>

389
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.730
<v 2>Pretty stupid. I sat there and I went over and pet a dehydrated. You</v>

390
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:08.483
you.

391
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.950
<v 1>This is a problem with any story, like all these UFO stories.</v>

392
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.990
It's people's memory. Memory is not that good. It's just not that good.

393
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.280
It's too hard to figure out what it actually looked like after he saw it.

394
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.200
Like you see something crazy, look a year ago, and then you try to describe it.

395
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.160
It's too hard to describe. Like you barely remember it.

396
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.050
Your V your version of it is a rehashed version that you keep repeating to

397
00:22:37.051 --> 00:22:38.370
yourself. You know,

398
00:22:38.371 --> 00:22:42.840
if you saw something like save your hiking and you saw a Wolf, right?

399
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.440
If you saw that Wolf, when you try to describe that,

400
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.410
that moment you saw that Wolf years later, like what,

401
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.500
what are you actually seeing when you go into your memory?

402
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.200
How much do you help accurate,

403
00:22:55.201 --> 00:22:59.550
as it were always lying about how accurate our memory is. It's not that good.

404
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.020
I'll give you, you did see a Wolf, which is an extraordinary moment, right?

405
00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:06.960
You're in the forest. It's a Wolf that's off.

406
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.300
And you see a real Wolf looking down on you,

407
00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:13.560
a wild in the woods of Canada, just looking at you,

408
00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:16.200
staring at you on a trail. That's an extraordinary moment.

409
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.220
But if you try to recount that in your mind, 10 years later,

410
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.630
what do you actually see? How much do you actually see you? See,

411
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.980
there's a blurry, weird Misty version.

412
00:23:28.981 --> 00:23:32.640
And you've got some words that fall into place that can describe it.

413
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.570
But how accurate is your memory? It's terrible.

414
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.460
<v 2>How accurate is your memory? It's good.</v>

415
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.870
<v 1>With statistics. Like, I can tell you about fights. I can,</v>

416
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.330
I can tell you what year someone fought can tell you how this guy won and how he

417
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:50.630
beat this many guys with the triangle. And I remember things,

418
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.340
but if I actually have to remember that, would it actually look like in my head,

419
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:58.280
I can't really pull that up. I barely could pull it up. I see it.

420
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.440
I'll recognize it again. You know,

421
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.490
like you show me Joe Schilling knocking out Melvin Manhoef and Bella tour.

422
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:09.560
I signed it. I said, watch that Kao. So many times the wild, crazy slug Fest.

423
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.450
And if I see it, I'm watching it happen in a video.

424
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:18.530
I remember it. Yep. This is how it goes. Here. It goes, boom. He Kaos him.

425
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.610
But if I had to just pull that out of my brain right now, it's not good.

426
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.100
Do you know what I'm saying? Like if I had to, like,

427
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.690
if I have to like close my eyes and pretend I saw Mike Tyson

428
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.280
knockout, Michael Spanx,

429
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.540
I kind of can see blue flashes.

430
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.930
I can kind of remember weird little parts of it. You know,

431
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:41.060
I remember the final right-hand boom.

432
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.090
He just sends them flying through the ropes. It was chaos. It was just like,

433
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:47.870
he's the best ever. But if I had to like play it back in my head,

434
00:24:47.871 --> 00:24:49.750
it wouldn't be nearly as good as a video of right.
