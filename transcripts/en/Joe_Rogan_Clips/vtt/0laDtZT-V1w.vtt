1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.281
<v 0>Especially,</v>

2
00:00:00.281 --> 00:00:03.160
cuz now we're bending all these rules and names and terms and all this.

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.800
It's like the no people.

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.840
I think we there's such an escapism from like the true nature of, of,

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.560
of men and women. People don't wanna talk about it anymore.

6
00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.360
Like it doesn't exist. It's a denial.

7
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.280
<v 1>Of biology. It's.</v>

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.440
<v 0>So crazy to me. Well,</v>

9
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:18.640
it's almost like this whole Kavanaugh thing and all this and I don't wanna even

10
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.870
get into all that it's a Diatri in sense.

11
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.750
But the one thing I will say that I don't think anybody talks about is the

12
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.070
sexual and social psychology of men and women.

13
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.990
Nobody wants to talk about when you are developing as a young teen,

14
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:32.824
especially a boy,

15
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.670
and you're learning about sexuality and you're confused and embarrassed and

16
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:39.430
scared and the way that men and women interact in that year from,

17
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.220
in those years from like ELVE to like 16,

18
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.420
it's insanely unstable because women are not as, uh,

19
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.060
not as hormonalally aggressive technically at that time than men are. Right?

20
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.580
So these men are hormonal freaks and they want to do things with these women,

21
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:58.300
but they're not supposed to kind of, and it's like, kind of okay.

22
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.420
And they don't know how to do it.

23
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:03.530
And they're these weird blurred lines of women wanna be accepted and cool in

24
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.530
their com in their circles. So, you know,

25
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.930
it's like when someone hooks up with someone early on when poop,

26
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.690
two people hook up young and it's like, Ooh, and it's sketchy and weird.

27
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.650
And sometimes the girl gets labeled a. You know what I mean for no,

28
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:17.450
for no reason. It's like, oh, she's a. Like I remember there was a girl in my,

29
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.290
when we were what, um,

30
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.320
juniors and she was dating a year and they had had sex you're right.

31
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.000
And it was like, she's a SLU. It's like, she's not a.

32
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.320
Everybody wants to do this thing. But there are these weird subset rules,

33
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.080
but every guy that does it, that's just what we want to do. But I don't,

34
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.080
we there's no explanation over like how we got to the point of getting

35
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.440
comfortable there because men are just these horny freaks that don't know what

36
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:41.320
to do with the thing.

37
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.790
So there are so many blurred lines of sexuality and relationships at that age.

38
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.430
Nobody wants to talk about it. Well.

39
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.710
<v 1>It's also the Puritan culture and religion. Right? Right.</v>

40
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:53.430
There's two things that set women up in this terrible place where if they given

41
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.790
to their hormonal urges, they're somehow tainted. Right. You know, you,

42
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.550
when I was in high school, everybody knew this and I'm sure you knew this too.

43
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.700
Everybody knew Catholic school girls. We're the biggest.

44
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.500
<v 0>Freaks. First time I had anal Catholic school girl, Paula &lt;laugh&gt; first.</v>

45
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.660
<v 1>And second time because they're, they're suppressed. Yes.</v>

46
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.740
They're you're making diamonds. Okay. Yeah. You're taking that carbon.

47
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.620
You're putting it under a mountain and a Diamond's gonna come out of it.

48
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.860
&lt;laugh&gt; you know, I mean it's Catholic school girls. Right.

49
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.650
And it's all over the country. Where' up? Chicago. Chicago. Yeah.

50
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:27.930
Jamie Columbus. Yeah. Catholic school girls. Oh, I went to Catholic school,

51
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.610
so yeah. Oh, talk to us. &lt;laugh&gt; to tell us.

52
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.290
<v 2>Right? Yeah. I mean that some of 'em, uh.</v>

53
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.290
<v 1>Yeah, be nice. Be nice. But they like what.</v>

54
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.610
<v 2>They were under underneath their jumpers. Sometimes they had shorts on.</v>

55
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:40.250
Sometimes they did. Yeah. Yeah.

56
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.890
<v 1>But there was a, there was a marked difference suppression, right?</v>

57
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.600
Between Catholic school girls and regular girls. Yep.

58
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.240
<v 2>Yeah. Well, I mean, I, the public school girls around me would,</v>

59
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.720
is it a whole different thing? So most of them are private school.

60
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.540
<v 1>Girls where I was outside.</v>

61
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.040
The biggest freak that I dated during my high school years was a girl.

62
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.720
It was a wonderful girl, but she went to an all girl Catholics. Of course.

63
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.640
<v 0>She was suppressed completely. Yep. Yeah. Yep.</v>

64
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.440
So when you hold someone a cage like that, what do you think is gonna happen?

65
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.680
It's like, of course when they get out, they're gonna have.

66
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.320
<v 1>Like wild animal, go nuts. This girl was nuts, man. She was wild.</v>

67
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.520
<v 0>But that's but that's so that's what I'm saying. No one wants to talk about,</v>

68
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.120
and again, I'm not trying to dive into Kavanaugh,

69
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.030
but people and they do crazy sh when you are,

70
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.310
hormonalally at your beginnings and you're confused and weird.

71
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.790
I mean guys know when guys start masturbating, it's this disgusting,

72
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:31.870
weird secret, creepy, gross, sad,

73
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.390
like undercover secret that you, yeah. You don't.

74
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.190
<v 1>Tell your friends in your school. Oh, so panics.</v>

75
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.100
<v 0>Off. So, and all of that is swirling inside your head, over sexuality.</v>

76
00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:42.780
And then when you do get the chance with a girl it's uncomfortable,

77
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.900
it's awkward. It's weird. Again, not talking about whatever he did.

78
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.860
I'm just saying you're already in this weird state of men are up when

79
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:53.380
they're sexually reaching this new peak of their life,

80
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.420
that they just wanna like jerk off and come and. And how much.

81
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.340
<v 1>Information are they getting from their parents? Zero. Almost.</v>

82
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.450
<v 0>No, almost none. Almost none. Almost none. That's the thing.</v>

83
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.210
How much guidance are the game? So you don't know border, you don't know rules,

84
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.250
you don't understand. And also our society perpetuates.

85
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:08.330
If you wanna be real honest,

86
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.090
our society perpetuates this weird pulling push of like, you know,

87
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.250
no, I don't want, you know, that song, baby. It's cold outside.

88
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.450
You know that song. How's that going? The Christmas song of baby,

89
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.200
just stay for a, a and really should go. It's cool outside.

90
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:24.680
It's a Christmas song. What song is this? You know what it is?

91
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.200
Jamie knows what the I'm talking about. Know? Yeah you do. Are you sure?

92
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.720
It's a Christmas song and it's, it's called baby. It's cold outside.

93
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:31.720
But the Christmas song about rapes a hundred percent.

94
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.800
It is really I'm dead serious. The, the here he's playing it.

95
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 1>Didn't you play it on YouTube or will we get in trouble?</v>

96
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.680
<v 0>I really can't stay. Uh, yeah. I can't really.</v>

97
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 1>Is an old, I was trying to see if I can find, oh, it's oh, oh,</v>

98
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.390
I do know this song. I do know the song. Yeah. I.

99
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.950
<v 0>Really can't stay. Yeah. Yeah. She's saying I gotta go home.</v>

100
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.110
My parents are gonna say the whole time, he's like, come on,

101
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:50.110
just have one more drink. Just cuz stay out a little bit longer.

102
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.070
<v 1>Oh, he's trying to lube.</v>

103
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.070
<v 0>Her up. Yes. And by the way, terrible person,</v>

104
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:56.790
she ends up staying at the end because she, she wants to be with him the game.

105
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.260
Right? So the thing that nobody wants to talk about at all, and I'm not end,

106
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.460
I'm not saying anything other than this is a perpetuation of our culture for a

107
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:09.780
long time of like this pull and take and tease a tease is a game that women play

108
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.100
and men play too of like, you know, look at that.

109
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:16.460
I really can't say it's cold outside. Gotta go away. This evening has been, uh,

110
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.700
so very nice. My mother will start to worry. My father will be pacing the floor.

111
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.610
I'd rather I'd I'd rather, uh, I'd really better scurry.

112
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.130
Maybe just a half a drink more.

113
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:28.570
That's her finally admitting the neighbors might think what you know,

114
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.490
what's say what's in this drink. Ah, you're.

115
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.970
<v 1>Very pushy. You know, I like to think of it as opportunistic.</v>

116
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.850
<v 0>I simply must go. The answer is no. The welcome has been so nice and warm.</v>

117
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.010
My sister will be suspicious. My brother will be there at the door.

118
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.600
My maidens aunt made is vicious. Well maybe just a cigarette more so. No.

119
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.560
So she's like, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Oh.

120
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.480
<v 1>God. Okay. Fine. Another drink then that.</v>

121
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 0>Took a lot of convincing. Okay. That's the last word that.</v>

122
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.800
<v 1>Took a lot of convincing. Yes.</v>

123
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.040
<v 0>How weird. So what I'm saying is when you is that is, oh my God,</v>

124
00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.480
this gotta be the 19 hundreds, forties, forties.

125
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:09.800
Maybe people just rap people for fifties. 52. Fifty2 52. No,

126
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.080
but he wasn't the original 44.

127
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.520
My point is this has been going on forever and it's real and nobody wants to

128
00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:16.080
talk, had.

129
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.590
<v 1>Nothing to do with the Kavanaugh thing. Right.</v>

130
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:19.830
And here's the thing about the Kavanaugh thing. You know what I mean.

131
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.750
<v 0>By that? Oh no. I do know.</v>

132
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.670
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, but here's the thing.</v>

133
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.990
But even the fact that you have to be defensive right there. Yeah.

134
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.310
Like everybody has to go da what I'm saying. Right. I see what I'm saying.

135
00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:28.070
Right? Right. I'm not supporting rape. I'm not supporting rape.

136
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.350
Even discussing it at all. People were ready to hit you in the head. Of.

137
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.270
<v 0>Course a rock. Of course there's no conversation.</v>

138
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.110
<v 1>To be here. There's a woman who had a brutal take on it.</v>

139
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.300
A brutal there's there's two ways we can look at this.

140
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.340
There's a woman who had a really brutal take on this Leah that was on Jordan.

141
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.740
Peterson's uh, Twitter page. If you go to Jordan Peterson's Twitter page,

142
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.660
there's a woman who is, uh, I don't know what she does,

143
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.460
but she talks about how this woman who is accusing Brett Kavanaugh

144
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.170
goes to this predominantly,

145
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.970
or she teaches at this predominantly women's college where 79% of the students

146
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:06.650
are women. Yeah. The majority,

147
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.410
the vast majority of the professors are women and social justice is the

148
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:15.410
number one thing that they promote at the school, right ahead of education.

149
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:19.200
Have everything. When you look at the schools like li of like what it,

150
00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:23.760
it aims to accomplish and how to educate the students like promoting social

151
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:27.880
justice is one of the primary things. It's the, the first one shy. Yeah.

152
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.880
Above everything else. And,

153
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.200
and the idea is that why would this woman risk everything? And the,

154
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:36.400
what this woman's take is who's criticizing.

155
00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:38.240
This is that she's not risking anything.

156
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.270
She's rewarded from this a hundred percent her culture. This is a big deal.

157
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.350
And she's very cynical about this. She's like this woman has no recollection.

158
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.190
Doesn't remember how she got home. Doesn't remember where the party was.

159
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.110
But does remember that someone may have tried to do something to her.

160
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.110
You know, I'm not a big fan of,

161
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.860
of criticizing people who come out and say someone did something to them or try

162
00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:03.340
to do something to them. Right. Cause you don't know,

163
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.180
you don't know you're on the outside looking in and you're, you're,

164
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:09.660
you're trying to pick holes in their story. I don't even know if they know,

165
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:14.540
cause I don't re I don't hear it is that Yeahmle. If, if you click on the video,

166
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.860
you, you can hear some of what this woman says,

167
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.970
like click on it and play someone with one says 11 minutes long. Uh,

168
00:08:20.971 --> 00:08:22.930
we don't have to notably.

169
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.210
<v 3>By the lifelong friend who supposedly accompanied Blasey Ford and</v>

170
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.410
presumably might have noticed and.

171
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.570
<v 0>Remembered. She sounds, sounds like Jordan Peterson. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.</v>

172
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:34.170
I kinda't think I can play that. Actually probably get kicked off.

173
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.050
<v 1>Got a, yeah, its.</v>

174
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.730
<v 0>Okay. Too new. But the, the,</v>

175
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:39.570
the point is that like there's only two people that know we really happen and

176
00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:41.400
they don't even know what really happened. Well.

177
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.200
<v 1>You're talking about something that happened 35 years ago. I mean, if he,</v>

178
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.440
if she said 35 years ago, this guy raped me. Okay. Yeah. That's a different.

179
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440
<v 0>Story. Well yeah. Well.</v>

180
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.400
<v 1>Yeah, this is not what she's saying. Right? What is she saying?</v>

181
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.040
<v 0>My, from what I understood and by the way,</v>

182
00:08:58.041 --> 00:09:00.040
this is something I distanced myself from. Cuz I, I was just,

183
00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:01.600
it was so overwhelming that I was like, oh God,

184
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.840
that he held her down while the other dude was in the room and he kind of helped

185
00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:06.920
him held, hold her down.

186
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.080
And he had his penis on her or out.

187
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.720
<v 1>Did he, is that what he's saying? Like let's,</v>

188
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.830
let's find this because people got so were mad and we talked about this the

189
00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:16.071
other day.

190
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:18.790
Like you should have done research for you discussed a predatorm like.

191
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.470
<v 0>As, but see that's, what's a I'm not supporting first of all,</v>

192
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:25.510
I'm not supporting him anyway. I'm not, I'm not standing there saying no, no,

193
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.670
but either none of us. But that's the thing is like, when you talk about it,

194
00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:31.030
someone goes you're what do you, what do you in favor of him?

195
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.710
It like exactly what the are you tied to?

196
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.900
You have to have a conversation about what's going on. Otherwise I'm just,

197
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:37.020
I'm just a numb.

198
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.300
<v 1>This is a giant platform. And that if we're discussing in this giant platform,</v>

199
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.260
we should be informed.

200
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.020
I disagree with that because I think that we're just having a conversation.

201
00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:45.140
Yeah. We're just talking about something.

202
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.180
You just happen to be privy to this conversation because millions,

203
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.380
I'm not pretending I am some sort of an export or that I have some sort of

204
00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:54.580
information that you don't, that, that if you have those misconceptions,

205
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.530
let me clear those up right now. I'm a moron talking to another moron. Yeah.

206
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:01.490
Next to another moron. Theres three morons in this room.

207
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.610
They're all dudes talking. Okay. We don't, we don't know Jack. Nah. You know.

208
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.890
<v 0>I know what I, I know, I know my feeling of the whole thing.</v>

209
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.170
I know the feeling of the whole thing is that no matter what anybody it's kind

210
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:14.690
of like, uh, what got in trouble for a norm.

211
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.680
You know when norm when outta trouble, no matter what I think here,

212
00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:20.280
what people are suffering in a bad, bad.

213
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.320
<v 1>Way. Okay. Here, what it says here, um,</v>

214
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.320
it was shortly the most explosive and surreal confirmation hearing since

215
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:27.520
Clarence Thomas and Anita hill in, in 1991,

216
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.240
a nominee from the Supreme court was asked if he was a gang rapist and a

217
00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:35.080
blackout drunk while defending himself by describing how long

218
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.510
heed D his virginity, his accuser described him grinding.

219
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.590
<v 0>Intoinging her mouth covering.</v>

220
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.510
<v 1>Her mouth and fearing that he was accidentally going to kill me,</v>

221
00:10:46.511 --> 00:10:49.630
going to kill me. Okay. Well that's pretty serious. So if he was,

222
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.750
if he was covering her mouth because she was protesting and he was grinding into

223
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:56.670
her, right. That's some pretty dark. Yeah.

224
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.580
<v 0>So the, that, that.</v>

225
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.980
<v 1>Keep going down a little bit. Yeah. Keep scrolling down please.</v>

226
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.660
<v 0>Unlike Ms. Hill, 27 years ago,</v>

227
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:05.900
Dr. Bla a psychology profession in California was treated gingerly and the

228
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.100
polyan so feared. Okay. This is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But, but,

229
00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.020
but that, okay, so that was the.

230
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.060
<v 1>Thursday AB she became a very human being,</v>

231
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:14.020
telling a terrible story about judge Kavanaugh,

232
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:18.010
compelling terms that brought many women to tears and transformed the out for

233
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:22.010
the Supreme court. Okay. Well, see, that's all I needed to hear.

234
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.970
See that the, the kind of person now, look, I don't know if he did this,

235
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.490
but if he did do this, the kind of person that covers a woman's mouth. Yeah.

236
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.530
That's crazy. That's an extra level of darkness. Yeah.

237
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:37.730
You're that's not like trying to kiss her. No,

238
00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:41.400
I was trying grinding against each other covering someone's mouth. Right.

239
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:43.400
That's rape. If he really did that.

240
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.160
<v 0>Yeah. That's what I'm saying. If it is all true, that's what that is.</v>

241
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:47.840
That's him trying to hold her back from something.

242
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.560
<v 1>So, uh, Donald Trump said this, uh, you know,</v>

243
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.200
this famous quote that it's, uh, a tough time for boys, you know? Oh man,

244
00:11:57.201 --> 00:12:00.200
this guy tough time for boys. So a girl made a song.

245
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.360
<v 0>I've that's.</v>

246
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.040
<v 1>I heard that song song is actually very catchy. It's a great song.</v>

247
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.440
It's a good song. And I I'm gonna tweet it. But I'm like, when I,

248
00:12:07.441 --> 00:12:11.040
when I was about to tweet it, I'm like people are gonna get so mad at me. Um,

249
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.310
her name is, uh, on Twitter. It's Mercedes,

250
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.750
L Y N, Z. She has a beautiful voice.

251
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.470
And the song is, it's a scary time for dudes. Scary.

252
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.910
<v 0>Time for dudes. Yeah. Yeah. I listened to it a few times. It's really good.</v>

253
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.270
I mean.

254
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.390
<v 1>Maybe we could play a little bit of it.</v>

255
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.420
Can we play a little bit of it or we get kicked off of you too? Nah,

256
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.140
Jamie's just shaking his head, shaking.

257
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.900
<v 0>His, his head. It's just.</v>

258
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.940
<v 1>That it would get tagged because I'm sure she's trying to monetize. Oh,</v>

259
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:43.940
she's probably got a, a billion views. So anyway, her Twitter page, listen,

260
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.820
you know, and this is the thing men in particular, you're gonna hear this.

261
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.060
You go, oh, you're supporting this and talking men male bashing.

262
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.330
Give you just gimme a little vow. I can't.

263
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.770
<v 4>Open up. I windows when I'm home alone.</v>

264
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.890
I can't go to the farm without a shopone. I can't wait for many skirt.

265
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.770
If it's the only one I own, I can't.

266
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.810
<v 1>Use public. It's look, it's,</v>

267
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.370
she's just going on about how difficult it is to be a girl.

268
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.880
And when you're not a girl, it's not something you consider.

269
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.160
And so all these guys that are like, it's a.

270
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.440
<v 0>Lot of good truth. She she's like, I can't live on the first floor.</v>

271
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.360
I can't just leave my window open at night. Yeah.

272
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:24.080
Like all these things are very, very.

273
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.080
<v 1>True. And it's a good song that she's got. A's beautiful voice. Yeah.</v>

274
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.360
<v 0>Listen, this is the, this is the whole thing that I think we're,</v>

275
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:32.640
we're talking about. You're allowed to see,

276
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.590
to see truth on all sides of all of these issues.

277
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.110
I don't think you ever have to be so staunch about anything.

278
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.550
I disagree with people that are so staunch about just being like,

279
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.790
this is the end of, of the discussion. You're only this way or not. It's like,

280
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.310
no, man. I don't know all the stories. I don't know all the truths of,

281
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.243
of that Kavanaugh.

282
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.590
I don't know all the truths of anything that woman coming forward.

283
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.660
I tend to believe a woman that's gonna outta her way.

284
00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.940
I don't think she's looking for fame.

285
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.620
I don't think any of the girls that came out for Louisie were looking for fame

286
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:00.061
and attention.

287
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:03.660
No one wants attention to have their name Googled and come up with this for the

288
00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:06.300
rest of their life. So I don't, I wouldn't say that. Uh.

289
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.260
<v 1>See, I don't, I wouldn't.</v>

290
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.140
<v 0>Say no one. I, I think most people don't want that kind of. Okay.</v>

291
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.060
Okay. You, you know what you know, most people. Okay. You know,

292
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:16.170
who does want that kind of attention? Uh,

293
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.690
the psycho Apath with the Donald Trump, uh, what's her name?

294
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.410
The porn star with Daniels. Okay. Yeah. I think she,

295
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.170
all she wanted was attention. I'm sorry. I, I like, well,

296
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.050
I thought the guy consensually and all she did was make fun of his penis.

297
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.210
Like she wants money.

298
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.650
<v 1>Yeah, no. Okay. So she's making money from it.</v>

299
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.770
And she's like in her forties and she's still stripping. It's sad.

300
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.010
It's it's not, but these other women's got kids.

301
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.080
<v 0>Okta Ford and these other women. Yeah. They're not doing it for the atten.</v>

302
00:14:39.081 --> 00:14:40.680
They don't, she doesn't want she's doing that.

303
00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:42.200
Cuz there is a truth in there of what happened.

304
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.920
And I believe that I don't know what it is,

305
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.920
but I believe there something up that went down and unfortunately we are in the
