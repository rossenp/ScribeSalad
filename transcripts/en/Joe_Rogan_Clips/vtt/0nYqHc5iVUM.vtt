00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 1>And she's just, she's like a, my buddy. I mean, she's like a ratchet Chucky,</v>

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.480
you know? Well, it's.

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.480
<v 0>The, the uncanny valley that right.</v>

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.480
She's in the uncanny valley where it's not quite a human where I went to

6
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:19.440
Invidia. Once they're a video card, um, video game mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, they,

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.670
they make a O cards for computers,

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.670
like really high end graphics cards and for gamers and stuff like that.

9
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.790
And one of the things that they had was, and this was quite a few years ago,

10
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.790
they had the state of the art fake CGI person that you could kind

11
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.750
of talk to. And it was animated. Yeah. And they were like,

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.580
we're not quite there. Like, we can't do them mouth, like the tongue,

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.900
you can't do the tongue correctly.

14
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.700
<v 1>I'll show you. And because the muscles that's, what's so.</v>

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.780
<v 0>Fascinating. Yeah. There it is. This is, this is what we looked at.</v>

16
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.460
This is exactly the guy that we looked at. And, um,

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.260
is this the video of the show that I did? That's like 2013 face works.

18
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.740
You can look it up. Yeah. That's why,

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.770
so this was the guy and he's also balded because they can't do the hair. Right.

20
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.610
Yeah. But of course this was six years ago. Right. But look how close it is.

21
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:08.090
Look at the skin. That's.

22
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.530
<v 1>Pretty amazing. Like stub. I mean, that's like razor. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.490
And also the eyebrows are really good. Yeah. But it's the.

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.090
<v 0>Eyebrows. It's still uncanny. It's still not quite a person.</v>

25
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.490
There's something wrong, but that's video,

26
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.480
which is better to duplicate than those are. Wrinkles.

27
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.680
<v 1>Are good. Yeah. It's,</v>

28
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:26.600
it's wild because it does make you realize flaws are what makes something look

29
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.280
human. We spend all of our time trying to be without flaws,

30
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.720
but that's actually what sells it.

31
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.360
<v 0>Well, what as a woman, like, how do you feel about that? Like that?</v>

32
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.080
And we've talked about this before with, with, with guys,

33
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.520
guys that use filters on their pictures. It is, I thought.

34
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.393
<v 1>You can say fillers, cuz.</v>

35
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.390
<v 0>Do that too. Now they do that too. That's weird. Yeah. That's weird.</v>

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.950
They're both equally weird. Yeah.

37
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.110
But there's something particularly disturbing to me about guys who use filters.

38
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.950
I mean, I only know.

39
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.430
<v 1>One. I'm glad I'm not single. That's all I'm gonna say. Cause I,</v>

40
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.350
I don't think I, you know, but yeah. I mean it's um, alarming,

41
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.780
but a lot of guys do. I mean guys are also getting Cal implants and and guys,

42
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.300
what, what?

43
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.490
<v 0>Who's getting.</v>

44
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.180
<v 1>Calf implants. I don't think anyone we know, but Cal implants are a thing.</v>

45
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.180
<v 0>No, it's a big deal. Yes. It's a big deal.</v>

46
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.660
<v 1>Mont of course. 15 years ago. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.820
<v 0>I thought that was a joke. I don't believe so. Oh no. I never watched.</v>

48
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.370
<v 1>Entourage. People get CA implants guys are getting facelifts. I all kinds of.</v>

49
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.570
You know, I know guys are getting lip and, but what they.

50
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.330
<v 0>Say, but guys you suck. Get lip, lip injections. That's yes.</v>

51
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.770
<v 1>I would imagine that's a different thing. I don't know.</v>

52
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:36.610
There's I know guys that wear makeup &lt;laugh&gt; guys that wear makeup.

53
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.090
There are some guys that I what's going on here. Is this a CA.

54
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.050
<v 0>These are cats. Plants. Website. Yeah. It's just Google images for cats. Yeah,</v>

55
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.800
we got one of the lower left, but by the way, you can just run Hills you.

56
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.760
<v 1>But when you do this, can you still exercise? Like,</v>

57
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.440
can you grow muscle underneath it?

58
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.520
<v 0>Wow. That guy's calves look very impressive on the right. I do have to say,</v>

59
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.040
I mean, they, they changed him.

60
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.120
<v 1>It's shortcuts. How much of.</v>

61
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.480
<v 0>These? Oh, those. No. So.</v>

62
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.280
<v 1>Fake those look like that fell down.</v>

63
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.320
<v 0>You know what those look like? Like a, a cop, like a athletic cop. Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.320
<v 1>It does. It looks like a, like a fencer. Uh, yeah.</v>

65
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.960
Had to keep from getting kicked in the nuts. Yeah. No,

66
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.600
he did that at the mini mall. And that's.

67
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.040
<v 0>Bad. How about that guy down there?</v>

68
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.830
<v 1>Are those bad or good? Right? There's pretty.</v>

69
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.910
<v 0>Good. Look at this one. That's pretty.</v>

70
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.390
<v 1>Realistic. What does it hang on. It's what I don't understand.</v>

71
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.510
I used to really be into the surgery channel.

72
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.470
<v 0>Well, I mean, it's gotta be like, like.</v>

73
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.030
<v 1>A tip silicone, like a fit tip. Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:34.230
Silicone or water based or something like that.

75
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.790
But how do you live with yourself? I don't know. That feels like a tricky one.

76
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.460
<v 0>Do you're probably just trying to get laid and you're sad anyway. Oh no.</v>

77
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.860
<v 1>How the scars? No. Woo. Oh, it looks like that's some Pinocchio right there.</v>

78
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.380
I don't like that. What's the thing on the left. Has it rotted?

79
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.340
What are all those veins? I think you.

80
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.460
<v 2>Got the implants to take care of.</v>

81
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.380
<v 1>That problem. Well, I'm glad my robots least disturbing thing you've.</v>

82
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.050
<v 0>Seen looks. He has some injuries. Yeah, but you a bit by wolves. This.</v>

83
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.330
<v 1>Is why I got him. And this is cause he got beat. Cause he got eaten by wolves.</v>

84
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.090
<v 0>Yeah. Those looks like where attacked.</v>

85
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.530
<v 2>They sliced right behind his knee and just, just.</v>

86
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.730
<v 0>Dropped him in. But look at his, there was no other options. His legs.</v>

87
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.370
Weren't great. Well, here's the other option. Don't get cath implant.

88
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.530
<v 1>And stop running around. Outside with wolves. Well.</v>

89
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.240
<v 0>Go, go. No, I'm just saying. Yeah. Don't think you really got bit by wolves.</v>

90
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.960
If that does happen. I thought that that's if wolves get you,

91
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:27.600
they usually get you get you. It's very coyotes might do that to your calves.

92
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:28.120
Yeah. There's.

93
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.960
<v 1>No like margin of bear with.</v>

94
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.480
<v 0>Wolves. Yeah. They just break the bones or your leg with one bite.</v>

95
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.680
This guy had an injury. Cause.

96
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.640
<v 2>It's a car accident. He was.</v>

97
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 0>Younger and uh, calves wouldn't grow.</v>

98
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.470
<v 1>Yeah. I think a lot of it's reconstructive. It's just one sentence. Oh yeah.</v>

99
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.830
But a lot of guys get that.

100
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.550
<v 0>I know a guy with Peck implants. He was a skinny guy. Depress implants. Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.790
He got Peck. He got under his,

102
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.710
under his meat of his chest to make his chest poke poke forward more.

103
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:55.790
<v 1>And so is that,</v>

104
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.830
is that something somebody does cuz they can't accomplish it naturally or

105
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.070
they're just lazy and cutting corners.

106
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.380
<v 0>You have to ask them. But the reality is there's things, people,</v>

107
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.380
some people are ectomorphs and ectomorphs are like really thin people that have

108
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:10.340
an incredibly hard time gaining weight. Yeah.

109
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.380
Their body just doesn't metabolism. Yeah. It doesn't grow mass. Yeah. They,

110
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.980
their muscles don't grow. Right? Yeah.

111
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.300
<v 1>Male, plastic surgery is a really big thing now. But putting filters on it,</v>

112
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:20.860
I don't know. That feels like a slippers. I love.

113
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.490
<v 0>That show by love it live for. And uh,</v>

114
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.330
one live for one episode was actually pretty interesting.

115
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:32.290
Whereas a guy had been in an injury and he got his calf destroy or his uh, his,

116
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.050
his breast destroyed his Peck. Yeah. And they had to fix it. How?

117
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.370
I don't know that's wild. He just, he had nothing there.

118
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.000
So he had like one that was like here. There was a guy who was a fighter.

119
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.280
Who's a, a high level UFC fighter. His name is Trey Telman.

120
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.280
He fought VTO Belfort in 1997.

121
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.280
He was veto Belfort's inaugural fight in the UFC.

122
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.240
And we didn't know about VTO when VTO was 19 years old and I knew who he

123
00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:01.160
was. Cause I was training with VTO back then I was, I was uh,

124
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.000
a white belt at Carlson Gracie's school on Hawthorne in uh,

125
00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:08.600
west Hollywood mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so we knew he was this phenomenal talent,

126
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.480
but a lot of people didn't know that he was this incredible boxer.

127
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.680
He had this crazy hand speed. He lit this dude up. But anyway,

128
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.590
Trey Telman was in a car when he was a little kid and uh, he didn't have a Peck.

129
00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:21.190
Like his chest was caved in.

130
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.710
It's very see if you photograph of Trey Teleman the guy was a stud too and

131
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.830
handsome fella too. But everything else just super jacked.

132
00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:33.390
But he had this crazy Peck injury. I mean also look at that. See that.

133
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.980
Oh. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.300
It looks like someone just like scooped out. Well he was a baby I think.

135
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.540
And he was in a car accident had pretty significant injury.

136
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.260
<v 1>That would psych me out. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

137
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.260
<v 0>Yeah. If a guy took his clothes off and you saw that.</v>

138
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.020
<v 1>I mean, I just mean what that's your opponent. You're just like, oh.</v>

139
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.700
<v 0>Right. But he um, um.</v>

140
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.010
<v 1>That's badass. This there's something hot about it. There's this is, this is,</v>

141
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.690
I think there's something primal of like he's survived some right.

142
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:06.570
Stick with him. There's something hot about that.

143
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.730
<v 0>Like that dude from the wire with that scar across.</v>

144
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.850
<v 1>His face. Totally scars.</v>

145
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.170
Any kind of proof of injury proof that you've been in battle is attractive to

146
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:16.450
my, yeah, that's a weird primal brain. I hate myself.

147
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.790
<v 0>For it.</v>

148
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.920
Do you know that the Nazis you used to have dualling scars that were very

149
00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:23.440
popular across the face. It was a big deal. They would all,

150
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:24.400
they would get 'em on purpose.

151
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.720
Like they would get into duals with swords and they would have dualling scars

152
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:32.400
and a lot of the operation paperclip Nazis that we got from, uh,

153
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:36.360
the Soviet where we got from, uh, Germany, rather at the end of world war II.

154
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.710
When you know NASA on a bunch of, uh, German scientists,

155
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.350
a lot of 'em had these horrific Duling scars that they did their face on

156
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.830
purpose. No, they would get in, in,

157
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.590
in boarding school and in military school they would get in fights with swords

158
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.950
and they would cut each other's faces open weren't they on meth.

159
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.990
<v 1>And too. Weren't.</v>

160
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.710
<v 0>They? That was more Thetas for sure. But that was more the Japanese.</v>

161
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.220
That was the Kamakas the Kamas as the way they got them to, uh,

162
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.900
fly into boats and just explode their airplanes the way they got 'em to do that

163
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:09.220
was they were me outta their mind. Jesus America. Yeah.

164
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.140
But try to find a picture of, uh, Nazi Duling scars.

165
00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:16.460
It's crazy because like some guys that were hanging out with Warner VA, uh,

166
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:21.210
Warner Herzog rather. Um, no, we VA bra Warren Zog director, the director, the.

167
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.290
Yeah. We Arvon bra the guy was the head of NASA. When they went to the moon,

168
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.980
he had this,

169
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.530
these guys that were working with him and these giant scars across their face,

170
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.330
huge like, like, was it.

171
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.330
<v 1>Like a scars? Was it like a ritual, like to show your pecking.</v>

172
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.650
<v 0>Order? Yeah. Which showed you were a badass that you, you had gone through,</v>

173
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.200
but it was a big thing with the Nazis and there's some ho photos of these guys,

174
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:45.360
young kids with huge gaping open wounds. See here's here's the photos.

175
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.720
Holy ex yeah. Go zoom in on oh Jesus zoom in on the, uh, yeah. See,

176
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:55.400
this is a guy. This is right after the dueling cults. That's um,

177
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.280
so I was just reading an article on this.

178
00:08:57.281 --> 00:08:59.960
It said that women found it attractive. Yep.

179
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.760
So someone guys actually would do it on purpose. Oh yeah.

180
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.480
They would have Dockers sliced off their cheek. Well,

181
00:09:05.481 --> 00:09:06.960
look at this guy right here with the goggles.

182
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.600
Go to that guy with the goggles right there, right there. Yeah. Look at that.

183
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.550
Yeah.

184
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.600
He's got two big scars on his face and they had the goggles so they can cut

185
00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:17.430
their eyes out. This is before anesthesia. Oh yeah. See. So he is got a,

186
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.830
a plate over his nose to keep his nose intact cuz he couldn't really stitch that

187
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.823
back on,

188
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.550
but they would take these huge scars on their cheeks cuz they would be Duling

189
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:29.470
with real swords and they would have these practice Duling matches and then

190
00:09:29.471 --> 00:09:32.870
they'd have to stitch 'em up. So these guys all had these huge scars,

191
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.910
by the way, when he comes back to cauliflower ears,

192
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.700
a lot of guys did that themselves on per believe. They're stitching 'em up. Who?

193
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.580
Um, a lot of guys, um, did that themselves. They would their ears. Yeah.

194
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:46.380
They would smash theirs on oh yeah. All the time. Cause it makes white belt.

195
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:47.140
White belts. Yeah.

196
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.180
A lot of white belts that wanna be like bad asses they'd smash their ears.
