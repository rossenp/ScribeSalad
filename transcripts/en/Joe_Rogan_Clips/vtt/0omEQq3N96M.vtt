<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 1>But again, I'm a responsible grownup, right?</v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:10.410
I'm 54 years old and I know what I'm doing. Um,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.050
so when we think about some like cocaine, cocaine,

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.920
not the that people sell on the street that's been stepped on.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.330
So like when you go to places like Columbia and you go to the source and you get

7
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:26.010
really good cocaine, like Columbia cocaine is about $7 a gram,

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.270
whereas in New York is, can be anywhere from 60 to a hundred dollars a gram,

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.530
um, uh, and not as good as the product in Columbia.

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.090
So you go to the source countries and you get good stuff. Um,

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
it could be a really good evening with you and your significant other,

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.820
you know, and, um, um, uh,

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.830
all of these sort of stories of people being paranoid about the cops with

14
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.970
cocaine, their reasons to be paranoid if you're doing something wrong,

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.240
they're there. So I get that. I mean, so they're.

16
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.020
<v 0>Also worried about being.</v>

17
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
<v 1>Arrested. That's what I'm talking about. That's exactly what I'm,</v>

18
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.630
that's exactly what I mean. So there's a reason to,

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.240
that's a rational sort of thing. Um,

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.080
but what's irrational is that we are arresting people for what they put in their

21
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:13.914
bodies. Yeah.

22
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.380
<v 0>Yeah. Agreed. Yeah. Agreed wholeheartedly.</v>

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.040
And I always point out that you can go to CVS and buy enough liquor to kill

24
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.010
yourself. Absolutely. 24 7 all day long.

25
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.770
<v 1>It's so easy to do. Absolutely. Yeah. So,</v>

26
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:30.030
but when we think about cocaine and why it's illegal. Yeah. Um,

27
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.900
uh, cocaine came to the United States, uh,

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.590
in a pop for the popular masses in the late 18 hundreds.

29
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.940
And Coca-Cola this guy, John Pennelton, I think his name was,

30
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:46.530
he put it in Coca Cola. Well, this product, a cocoa wine, uh,

31
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.280
and he was out of Atlanta and, uh,

32
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.010
he put it in cocoa wine in

33
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.640
1894, the next year,

34
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.570
Atlanta banned alcohol. So before prohibition,

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.670
alcohol was banned in Atlanta, poor prohibition, Atlanta, just Atlanta.

36
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.700
I mean, cities interesting, various cities bad.

37
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.410
This prohibition happened in 1920, uh, nationwide.

38
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.170
Um, so since they ban, um, alcohol in Atlanta,

39
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.050
he had to come up with a new formulation and he,

40
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:26.370
and so what he did was tucked the alcohol out, added carbonated water and sugar.

41
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.040
Then you have Coca-Cola that's,

42
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.180
this is how this is how Coca-Cola was made.

43
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.990
And he put it in the soda fountain soda.

44
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.100
So that pharmacies at the soda fountains and they were for whites only.

45
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.810
So cocaine was,

46
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.400
you was typically available only to white people at that time.

47
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.530
But then in, I guess, maybe 1899,

48
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.610
early 19 hundreds, Coca-Cola began bottling the products.

49
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.920
Now it's available to black people,

50
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.210
and now you start to get DS the connection between

51
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.070
violence and cocaine use among black people and this

52
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:13.360
sort of narrative grew and grew, um,

53
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.920
to the point where we banned cocaine effectively in

54
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:18.880
1914,

55
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.590
largely because of its association with black people using the drug,

56
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.950
a similar thing happened with opium and the Chinese.

57
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.330
That's the real reason that those drugs are bad.

58
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.630
Not because of pharmacology. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

59
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.750
Now that's not to say that people can't get in trouble with these drugs.

60
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.010
So people do, you.

61
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.930
<v 0>Know, they can get in trouble with alcohol. That's.</v>

62
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.730
<v 1>Right. That's right. But the only stories that we tell about cocaine,</v>

63
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.700
uh, uh, is the one where people get in trouble. Yeah. But I gotta tell you,

64
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.900
uh, recently I watched, uh, uh, Pete Davison's movie. What was that?

65
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.570
The king of Staten island.

66
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.480
It was the first time in a popular movie where,

67
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.770
um, the, a hero, uh,

68
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.110
used cocaine and he was still a hero.

69
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.850
So you might remember the scene where Steve Buscemi and, uh,

70
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.390
I think bill bird, they was talking about and see the movie. Oh,

71
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.560
it was a great start. It was great. A great scene where they were talking about,

72
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.820
um, Pete's dad and Pete's dad, um,

73
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.590
had used cocaine previously and, um, Pete didn't know this.

74
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.150
And, but it was just a matter of fact, the guy used cocaine.

75
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:41.800
He liked his cocaine, but he was still the good guy. He was a fireman,

76
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.080
he was a hero. He was all of these things.

77
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:46.720
And they didn't smirch him for using cocaine.

78
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.130
It's one of the few times that you see in popular culture that somebody uses

79
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.750
something like cocaine and they're not smart. They don't have,

80
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:59.980
they don't go down this path to becoming an addict and losing all of their

81
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.250
possessions because of the drug. And so I thought like,

82
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.750
they're doing something here that's different. And that was really,

83
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:09.250
that was a great scene. Yeah.

84
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.420
<v 0>Most of the stereotypes about cocaine and Hollywood are, you know,</v>

85
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.870
people using people, CD people,

86
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:20.470
people that have no compassion for each other, ruthlessly,

87
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:24.820
ambitious people doing Coke and just for full of themselves in the high,

88
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:29.220
on themselves. And Ron, I'm going to take off it. It's town. That's what you,

89
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:31.300
you hear and see, you know?

90
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.110
<v 1>Yeah. Um, yeah. Hope that changes, man. I know.</v>

91
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.640
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I mean, uh, I would try it with you. Yeah. I would try it.</v>

92
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.620
Especially listening to you and knowing you probably get the real. Yeah. I just,

93
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.900
uh, I avoid things that make me confident. I'm not interested in that.

94
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.050
I'm confident enough. I'm plenty confident. I like things that scare me.

95
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.220
That's why I like marijuana so much. I do. I tell people think I'm kidding.

96
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:57.220
I'm not, I, I like the paranoia.

97
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.740
I like freaking out because I always come out of it to the other end with some

98
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.830
sort of a lesson, because I think sometimes, um,

99
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.100
we can shield ourselves from things that are,

100
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.060
we're really worried about or shield ourselves from concerns that we have,

101
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.770
or even from ruthlessly introspective thoughts

102
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.190
that come with a high doses of marijuana.

103
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.440
And that's the thing that freaks a lot of people out.

104
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.570
I find them very beneficial.

105
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:28.490
Some of the best moments I've had personally or after some of the wildest

106
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:33.140
trips where I was like, boy, this is rough. And, but at the end, when it's over,

107
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:35.090
I come out feeling so much better. Okay.

108
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.810
<v 1>I feel you. I mean, that's great. I mean, because you know, um,</v>

109
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.560
that's useful, uh, you feel like you're a better person. That's cool.

110
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:47.510
But sometimes you just want to be euphoric and just enjoy your

111
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.300
significant other. Show me, you know what I'm saying? So,

112
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:55.220
and so cocaine or some other drug might be useful for that.

113
00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.110
And so it's not like you have to have only that experience that frightens

114
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:04.160
you and then you become a better person that at the end of it, um,

115
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.270
I'm all for that. That's fine. You got that. Um, uh,

116
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.570
but I would just say broaden your repertoire. Yeah.

117
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.320
<v 0>That's it, the problem is like, get the, if it was legal, it'd be great.</v>

118
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.550
Like you could get pure cocaine and you knew what you were getting,

119
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.580
but if you're getting cocaine in Austin, Texas,

120
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.670
you probably getting it from some sketchy dude. Yeah.

121
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.660
Oh a is also selling a bunch of other and yeah. I mean,

122
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:31.520
I'm gonna imagine I've never tried to buy it.

123
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.500
<v 1>Yeah. But you know, um, two things here, um,</v>

124
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.230
we got the technology to put on the streets where

125
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:46.520
people can, um, just submit small samples of their drug,

126
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.720
10 milligrams, which is nothing. And then they get a chem,

127
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.500
they get a readout of the chemical composition of their drug. Right.

128
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.910
We have that technology.

129
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:59.990
If the public would put pressure on their officials that make sure that it's

130
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:02.540
available to people where they can submit their drugs,

131
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:07.070
small samples of their drugs free and anonymously. Uh,

132
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.210
and then they get this Rita.

133
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.680
<v 0>Departments it's so taboo. Like if you even admit that you do cocaine paper,</v>

134
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.460
like look at this guy was ready to ruin his life, barely hanging on over there.

135
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:18.770
Carl, look at you doing cocaine.

136
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.670
<v 1>This is why in the book. I admit my heroin use my cocaine,</v>

137
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:23.930
use all of my drug use.

138
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:28.700
So I'm trying to change that image because I have met people all

139
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:33.470
around the world, some politicians and so forth and got high with these people.

140
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.610
Uh, of course I won't say who they are. Uh, but, um,

141
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.220
the vast majority of people who use these drugs are people who are

142
00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:46.940
responsible, take care of their families. They care about their communities.

143
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:48.290
They do all this sort of stuff,

144
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.360
but Hollywood and the media and the mythology is

145
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:57.780
so powerful in showing only this one image. Yes.

146
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.410
Um, and I'm trying to really disrupt that because it's,

147
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.360
it's so harmful to so many people.
