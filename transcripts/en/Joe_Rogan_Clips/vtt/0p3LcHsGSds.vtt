00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What's your thought on Khabib Nurmagomedov.</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.230
<v 1>Extremely embraced. His kid is, uh,</v>

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.040
deeply, deeply embracive I've. Um, uh,

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.160
he's coming to the academy a couple of times before fights.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.670
I've never actually seen him train. Um, he, uh,

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.370
after his fight in Madison square garden,

7
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:26.640
he bought himself and a group of his friends,

8
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.100
his training partners came into the academy,

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.870
trained in my Monday afternoon class could be didn't train.

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:33.180
He just sat on the bench because he'd just support on Saturday nights.

11
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.420
Of course he's not going to train, but his, um, his, uh,

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.150
his training partners came in and trained with the squad.

13
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.370
And that was a fun afternoon. They rolled with, um,

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.810
I think mostly Nikki Ryan and, um, uh, it's hard for them of course,

15
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.260
because it's submission grappling. That's not really what they do. They,

16
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.200
they do more the interface of, of, um, grappling combined with striking.

17
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.980
So they had autonomy, but, but, uh, he struck me as a very, very nice person.

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.400
He shockingly begged for his weight division. Shocking was shocking to me. So,

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.690
um,

20
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
like all the people coming out of the Caucasus regions of Russia has wrestling

21
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.590
is extremely good. Um,

22
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.640
they have probably the best wrestling program in the world that whole area

23
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.310
stretching from, uh, uh,

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.120
SEASHA through dog Astons for church near all the way down to Iran that,

25
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.490
that areas as the heartbeat of wrestling in the world,

26
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.710
and it shows all their fighters,

27
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:26.580
they're all strong in wrestling and United add to that, the various skills.

28
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:28.560
And you've got a tough, tough group of people.

29
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.120
<v 0>Yeah, it was extremely,</v>

30
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.900
I bet I've been impressed with every single performance he's had in the octagon.

31
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.900
I mean, he's undefeated, which is incredibly rare in and of itself,

32
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.840
but in the 155 pound division, even more impressive,

33
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120
but the way he mauled Barboza.

34
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.730
<v 1>Christ. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.890
You could see the fight was essentially over halfway through round one. Yes.

36
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.050
<v 0>Yeah. You could see it in Barboza his face. He was drained. Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.910
<v 1>And that was an incredibly impressive performance. Um, I, uh,</v>

38
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.320
uh, obviously there's still,

39
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.590
you can't put them yet in the greatest of all time category.

40
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.650
<v 0>But he doesn't want a title that wasn't even challenged for it yet, but.</v>

41
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.800
<v 1>You definitely get the sense that if, if he had had a title fight by now,</v>

42
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:09.330
he probably would have been a champion by now.

43
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.720
<v 0>Oh, ham versus Connor, Jesus Christ.</v>

44
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.170
That's what I want to say him versus Connor in Russia or him versus Tony,

45
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880
Tony Ferguson, and then would be a very interesting thing.

46
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.320
<v 1>Well, what's interesting about those two fights as you have,</v>

47
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:26.250
basically polar opposites could leave of them would get off as a control based

48
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.050
fighter. Whereas, uh,

49
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.790
Tony Ferguson is a scramble based fighter and just that

50
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:37.050
clash in styles is going to be fascinating with regards Conor McGregor and

51
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:40.770
Khabib limo get off. The feeling one gets is that if they did fight,

52
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.300
it would be a complete shutout in one of two directions.

53
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680
It's either like a man beating up a child on the ground,

54
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.690
or it's just a flush knock out the guy,

55
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.050
unable to cover distance properly and walking into a left-hand.

56
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.310
And as in catastrophic chaos,

57
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.570
and you feel like there's potential for it to go in both directions.

58
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.430
Uh, and it's, that's a fight I don't think goes to the distance. It's uh,

59
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.140
it's one way or the other. Yeah.

60
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.490
<v 0>Um,</v>

61
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.470
I feel like what Connor presents it's interesting in terms of danger is speed.

62
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.110
And one shot knockout power with his hands.

63
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.820
<v 1>And Khabib has been hurt coming in.</v>

64
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.900
<v 0>By Michael Johnson.</v>

65
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.300
It's really the only adversity ever suffered inside the Arctic.

66
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.480
<v 1>And he dealt with it. Well, that's a good sign for debate. It's the.</v>

67
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.790
<v 0>Sliver of hope that every opponent clings to,</v>

68
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.510
they watch that one moment where Michael Johnson clipped him and he's like,

69
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:39.040
look, look, he's human. He can be hurt. It's like the Terminator.

70
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.903
If it believes that.

71
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.940
<v 1>They believe that was predator.</v>

72
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.710
<v 0>Oh yeah. What'd I say Terminator. Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.580
<v 1>You just up your arm reference. Sorry. I'm sorry.</v>

74
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.370
<v 0>Uh, yeah, I did it up. Um,</v>

75
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.570
but I think that Connor has been overwhelmed on the ground though.

76
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.010
And he's been overwhelmed by Nate Diaz and he's been controlled in the ground

77
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.430
box.

78
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.310
One gets the feeling that whatever amount of control they were able to impose on

80
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.030
them will be nothing compared with what could be could impose.

81
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.060
Moreover Khabib is, um, it's a much more dangerous form of control. Could be,

82
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.730
it could be, has a program of hitting people on the ground,

83
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.540
which is substantially better than either of the two athletes you just

84
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.430
mentioned. Yes. Um,

85
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.620
and a big differences when Khabib gets you on the ground. You're not getting up.

86
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.663
No.

87
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.430
<v 0>You're getting mauled and it's almost like a spider,</v>

88
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.990
like he's injecting venom into you and slowly but surely like weakening your

89
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:38.560
body. Yeah. Like you, you see, after the first round,

90
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.880
when Barboza gets up, it's like, okay, you mean he's,

91
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.270
he's alive still. Yeah. But this is a different person now.

92
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.070
And going into the second round, I mean,

93
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.680
the Barboza gave an admirable account of himself.

94
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.760
He showed himself to be a true.

95
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
<v 1>He did try a couple of spending backaches and some of them were relatively</v>

96
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.870
close. Yeah.

97
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.490
<v 0>Barboza is kicking heavy strategy though is very different than Connors.</v>

98
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.210
Connors kicks are just the opposite. His kicks are just probes.

99
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.280
He's sort of poking at you,

100
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.370
poking at you and putting things out in front of you.

101
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.180
And he's just trying to dang. He just trying to drop that hard.

102
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.080
Left-hand on you.

103
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.090
<v 1>It's a fascinating guy to watch. Fascinating.</v>

104
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.960
I always undervalued him when he first came in the UFC. I said, oh,

105
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:24.040
it's hype it's hybrid. But the more I started, the more I saw. Yeah. He said,

106
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:24.874
he's very, very.

107
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.070
<v 0>Well. He's also, he mind people. He mind people in a way that,</v>

108
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.840
um, but I don't think he's mine.

109
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.240
<v 1>Could be. I don't think.</v>

110
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.110
<v 0>That's going to happen.</v>

111
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.680
I just think we'd be dealing with a totally different kind of human being.

112
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.890
Those people from Dagestan are just so hard.

113
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.470
It's just a hard part of the world. They're just, they're made of hardier stuff.

114
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.620
You know what I mean? It's just like, they have to deal with way more.

115
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.980
Not that people in Ireland are soft. They're hard people too.

116
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.580
I just think that with I've always said the most important.

117
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:03.380
If you have a pyramid of technique, when it comes to, uh, mixed martial arts,

118
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.760
the base of the pyramid,

119
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.870
the most important thing is the ability to control the grappling.

120
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.250
The ability to take a guy down. If you can take a guy down and control him,

121
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.540
you have a significant advantage. You can choose where the fight takes place.

122
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.270
And if you're competent in the standup, which could be,

123
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.380
is definitely competent in the standup. So you are adequate in the standup,

124
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.960
but overwhelming. When it gets to the ground,

125
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.120
you can present problems with a guy standing up, which, which case is problems.

126
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.380
The guy has to deal with the striking aspects, which open up the takedowns.

127
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.920
<v 1>I wholeheartedly agree with you, but I'll go a little further.</v>

128
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.530
Whenever someone asks me, what are the, what, what are the programs? Well,

129
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.130
what do you look for when you see a guy dominating fights? What, what,

130
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:53.080
what makes someone go in the right directions for their training and,

131
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.420
and the fighting itself? I always say there's three things.

132
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:00.830
If you show me a fighter who can one dominate the

133
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:05.090
setups to dominate the pace of the fight

134
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.890
and three, how can I phrase this?

135
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.980
Dominate the simple direction of the fight. Three things, dominate the setups,

136
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.260
dominate the pace, dominate the direction.

137
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.990
You show me a fighter who can do those three things.

138
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.250
And I'll show you a fighter who can win 95% of the fights. He gets into

139
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.410
dominate the setups, dominate the pace, dominated direction.

140
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.880
Thinking about someone I could be, or anyone who comes from a,

141
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.870
a strong wrestling or judo jujitsu with take-downs baseline.

142
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:45.830
Is it always going to be a dominate the direction they determine whether it goes

143
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.530
down to the ground over the right, say, standing

144
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.720
to be always dominates the pace of the fight. Once you're on the ground,

145
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.200
you're on top. The other guys is reacting to what you're doing,

146
00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:00.800
trying to get back up to his feet, et cetera, et cetera. You're dominating pace.

147
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.980
If there's one weakness that could be pears is,

148
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:10.880
is not as strong dominating the setups to get to those areas where

149
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:15.650
he can dominate pace and, uh, et cetera, et cetera.

150
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.660
If he's going to lose a fight,

151
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:21.680
it's going to be in that area and corner more than anything else.

152
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.870
As a guy who dominates the setups,

153
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.380
you set it before the kicks of probes. They don't kicks.

154
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.430
It's not trying to hurt you with a kicks. He's probing. He hurts you with this.

155
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.110
Yeah. Okay.

156
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.850
So Connor's skill is he's a master of dominating setups,

157
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.170
especially in the standing position,

158
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.110
but to Beavs mastery out of those three critical areas for domination and all

159
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:48.500
forms of fighting is he's a dominant, uh,

160
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.790
he's incredibly dominant in determining the direction of the fight and the pace

161
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:55.280
of the fight. That's why he never gets tired in his way. It's,

162
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.750
it's got a very high work rate, but he never gets tired.

163
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.520
Never see him just completely shattered.

164
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.440
Despite the fact he's working hard the whole time.

165
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.220
<v 0>And the F despite the fact that he significantly weakened themselves to make 155</v>

166
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:08.070
pounds, which apparently he's done far better.

167
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:12.600
Now he had a real nutritionist heading into this camp and it was much easier for

168
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:12.930
him to cut.

169
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.910
<v 1>The weight. I'd be fascinated to see him fly at one.</v>

170
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.140
<v 0>70 And well, that's a plan, apparently that was a plan.</v>

171
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.660
And Woodley was joking around about it saying, he'll send him nutritionists.

172
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.960
They'll say, keep his psycho down at 1 55. Was his exact,

173
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.420
exact quote. Yeah.

174
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.700
<v 1>Yeah. With regards to your point, before you saying you, this,</v>

175
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.080
this core combat skill,

176
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.780
the most important one that you as a commentator look for,

177
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:41.250
when you look at finance, you know, um, can you determine, uh, you, you,

178
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:44.100
you put grappling skill as, as the number one saying,

179
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:46.610
whether it be wrestling with every Samba, with a beat you to it. So whatever.

180
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.050
Um, I would go further and say, yeah,

181
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.720
there's three things that I look for who dominates the setups,

182
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.180
who dominates the pace who dominates the direction.
