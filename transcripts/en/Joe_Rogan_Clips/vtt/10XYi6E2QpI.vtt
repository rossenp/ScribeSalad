WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>Well, the Joe Rogan experience, but what we are now doing,</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:08.610
and the thing that troubles me most about this movement is that if you listen to

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.580
it closely and I have listened to it very closely,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
it is explicitly about disassembling,

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.810
the very things that make the west marvelous, right?

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.720
It is anti science, right? It does not want policy based on science. In fact,

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.000
well, I mean, you saw last week,

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.180
presumably that it got a nature,

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.100
the journal nature or science magazine, uh, Cal tech, it got all of these,

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.030
uh,

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.770
just absolutely top level scientific institutions to broadcast

12
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:45.570
the hashtag shut down stem. What? Oh yeah,

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.120
no, I'm not aware of this at all. Oh, well,

14
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:51.960
and this is another thing we're losing our minds because to me,

15
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.400
the idea that you would be unaware of this is hard to imagine because it was so

16
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:59.430
much going on. It was so thoroughly all over my feed though,

17
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:02.550
but I'm discovering this there's stuff absent from my feed too,

18
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.010
that I should know about. And I'm finding the same thing.

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.170
<v 1>But here's the thing. I don't read my feed.</v>

20
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.440
<v 0>Well, you don't read your Twitter feed, but you're plugged into enough people.</v>

21
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:11.610
You have to have conversations, right.

22
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.890
<v 1>Things have to be like almost nuclear before I'm paying attention to them these</v>

23
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.980
days, just for my own personal sanity. Yeah. I,

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.790
I I've stepped away from almost all social media other than.

25
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.560
<v 0>Yeah. It's actually, uh, uh, if I can say something perfectly weird,</v>

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.820
I don't really aspire to great wealth. I never have,

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.300
but there is part of me that wants to be wealthy enough that I can afford to

28
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:39.890
ignore my feeds. Right. I can't now I have to be plugged in. But,

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.960
um, but anyway, the, uh, the thing that's really concerning here, and I,

30
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:47.630
you know, I, I don't want this podcast to be all about concern.

31
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.660
<v 1>Thousands of scientists go on strike to protest,</v>

32
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:55.040
systemic racism and stem more than 5,000 scientists in two prominent

33
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.030
scientific journals,

34
00:01:56.031 --> 00:02:00.080
shut down operations and pledged to use the data to address racial inequalities

35
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.243
in science,

36
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.400
the strike falls two weeks of demonstration spurred by the police killing of

37
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.780
George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pro um,

38
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.670
people on social media or spreading word about the strike with the hashtag shut

39
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.080
down academia,

40
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.430
shut down stem and strike for black lives.

41
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.710
Shut down. Academia's terrifying. Shut down. Stem is equally terrifying,

42
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.860
but I'm to like, what takes its place? What do you expect? Well,

43
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.070
if you shut down academia, like what do they, what are they saying?

44
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:34.010
When they say systemic racism in stem? What does it mean?

45
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.390
It's representation in terms of like the, what are they saying?

46
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.820
<v 0>So this is so sad because truly,</v>

47
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.450
if you, if you really wanted to, uh,

48
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.500
to raise black people out of the quagmire, the economic quagmire,

49
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.140
they find themselves in. If you want it to do it on mass,

50
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.520
you would arm them with the most powerful tools, right?

51
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.490
The powerful tool and the tool that is best positioned to

52
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.930
address biases, especially subtle biases is science. That's,

53
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.640
that's what the scientific method does.

54
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.810
That's it's one reason for existing is that it takes that, which you think,

55
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.270
and allows you to see why it is wrong, right?

56
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.330
It takes your biases and forces you to see what's wrong with them.

57
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.190
That's what science is for now.

58
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.970
The reason that this movement is attacking stem has to do with the connection of

59
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:29.470
this movement to critical theory and critical theory.

60
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.940
Didn't come from the science. As the word theory is basically, uh,

61
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.290
pilfered, right? It's being used in a most ironic fashion.

62
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:41.020
Critical theory is a narrative.

63
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.030
That's now becoming a religious movement and it is anti stem on the basis that

64
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:50.550
it claims that stem itself science itself is racist

65
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.690
inherently. What.

66
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.390
<v 1>Do they mean when they, when they're saying critical theory? Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.260
What does that encompass?

68
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.620
<v 0>Well,</v>

69
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.030
my understanding is that critical theory was born as an honorable investigation

70
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.350
of biases that exist inside of our court system, racial biases,

71
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.840
and that it has now morphed into something that its originators don't recognize

72
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.040
and don't respect that it has become basically. I mean, you know, you've,

73
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.900
you've had, uh, Jordan Peterson on your podcast many times once with me and,

74
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:22.080
you know, he, what he talks about with respect to these,

75
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.000
these are cultural Marxists and they are wielding this post-modern doctrine.

76
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.400
What he's talking about is critical theory, right?

77
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:33.150
Critical theory is basically a, um,

78
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.400
a Trojan horse that exists in academic departments that are dedicated to its

79
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:42.660
study. And what it does is it uninvent progress in other fields.

80
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.140
And that's a very, um,

81
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.720
uninteresting process when it's hiding away in some corner of your university

82
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:53.160
where you don't have to listen to it.

83
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.870
But what has happened is it has now reached enough people that it has spilled

84
00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:01.380
out into public. And the nonsense that you hear about shutting down academia,

85
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.960
shutting down, stem, abolishing, the police,

86
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.170
all of this is standard fare in those phony.

87
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.830
<v 1>When you say uninvented progress now, what do you mean by that? Well.</v>

88
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.090
<v 0>I mean that we have a system and, you know,</v>

89
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:18.300
I'm as upset about what doesn't work about it as anybody,

90
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.810
but we have a system that accomplishes a great deal.

91
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.150
And this style of thought that all of these

92
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:29.910
departments that end in theory, um,

93
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.980
that don't actually function by normal rules of logic or the

94
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:39.360
scientific process. These things are an attack.

95
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:43.080
They're like an auto-immune disease of the academic culture.

96
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.760
And by and large,

97
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.200
the scientific part of the academy keeps his head down and it stays away from

98
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:52.950
people who believe in this stuff and it tries to do its work. Um,

99
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.160
but what has happened is that the dynamics,

100
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.200
the demographics changed such that these departments,

101
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.710
which weren't taken seriously by the sciences are now dictating terms to the

102
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:08.150
sciences, which couldn't possibly be more dangerous because to the extent that,

103
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.751
uh, the,

104
00:06:09.751 --> 00:06:14.540
the argument more or less is that the sciences are unfairly biased in

105
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.200
favor of those who are currently successful. And that,

106
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:22.790
that bias is actually preventing people who are not succeeding under current

107
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:24.500
conditions from getting there.

108
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.510
And therefore we need to hobble these disciplines to level the playing

109
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.230
field. Well,

110
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.090
imagine that America surrendered its advantage in the

111
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:37.880
sciences in order to, um,

112
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.590
even if you could level the playing field inside of the U S by doing that,

113
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:44.750
which you can't, but even if you could,

114
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.340
this would so hobble us in the world that it would be an insane policy to

115
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:50.290
pursue. Is.

116
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.740
<v 1>There any debate going on about this? Clearly,</v>

117
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:58.600
what they're saying is if you're looking at the vast majority of the scientists

118
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.900
they represent, what, what is it?

119
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.850
European Jews are a lot of them.

120
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:07.720
There's a lot of various people of European ancestry,

121
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.820
Asian folks, less, African-Americans less Africans.

122
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.420
So they're saying that because of this, this is clear,

123
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.090
this is clear evidence of racism.

124
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.400
<v 0>Yeah. Which is total nonsense. What is it? Evidence of it is? Well,</v>

125
00:07:24.401 --> 00:07:26.500
it's evidence of a number of things. And, you know,

126
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:30.640
I find myself in two places on a lot of these arguments on the one hand,

127
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:32.650
somehow I'm sitting here on your podcast,

128
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.680
defending academia went on any normal day.

129
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.920
I would be telling you academia was so incredibly broken.

130
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.690
And science has been so incredibly,

131
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.980
incredibly corrupted by its contact with the market that we have to fix these

132
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:49.780
things, because that is in and of itself a threat, you know, to the west here,

133
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.430
I find myself saying, wait a second.

134
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:54.040
These people are actually telling you what they think.

135
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.600
They think science is the enemy.

136
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.770
And instead of democratizing the tools of science and giving them to the people

137
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.110
who need the most, they want to end science.

138
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.200
So the problems are several.

139
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.080
Unfortunately they're not tremendously interesting.

140
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:10.420
They're sort of dry inside baseball stuff.

141
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.830
<v 1>I think we have to cover them though,</v>

142
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:16.210
just to sort of take the legs out from under this racism argument when it comes

143
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.050
to representation.

144
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.880
<v 0>Sure. So first of all,</v>

145
00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:23.050
let me just say academia is tremendously

146
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.940
liberal and that, uh, I mean that in both senses,

147
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.960
let's take the honorable part of it right inside of a university.

148
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:37.090
There is every desire to bring people who do not look

149
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:41.530
like the old white guys that have done so much of the past work in science.

150
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.400
There is a desire to, uh, to broaden, you know,

151
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.350
so it is not true that privately scientists are harboring racist

152
00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:52.630
views and talking about them. And then, you know,

153
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:56.580
behaving themselves when they're around people who are of a different color.

154
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:01.560
It's not like that. Okay. There is a desire to have those people show up, uh,

155
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.570
and get the job because for one thing,

156
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:06.930
it takes the pressure off to the extent that departments don't look like the

157
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:10.590
demographics of the country, in which these departments are housed, you know,

158
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:14.670
that raises questions. And so there's a desire to bring in anybody who, um,

159
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.990
makes it clear that that's not going on. However, let's say that you were,

160
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.030
uh, you were black and you grew up in a neighborhood where the odds were stacked

161
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:28.480
against you and you made it, let's say that, um, you know, you,

162
00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:30.360
you had people who, uh,

163
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.120
said wise things to you and they got you to focus on the right stuff.

164
00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:37.710
And you managed to Dodge the stuff that captures so many and you made it right.

165
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.960
Let's say you got into Harvard, you got to a really good quality degree in, uh,

166
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.130
in, uh, in a proper science, well, what are you going to do with it?

167
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.080
You're going to go into academia.

168
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.840
That would be insane because I don't know what the numbers are.

169
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.070
I don't know what fraction of people who get PhDs actually get the job that

170
00:09:58.071 --> 00:10:02.300
they've trained for, but it's tiny. It wasn't really, I'll be like one in 20,

171
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.403
really? Yeah.

172
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.420
<v 1>Because there's only so many positions and every year you're graduating</v>

173
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.270
hundreds and hundreds of people with those degrees. Well,

174
00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:12.560
but there's also a very.

175
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.140
<v 0>Good reason for this. I mean, it's a terrible reason,</v>

176
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:17.750
but there's a very easily comprehended reason.

177
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.970
So universities are fueled in large measure by what's called overhead of the

178
00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:25.250
grants. So if you've got a million dollar grant,

179
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.950
half or more will go to your university, right?

180
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:30.470
So that's what builds the buildings and fuels to place.

181
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.750
So the university has an incentive to get as many people file grant applications

182
00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:36.440
as they can.

183
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.770
And they have an incentive to hire people whose grant applications will be large

184
00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:40.670
rather than small.

185
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.830
So this for example is one of the reasons that science has taken up arms against

186
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:49.700
theory, that is to say proper scientific theoreticians like me.

187
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.130
And it is instead hired people who run big,

188
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:55.460
expensive experiments because big expensive experiments have big grants.

189
00:10:55.461 --> 00:10:56.840
And those big grants bring in money.

190
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.150
But if you were a university and what you wanted was to

191
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:05.180
have people writing big, expensive grants who were capable of getting them,

192
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.030
then what you would want to do is you would want to free those people from

193
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:08.864
teaching.

194
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.970
And you would want to get people who weren't so expensive to do the work of the

195
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:14.690
university.

196
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.170
And the way you do that is you bring them on as graduate students and you pay

197
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:20.450
them, uh, an appalling wage.

198
00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:24.080
You claim you claim that they are not actually workers, that they are students.

199
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.840
And they, they do most of the teaching.

200
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.400
And they do a lot of the work of the university for incredibly, uh,

201
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.200
low amounts of money. And they live under poor conditions. And increasingly, uh,

202
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.590
they have to come from abroad where they are in some sense, getting a deal.

203
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.340
That still makes sense. But this means that we overproduce PhDs.

204
00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:47.180
We give people degrees instead of money to do the work of the university in

205
00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:50.180
order that the people who are capable of getting the grant spend almost

206
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.670
full-time doing that job. And it's a wreck. So in.

207
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.550
<v 1>That, so I wasn't aware of that at all. I didn't know how it works.</v>

208
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:57.851
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

209
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:02.140
It's a racket and the person you should talk to the person who knows the most

210
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:04.690
about this is actually Eric, my brother. Um,

211
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.620
so what he on earth was actually that there was an explicit

212
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.690
conspiracy to game the visa system in order to keep the

213
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.190
system running. Then in fact,

214
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:20.110
effectively a fake shortage of science students was created

215
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.810
to allow the universities to basically flood the market,

216
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:23.800
to drive the wages down.

217
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.170
But all of these things mean that if you are coming from

218
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.510
circumstances that have, uh,

219
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.480
been challenging and you make it,

220
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.170
you don't want to go to graduate school in the sciences because it's a dumb move

221
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:40.690
you're going to take having gotten your head above water,

222
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:44.470
and then you're going to voluntarily drown. And it doesn't make any sense.

223
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:48.670
You're much better off, even as bad as, you know, being a doctor has become,

224
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.910
it used to be a great job. Now it's kind of a sucky job,

225
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.510
but you're better off doing that because at least it's a job you'll pay off your

226
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:57.250
loans, you know, you'll make it.

227
00:12:57.251 --> 00:13:01.990
And so basically what we see is that there are lots of reasons that a rational

228
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:06.730
person, uh, from certain demographics is less likely to go into the sciences.

229
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:09.670
That's not racism in the sciences. It's again,

230
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:12.910
one of these echoes of a past, uh,

231
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.380
racism or a past indifference that is having huge impacts on the present.

232
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.090
<v 1>Okay. Um,</v>

233
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.110
so these people that want to

234
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.940
that, that think that stem is racist and they want to dismantle it.

235
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.190
What do they propose? Like what,

236
00:13:32.191 --> 00:13:35.730
what do they propose them replacement of stem and academia.

237
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.040
<v 0>So I,</v>

238
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.010
what they want is so strange and preposterous that it damages my

239
00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:47.400
credibility to even say it. I, I will, I will answer your question,

240
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.640
but I know that what I'm saying sounds preposterous.

241
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.750
The only reason that I'm so certain of it is that I've talked to them directly.

242
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.160
And I watched this happen at every grade. I.

243
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.890
<v 1>Talk to them Greg directly. So, you know, this is actually what they want.</v>

244
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.960
I can't say they.

245
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.500
<v 2>Because undoubtedly there's variations, but I can say that.</v>

246
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.860
<v 0>To the extent that I've actually had these conversations with people,</v>

247
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.480
I was left completely shocked by, you know,

248
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.070
there was an, there was an example at evergreen where, uh,

249
00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:21.870
we were in a faculty meeting and I said

250
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.060
that the proposals that we're moving through were a threat to the

251
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:30.450
enlightenment values that were the basis of the institution.

252
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.250
And what I got back was something I had never heard before, which was an attack,

253
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.180
not only on the enlightenment, but on the idea of enlightenment.

254
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.280
I was just so stunned. I was a college professor amongst faculty,

255
00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:49.200
and somebody was actually saying out loud that enlightenment was a problem.

256
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.850
And nobody in the room said.

257
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.750
<v 1>What did they mean by enlightenment as a problem? So.</v>

258
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.120
<v 0>Here's, here's what I say to,</v>

259
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.050
to people who asked me about this students in particular, um,

260
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.930
the enlightenment was a European

261
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:13.030
project, right? It definitely had a light skin tone,

262
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.760
right? It was, it was European men. It was not a Jewish project,

263
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.440
but I am not embarrassed about taking the tools of the enlightenment and

264
00:15:23.441 --> 00:15:28.120
wielding. They don't belong to Europe, right? They're human they're human tools.

265
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.650
They were a discovery in Europe.

266
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.090
And arguably the discovery in Europe happened because of unfair exclusion of

267
00:15:34.091 --> 00:15:37.450
other people. But at some level who the cares,

268
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.620
these are the most powerful tools ever. And you can't,

269
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.450
uninvent them. The thing to do is distribute them as broadly as possible.

270
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.360
But if you're in critical theory, first of all,

271
00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:53.290
if you end up in critical theory, any one of these fields, women's studies,

272
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.150
studies, whatever it is,

273
00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.010
you have all ready for gone. This option.

274
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:04.990
You don't end up in critical theory if you have the chops to do science.

275
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.210
So in effect you have people who don't stand to

276
00:16:10.211 --> 00:16:13.990
personally benefit from opening those doors wider because they wouldn't go

277
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:16.990
through them arguing that nobody should go through those doors.

278
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.910
<v 1>So let's take a side step here. Um, critical theory,</v>

279
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.400
when you're talking about gender studies or studies,

280
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.050
why do you think those are not valid avenues

281
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.330
for, for people to pursue well?

282
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.330
<v 0>Because the method is nonexistent.</v>

283
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.200
If you were to do these things properly,

284
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.320
you would study them with the tools of stem, right?

285
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:46.240
But we know from, we know that's not what goes on inside of these departments.

286
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.410
And we also know that the product doesn't add up from the point of view of

287
00:16:50.411 --> 00:16:54.310
science, you can't take the claim for example, that, uh,

288
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.260
uh, if a man decides that he is a woman than he is a woman,

289
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.070
it's not a valid claim, it just doesn't stand up.

290
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.090
And you can't claim that sexist spectrum eater, that claim doesn't stand up.

291
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.953
These are empty.

292
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.670
And we could have a discussion about what we are to do in light of the

293
00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:15.730
part of gender that is flexible,

294
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.890
but we're not having that conversation because we've got an ultimatum on the

295
00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:25.840
table. Either you agree sex is a spectrum or you're the enemy, right?

296
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.590
So all I would say is just empirically. This is what happens. Now.

297
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.330
I will also say, uh,

298
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:37.180
one of the most telling incidents that happened during the evergreen riots

299
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.470
is now finally, it's been covered by PBS.

300
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.120
I've talked about it on my podcast, a student of Heather and mine,

301
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.130
um, an excellent student,

302
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:52.470
one of the best ones ever had as a young woman named Odette.

303
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.940
Odette is half black. Her mom is Africa, Caribbean.

304
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.550
She was known to be my student and Heather student during the riots.

305
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.530
And she was actually confronted and physically bullied by the

306
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:09.750
rioters who accused her,

307
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.370
of being a race trader for studying science. This actually happened.

308
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.670
And what I'm telling you.

309
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.760
<v 1>When they say you're a race trader for studying science, what what's,</v>

310
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.320
what specific discipline?

311
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.780
<v 0>Well, she was studying evolutionary biology with Heather and me and,</v>

312
00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:30.070
and.

313
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.850
<v 1>They said, yes, you are race trader for studying evolutionary biology because.</v>

314
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.840
<v 0>Because science is racist, yo</v>

315
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.630
it's nonsense. And I hear you trying to parse it as if it makes sense.

316
00:18:44.631 --> 00:18:45.140
And I think.

317
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:50.050
<v 1>The point is stand as a person who spent three years barely paying attention in</v>

318
00:18:50.051 --> 00:18:52.540
college. I don't know how it got to that.

319
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.150
I don't know how that becomes an actual course.

320
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.010
I don't know how that gets funded.

321
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.950
I don't know how that you can get a degree from that. Well.

322
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:04.660
<v 0>So what I've heard of late, um, and I'm, it may be James Lindsay,</v>

323
00:19:04.661 --> 00:19:07.900
who is the originator of, of this phrasiology,

324
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:13.090
but there's a term racism of the gaps and racism of the gaps is a

325
00:19:13.091 --> 00:19:15.190
reference to the God of the gaps. Hypothesis.

326
00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:17.590
Anything we can't explain in science is explained by God,

327
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.300
which is obviously nonsense,

328
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.860
but racism of the gap says any place where that we see a

329
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.970
success differential, the explanation is inherently racism.

330
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.140
So if we see an absence of black people in math,

331
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.360
obviously the answer is racism.

332
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.410
<v 1>They apply that in areas where black people Excel.</v>

333
00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:44.020
<v 0>No, because this is a self-serving, uh, modality, like hip hop,</v>

334
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.100
right? And so let's go back to Odette for a second,

335
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.100
trying to parse what they're saying as if it has content logical content is a

336
00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:54.934
mistake,

337
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.530
trying to parse it as a tactical move makes a lot of sense. Okay.

338
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:04.000
Let's imagine that Odette was not the courageous person that she is and that she

339
00:20:04.001 --> 00:20:08.890
had caved, right? Imagine you're cornered, you know, you're alone,

340
00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:12.940
you've got a mob that's actually physically confronting you for studying

341
00:20:12.941 --> 00:20:16.360
science. If she was not a person of strong character,

342
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.410
she might have signed up with them. If she had signed up with them,

343
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.630
then a, now they have a potentially powerful ally,

344
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.130
right? A black person, former student of, or at that point, I guess,

345
00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:33.580
current student of Heather and mine, who would say yes, in fact,

346
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.910
science is racist, evolutionary biology, particularly. So I was in that class,

347
00:20:36.911 --> 00:20:37.600
yada, yada, yada.

348
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.310
<v 1>And people are easily influenced.</v>

349
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.230
And that many bullied by that would probably cause a lot of people to cave

350
00:20:44.231 --> 00:20:48.190
into that. And given to that, just for conformity, just so that people accept.

351
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.000
<v 0>Them. Yes.</v>

352
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.770
And so thank goodness that Odette is somebody who is of incredibly strong

353
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.300
character, who really got the message of evolutionary biology very deeply.

354
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:00.580
And there is nothing that they could have said or threatened her with.

355
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:03.520
It would have caused her to make the move that they wanted her to make,

356
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:05.890
but processing it, tactically is important.

357
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.360
What they're doing is tactical and what they did with shutdown, stem,

358
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.600
tactical, they were proving their power, right.

359
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.610
They were able to get the most important scientific institutions to broadcast a

360
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.850
demand to shut down stem. That's an amazing level of power.

361
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.540
<v 1>And actual scientists that are in disciplines</v>

362
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.520
that are legit, like evolutionary biology went along well.

363
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:32.851
<v 0>You know,</v>

364
00:21:32.851 --> 00:21:37.140
I contacted Richard Dawkins as this was happening because I didn't see anything

365
00:21:37.141 --> 00:21:40.620
on his feed that suggested, you know, he hadn't made a statement.

366
00:21:40.621 --> 00:21:42.840
I thought it would be powerful him to do for him to do it.

367
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.450
He was totally unaware. It was going on. Right.

368
00:21:45.451 --> 00:21:48.330
So you have the most important institutions broadcasting. This thing,

369
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:52.200
something about our environment is not calling it to the attention of people who

370
00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:54.330
might be in a position to say something.

371
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:59.670
And the whole thing is, uh, it's setting us up. We're in,

372
00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:01.770
we're in tremendous danger.

373
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.400
<v 1>And what, what do you think their motivation is?</v>

374
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.120
<v 3>Power, power. Well, what happens if that gets.</v>

375
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.260
<v 1>Through, they shut down stem, then what do they do? How did you know, did they,</v>

376
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.130
are they thinking this far ahead? They're not playing this long game.

377
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.210
<v 0>Um, okay. I would just,</v>

378
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.430
I would tell people who aren't aware of me and what I think and believe that

379
00:22:26.431 --> 00:22:29.490
I am very progressive.

380
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.000
I am very interested in making a fair system that some, I,

381
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.900
I, I know you, I know you are.

382
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.940
So what I'm about to say sounds like one of those right-wing crazy things,

383
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.100
what they want. Well, imagine the following look, first of all,

384
00:22:47.101 --> 00:22:49.170
let's talk about reparations for a second. Okay. Okay.

385
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.540
I am not a fan of the idea of reparations.

386
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:54.510
I think it would be a terrible failure. It would be a disaster,

387
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.250
but I do believe that something of very substantial

388
00:22:59.251 --> 00:23:02.880
magnitude is justified. I just don't think reparations is the answer.

389
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.770
<v 1>I completely agree. Okay. I think reform in terms of communities, I think, uh,</v>

390
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.150
spending massive amounts of money to rebuild communities and give people hope.

391
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.210
Yes. Economic opportunities. It's massive.

392
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.090
<v 0>Investment in communities that have been systematically frozen out.</v>

393
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.500
And I would put, uh,

394
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.130
I would put American blacks and American Indians at the top of the list because

395
00:23:23.131 --> 00:23:25.560
I believe they have a special claim. It's.

396
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.620
<v 1>Particularly native Americans are particularly distraught because they've been</v>

397
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.460
subjugated to this weird position when they're stuck on these reservations.

398
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.640
<v 0>So, so, uh, we'll come back to this for a second maybe, but, um,</v>

399
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.850
I think that there's something very special that happened with blacks and with

400
00:23:38.851 --> 00:23:40.830
Indians. And they're not, it's not exactly alike,

401
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.370
but it has to do with their different origin stories that these two populations,

402
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.160
uh, I have, um, both suffered a parallel. Uh,

403
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.970
I don't even know what to call it. An obstacle that doesn't,

404
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.720
that makes them unlike, um, anyone other Americans. Yes.

405
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.110
So not in favor of reparations,

406
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:03.170
but I would be in favor of something that did the job that reparations are

407
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:05.660
imagined to do. Okay.

408
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.270
What this movement is,

409
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.830
is an attempt to create a slant

410
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.510
in every single interaction that does the job of reparations.

411
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.790
It's reparations 24 hours a day,

412
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:23.390
seven days a week in every room in every institution,

413
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:27.860
in every context right now that

414
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:33.170
will be the uninvented of America. It is in some weird sense,

415
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.450
a mirror for the America that blacks and Indians have

416
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:43.100
faced. They have faced an America in which everything was slanted against them.

417
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.190
It has grown less. So, but again,

418
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:51.170
we have the echoes of that deeply slanted America that are

419
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:55.850
broadcast into the present at a high level of intensity. Um,

420
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.500
but you cannot do reparations

421
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.490
inside of every institution every hour,

422
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.970
every discussion that is not a plausible plan,

423
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.500
even people who support the idea of monetary reparations of the solution,

424
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.090
if they understood the dynamics of trying to infuse it into every interaction,

425
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.160
there is no way it could possibly work.

426
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.450
And it invalidates all of the most important principles on which America runs.

427
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:28.100
So we are really talking about uninvented America and substituting a reparations

428
00:25:28.101 --> 00:25:29.120
program for it,

429
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.860
which it just couldn't possibly be a bigger hazard and think,

430
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.950
think for a second, if you're trying to imagine what the hell I'm talking about.

431
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.320
Imagine right now,

432
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.970
there is a problem. There's a process called jury nullification.

433
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.230
And Eric has pointed out that jury nullification is a huge hazard in an era

434
00:25:50.231 --> 00:25:54.340
where people are saying as much nonsense about who's guilty and who's innocent

435
00:25:54.341 --> 00:25:56.530
and what it has to do with race as we have,

436
00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.090
because effectively you can instantly create a situation in which

437
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.410
the law doesn't apply to certain folks because of the color of their skin,

438
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.240
right? That would be an advantage.

439
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.450
You could argue that it was compensatory for years of being on the other end of

440
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:13.870
that deal, but it cannot be made to function.

441
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.190
But the other thing is also possible, right? You can, uh,

442
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:23.020
not only have the law not apply to people on the basis that they have a skin

443
00:26:23.021 --> 00:26:25.210
color that suggests they've had a raw deal,

444
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.870
but you can also make the law apply to people because of their skin color.

445
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.420
We can have show trials, right?

446
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.780
I was effectively exposed to the equivalent of a short trial at evergreen,

447
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.340
right. I was convicted of racism and it happened at for various reasons.

448
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:44.610
I knew well that the charge was completely empty based on my history as a

449
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:49.140
human being. And so I felt I could stand up to it and withstand it.

450
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:51.360
And I guess in a way I did, on the other hand,

451
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.070
my wife and I were driven out of the college. So yes, I survived it, but,

452
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.810
um, I didn't survive at intact. Right. I made it somewhere else,

453
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.970
but that show trial mentality mean it would be a perfect fit

454
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.500
for the, uh, the Maoist part of this,

455
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.090
of this movements, ethos. I mean, we're already seeing struggle sessions,

456
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.830
people being forced to admit things that aren't true, right.
