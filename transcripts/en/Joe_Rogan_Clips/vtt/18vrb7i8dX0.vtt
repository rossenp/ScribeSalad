00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. It's amazing that stuff's legal.</v>

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.853
Did you watch.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.760
<v 1>60 Minutes? Three weeks ago? No, that was the whole, that was the.</v>

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.640
Who was it? Just about the op opioid epidemic and oh,

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.910
the DEA stopped prosecuting. The word came from, you know, it's just man,

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.230
they're terrible. Those things. Listen, those things are terrible.

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.910
<v 0>Yeah. There was a whole article recently about the company that,</v>

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.430
that sells most of the opioids and the family that's behind that company.

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.110
And how many billions of dollars that they've made off the opioid crisis,

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.300
opioid opioid, or be it how we say opioid? I always say it wrong.

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.740
<v 1>Once that grips you. That synthetic heroin. That's what that right? Isn't it?</v>

12
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.660
<v 0>Yeah, essentially. Yeah. It's.</v>

13
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.380
<v 1>Uh, it's a bad grip. Like I said,</v>

14
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.020
I took a 16th one night in my living room and I had to lay that and that was my

15
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:01.060
that's my whole resume with Oxycontins and I I'm a meal.

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.890
I can eat 2000 milligrams of THC and live a 16th of one of those

17
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:09.610
pills. I popped. It was just a little piece. Nothing.

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.170
My blood pressure dropped so much. I just laid down,

19
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:18.570
went to sleep and I knew my pill career had come to an end.

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.640
Never even let it start. Really never even let it start. Can you believe brother

21
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.160
in two weeks, it's gonna be 10 years since I've done that wipe out.

22
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.920
I want you to think about that. Wow. 10 years. I want you to really think about,

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.960
I still remember being at Cobbs with you that January and like going it's been

24
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.440
two months. I don't know if I could really do this. Like,

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
I don't know if I control this feeling and I controlled it. It's.

26
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.710
<v 0>So you like when you quit, what was like the first week? Like.</v>

27
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.830
<v 1>Hell hell first two weeks were hell.</v>

28
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.190
<v 0>Did you think about going back? Just like,</v>

29
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:55.990
I can't do this or did you know that you had had to make a change?

30
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.950
<v 1>I had to make a change. I knew that my spine was starting to hurt.</v>

31
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.150
I knew that yeah. Spine was starting to hurt. Yeah. I was starting to get jolted

32
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.860
just by four in the morning, you know, after you do Coke.

33
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.340
Oh right at the tip over here. A.

34
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.140
<v 0>Lot of people who've done Coke. Get like Parkinson's.</v>

35
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.100
<v 1>Yeah, that. No, no, no, no, no. Once.</v>

36
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.060
<v 0>I started. So you think that's related? Well, a lot of,</v>

37
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.940
lot of old timers that did a lot of Coke in the seventies,

38
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.020
and then they wound up like some serious neuromuscular, absolutely.

39
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.330
<v 1>That shocks to your central nervous system. There was times I did cocaine.</v>

40
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.890
That was like electric. It was like,

41
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:33.330
when you put that thing in your hand or you get electrocuted,

42
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.410
you could feel the electric in your body the next day, like that,

43
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.570
like in your brain,

44
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:43.890
like you could actually see the neural transmitters of non fire.

45
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.160
You could feel that, you know,

46
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.440
I could tell when I would go on stage after doing two or three nights of blow

47
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:54.280
that week, I had no control. I really had no control over my material.

48
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.080
I had no control over my delivery. That's what I wanted to tell you.

49
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.400
<v 0>Like you just, the way you communicate.</v>

50
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.280
<v 1>Is off. Yeah. Your mind can't grip it. You can't sell the joke.</v>

51
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.760
The facial doesn't connect with the hand movement or the breathing.

52
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.400
So like I knew that that was always gonna be a danger in the future. Now,

53
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.840
you know, I take all that, uh, for like a year I drank those, uh,

54
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:21.470
what's your butt, these names that makes the neurosurgeon milkshakes,

55
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.590
the football player. That beat the guy.

56
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.510
<v 0>Up Ky. Oh.</v>

57
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.230
<v 1>Romanowski. I took all his stuff for like a year just to, did you, yeah.</v>

58
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:30.470
The orange drink and stuff.

59
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.350
<v 0>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; neuro one. That stuff did that help you?</v>

60
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.670
<v 1>Yeah, it felt good. It felt a lot better. You know, I did.</v>

61
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.013
<v 0>Give your brain some.</v>

62
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.260
<v 1>Nutrients getting some control. Yeah. But 10 years, I mean that, that, uh,</v>

63
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.460
I had to do a benefit in Hoboken and I had gotten high. Like that whole summer.

64
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.460
I tried to get off Coke. I was doing the heroin.

65
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.460
I was trying to get off the Coke. And then that September I ran outta heroin.

66
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.220
So I was doing it like maybe once a week.

67
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.580
And the whole thing went down in Maryland. I knew I had to stop.

68
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.170
And then I had this thing in Hoboken. I went, whole.

69
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.930
<v 0>Thing, went down, Maryland Martinez. When she.</v>

70
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.610
<v 1>Died, she was dying. I went, I went back east that week and she was dying.</v>

71
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.330
I don't know what happened. It was like, you know what?

72
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.450
I was trying to get Coke on Friday night. I couldn't get it.

73
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.890
And I just took it for what it was. I was trying to get Coke on Saturday.

74
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.970
I couldn't get it. So it. I took the plane back Sunday. I couldn't get it. He,

75
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.760
something could happen. I couldn't get it.

76
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.280
And then that Monday I had a meeting to do a movie. And at the end of the, uh,

77
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.960
the meeting, the guy said, listen, man, we know about your drug problem.

78
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.720
So before you say yes,

79
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.160
we want you to think about this cuz you can't miss a day on this movie.

80
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.240
You cannot be late. If you're late.

81
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.350
The whole movie can't shoot because it was a cast mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we all

82
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:48.150
shot in one room. It was an AA meeting. So I thought about it. I I'll do it.

83
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.190
And that was the roughest month ever.

84
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.510
Cuz I was just going home and before eight o'clock would start,

85
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.750
I would just go to bed cuz eight o'clock was my cocaine time.

86
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.300
That's when my body would start to ache. That's when I, it,

87
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.860
and even you could be telling me the most important thing in your life and I'd

88
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:06.740
be watching you, but I couldn't hear. Mm.

89
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.700
All my mind was focusing on was getting that blow at eight o'clock. Wow.

90
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.900
And then I would figure out how to get the 60 bucks. You know,

91
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.180
I'm gonna go to the ATM machine. I would shoot over the rock and roll routes.

92
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.380
There's that ATM machine in front of rock and roll routes right there. Yeah.

93
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.410
And I would take 60 bucks out that dog.

94
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.530
I would run every red light to get to that ATM machine. Like I didn't give a.

95
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.970
Like I didn't give a. And, and then from there would just make the,

96
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:34.890
U-turn go to my dealer's house, go home and leave the Coke there.

97
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.970
And now is ready for the night I was in peace.

98
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.690
Just knowing that the Coke was at the house. I didn't have to do it.

99
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.010
<v 0>You know, I, I don't,</v>

100
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.920
I've never been physically addicted to something in a way where I had a hard

101
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:49.520
time kicking it, but I've had some psychological addictions for sure.

102
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.800
And I think that one of the things that's that I've gotten out of this month of

103
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.000
uh, no, the sober October thing that Tom Burton, Ari and I are doing is that,

104
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.680
uh, a lot of it is psychological.

105
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.440
A lot of it is psychological because just knowing that we can't smoke pot or

106
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:07.040
can't drink all month, you start thinking about, oh,

107
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.440
we're at the home stretch November 1st around the corner.

108
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.000
Like I don't really feel like I need to get high.

109
00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:13.920
It's not like I need to a drink tomorrow,

110
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.070
but it's knowing that can't do it for the month where it hangs over your head.

111
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.950
So that's, what's even more impressive that you could kick it,

112
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.350
cuz it's not just the fact that you, you have like a physical problem,

113
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.110
but you also have this psychological problem.

114
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.830
Like the psychological part of it is like, it's,

115
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.030
it's a pattern that you're comfortable with.

116
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.980
You got used to that pattern of eight O' you're looking for the Coke.

117
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.020
You go and do it. And then you're off. It's like you're off.

118
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.500
Even though you're you're in chaos,

119
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.500
your life's in disarray and you're in the grips of addiction.

120
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.020
You're comfortable with that feeling.

121
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:49.620
You've been there before and you're B for whatever reason,

122
00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:52.980
when people get used to up and they go, why do I keep up?

123
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.300
One of the reasons you keep up because you're used to up used to.

124
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:59.530
And it's not an uncomfortable feeling in the sense that it's it's you've,

125
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.490
you know, it, it might suck, but you know, it's the devil, you know, you know.

126
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.310
<v 1>There was nights I didn't wanna do it and I still did it. Do you understand me?</v>

127
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.470
I didn't wanna do it. Like I didn't need to do it. Like I didn't feel, I just.

128
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.390
<v 0>Wanna do it, but it was just something to do. Like it.</v>

129
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.950
<v 1>Was just something to do. Wow. It was just something to do.</v>

130
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.660
But you know what I tell people all the time is you want to have to quit.

131
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.940
It just doesn't happen. Like I quit at 44. I'm no genius,

132
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.260
but it took me two years. Like it was a two year struggle,

133
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.220
like a personal little struggle. Like.

134
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.060
<v 0>When did you know that it was that you were free?</v>

135
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.380
Cause you didn't go to AA or narcotics. And.

136
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.370
<v 1>All, I went to one meeting, an AA meeting and I went in Hollywood,</v>

137
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:45.810
which everything is good until you go to it in Hollywood.

138
00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:47.650
Because in Hollywood you act, you,

139
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.650
you add the dramatic and the actor image to it. You know,

140
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.810
if you go to an AA meeting in Jersey, they're in their smoking, camel, reds,

141
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.200
talking from the heart. You go to an, a, a meeting in Hollywood,

142
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:04.280
you got people with AA tattoos on their arm. &lt;laugh&gt; hugging each other.

143
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.280
You know, it's a Jamee.

144
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.160
<v 0>They're just happy to be in AA. So like it's a new clan that they're in. And.</v>

145
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.360
<v 1>Then what happens is after about two months in this area,</v>

146
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.760
for some reason I've noticed. Cause I have a lot of friends in an AA. They,

147
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.950
somebody approaches you. It says, you know, what's going on? You're like,

148
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.070
I'm struggling. They're like, why have you seen Dr. Bob? They're like Dr. Bob,

149
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.790
gosh, I'm just making this name. They're like Dr. Bob. Oh my God.

150
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.310
Tell him about Dr. Bob. Tell Joe about Dr. Oh, Dr.

151
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.470
Bob is changed your whole life. So basically you'll see Dr. Bob,

152
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.500
