00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's such a unique country.</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.580
And you think about the history and their,

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.900
their contributions to the martial arts in particular, just, I mean, the,

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:12.480
the warrior ethic of the samurai, like a,

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.030
that book Miyamoto Musashi is the book of five rings.

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.610
That's a great book for your life, just to,

7
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.840
just to think about excellence in your life and pursuit in your life and how all

8
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.810
things balance out, all other aspects of your life.

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.590
Like his idea of being a great samurai. You had to also be great at calligraphy.

10
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.500
You had to be a great artist. You had to, you had to be able to write poetry.

11
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.400
You gotta be a balanced human being in order to fight correctly. You know,

12
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:40.080
this guy was like 60 and O in one-on-one sword

13
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:40.914
fights.

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.160
<v 1>And became a pacifist in his later life.</v>

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.550
<v 0>And that book of five rings is, man. It's an amazing book.</v>

16
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.500
<v 1>We got a massager quote at the end of the anime film.</v>

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.170
<v 0>That's him. Yeah, that's him. My mom. Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.940
Um, just that whole, the culture, what?

19
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:04.710
Their contributions to martial arts,

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.570
like what they've been able to do with design. Like it's a interesting place.

21
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.360
Even their automobiles, you know? I mean,

22
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:15.030
they make like Bulletproof cars that lasts forever.

23
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.710
Like they were the first people to figure it out.

24
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.330
Just make cars that don't break.

25
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.120
<v 1>And go really fast. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.700
<v 0>They're, it's a fascinating culture. So what,</v>

27
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.300
what connection did they have to the anime thing? Do, who did like,

28
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:32.550
who was making all that animation for you?

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.370
<v 1>Well, we, I had the idea for the record first.</v>

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.190
Then we played Fuji rock in 2017. I have a very good friend, uh,

31
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:48.030
a Japanese friend who grew up in Kentucky on an exchange program

32
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.260
with, with my wife. And he later moved back to Tokyo for college, came radio,

33
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.670
DJ. Uh,

34
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.540
his name is [inaudible] and he did the radio thing for one.

35
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.240
Then he got into voice narration from Marvel over there,

36
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.420
and he's just a good dude. And we were talking,

37
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.870
I went over for a couple of weeks before we played Fuji rock to hang out with

38
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.970
him and my buddies and get some time on the ground.

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.320
And the record was recorded the month before. And I was like, man,

40
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.380
it'd be really cool to do some animated videos for this album,

41
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:18.750
if it's like one or two. And we were,

42
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.620
we were sitting around in his place watching a lot of old animation and anime

43
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.880
films and, um,

44
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.270
the textures and the color and everything is just stuff you don't really see

45
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:28.104
anymore.

46
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.210
And I was just thinking about like some of my favorite cartoons from

47
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:34.350
that, especially the older stuff,

48
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:38.280
the seventies and eighties that came from that world. So he,

49
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.610
we decided to start taking meetings with producers just to get an idea of like,

50
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:45.510
what would this cost, how long, how long will it take? Is it even possible?

51
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.620
Would they do it? And, um, it was kind of trial and error for a while.

52
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:51.900
We finally had a meeting with a guy named, uh,

53
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.800
Hiroki who was very understated in the meeting,

54
00:02:55.801 --> 00:03:00.310
sold himself short. You know, it's just like a mid fifties guy on a track suit,

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.190
but we come to find out a week later, he's the man.

56
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.560
And like all his buddies are the man too.

57
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.330
And those guys are also used to working under

58
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.520
not necessarily restrictions,

59
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:14.740
but if they take a project on it's from a big studio,

60
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:19.150
the story's already dictated, the parameters are dictated.

61
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.020
Like basically they have to stay within someone else's lane with their vision.

62
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.610
And so one of the first he asked me this w what kind of animation I was

63
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:28.151
interested in.

64
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:31.930
So I named off some of the references of the things that I loved and was looking

65
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.690
to sort of get in terms of aesthetic and texture.

66
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.570
And he just went straight to the guys that made those things because they were

67
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.780
drinking buddies with all of them. And June pay music. Saki,

68
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.870
especially was the one director who I think Sean translated all the lyrics for

69
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.630
them. Cause I wanted them to know one what the record was about.

70
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.190
And so they could gauge interest. And he just sort of said at dinner one night,

71
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:57.370
he's like, you're talking about the same things that I deal with as an artist.

72
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.910
He's like, I, you know, I feel like this is, this could be me talking.

73
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.600
We deal with the same things in terms of dealing with business and commerce

74
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.550
versus art. Um,

75
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.970
so he just sort of reacted passionately to the music and he just said,

76
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:11.830
I want to do the whole record. He's like,

77
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.180
this is kind of a dream project for me. And, uh, I said, okay.

78
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.250
And then there was like, well,

79
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:20.590
how are you going to do the whole record in a year?

80
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.850
Because we've already been sitting on this thing for a year and a half now. And,

81
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.530
uh, he,

82
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:31.090
they assembled four other directors who were running teams or project teams at

83
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.630
the same time simultaneously and breaking the songs up into chapters.

84
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.150
So even though there's some more of a Leonard,

85
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.110
a linear narrative told out of chronological order, um,

86
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:43.930
and then two little side vignettes, which are sort of same universe,

87
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:45.700
different world, just to give, uh,

88
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.830
a different perspective on some of those songs,

89
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:52.480
because some directors were doing one song other teams had to,

90
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.790
and he was overseeing the entire thing,

91
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.000
but had them all working simultaneously on it. So we could finish on time.

92
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:02.980
So I went over six times in the last year and I realized about the second trip

93
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.210
that those visits were very beneficial, uh,

94
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:09.700
because those guys don't do half-ass, you know what I mean?

95
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:12.550
And they w they definitely pride themselves on their work and they all wanted me

96
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.910
to be impressed. So every time I would come back, they, they knew I was coming.

97
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:19.510
I could tell that it was really motivating them to go outside the box.

98
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:21.850
And everybody wanted to be the guy that blew my mind the most,

99
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:25.240
you know what I mean? Um, and they did every time.

100
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.780
It was just like some of that stuff. I know how they did it,

101
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:31.840
and I don't know how they did it, you know,

102
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.810
where can anybody see the whole thing, Netflix? Oh,

103
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:38.110
it's all on Netflix right now. But you put some of it on YouTube. Uh, well,

104
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.780
want to, the label has to have a single cause they, you know,

105
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.360
they got the relationship of Spotify and all that. So they got to,

106
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.310
which is also frustrating.

107
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.120
Cause we make cohesive concept records that are meant to be consumed as a whole.

108
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.690
And then like, if I'm not going to radio, why do I need a single,

109
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.060
you know what I mean? Like just put the record out,

110
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.980
skip the lead up the whole traditional setup. Cause we're not,

111
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.290
we don't fit that model. Right. Just by making records, we're antiquated,

112
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.280
you know? Um,

113
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.210
but they put a single out and so they put one section of the movie up on

114
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:12.440
YouTube, which I think we'll take down now that the whole film's out. But, uh.

115
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.750
<v 0>Yeah, for people that they'd be like, what is going on here? Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.260
<v 1>Yeah. We basically made a, you know,</v>

117
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.190
heavy metal or the wall, but with Japanese animators,

118
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.720
I love it. I wouldn't compare it to the wall, but uh, same idea.

119
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.550
It's just a visual, it's a visual age.

120
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.550
<v 0>It's beautiful to the, the animation that they did for it. It's really,</v>

121
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.220
it's incredible. Did you,

122
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.730
was it weird seeing like their vision connected to D to your music?

123
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.350
<v 1>No. I mean, I wrote the initial story, the, the main byline screenplay,</v>

124
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.830
and then told June pay, like we were trying to do an homage of, uh,

125
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.000
specifically Yojimbo and then a couple of other famous samurai films.

126
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.530
Like the Kashi Caetano was a twitchy and a lot of Korea saw things like

127
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.160
very reoccurring storylines. Um,

128
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.540
and we were watching Kurosawa films in the studio making the record on silent

129
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.790
and the control room just to kind of keep our mood, right.

130
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.260
Like to keep everything kind of dark and ominous and no second guessing. Ah,

131
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.510
so, but yeah, it's kind of like a futuristic dystopian Yojimbo,

132
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.950
which, um,

133
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.270
which is also a fistful of dollars where you got one town of people being

134
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.820
oppressed by a couple rival factions or gang leaders, uh,

135
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.060
and sort of using them for the wrong building.

136
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.940
So in the future now we just jump high and I talked about it. Well,

137
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.423
sex,

138
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.110
drugs and weapons and war are really the main drivers of the

139
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:49.400
economy. So let's just say that those are the only economy, you know,

140
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.440
those are the only things that have value anymore at that point. Um,

141
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.820
and he got weird. So I gave him a rough script and then they just, I said,

142
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.560
but you know, I want you guys to do what you do.

143
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:04.250
So feel free to add or take things in any direction you want at any time.

144
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:08.720
So then you get 30 women with their out dancing and

145
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.280
which, which was I, that was June Pei's idea. I told him there was a very old,

146
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.580
famous samurai film calls the twitchy. And at the end of it, a,

147
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.170
this blind swordsman conquers,

148
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:22.160
this evil force and the townspeople celebrate,

149
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:24.110
and there's this very famous scene in the end of it,

150
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:26.840
with his traditional dance and they're doing this dance. And I said, you know,

151
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.310
can we sneak this in as a dance sequence slash homage and anybody that has to be

152
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.070
like a film buff geek, like me would get it. Anybody else just be like,

153
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:34.970
this is cool.

154
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.910
So they decided to take the gimps and the sex trafficked slaves,

155
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:44.780
so to speak and then just make a big chorus line. But then they had a woman,

156
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:47.990
a traditional Japanese dancer come in and they put her on motion capture and

157
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:51.920
green screen. And she did the actual dance from the film and the animated,

158
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:55.710
everyone to that. Wow. I was like, that's pretty sweet.

159
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.830
I wouldn't have thought of that, but he did what I wanted.

160
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:01.470
He just gave me what he wanted to do with it.

161
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.140
<v 0>Now, how long is the whole thing?</v>

162
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.430
<v 1>40? The same links is the audio is the album. It's 42 minutes. Wow.</v>

163
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.810
<v 0>It's a brilliant idea, man. It's really cool.</v>

164
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:15.390
I just love the idea that you're experimenting with something like that.

165
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:19.260
Just trying it out, but it had to be a long stretch.

166
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.340
<v 1>That was the hardest part was sitting on it so long. And then hyper-focusing,</v>

167
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.300
I mixed the record three times, mastered it twice.

168
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.500
And then we had to do a surround sound mix for the movies.

169
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.090
So I'm pretty burnt out on it. I'll be honest. I'm ready to go play it live,

170
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.450
but I don't ever want to hear that again. Um.

171
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.780
<v 0>Does that contribute to you the way you, uh,</v>

172
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.170
get creative with the sound when you perform in life, you change out?

173
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.063
Absolutely.

174
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.380
<v 0>Do you think you're going to do this in the future again,</v>

176
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.780
like this kind of animation or is this a one-off?

177
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.730
<v 1>Oh, no. The, uh,</v>

178
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.910
there's already talk of doing a C I wouldn't do the music again.

179
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.070
I would certainly, I might,

180
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.090
if they want to run with the story, I'd be all about it.

181
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:05.610
Either prequel or sequel action. Um,

182
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.320
but I wouldn't want to make this Sonic signature again.

183
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:13.590
I would probably use like traditional Japanese musicians and then contemporary

184
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.040
production methods and like actually have dialogue and sound effects and make a

185
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:17.874
story.

186
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.670
<v 0>You're going to get into the cartoon business.</v>

187
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.460
<v 1>I got three kids.</v>

188
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.330
<v 0>That would be awesome. It looks awesome. I got to watch the whole thing.</v>

189
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.220
I got to check it out. It's really.

190
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.860
<v 1>Weird, man. It's super trippy light, a big, right,</v>

191
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:36.510
like that big Mike Tyson blunt.

192
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.150
When you get home tonight at midnight and your kids are asleep and watch that

193
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.270
and then think about what a weird I am.

194
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.870
<v 0>All right. Now, when you,</v>

195
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.320
when you think about like doing another storyline like that,

196
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:50.820
like following that storyline.

197
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.980
<v 1>I haven't thought about it. It'd be pretty easy though. I mean,</v>

198
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:57.870
she rides off with the two robots and there's like an AI monster on

199
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.480
Lyft dealt with. Or you could go back in time,

200
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.740
which is the origins of the two slick and Slims feud with her dad.

201
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:07.140
And while they show up to the dojo and kill everybody, I don't know.

202
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.370
There's all kinds of just right and making up pretty straightforward.

203
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
