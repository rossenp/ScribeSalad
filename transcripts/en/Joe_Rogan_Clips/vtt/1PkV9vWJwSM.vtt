00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 3>Um, that girl,</v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.240
that amazing gymnast who everybody's on Simone Biles,

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.210
cause she just bailed on the Olympics. Like I can't take anymore.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.950
I was just reading that she regularly takes, um,

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.230
uh, ADHD medication and they said that she can no longer take it because in

7
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:27.030
Japan you can't take this stuff. She takes Ritalin. Find out if this is true,

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.640
because if that is the case,

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.960
they said that during the last Olympics, uh,

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.880
I guess 2016,

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
she took this stuff and she won a bunch of gold medals. Yeah. And now,

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
because she's regularly on this, right? This is her medication.

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.780
<v 0>And so they're saying she can't because.</v>

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.520
<v 1>Japan, Japan, Japan is it's illegal to take, uh,</v>

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
whether it's Adderall or Ritalin. I think it's illegal to take those in Japan.

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.370
So I was reading today.

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.280
<v 0>How cultures have their different, yeah. I mean,</v>

18
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.310
you could like buy panties in a vending machine,

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.620
but you can't take Ritalin.

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.120
<v 1>Well, I think they're very sensitive to amphetamines because amphetamines and</v>

21
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.750
methamphetamines were the reason why the kamikazes were willing to fly their

22
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:17.550
planes right into boats. You grit in their teeth the whole way.

23
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.384
Boom.

24
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.330
<v 0>That's why Lexus probably does so well. Cause if you mess up at the factory,</v>

25
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.470
you have to like walk off a plank because honor in honor. Well, I'm just,

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.490
I don't know if that's true, but.

27
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.260
<v 1>They don't. I've had three Lexuses in my life. They never break.</v>

28
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.780
They're so good. They're so good. I had the best cars.

29
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.630
So this is from last Olympics. Okay.

30
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.980
Simone Biles addresses leaked medical records and ADHD misconceptions,

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.510
U S gymnast superstar.

32
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:46.650
Simone Biles was in a different kind of spotlight Tuesday after Russian hackers

33
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:48.810
circulated confidential medical reports in the world.

34
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:53.430
Anti-doping agency database that showed her use of methyl

35
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.740
Fen date methylphenidate, a stimulant use to treat ADHD.

36
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.360
Biles 19 was forced to publicly address her ADHD and approval of the use of

37
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:04.350
medication. After leak.

38
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.940
I have ADHD and I've taken medicine for it since I was a kid. Please know,

39
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.980
I believe in a clean sport, I've always followed the rules.

40
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.220
So we'll continue to do so. As far as play is critical to us,

41
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.800
fair play is critical to sport and is very important to me.

42
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.890
So she's been on this medication for a long time,

43
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.340
but see if you can find that, uh,

44
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.260
an article that says she was not allowed to take this ADHD medication in

45
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:30.540
Japan, because that's what they were saying.

46
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.810
They were saying that during this Olympics,

47
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.490
they told her she has to get off of it.

48
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.620
If that's the case that would greatly contribute to her anxiety

49
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.530
and her mental problems that she's having.

50
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.210
Imagine if you're on a medication for less, at least five years. Right.

51
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.470
And she's been on since 2016 and then all of a sudden they tell you can't be on

52
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.030
it anymore and you have to compete in the Olympics.

53
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.270
And you're used to being on this medication. Yeah.

54
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.270
<v 0>No. That'll that'll cause you some strife, but this could be fishy.</v>

55
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.210
Like they're saying they treated for ADHD,

56
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.170
but what if this is like a drug that makes them like super-focused.

57
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.140
<v 1>It does make you super, super focused. I'm sure it does. I mean, that's,</v>

58
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.360
that's why they say pitchers, can't take it right?

59
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.920
Like pitchers want to take Adderall.

60
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.850
<v 0>Yeah. And they w the pitchers used to take, uh, Greenies,</v>

61
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.240
which were basically some sort of amphetamines amphetamines.

62
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.050
So this could be a similar kind of scandal where the Russian hackers fricking

63
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.600
Russell's, uh, you know, the Russians and the Chinese are just like,

64
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.360
they're beating us on the online dude. They're like,

65
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.890
they're like Jago and Othello.

66
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.930
And they're just kind of manipulating us and hack our. But I think about it.

67
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:40.570
It's like, um, Yani and, uh,

68
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:45.070
what's his name from Slovenia is like the best BA th uh, everything is like,

69
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:49.300
the rest of the world has, is beating us and everything. Like, look now,

70
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.300
like our gymnasts are retiring because they're sad. I don't know.

71
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.190
<v 1>See, this is what everybody's saying about that girl.</v>

72
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:57.850
I think a thing about that girl is her ADHD medication.

73
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.570
<v 2>Oh, I could find was people discussing that and that,</v>

74
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.420
so then I outside looked up Ritalin in Japan,

75
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.060
turns up that currently the only drug used to treat ADHD that is legal in

76
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.830
Japan is called Conserta.

77
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.370
While Ritalin is available in Japan is to treat sleep disorders.

78
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:16.990
It's not prescribed for ADHD.

79
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.060
<v 1>Giving you speed for sleep disorders.</v>

80
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.210
<v 0>But it's not illegal though. Right? Ritalin. It.</v>

81
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.570
<v 2>Says it then going into, it says, it's V you maybe could get it.</v>

82
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:26.710
It's very hard to get.

83
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:31.510
And then she could be not on it because it was hard for her to get a TV because

84
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.670
Japan rules, Trump Olympic rules.

85
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.830
<v 1>I think that's what's going on. If you go to,</v>

86
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:40.510
I believe it was a Chris Bell's Instagram page, I saw him tweet it.

87
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.930
But I think you go to big, strong, fast. He on Instagram,

88
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.880
I think Chris bell covered it.

89
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.690
And he's discussing what exactly is happening with that girl.

90
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.970
So that's something that people needed to, could take it to.

91
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.480
So many people were on her online and calling her a Couter it's disgusting.

92
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.270
Like you have no idea what's going on in her head.

93
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.080
You suppose she's supposed to play when she's suicidal.

94
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.970
She's supposed to play when she's freaking out.

95
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.330
And she's supposed to do gymnastics when she's literally losing her mind.

96
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.480
Like when people get off prescription drugs,

97
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:15.340
like Jordan Peterson was up for a whole year when he was trying to get off, um,

98
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.060
benzodiazepine. I mean, I don't know what it's like to get off Ritalin. Right.

99
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:20.770
But I would imagine it's not fun. Right?

100
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.900
<v 0>Yeah. It's withdrawal. Yeah. And who knows the stuff that that girl has done?</v>

101
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.860
I mean, she's the goat by a lot. I mean, she does stuff. That's like superhuman.

102
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.080
<v 1>Simone Biles, ADHD meds among common drugs banned from Olympics.</v>

103
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.970
So Simone Biles has revealed that she has ADHD and takes Ritalin for it. Uh,

104
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.240
correction. It was first told Adderall in the articles, looked it up.

105
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.910
It's Ritalin, very similar. He says, sorry. Uh,

106
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.170
she received a therapy therapeutic use exemption for it in 2016 and took home

107
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:54.250
four gold medals in Rio. Fast forward to Tokyo, 2020, and Ritalin.

108
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:57.860
And Adderall is 100% illegal in Japan under all circumstances,

109
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.130
including therapeutic use. It is unfair. Unfortunate,

110
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:02.990
because I'm sure we'd love to see her compete,

111
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:07.040
but it makes sense that she couldn't focus. That does make sense.

112
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.770
See, now, why are we not hearing this?

113
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.740
Why am I getting this only from Chris bell, who by the way,

114
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.610
made an incredible documentary, bigger, stronger, faster, uh,

115
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:19.280
which is a documentary on steroids. And then, uh,

116
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.700
another documentary prescription thugs, which both prescription medication.

117
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.593
Great. He does great.

118
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.180
<v 0>So I guess at this point, it's either that's true.</v>

119
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.390
Or what Jamie pulled up before his chair. Like,

120
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.950
we're not sure because Jamie's saying the article he wrote is that it's not an

121
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.784
illegal.

122
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.370
<v 1>Might be illegal for competition.</v>

123
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.920
It might be illegal as a therapeutic use exemption.

124
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.520
You might not be able to get one of those. Right. Whatever Chris is saying,

125
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.690
but it's a, it's a complicated story. It's not, I mean, this girl's,

126
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.070
she won four gold medals in Rio. She's she's, uh, she's not a chicken.

127
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.610
She's the best.

128
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.310
<v 0>Of all time by, by all people's accounts. Aren't they.</v>

129
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.210
<v 1>Changing rules because she could do that other people can't do. She's right.</v>

130
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.540
<v 0>Yeah. She like flies through the air. It's incredible.</v>

131
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.880
<v 1>The video that was a describing how they're literally like altering the</v>

132
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:08.030
rules to make what she does, less impressive, right.

133
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.080
Or less a S scores, less whatever. Right. I don't follow gymnastics.

134
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.020
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, most people don't until the Olympics. I mean,</v>

135
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.990
that's the thing about Olympic sports. Like these people are,

136
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.450
that must be a weird come down. Like, you know,

137
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.780
the whole world's watching and then you gotta go back to working at a Panera

138
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:28.070
bread. That's weird. Yeah. You're just a swimmer or like a shot put guy,

139
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.270
you went to gold and then you're just back to handing out buzzers.

140
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.760
<v 1>How much money do you make for a shot, but.</v>

141
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.520
<v 0>I don't think they make anything right.</v>

142
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.600
<v 1>Olympics, you win the Olympics. And then,</v>

143
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.070
then what you just teach ShotPut to people that also can't make money,
