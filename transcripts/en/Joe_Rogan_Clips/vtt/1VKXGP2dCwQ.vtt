00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. In all this traveling. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.140
Did you come out of this with anything.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.420
<v 1>You know, a few things for.</v>

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.950
<v 0>Sure. Cause you seem to like to tell you from the outside,</v>

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.710
you seem like almost like you, uh, had a different purse.

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.130
You also you've seemed, I don't know, man.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.620
It was nice to see you when I first saw you when you came back,

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.570
but you seemed like a little different, he seemed like you, um, I don't know.

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:34.500
You've seen another level of stuff, you know, like you see,

10
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:39.420
you've got another level of perspective from this travel thing that like added

11
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.800
to your, your vision of the world, your,

12
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.640
your whole overall world view.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.430
<v 1>Yeah. With a lot of time to think also you're seeing stuff, you know,</v>

14
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:51.080
certainly as everyone would see out there,

15
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.530
like poverty levels where you're like, oh, I'm doing fine. Yeah. You know,

16
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.490
but not even that it's more specific, just like, I don't know,

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.880
friendly people and like yeah,

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.090
just different versions that are positive travelers and plus really getting to a

19
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:09.800
place where you're like, don't need to do anything, you know,

20
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:12.680
after a month of that, it's like, okay, you just settle into this. Like,

21
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.890
I dunno, what's today going to bring, right. You know,

22
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.860
you wake up and you're just like, I heard there's this cool tempo there.

23
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:22.370
We'll go check that out. Maybe there's get on motorbikes and go somewhere.

24
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.570
I heard there's a cool, you just talk to other travelers and be like,

25
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.420
there's a canyon up there. It's really neat to check that out while you're here.

26
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.620
And so you just do, and at some point you're like, you know how,

27
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:35.870
when you haven't got enough sleep for like a few days in a row,

28
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.750
you got four hours, four hours, four hours, and you sleep like 11 hours.

29
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.540
And you're like, I am completely caught up. Right.

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.250
So like not having any responsibility, the stress level goes down, down.

31
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.150
And then it's just like waiting in that zero responsibility life for like,

32
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.200
um, three months in that level, I guess. Wow. You know,

33
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.660
after the first couple of weeks and it's just like, I don't have anything to do.

34
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.280
Just like, oh, I just like relax, man.

35
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.600
I would leave a city when it felt like the right time to leave a city, you know,

36
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.360
it wasn't even like a regular vacation where you're like, come on,

37
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.260
we gotta do this. Then move right. A reservation somewhere. Yeah.

38
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.920
It was just like, relax. And then I could just think about things,

39
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.220
my art form in general, people in my life,

40
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.700
you know what I want and don't want, I'd have like moments of just like,

41
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.010
Hey, take a 10 hour bus. There's no wifi. You know,

42
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.290
you're just like thinking for awhile. Okay. Yeah.

43
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.000
Tons of moments like that. How did you know.

44
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.833
<v 0>When to end it?</v>

45
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.300
<v 1>Um, so I, um, I was going to come back for this show.</v>

46
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.010
Um, but then I remembered my, my manager, my friend, Eric.

47
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.550
They wanted to do a show at third man records in Nashville, uh, for their,

48
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:53.930
for the wild west comedy festival.

49
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.660
And I forgot about that because people ask me, when do you have to go back?

50
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.260
Like travels? I made, I was like, I'm open to,

51
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.940
there are so many people that were just traveling open.

52
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.630
<v 0>Wow. Yeah. That's really common. I mean.</v>

53
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.920
<v 1>Three months is like a norm. You have some people six months or a year I met,</v>

54
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.140
I met an Italian girl who was going on her five and a half,

55
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.050
fifth and a half years just traveling.

56
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.030
<v 0>Five and a half years. Just traveling.</v>

57
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.700
<v 1>She'd find jobs every once in a while. Wow. Yeah. And, uh, it's just,</v>

58
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.280
um, she goes where she wants.

59
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.770
<v 0>It's very appealing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very fascinating. Right.</v>

60
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:32.890
That's like nobody writes books about a guy who stays in his town that he grew

61
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.724
up.

62
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.730
The book is about the crazy traveler person all over the world and a backpack

63
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:40.810
and yeah. But.

64
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.750
<v 1>There's three months, people all over America doing that.</v>

65
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.100
<v 0>I know there's a lot of tent people. There's a lot of people that like,</v>

66
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.060
they'll get like a truck, you know, like some sort of, uh, get off the grid,

67
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.433
CV thing.

68
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.430
And they drive it around the campgrounds and they camp and they use the showers

69
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:01.840
at the campgrounds and then they do stuff enough for money so that they have gas

70
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.890
and they keep traveling around and hope their car doesn't break down.

71
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.750
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.650
This girl picked oranges and Sydney for like two months.

73
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.690
<v 0>I had this dude on Chris cage. He walked the Appalachian trail.</v>

74
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.140
Wow. Yeah. That's Georgia all the down and stuff.

75
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.140
<v 1>I don't know. How do you survive?</v>

76
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.840
<v 0>You would never make it. You would never make it.</v>

77
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.190
<v 1>What do you mean?</v>

78
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.980
<v 0>Well, you'd never make it. If you're just trying to kill animals all the way.</v>

79
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.980
You'd never make it. So how do you eat?

80
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:35.590
You'd have to be an elite hunter and you still might not ever make it because

81
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:38.050
you're not. If you're carrying that food around, it's going to go bad.

82
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:41.980
You're walking through Georgia in the summer, mean, you know, critters Credit.

83
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:46.180
Do you not gonna get enough? Just really? Yeah. You'll starve.

84
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.640
It's way harder to kill an animal than people think.

85
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.720
<v 1>That's what they do. It's like let's camp. Get some dinner, dude. Eat.</v>

86
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.640
<v 0>It's way harder. It's way harder. Yeah. Yeah. You're not getting,</v>

87
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:02.080
unless you're walking around with several high powered rifles and scopes and

88
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.600
you're setting up, you know where the animals are, the here you come,

89
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.080
when you're walking, you're not going to be able to walk all the way to Maine.

90
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.590
Oh.

91
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.290
<v 1>And maybe that's you, but experienced hunter like me. I don't understand. So,</v>

92
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.090
uh, you have to get in their heads. Bam.

93
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.400
<v 0>They go to restaurants, they buy food, they stay in hostels. You know, they,</v>

94
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:19.240
they have these little, uh,

95
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.590
camping spots where they have covered shelters and people share them.

96
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.550
<v 1>Yeah. There's a lot of that too, where it's just like, oh, forget about your,</v>

97
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:31.420
like what you need in terms of like hotels. Yep. That's all out. You need a bed.

98
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.283
That's all you need.

99
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.370
<v 0>So some people, they carry it on their back. There's a thing called a bivy sack.</v>

100
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:41.080
You know, Navy sack is a bivy sack is like either a bivy or Sacra bivy tent.

101
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.180
Um, they're like essentially a, like a combination sleeping bag tent.

102
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.690
Oh cool. And it's super light pull, pull up, um,

103
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.820
a picture of a bivy tent.

104
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.120
<v 1>Yeah. That's one of the reasons I didn't go to south America because I was like,</v>

105
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.290
there's going to be more camping.

106
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.190
It seems like up and down the coast and stuff like cities. And I'm just like,

107
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.750
I dunno if I can camp alone for that long.

108
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.550
<v 0>You might freak out. Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.710
Be hard to get a good night's sleep round. A bunch of weirdos,

110
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.920
speak their language. This is what they look like. Oh, neat.

111
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.100
So you keep that thing, they wrap it up, put it on their back.

112
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.210
It's pretty light.

113
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.000
<v 1>Ran it off you. Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.810
<v 0>It's basically like just this tiny, little tent.</v>

115
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.260
And like, if you were a minimalist hiker,

116
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.800
like if you're some guy was trying to walk 50 miles or something crazy,

117
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:31.634
like these guys,

118
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.990
they try to carry as light stuff as they can and try to go as minimal as they

119
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:38.570
can. And that's one way that they do that.

120
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.040
And then a lot of times they'll use like a little air mattress like that dude

121
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:44.900
has a little, uh, oh, wow.

122
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.240
<v 1>Blow it up. Don't take up any space. Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.720
<v 0>Just got to hope it doesn't pop. Oh yeah. Otherwise you're sleeping on rocks.</v>

124
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.083
It's hard.

125
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.740
<v 1>But that was what everybody did to traveling for this backpack test.</v>

126
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.310
You just got to make it work. Space was like a, a

127
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.120
that's another thing you learn too. It's like, I don't need much stuff. Yeah.

128
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.290
You go down to like, you know,

129
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.270
just a backpack full of that's all your belongings. Right? You buy anything,

130
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.153
you throw something out.

131
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.280
<v 0>Yeah, man.</v>

132
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.990
Like there's a real movement right now towards minimalism

133
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.190
or where people are trying to pair the life down as much as possible.

134
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.911
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:26.810
I think people don't want to get involved with like banks and having to like

136
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.070
mortgage themselves and their lifestyle just for the sake of having things. Yep.

137
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.000
When they're like,

138
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.640
and so they get into like stuff like camping and hiking waltz.

139
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.400
<v 0>Also, you got to think like, what do you really appreciate?</v>

140
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.880
What's important to you. And what's really important to you. Yeah.

141
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.950
Cause you don't have forever. Right.

142
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:45.710
So what is important to you because you only have 24 hours in a day,

143
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:49.880
so what's important to you find out what the that is and do more of that

144
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.340
and try to figure out like how to,

145
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.410
how to make enough money so that you're not starving that you're doing well,

146
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.130
but don't just chase that chase. What you're trying to do.

147
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.210
I did the point system attached to it. The monetary point system.

148
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.650
It can get you all up because it'll get you working like 12 hours a day,

149
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.910
13 hours to get what, to get more stuff, to get better stuff,

150
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.360
to get more prestigious stuff, to get stuff that you know, all your other stuff,

151
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:19.220
having friends are really jealous of your stuff.

152
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.550
<v 1>And you're just going to die, bro. If you can, long term,</v>

153
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:25.100
I mean like what are you getting out of it now? That's right.

154
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.800
That's what's most important. Yeah. A ton of people that are like,

155
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.980
I don't want that. So I'm just going to do a job, you know,

156
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:33.170
working on a tugboat in Seattle for few months,

157
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:36.110
save up money and then go enjoy myself. Yeah.

158
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.671
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

159
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:41.720
There's a lot of people that are just choosing to look at everything that they

160
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:45.170
can see experienced every new place that they can go to.

161
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.410
That Henry Rollins podcast, man, it's a world changer. Yeah.

162
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.340
That crazy is fascinating. He's a fast,

163
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:54.410
I never met anybody like him. He's really.

164
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:55.710
<v 1>Fascinated. He goes and does.</v>

165
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.410
<v 0>Stuff at sea stuff. It was just also his lit outlook,</v>

166
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.100
how he simplifies all the things that are wrong with him and all the things that

167
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:04.620
are wrong with the way he interacts with people.

168
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:07.320
And so this is what I'm going to do. And it's gonna, you know,

169
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:10.440
like he's like his, his, um,

170
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.330
story about being given was a Ritalin was Ritalin, right?

171
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.050
From the time he was like five for as a young boy,

172
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.250
they gave him Ritalin until senior year of high school. So he was like,

173
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.050
I would just be on these pills. I'd be like all day at the end of the day,

174
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.990
like boom. He was like crash. And then they do it again. I mean,

175
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:35.250
they were juicing them up with this crazy stuff from like,

176
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:36.540
he was an experimental case.

177
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.780
<v 1>I grew up in, from what I understand, he's from Potomac, Maryland,</v>

178
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.080
which is same counties where I grew up in. But he,

179
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.070
that was the richer part of town. Um, not that he was a rich kid,

180
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.810
but like Montgomery county is one of the richest counties in America. And like,

181
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.720
that was just a standard thing. Like if your kid's not performing,

182
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.660
ideally he's learning disabled. Give him some pills. Right.

183
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.850
<v 0>Crazy. Yeah. That people thought for awhile, that was the way to go.</v>

184
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.460
I just, uh,

185
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.650
it just fascinating that he so like Henry so intense and

186
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.820
he so like is he's got like these rock solid fix

187
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.860
this view of the world. It's very egalitarian, very open,

188
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:22.680
but also very aggressive. Very interesting.

189
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.960
<v 1>And this is why I believe no matter what. Yes. He's like, oh yeah, for sure.</v>

190
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.520
I've thought about this and here's the answer.

191
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.730
<v 0>No, I super enjoyed talking to him. Thanks for looking that up.</v>

192
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.540
<v 1>I'm glad it worked out, but I was like, all right, I got back. I was like,</v>

193
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.960
true link up with them. You're like, yeah, we did. It's a good pack. I was like,

194
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.490
oh hell yeah.

195
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.700
<v 0>Yeah. It was really good.</v>
