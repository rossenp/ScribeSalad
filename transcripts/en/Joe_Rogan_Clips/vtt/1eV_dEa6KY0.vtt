00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But, uh, I had a question for you right off the bat,</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.960
um, regarding Metformin,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
there was actually an article I'm sure you saw it recently. Um,

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.330
like within the last couple of days,

5
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:15.390
that was going around through all the mainstream papers, it was, uh,

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.160
talking about how for the use of Metformin, uh,

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.590
DGA and w was there something else as well that was taking two years human

8
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.480
growth hormone taking two years to biological years off of people's lives in

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.350
terms of their, their age, which your natural eight would your actual I'm 52,

10
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:35.190
it would make me 50.

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.360
<v 1>Right. Even 49.5 clinical study. That's what I'm looking for.</v>

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.550
<v 1>That was, that was good study. Uh, you know, it's only nine people,</v>

14
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:45.810
so we have to repeat this.

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.190
<v 0>Um, will they studs,</v>

16
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.970
or did you get like nine super athletes or did you get like schmoes that don't

17
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:51.804
exercise?

18
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.130
<v 1>Uh, I, as far as I know, these were just a regular Schmalz Shamar. Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.993
Which is good news.

20
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.290
<v 0>Yes. Good news. Yeah. I mean, that's what you want. You don't want, like,</v>

21
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.860
some people just respond better. They're super bodies, you know.

22
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.400
<v 1>Well, the great thing about that, uh, study is first of all,</v>

23
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:12.300
I was with the first, uh, the main author on that paper, uh, while it came out,

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.500
I was over in Israel, uh, as part of my journey up the,

25
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:19.530
the great rift of Africa ended up in Israel. Anyway, the guy there, uh,

26
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.680
Steve Horvath is his name. Uh, he and I,

27
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.610
and a couple of other guys are trying to figure out, uh, not just why we age,

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.200
why we don't have to, but is aging, uh, truly reversible.

29
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.400
And that's what this study suggests is that it's not just about slowing down

30
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:40.200
aging, but one day we could be 80, but biologically 30.

31
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.550
<v 0>Now, when we're talking about the biological age,</v>

32
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.570
how is that measured? Is this measured by the length of the telomeres?

33
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.700
Is this measured by physical performance?

34
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.800
Is it measured by a combination of these factors?

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.550
<v 1>It's none of that, no something brand new, most people don't know about it.</v>

36
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.410
So it's called the Horvath clock.

37
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.330
And what Horvath and others have discovered is that if you read the DNA

38
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.300
and you don't just look at the letters, ACTG,

39
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.570
if you look at what's on the letter C sizing, it's called,

40
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.490
there are chemical modifications.

41
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.830
And those chemicals change as we get older in very linear and predictable

42
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:20.100
ways. If you use a computer AI, you can say,

43
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.250
if I took your blood sample right now, I could read your DNA,

44
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.990
look at those chemical groups on the seas. And I could say you are okay,

45
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:32.520
you're 52. You might be 46, according to that clock. Uh,

46
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.270
and also I could predict when you're going to die. Whoa, scary thought, right?

47
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.570
Yeah. Like a fortune teller. Yeah. But the good news is, well,

48
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.590
now that we know what's not just a measuring agent,

49
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:44.940
we actually think that clock is part of the aging process.

50
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.700
We're learning how to reverse it to, Hmm.

51
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.560
<v 0>Now is this just one modality? This,</v>

52
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:57.360
this combination of growth hormone is this one way of going

53
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:00.340
about it? Are there other ways of going about it? Growth hormone,

54
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:03.010
D H CA Metformin, is there anything else?

55
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.640
<v 1>Well, that's the first that's ever been shown to those three things,</v>

56
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.860
but I'm sure there's going to be many more discovered.

57
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.670
We've only had this Horvath clock over the last few years in humans, uh,

58
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.840
being used widely. Uh, but I think as we use this clock, uh,

59
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.200
we're going to figure out that whole bunch of stuff that we do and things that

60
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:23.380
we can do and combine will not just slow aging,

61
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.620
but reverse it and not just by two and a half years eventually.

62
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.470
And some of the technology that I talk about in my book,

63
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.250
we think could turn the clock back by a decade or more. Wow.

64
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.390
<v 0>Now what things are you talking about that could possibly turn it back a decade</v>

65
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:41.800
or more? Well, so the, and who do I have to blow? Sorry.

66
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.473
Uh.

67
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.620
<v 1>Yeah, you can blow me. Yeah. You may have to do it a few times,</v>

68
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.770
but, uh, the, uh,

69
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.180
the amazing thing about where we are now today with aging, um,

70
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.530
and we're right on the cutting edge.

71
00:03:56.531 --> 00:04:00.970
So it's great to be able to share this with your listeners, is this clock it's,

72
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.440
uh, changes on the DNA, right? What I'm saying, uh,

73
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.850
in my theory of, uh, of aging is that it's not the DNA that we lose.

74
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.720
That's the old theory, you know, the old idea that anti-oxidants hurt the DNS.

75
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.020
Just throw that out for a while. Maybe forever.

76
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.030
What I think is going on is it's,

77
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:24.010
the DNA is getting modified and the cell can't read the DNA the way it

78
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:28.480
used to. Okay. That's really important. And so the clock is not just a clock,

79
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.330
it's not a clock on the wall. It's also,

80
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.720
if you move the hands of the clock time changes. That's what I think is.

81
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.470
<v 0>Can we pause right here for a moment and explain what you were saying about</v>

82
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:39.310
antioxidants?

83
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.140
<v 1>Well, and toxins have been the biggest disappointment, uh, in the aging field.</v>

84
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.560
Um, it doesn't stop, you know, 40 million people every day,

85
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.180
buying drinks with antioxidants in them,

86
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.550
but anti-oxidants have with very few exceptions failed to extend the

87
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.770
lifespan of any organism, but.

88
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.340
<v 0>You are a proponent of resveratrol, at least you used to be, are you still.</v>

89
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.370
<v 1>We'll take it. Um, and we still study at my lab,</v>

90
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.490
but what's you brought this up is really important.

91
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.750
Re virtual was originally thought to be an antioxidant and it is a mild

92
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.030
antioxidant, but the way it really works,

93
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.620
we know this is a fact from my lab is that it's stimulating the body's defenses

94
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.700
against aging and disease because it's,

95
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.100
it's binding to these enzymes that we work on called serotonins.

96
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.170
And these are the defenders of the body.

97
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.220
<v 0>And you were saying that if I remember correctly, you take resveratrol,</v>

98
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.600
you take powdered form,

99
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.230
actually bought exactly what you take and you mix it with yogurt in the morning.

100
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:39.160
Is that, is that how you do it? Yup. What's the dose that you take?

101
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.830
<v 1>Well, probably comes out to about a gram.</v>

102
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.520
<v 0>And a gram. Yeah. Okay. So if someone's taking capsules.</v>

103
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.170
<v 1>What depends. If the probably capsules, a 250 milligrams,</v>

104
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:55.030
that'd be four in the morning. Yeah. You know, I'm still alive, so that's good.

105
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.450
Oh.

106
00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.230
<v 0>Thank you. Do you, um, is it important to take it with fats?</v>

107
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.940
Is that why you take it with yogurt?

108
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.130
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Either high protein, which is, uh, you know, uh, Greek yogurt,</v>

109
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.630
suffices, or fact, but water it's like brick dust. It won't dissolve and.

110
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.890
<v 0>Just a glass of whole milk. Maybe it would be okay. That's great.</v>

111
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.770
But it has to have something to bind to. Is that the deal for sure? Yeah.

112
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.140
<v 1>Yeah. In, in our studies, in humans and in mice,</v>

113
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.260
if we didn't give them high-fat food, it barely got in there.

114
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.670
<v 0>Less. Now this study of Metformin,</v>

115
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.410
D H E a N human growth hormone does not include an MN.

116
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.533
<v 1>Right.</v>

117
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.300
<v 0>So, but NMN is also effective.</v>

118
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.040
<v 1>Ah, well, let's delve in a little bit, please, if you read the paper, uh,</v>

119
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.870
and I have, uh,

120
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.520
it turns out one of the effects of this treatment was the reduction in the

121
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:54.350
levels of a protein called CD 38 CD 38 resides

122
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.490
on immune cells. And it goes up as we get older and what they found,

123
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:01.940
one of the biggest effects of the treatment was the levels of this city.

124
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:05.480
38 protein went down. So what is the CD 38?

125
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.610
This is the main enzyme in our bodies that degrades NAD NAD is required

126
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:14.930
for the sirtuin defenders to work. So one possibility is that, uh,

127
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.980
and I'm sure it's complicated,

128
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:20.960
but one way this could be working is by allowing your body to make NAD

129
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.060
and store it rather than degrading it as we get older.

130
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.910
<v 0>Interesting. So would supplementing with</v>

131
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.830
NMN, which is a form of NAD, correct? A precursor. Yeah. Precursor,

132
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.460
would that, uh, enhance the effects?

133
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:40.400
Do you believe like if they tried to do a new study, it could.

134
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.030
<v 1>It could,</v>

135
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.630
it could potentially each of these patients cost $10,000 for the treatment.

136
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.730
So it's, it's not easy to do these studies.

137
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.040
<v 0>$10,000 For the entire T of the treatment and the treatment last, how long?</v>

138
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.110
<v 1>Um, I don't remember how long they treated the patients for. Uh,</v>

139
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.650
but I do know that it's, wasn't shaped. That's why they only did nine.

140
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.490
Cause at first I said to my friend, Steve Horvath, nine patients,

141
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.680
you kidding me? Why didn't you do 50? And I went, well,

142
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.740
we didn't have the money. That's the, that's the, anyway,

143
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:13.280
my point really is that we need to test a lot of different combinations,

144
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.060
include animal and include a there's one called rapamycin,

145
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:18.620
which is a little bit more risky and toxic,

146
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:20.570
but there are better molecules in development.

147
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.030
The question is what is the best combination?

148
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.450
And do you use it with exercise and fasting? Um,

149
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.210
or is it bad to combine them all together? We don't know yet.

150
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.980
<v 0>That's a good question, too,</v>

151
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:34.250
that I wanted to ask you because one of the things that came out of the podcast

152
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:37.640
was input from some other people that I know that are nutrition experts and

153
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.090
performance experts that were skeptical about Metformin.

154
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.390
And they were saying that Metformin, although it may have, uh,

155
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.190
an anti-aging effect, it actually decreases physical performance in athletes.

156
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.900
<v 1>Well that there is a study that shows that, uh, and raise virtual to actually,</v>

157
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.380
uh, real can prevent the great gains from hot exercise.

158
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.910
So here's the solution, uh, that I think is worth trying a solution.

159
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.290
And that is a theme that, that I have in my book and in my, on my research.

160
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.800
And that is, we don't want to be doing everything every day, necessarily.

161
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.890
We want to pulse it. We want to shock the body and let it recover.

162
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.170
We know that you can't just exercise. I mean,

163
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:19.620
some people who've been on this show run a hundred miles every, every weekend,

164
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:23.820
but generally you want to hit it hard and let it recover, hit at Huddler com.

165
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.350
So what I am planning to do and actually started doing is on days that I'm

166
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:30.540
exercising and recovering, I don't take Metformin.

167
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.030
And then when I'm just sitting around on a plane, I do.

168
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.970
And that way I think that my body can have the best of both worlds.

169
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.590
<v 0>So when you are not exercising and you take it,</v>

170
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.720
you feel like it doesn't have a hit when you are exercising and not taking it.

171
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.980
So it somehow, or another whatever performance had has it's temporary.

172
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.500
<v 1>Yeah. Right. So, well.</v>

173
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.150
<v 0>This is all just theoretical.</v>

174
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.910
<v 1>It is we're right on the cutting edge of human knowledge.</v>

175
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.910
We don't actually know what the best thing is, but my,

176
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.960
my best guess is that we want to allow the body to recover.

177
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:06.720
So I don't take Metformin on those days, rather than taking Metformin everyday,

178
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:07.620
like a diabetic would.

179
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.100
<v 0>[Inaudible]. And what does</v>

180
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.933
, what is the, what's the hit, like what is happening? What's the mechanism behind the performance hit from taking Metformin?

181
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.470
<v 1>Oh, we don't know, but I can tell you the best, uh,</v>

182
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.150
explanation that I can give you.

183
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.490
So Metformin is a derivative of a plant molecule, the French lilac.

184
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:28.980
So it's not crazy molecule. It's pretty natural,

185
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.320
but what it does is many things in the body.

186
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.580
Scientists will quite annoyingly argue about it for, for,

187
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.270
to have for the past 40 years. Um, so there's no correct answer.

188
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.020
But what I think is going on is that Metformin is interfering with the

189
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:45.780
mitochondria mitochondria in the cell, mitochondria the,

190
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.780
we call them battery packs. They basically making chemical energy.

191
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.870
Without that chemical energy, we'd be dead in about 20 seconds.

192
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.070
So we need that for life.

193
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.690
So Metformin interrupts that energy production in the mitochondria, uh,

194
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.970
but you need the mitochondria to amplify after you've exercised. So they're,

195
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.530
they're antagonizing each other.

196
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.190
So why does Metformin work by inhibiting the mitochondria?

197
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.580
The body gets a signal that it doesn't have enough chemical energy.

198
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:14.670
It's not making enough. So it expands the number of mitochondria.

199
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.870
These are ancient remnants of bacteria that entered ourselves.

200
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.800
And we have less, if we sit around and like we are now,

201
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.460
and we have more free exercise and Metformin by telling the body, uh,

202
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.520
we're running out of energy, the body responds and makes more mitochondria,

203
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:30.600
just like exercise does.

204
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.680
But I think if you're taking Metformin and exercising,

205
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.810
that inhibition is preventing the benefit somehow of what you get with exercise.

206
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.720
<v 0>Perhaps preventing your house. So like what, what did the study,</v>

207
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.180
or what studies have been done? What did they reveal?

208
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.570
<v 1>Uh, I don't remember the precise details of the study. It was,</v>

209
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.800
it was giving Metformin every day to people who were, uh,

210
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.370
in controlled exercise, I think was treadmill, um, a few times a week.

211
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.500
Uh, but then what they measured was the mitochondrial benefit now that, uh,

212
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.890
and I think they measured a bit of strength.

213
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.050
<v 0>Fusing that there's a Mito mitochondrial benefit, but a performance hit.</v>

214
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.540
<v 1>Well, no, they actually Metformin prevented the mitochondria from amplifying up.</v>

215
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.410
Oh, all right. So then it must be, uh,

216
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.620
interfering with the signal that you get from exercise, whatever that is.

217
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.060
We don't know exactly what that is.

218
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.670
<v 0>So you'd really have to be some sort of a Guinea pig to try to with this stuff,</v>

219
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.140
to go back and forth from taking it and exercising, not taking it.

220
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.190
Yeah.

221
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.300
<v 1>And exercise. And I'm one of those.</v>
