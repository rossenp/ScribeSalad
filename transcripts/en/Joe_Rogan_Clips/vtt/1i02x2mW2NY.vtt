00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 0>Point in my life where I hand on heart thought I</v>

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.160
was gonna end up in a padded room.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.290
That's how bad.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.670
<v 1>It was.</v>

5
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.210
But it's fascinating that you're saying that setting goals and setting your mind

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.890
on things and hard training is what's set you back on track. And now I,

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.360
I don't know what your, like when there's no one in front of you,

8
00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:25.360
but standing here in front of you right now, I would say this is a, a healthy,

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.720
vibrant guy, a.

10
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.920
<v 0>Hundred percent. I've never felt better. Mentally strong, physically.</v>

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.240
I've training hard. I feel fit as a fiddle. You know, I,

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360
I wouldn't be here if I was anything wrong with.

13
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.500
<v 1>Me,</v>

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.200
but that's fascinating that most people think that to come back from a mental

15
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:43.630
health issue like yours, you need psychiatric care and you need medication.

16
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.750
And you are saying you did it with setting goals and hard work.

17
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.110
<v 0>And the biggest thing we're missing here is I didn't,</v>

18
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.110
I didn't do it with doctors and, um, all them type of things.

19
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.470
I Don it was something way more powerful. God.

20
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.990
<v 1>So your faith and your belief.</v>

21
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.780
<v 0>Me faith and belief that God would make me better. Made me better.</v>

22
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.460
Almost like somebody who don't have any faith will think, oh,

23
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.140
this this nonsense or whatever, but.

24
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.380
<v 1>I'm living proof. Well, if you believe in something, yeah. I mean,</v>

25
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.620
just like you were talking about believing in pills that don't do anything.

26
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.940
Belief is a powerful thing. Whether who knows what's behind that belief,

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.050
but what you saying is so powerful that you just,

28
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.130
by virtue of changing the way you think about things, setting goals,

29
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.370
working hard,

30
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.930
you lifted yourself out of the worst depression of your life to the point where

31
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:36.770
you were suicidal a hundred.

32
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.090
<v 0>Percent. And I never ever went back to that from this day to that.</v>

33
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:42.290
And it's been, it's been one over 12 months.

34
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.400
<v 1>That's pretty amazing. I mean, it's just,</v>

35
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.440
that's an amazing thing for people to hear because there's a lot of people that

36
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.640
rely heavily on antidepressants and medication.

37
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.600
And they think that is the only way for them to be happy.

38
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.280
And for them to be not suicidal, not depressed, they need that medication.

39
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.360
And for them to hear what you are saying, I think is a very power,

40
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.510
powerful thing. It.

41
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.750
<v 0>Is, but I'm no doctor.</v>

42
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.550
I'm not gonna tell people to Chuck away your pills and right. And pray. Right.

43
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.510
But it, it doesn't do any harm. What I'm seeing, give it a whirl, give it a try.

44
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:20.150
It can't hurt. You set yourself some goals, think positive and, uh, crack on,

45
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.003
do a bit of training.

46
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.340
<v 1>So from, from accomplishing your ultimate at goal beating CLE,</v>

47
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.700
go becoming the heavyweight champion and then falling into this deep funk.

48
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.820
Do you think you had to go through all this to come back again?

49
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.620
<v 0>I think so. Yeah. I believe I was being tested to, to,</v>

50
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.500
to see what type of man I was and what type of character I had. And, you know,

51
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.770
even before the depression, I didn't appreciate the nothing.

52
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:49.330
Nothing was value to me. So even something I'd worked hard for,

53
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.650
if I'd worked hard and, and saved up for a car, just say for five minutes,

54
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:56.970
they'd be okay. But then I wouldn't want it anymore. It was a piece of.

55
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.800
So nothing mattered to me. I didn't value anything,

56
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.120
anything that I had and I worked hard for and everyone knows like,

57
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.520
what I have is blood money because I pay for him in face and my body gets

58
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.200
punched to pieces for what I have.

59
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.200
So you'd think I'd appreciate things more than the next month,

60
00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:19.710
but I didn't appreciate nothing. Didn't appreciate anything.

61
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.670
Anything I door achieved, even world championships,

62
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.750
anything I thought is that it is.

63
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.790
<v 1>This your whole life or something like this. Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.230
<v 0>So I believe I was taught.</v>

65
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.110
I was put down this road and I had to suffer all these things so I could

66
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.670
understand when I add things good. Like today,

67
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.460
I'm happy that I'm breathing fresh air, that I'm, I'm sat here in a mental,

68
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.180
mentally stable way of thinking.

69
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.540
I'm happy that I can go out and enjoy a dinner and just be normal,

70
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.060
whatever that is. Mm that's. What I'm happy for.

71
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.900
I'm one of the most, probably the most unique people you'll ever meet. I'm not,

72
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.050
I'm not orientated by I material things and, and all that sort of stuff.

73
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:06.850
It means nothing to me. I don't even care about glory and honor,

74
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.010
I don't care about legacies. I don't care about winning titles or, or,

75
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.370
or medals doesn't matter.

76
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.090
But when I set my mind to doing something, I'll do it.

77
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.600
And every single time I've ever set my mind to anything, I've done it.

78
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.840
Even unthinkable things. Have I set my mind to I've done it.

79
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.800
I don't care about wanting what Deontay Wilder has in his position or whatever.

80
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.040
I only wanna beat him in a fight. That's it?

81
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.400
<v 1>You only wanna beat him because it's so difficult.</v>

82
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.920
<v 0>Not just that, because that's what I wanna do. I that's your goal set me goal,</v>

83
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.470
be eating Deontay Wilder. So do you.

84
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.220
<v 1>Think that that's the,</v>

85
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.790
your future is just setting goals and constantly trying to achieve those goals?

86
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.030
<v 0>I think, I think I've got a bigger purpose now than boxing.</v>

87
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.510
Boxing's a sport and something I've made a living out of for a long time,

88
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.110
but I think there's a bigger picture. Bigger than any, any winning,

89
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.860
any titles bigger than winning any, any fights number of fights?

90
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.180
I think my call in Karl in life is to spread the word on this, this disease,

91
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.133
a silent killer,

92
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.900
a a killer that's so ferocious that you can't see it or feel it

93
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.020
from the outside. You could be suffering right now,

94
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.020
but I won't be able to see it because I can't see into your mind.

95
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.130
<v 1>You it's just so unusual that someone has that solution,</v>

96
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.770
that hard work dedication and setting goals is what lifted you out of the

97
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:34.210
depression and made you appreciate life and made you appreciate all the,

98
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:36.370
all the aspects of it. Yeah.

99
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.090
<v 0>I appreciate everything. You know, spending time with me family,</v>

100
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.720
I took it for granted before far. I spent time with time family. Anytime I want,

101
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.880
I, I couldn't put into words what I went through, but let me just say,

102
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.440
I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy.

103
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.040
Not that I have any enemies, but if I did,

104
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.120
I wouldn't wish on a soul because I know how hard it is.

105
00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:01.800
And I know a lesser person,

106
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.720
maybe not I've got through and maybe not a man without faith may would've took

107
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:06.554
his own life.

108
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.640
<v 1>Now that you have gotten through,</v>

109
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.160
do you feel like you have the solution now to navigate the rest of your life?

110
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.143
Yeah.

111
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.230
<v 0>I know. I know the secret for me and everybody's will be different,</v>

112
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.550
but if I train every day and I'm stay in shape, then I'll be happy forever.

113
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.590
The time I stop training, the time I balloon back up again,

114
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.990
the time it all goes wrong again.

115
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.430
And I know that if you know something in your life, then you don't do it.

116
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.750
And that's what I know. It's like a diabetic. If he goes and eat a lot of sugar,

117
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.670
he know's gonna make him ill. So he don't do it.

118
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.660
So as long as I always stay by them guidelines, I know I'm gonna be all right.

119
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.900
And that's.

120
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.700
<v 1>How she wrote. So as long as you, well, that's the other thing too, right?</v>

121
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.580
The alcohol and the drugs exacerbate, any sort of bad state that you have,

122
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:53.620
because you're gonna feel like. Yeah.

123
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.530
<v 0>I'm not T total. Right? I I've had a drink since I've been back. I been I've,</v>

124
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:01.090
I've been out with the lads, had drinks, whatever.

125
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.970
<v 1>And, but your goals are still set and strong. Yeah. But long as,</v>

126
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:09.650
so that's really what it is. Yeah. So from now on,

127
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:12.690
you just have to continually set goals in your life, set goals.

128
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.610
<v 0>Whatever them goals might be. They don't have to be massive goals,</v>

129
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.760
but they can be any, anything, really, anything that I want do,

130
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.680
or I wanna achieve, or I wanna go someplace or whatever. Then I,

131
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.360
I work towards it and set myself a goal.

132
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.040
It's almost like a little treat or whatever.

133
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.280
<v 1>It's fascinating because no one's ever really connected that. I mean, people,</v>

134
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:33.520
people have made that connection in terms of like, when they study happy people,

135
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.160
one of the things they find about happy people is their goal oriented people.

136
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.070
They set goals think come with those people,

137
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.350
but nobody's ever really set that as a remedy for

138
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.270
depression and for mental health issues, setting goals, achieving those goals.

139
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.790
That's the key to keep it going.

140
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.710
<v 0>I believe that's the case. Yeah. After doing quite a lot of research on,</v>

141
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.430
on myself and experiencing it and it, it works for me.

142
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:58.670
And I find it works for a lot of people. I speak to,

143
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.780
who's got the same problems. I get messages from all,

144
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.540
all over the world from different types of sports people and different type of

145
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:08.100
people asking for information and, and help and how I,

146
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.500
I got free mine and what I did. And I'm happy to, I'm happy to help.

147
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.700
So if there's anybody out there who's struggling in silence,

148
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.860
which a lot of people are, then I'm always there to help.

149
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.480
<v 1>If I can.</v>

150
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.090
What's such an impressive of an inspiring message because you're doing it

151
00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:25.490
without medication. You're doing it just through positive thinking,

152
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:28.490
through goal setting and through healthy living. That's.

153
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.970
<v 0>Right. And I believe it's the best, best way to live. Anyway.</v>

154
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.850
Best way to live is fit and healthy.

155
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.810
When you're outta shape and you feel unfit and you feel terrible,

156
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.210
then nothing's gonna go right for you. But if you feel fit.

157
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.760
<v 1>You feel good. It's almost natural to feel depressed.</v>

158
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:46.160
If your body is literally depressed.

159
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.960
<v 0>If every time I go to the gym and do a little bit of training,</v>

160
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:52.680
whether it be a lot or little, I always go out of a shower.

161
00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:56.240
And I think I feel great. Now, training sets off an endorphin in your blood.

162
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.920
It makes you happy. Contentment is a word we're looking for contentment.

163
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:05.560
Doesn't come through material stuff, jobs, positions, fame,

164
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.520
glory, money, anything contentment.

165
00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:09.840
You'll never find contentment while you're chasing that sort of stuff.

166
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.560
My message would be

167
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.310
look around yourself and be thankful for what you do have today.

168
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.390
Don't look for what you don't have. You know, you gotta be,

169
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.430
be happy with who you are and why is man once said,

170
00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:29.150
you gotta know yourself before. You can know anybody else through yourself,

171
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.830
try and understand yourself. Think what makes you happy and do that.

172
00:09:32.831 --> 00:09:36.140
And what makes you sad? Don't do it. It's very simple, right? If so,

173
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:39.420
makes me sad. No, then I'm not gonna do it anymore. Take that on me life.

174
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.220
I don't want that. And if you know,

175
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:43.540
something's gonna lead you down the wrong way in a wrong puff in life,

176
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.700
don't do it simple, very simple set yourself, small time goals,

177
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.460
long time goals, achieve them and move on. Now, how.

178
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.140
<v 1>Long did it take you for you to lose the weight?</v>

179
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.210
<v 0>I started training in November, 2017,</v>

180
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.650
400 pounds. Yeah. And I can't run.

181
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.170
I got down to 275 pounds in my first fight back

182
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.450
in June. And by August in my second fight back,

183
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.360
I was 258 pounds. And I've,

184
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:22.400
I've maintained that weight 2 60, 2 58. That's your ideal weight? Yeah.

185
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:23.240
From there to now.

186
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.640
<v 1>So, um, what did you do differently with your diet? Like what did you.</v>

187
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.920
<v 0>I was eating a lot on drinking a lot. I just stopped all that sort of stuff.</v>

188
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.710
Like my weight wasn't put on through being in a normal person, eating.

189
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.870
Normally my weight was put on through excessive drinking of Larga.

190
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.350
There's like 500 calories in one pint of beer and I'd go out and I'd drink a

191
00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:49.230
minimal of 18 of those beers. &lt;laugh&gt;

192
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.710
followed by whiskey vodka, everything else.

193
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.020
Then I'd stop off on no way. And I'd says kebabs chocolates.

194
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.740
It was excessive living. If you put your body through torture,

195
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.740
you can't expect to feel great. Right?

196
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.300
So what I did was I started eating outfit feet, not drinking,

197
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.473
and that was it really.

198
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.220
I just trained on a daily basis for a long period of time. And,

199
00:11:15.221 --> 00:11:18.490
and at sensible and clean have caught everything out.

200
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.250
But if you want faster results, then, then you do it. No.
