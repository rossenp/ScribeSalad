00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.090
<v 1>Experience. Is one city in Pakistan. Is it Karachi? What does that city,</v>

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.630
why can't I remember the name that, uh, is that it,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.380
that was one of the cities that, um, uh,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.700
Shane Smith from vice was saying was one of the most terrifying places on earth.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.300
Oh yeah, because the, the, the sheer cheapness of murder,

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.140
how cheap it is to get someone murdered over there and how much murder and crime

8
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.280
goes on over there, God,

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.450
it's just a totally different metric for how you view the world.

10
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:35.400
Totally different perception of what life is worth and what life is like and

11
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.170
what kind of violence you have to deal with on a daily basis.

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.900
<v 0>It's gone. I know there's a lot of very dark places.</v>

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.730
That's why I don't like to travel.

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.990
<v 1>You don't want to travel at.</v>

15
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.880
<v 0>All. I do like to travel, but I don't,</v>

16
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.310
I'm starting to cross off a bunch of places.

17
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.650
<v 1>To sketch. Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.603
<v 0>You know,</v>

19
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.480
between getting parasites that make you have to poop in a bag and send to your

20
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:59.280
doctor or ending up in like real violent places that don't have the same

21
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:01.980
kind of, uh, rules that.

22
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.540
<v 1>You know, my friend, Justin Wren, who runs a fight for the forgotten charity,</v>

23
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:07.110
he was.

24
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.520
<v 0>Just wearing his shirt at the beach yesterday.</v>

25
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.340
<v 1>It's awesome. The best guy ever. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.760
He has a new intestinal parasite.

27
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.300
That's draining him and he doesn't know what the. Oh yeah. Yeah.

28
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.510
He's got something that he caught when he was over there. Now.

29
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.550
<v 0>That's what I'm afraid of. He's really sick.</v>

30
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.300
<v 1>Easy, really?</v>

31
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.100
<v 0>Yeah. He's really going to be okay. I don't know.</v>

32
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.730
<v 1>They're going to have to, um, hopefully identify it. Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:30.750
They have to figure out what it is.

34
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.780
Figure out how he got it figured out what's going on.

35
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.140
<v 0>That's no joke what happened in the Dominican Republic didn't they,</v>

36
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.710
people died because they were drinking from the minibar to hear that story.

37
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.930
<v 1>Yes. Yes. There's.</v>

38
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.340
<v 0>A lot of sketch.</v>

39
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.760
They were saying that people were putting stuff in the mini bar that wasn't

41
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:49.350
actually alcohol. Yeah.

42
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.070
The story that I had heard was that they would put cheap substitutes for

43
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:57.090
whatever the alcohol was supposed to be so that people would pay for it.

44
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:57.721
And then, you know,

45
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.440
they would steal the actual liquor and replace it with something else and then

46
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.400
people would drink and it was like.

47
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
<v 0>And they were dying. People really die. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.580
<v 1>Terrible. I hope, I don't know what the actual story was,</v>

49
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.590
but somebody else described it saying like,

50
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.160
one thing is you concentrate on statistics. And I don't know if this is true,

51
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.670
we should find out, but that if you concentrate on statistics,

52
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.790
then it seems like a lot of people die in the Dominican Republic when they were

53
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:21.181
over there.

54
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:24.510
But the reality is that it's just the way we're looking at it because we've

55
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.840
chosen to start focusing on people who die over there. But in fact,

56
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.410
it's like commensurate with people that die over here when they're on vacation.

57
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.430
<v 0>Right.</v>

58
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.200
But it is only a certain number go to that resort,

59
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.580
you know?

60
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.960
<v 1>Yeah. One resort, I believe it was. Yeah. I think so. Well,</v>

61
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.090
a lot of people go to the Dominican or not now,

62
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.940
but a lot of people were there last year. Yeah.

63
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.590
So would you go back after all this?

64
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.240
<v 0>No. First of all,</v>

65
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:55.440
I saw a story about a couple that went there and got hookworm in their feet. Oh.

66
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.460
<v 1>You can tell from the beach.</v>

67
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.590
<v 0>That I was already like,</v>

68
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.260
maybe not going back and now that you can't even drink from the mini bar,

69
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.410
I'm like, you know what? There's nice places in Laguna beach. Yeah.

70
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.810
<v 1>Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Look Guna.</v>

71
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.520
Did you know that hookworms responsible breach, hookworms responsible for the,

72
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.640
um, the stereotype of the Southern dummy?

73
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.970
<v 0>No. Yeah. What do you mean?</v>

74
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.100
<v 1>People walking around the south barefoot were getting hookworm and mass</v>

75
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.230
and hookworm has a detrimental effect on your ability to think

76
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.230
Literally compromises your mental ability. It makes you.

77
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.480
<v 0>So like the trope of like a hillbilly.</v>

78
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.500
<v 1>Yup. Yup. Do we find out about that from Peter Hotez?</v>

79
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.410
Is that who told us that I had a beard?

80
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.780
How a worm gave the south a bad name?

81
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.430
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

82
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.990
<v 1>Hookworms once sapped,</v>

83
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.250
the American south of its health and few realize that they continue to afflict

84
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.200
millions. Gee. Yeah.

85
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.300
<v 0>He looked so creepy.</v>

86
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.290
<v 1>It with the way you think makes you tired because you fatigue.</v>

87
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.480
Yeah. His podcast exhaustion. Listen, this weeks later,

88
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.370
victim succumb to an insatiable exhaustion and impenetrable haziness of the

89
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:19.960
mind that some called stupidity adults neglected their fields and children group

90
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.560
pale and listless victims develop grossly distended,

91
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:28.450
bellies and angel wings, a macerated shoulder blades accentuated by hunching,

92
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.790
all gazed out deli from sunken sockets with a tail tail fish eyes

93
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:36.850
stare. That is the stereotype of people from the south.

94
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.880
And we just always thought that they're just living in hot weather and they're

95
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:42.640
just stupid. It really was,

96
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.130
was worm was hookworm.

97
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.500
<v 0>None amazing. This podcast started off. We were having fun.</v>

98
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.900
We were talking about looking at you though.

99
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.180
<v 1>The culprit behind the germ of laziness as the south affliction was sometimes</v>

100
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:00.700
called, was neck contour.

101
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.400
American-ness the American murderer,

102
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.580
better known as the hookworm it's called the American murder.

103
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.690
<v 0>Are they still out there?</v>

104
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.590
<v 1>Millions of those blood-sucking parasites live fed. Yeah, for sure.</v>

105
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.600
And died within the guts of up to 40% of the population stretching from

106
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:18.670
Southeastern Texas to West Virginia.

107
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.530
Can you imagine 40% of the population of the south

108
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.940
in these places from Texas to West Virginia was infected

109
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:32.290
40% of the population with a worm that makes you dumb.

110
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.390
<v 0>I'm never going anywhere ever again. Incredible. That's this that's insane,</v>

111
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.110
but that's what.

112
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.060
<v 1>The stereotype came from. Wow.</v>

113
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.390
<v 0>How wild crazy. That's insane.</v>

114
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.580
<v 1>You know how many people are getting right now getting Lyme disease and Lyme</v>

115
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.970
disease, all that doesn't make you lazy. It's wrecks your health.

116
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.350
<v 0>For years. Yep. That.</v>

117
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 1>Is happening right now in the east coast. It's all it's over.</v>

118
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 0>These cause my kids were back there working on a farm over the,</v>

119
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.790
over the summer and my daughter had a tick on her. We freaked out.

120
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.830
<v 1>I should freak out. Yeah, you gotta get it off before 24 hours. And you know,</v>

121
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.020
but you also, if you do get infected,

122
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:14.900
you have to get on antibiotics really quickly, super fast.

123
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.940
There's a woman who wrote a book about, um, Lyme disease,

124
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.710
possibly being, uh,

125
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.330
a military biological weapon that accidentally was released.

126
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.310
Really? Yeah.

127
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.230
Apparently this is a popular thought that there's something about

128
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:34.130
Lyme disease.

129
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:38.630
That Lyme disease doesn't necessarily make sense how quickly it came from

130
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.970
this one area like this Lyme Connecticut area and how rapidly

131
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.360
it spread and how devastating its impact was.

132
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:52.220
And there is apparently there's has been some research that's

133
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:52.900
been done.

134
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.740
I'm not some quite a bit of research has done on various biological weapons and

135
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:59.420
various distribution methods.

136
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:04.310
And one of the thoughts of a lot of these distribution methods is infecting

137
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:05.144
bugs,

138
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.970
infecting bugs with some designer disease and then infecting the

139
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:15.260
population. Like if you release the bugs on this area that you wanted to attack,

140
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.970
like at a certain point in time and you infected giant chunks of the

141
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:21.080
population, right.

142
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.070
Then you would be able to go back there 10 years later and everybody would be.

143
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.230
Wow. Yeah. But this, this is something that biological diseases,

144
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:34.010
whether it's anthrax, like things along those lines, they terrifying,

145
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.840
but they've made those forever, you know, they've,

146
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.470
they've had that and people have been aware of that forever,

147
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.550
but the idea of it being something that's in a bug and that can infect.

148
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.780
<v 0>That's terrifying. Yeah. You trying to make it,</v>

149
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.660
are you trying to make it that I don't go out of my house trying to freak you

150
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:54.110
out, bro. No, it's weird that it's. I mean, we,

151
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.190
I don't remember being around when we were.

152
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.660
<v 1>It was not around and I think it took a while for anybody to figure out what the</v>

153
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.550
it was. Um, how about.

154
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.640
<v 0>The new mosquitoes that we have? Yes. Well,</v>

155
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.740
there's also never had these mosquitoes before.

156
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.600
<v 1>There's a recent case of a horrible disease breaking out in the east coast.</v>

157
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.750
I think somewhere in Massachusetts, there were some, uh,

158
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.100
horrible mosquito borne disease. What did that w what does that uh,

159
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.610
thing say about the ticks about Lyme disease? What is the book.

160
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.160
<v 2>It's called bitten? Yes. That's fine. Chris newbie.</v>

161
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.360
K with K R.

162
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.310
<v 1>I S. Chris, is that a man or a woman? It's a.</v>

163
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.370
<v 2>Woman. I believe she discovered the circumstantial evidence,</v>

164
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.850
like the outbreak of Lyme disease in the 1960s, the us military.

165
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.760
Some people say this is, but uh, some people say it's just.

166
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.700
<v 1>Who some people put up the articles so we can see it.</v>

167
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.690
It's the middle of the can give me a spread it out so I can see it

168
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.790
scroll down. Okay. The DOD go back up,

169
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.150
stop the DOD extreme care evolve,

170
00:08:56.151 --> 00:08:59.190
its research programs to ensure the protection of our personnel and the

171
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:03.480
community. What does that when Smith announced his amendment, okay,

172
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:04.680
this is this too much.

173
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.760
There says a there's just too much evidence for a reasonable man or woman to

174
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:11.670
just turn the page and say, put on your tinfoil hat.

175
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:13.620
This is just a conspiracy theory. Smith said.

176
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.070
And yet people with credentials will say that, which begs the question.

177
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.060
Why would they even say that Chris newbie wrote the book?

178
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.010
Bitten said she discovered circumstantial evidence linking the outbreak of Lyme

179
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:30.180
disease in the 1960s. That's what you said from the us military as proof new,

180
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:34.950
besides an interview that she had stopped right there with will Berg,

181
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.850
Dover, American scientists who discovered what causes Lyme disease,

182
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.680
who told her shortly before his death,

183
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.280
that he had been instructed to keep his research any possible.

184
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:46.080
Cause for Lyme disease, a secret,

185
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.460
my hypothesis was is that the biological weapon,

186
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.150
they were trying to cover up that, oh, my hypothesis is,

187
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:58.080
that was the biological weapon. They were trying to cover up, said newbie,

188
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.890
a science writer at the Stanford school of medicine in California.

189
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.510
<v 0>I don't believe it. Hmm. It seems like a lot of malarkey.</v>

190
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.480
<v 1>She said I can't connect the dots right now.</v>

191
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.430
So it's going to be who survived Lyme disease.

192
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.520
My theory is that it was a genetically engineered.

193
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.130
Rick kept see a bacteria, but as a journalist, I can't prove that.

194
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:22.020
So when she's saying, then she says.

195
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.320
<v 0>Pulling stuff out, she wrote a book. She wrote a book. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.940
I ain't buying it, but that's not to say that does worry me more than anything.

197
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.880
I think she's a Hoser. I don't know her personally,

198
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:36.480
but if you had to guess probably, but I think that, uh, it's your bread.

199
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.610
Yeah. I would never give her my bread. Uh,

200
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.960
that scares me more than anything though. Plague plague of some sort.

201
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.850
I always feel like we should be, uh, keeping some medicine in the house.

202
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.290
Plagued medicine.

203
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:52.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.670
<v 0>Like walk on. I don't know. Tetra recycling, duct. Good for plague.</v>

205
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.013
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

206
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.860
<v 0>What the, you gotta take something.</v>

207
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:02.550
<v 1>What the hell.</v>

208
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.730
<v 0>Could be good for? Plates depends what the plague is. Really. If it's a flu,</v>

209
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.960
there's certain things you can take. If it's nice. It's crazy.

210
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.030
War bugs. Probably nothing,

211
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.160
but there's so many people and it's so gross and you could see how people just

212
00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:21.720
coughing in the airports without covering their mouths. That's going to happen.
