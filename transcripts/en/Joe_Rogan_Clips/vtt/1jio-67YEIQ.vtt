WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>You don't get the vibrance. Yeah. Yeah. That when the ocean looks like a,</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.600
a dull, gray, even the ocean looks tired, like, Ooh.

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.000
Right. As opposed to like, if you go to, uh, Mexico, like, uh,

4
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.520
I went to Cancun way back in the day. And the first thing I noticed, like,

5
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.150
how the is the ocean that hour? Like, look how pretty it is. Yeah.

6
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.390
It's like a bluish green. It's gorgeous.

7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.510
<v 1>Yeah. Have you ever been to French Riviera? No. Oh my God.</v>

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.710
One time went and yeah,

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.310
same thing they have with pebble beaches instead of sand. Uh, which is horrible,

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.780
but &lt;laugh&gt; but the water so beautiful.

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.780
Yeah. It's crazy.

12
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.300
<v 0>Yeah. I grew up, um, in that town,</v>

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.740
which was next to the Charles river and that Charles river went all the way

14
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:55.140
through Boston and the, the Charles river was like, disgusting, man. Like you'd,

15
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.500
you'd see condoms floating in it. And you'd see,

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.740
I saw one pipe and these bubbles were coming up to the surface. I was like,

17
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:04.210
what the is that? And then I saw a condom bubble up and I went, oh my God,

18
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:05.130
it's a sewer pipe.

19
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.810
And I realized someone was just flushing their and right into the river.

20
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.050
I was like, how did this happen? And I was, you know, 14. And I'm like,

21
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:18.610
what the is this? Like, how the, how am I finding this? Like,

22
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:23.480
you don't have anybody like checking to see if the pipe is pumping right into

23
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:26.000
the river. Like, oh my God, it was crazy.

24
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.680
So it wasn't clean by any stretch of the imagination. So to see that kind of,

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.760
uh, clean, pure, like ocean water, where like you ever, uh,

26
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.200
you ever heard of bone fishing, do you know what that is? Mm-hmm,

27
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.160
it's a type of fishing that people do.

28
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:43.270
It's I think they mostly just catch and release 'em I don't think they even keep

29
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.790
most of them, but they go to Florida and the, I think The Bahamas,

30
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.590
I wanna say The Bahamas and, uh,

31
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:54.350
they on these like special boats that are like, uh, these, uh,

32
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.310
boats you can stand on and they're fly fishing for this fish that looks like

33
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.110
it belongs in the stone age. This weird,

34
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.300
cool looking fish called the bonefish see if you could pull up a picture of it.

35
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.300
I don't know why we're talking about this. That's how high I am.

36
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.540
&lt;laugh&gt; but that's.

37
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.300
<v 1>What they look. Oh, it's.</v>

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.140
<v 0>Cool. Is that a bone fish?</v>

39
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.380
It says it's more like a Barracuda. That's a bone fish.

40
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.820
See, that's a bone fish. That other one was a Barracuda.

41
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.300
I think they just had a bad, uh, photo.

42
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.530
You see the differe it's it's a crazy looking Fishman and see that water behind

43
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:28.970
them. It's hard to tell from this image,

44
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:31.850
but what we're looking is really shallow water. Like at the most,

45
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.290
it's like three feet deep. Right.

46
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.850
And they're just casting out and they see these fish coming towards them and

47
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.050
they catch it. It's supposed to be like super, super exciting.

48
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.250
You do a lot of fishing. I don't do a lot of fishing, but I love fishing.

49
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.080
It's fun. But this is fun. Like, I,

50
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.680
I would assume I haven't done this kind of fishing bone fishing,

51
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.360
but that's what people, people love,

52
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.120
like seeing a fish coming and going and biting your lure.

53
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.720
Like it's very exciting. Yeah. It sounds exciting.

54
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.000
But look how clear that water is? No, there's no condoms. There's no condoms.

55
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.200
Just bone Fest.

56
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.520
I was watching a video today of a guy jumping with scuba gear on,

57
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840
into the garbage patch. It's the middle of the Pacific ocean. You know,

58
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.840
I had knew, I knew that it was supposed to be like horrific, but once you,

59
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:15.840
when you see it in a video, you watch and just go,

60
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.280
what the is this?

61
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.350
This guy put scuba gear on and jumped into this. I mean, it was plastic.

62
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.790
You couldn't see anything, but plastic everywhere.

63
00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:28.950
You looked to the left and the right. It was all plastic. Like, this is huge.

64
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.470
Like, like several states, large. Yeah. This,

65
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.140
this is what humans are doing to the ocean. This is, this is, uh,

66
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.140
would you see him jump in? And it's almost, did they show him jump in?

67
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.860
Or is this a different video? This a different video?

68
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.980
Probably a different video, but yeah, this is a different video.

69
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.020
Cause the other one, the guy starts out on the boat and, and dives in.

70
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.900
And what he dives into is just like plastic soup. It's disgusting,

71
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.290
man. It's crazy. Yeah. Like this &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

72
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.570
so there's this guy that we had on the podcast name is Boyn slot and he created

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.090
a device that he's using to try to, uh,

74
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:14.170
pull the plastic out of the ocean. And they'll maybe convert that plastic into,

75
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.130
you know, things that we can use. And, um, there,

76
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.800
I don't think it worked on first attempt, but they're, they're relaunching it.

77
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:25.800
Right. Didn't need, they had to do something to fix things they're, you know,

78
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:27.600
still in like sort of the prototype stage,

79
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.240
but it's gonna have these machines or just giant nets that move around through

80
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:34.800
the ocean and catch all this plastic. It, yeah. Just I,

81
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:38.160
how to stop it from getting fish. That's a very good question.

82
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.030
I don't think there's any fish living in there. Um, I bet a lot of fish, um,

83
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.710
have eaten that stuff though. Guaranteed.

84
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:48.270
There's probably a lot of fish with plastic in their stomachs. Oh,

85
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.590
a hundred percent. Yeah, man. That's gross. I mean, what,

86
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.790
what kind of gets in their system? And then when you eat that fish,

87
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.950
what kinda are you getting in your system?

88
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.860
Like how many people were testing their fish? &lt;laugh&gt; you know, I mean,

89
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:04.620
how many people are, uh, before they eat a salmon, they're like, hold on,

90
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.180
let me check for mercury. Let see how much arsenics in this.

91
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.140
See kind of heavy metal port.

92
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.860
What sets up BPS that they're worried about that come from?

93
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.060
What is the stuff they're worried about?

94
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:18.860
That comes from bottles when it get yeah. BPAs or something like that.

95
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:22.650
That sounds right. Yeah. I wish I knew what that meant. The, I guess they did.

96
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.170
There's a video out their first results from November.

97
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.610
I don't know what he's saying. Oh, so this is their first, uh,

98
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.250
their first actual pulling of the garbage, you know,

99
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:38.530
listen, man. Even if it takes 10 years, if, if they could figure out a way to,

100
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.360
to get rid of all that plastic and we could figure out a way to not put that

101
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:43.194
plastic in the ocean,

102
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.080
we can maybe what I really worry about almost as much as this,

103
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.160
maybe even more is overfishing.

104
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.640
When you realize how many different ships are out there, mm-hmm,

105
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.200
&lt;affirmative&gt; using giant nets and just scooping everything.

106
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.680
They catch inside that net mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then just serving it to us.

107
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.040
And we were like, oh, you wanna get sushi? Yeah. Sushi sounds good. You know,

108
00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:09.280
we're like, so cool. Sushi sounds good. It's ocean genocide. I mean,

109
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:13.600
it's chaotic, man. They don't have real. I mean, they don't have real control.

110
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.080
It's international waters.

111
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.750
People are just cutting nets and dropping 'em to the bottom of the ocean and

112
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:21.590
they catching things all the time. There's nets all over the place out there.

113
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.670
People just release their nets. They just litter.

114
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.511
<v 1>Like you're always,</v>

115
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:29.990
you've been very conscious about like what you eat and what like sustainability

116
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.560
a lot lately.

117
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.510
<v 0>Right? Well, I think sustainability. Yeah. I do think about that a lot. Um,</v>

118
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.110
I don't know if I'm that conscious of it.

119
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.940
I'm definitely guilty of not being sometimes mean I'm hungry. I'm.

120
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.820
<v 1>Extremely unconscious about it. I wish I was more conscious about it.</v>

121
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:45.380
Cause I'm one put in my faith. It makes me all sad.

122
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.100
<v 0>Yeah. I'm more conscious about what I eat than I am, uh,</v>

123
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.900
sustainability in terms of like what the quality of what I eat.

124
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.140
I'm more conscious about that. I should be more conscious about sustainability,

125
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:58.290
but sometimes it feels like, um, what does this, what he showing me here?

126
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.330
Is that a crocodile? God. No. What is that says a big,

127
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.690
big catch with an exclamation. Mark is the name of this.

128
00:07:03.691 --> 00:07:08.490
Vehicle's got 40 million views on YouTube. It's a net that's full of stuff.

129
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.570
Oh, they caught a net. Oh this is oh a net. This is a fishing boat. Yeah. Yeah.

130
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.570
Oh Jesus. Yeah. Look at that. Look how it works. They just scoop up every thing.

131
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.120
That's in that ocean.

132
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.480
It's really amazing that they fit. I mean, what a horrific place to be.

133
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.333
If you're a fish,

134
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.160
imagine if fish were like super smart &lt;laugh&gt; and this

135
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:32.640
is their demise. I mean,

136
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:36.880
this is an insane net filled with living creatures that we're going to eat.

137
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.550
Not it's just tilapia, relax. God, you're getting so dramatic.

138
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.830
&lt;laugh&gt; look at that. It's a crazy bundle

139
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.110
of these ocean creatures. And how often does this happen? A day? Is it all day?

140
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.550
I bet it is. I bet. This is all day. I bet.

141
00:07:56.551 --> 00:08:01.380
This is all day for years and years and years and years.

142
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.140
And I don't think they take time off. I think they keep going.

143
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.900
And if they're not there, someone else is there too. I think this is happening.

144
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.780
As long as they can make money, uh, selling fish and we're willing to buy fish.

145
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.180
It's kind of insane. You.

146
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.820
<v 1>Think people ever feel bad about it? Those people feel bad. Maybe.</v>

147
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.770
<v 0>It's possible. They're not monsters. Right? If they, they might develop a.</v>

148
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.770
<v 1>Well, that guy just stepped right on a fish though. Yeah. They.</v>

149
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.370
<v 0>Get desensitized. I'm sure, man.</v>

150
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.410
<v 1>You know, he doesn't feel like he cared.</v>

151
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.050
<v 0>At all. Well, this is crazy. I mean, this is not a,</v>

152
00:08:31.051 --> 00:08:34.290
person's supposed to be able to catch a fish or a two fish or three fish and

153
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:37.650
then you eat it. &lt;laugh&gt; like, this is chaos, man.

154
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.970
This is some crazy thing where you have,

155
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.280
have to make filet of fish sandwiches because there's, you know,

156
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.000
320 million people and a hundred of them,

157
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.320
a hundred million of 'em want junk food anytime they want it. I mean,

158
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.840
I don't know if that went to filet of fish or if that's, uh, expensive fish.

159
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.840
I really have no idea. I'm just talking. Don't listen to me. But,

160
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.320
and I also eat fish, so I'm a hypo. Great. Yeah.

161
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.920
But it is kind of crazy when you watch this video and I'm not a, you know,

162
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.880
I, uh, I'm not opposed to you eating fish,

163
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.400
but I'm just saying the reality of what this is is, is crazy.

164
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.640
This is a crazy scene and to not deny, it's a crazy scene,

165
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.790
I'm still gonna eat fish. You know, I feel, I feel awful about this.

166
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.430
<v 1>It does slightly make me want sushi.</v>

167
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.390
<v 2>I looking at this it's crazy when I was a server, like a big question question,</v>

168
00:09:25.391 --> 00:09:28.710
people would always ask, is it farm raised or is it wild caught? Yeah. And like,

169
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.750
this is wild caught versus farm raised.

170
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:33.230
I don't know why it would make a giant difference. It seems.

171
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.180
<v 0>Like bad either way. Yeah. It's hell no matter what for these organisms,</v>

172
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.980
but they're delicious and they're really good for you.

173
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.060
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; but the how,

174
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.100
how are they gonna ensure that there's gonna be some left? That's what's crazy.

175
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.340
Like the, the human governments need to get together and go, Hey,

176
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.700
we can't kill the whole ocean. Cuz that is possible.

177
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.690
If you keep going at the pay that it's going now,

178
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.890
if you really stop and think about what the ocean must have been,

179
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:03.010
like when you hear about those, uh, Japanese, tuna, fishermen, like, uh,

180
00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:05.090
did you see J dreams of sushi?

181
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:07.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; remember when those gentlemen were at the fish market and

182
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:10.490
they were talking about what it used to be like used to be tuna everywhere,

183
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.850
so much tuna and now like a small amount and you gotta check to see if it's

184
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:16.520
good. Like they're watching it happening and old time,

185
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.800
if you go from that point where that guy was talking about to today and then go

186
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.160
50 years from now at the same pace, like.

187
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.600
<v 1>Yeah, no, you gotta be.</v>

188
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.560
But it seems like that it wouldn't be that hard to be more conscious about it.

189
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.550
<v 0>Well it, the very least they have to take into consider the fact that, uh,</v>

190
00:10:37.551 --> 00:10:41.870
they need to maybe develop some sort of an international program to breed these

191
00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:45.950
things. Yeah. You know, to, to, to like they they've done that with yellow tail.

192
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.590
They have these like, uh,

193
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.790
ocean sort of almost like a like corralled in area and they're out in the

194
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:57.620
ocean, but they're only in this one trapped area and they're feeding 'em and

195
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.660
occasionally they'd get out. Like they get those yellow tails in Hawaii.

196
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.140
There was a storm and the storm wrecked their little enclosure and they got out

197
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:08.740
now they're everywhere. So all these hamachi grade like sushi grade,

198
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.580
yellow tails are swimming around all over the place outta Hawaii's my favorites.

199
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.140
And they're breeding. They're getting bigger. Yeah. It's, it's crazy.

200
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.170
It's interesting. But, but I was thinking when they were telling me that well,

201
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:19.650
so if that's what they did,

202
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.890
like maybe they should do that and just keep releasing them.

203
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.010
Maybe it should be a program that all the people who buy sushi fund into

204
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.450
that just takes a little piece of the sushi money and uses it to develop

205
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.490
these programs, to make sure that these fish keep breeding.

206
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.850
So you can have more sushi.

207
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.960
<v 1>I think people have pay extra for that. Right. Then they would,</v>

208
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.720
then they would feel good. They yeah. Feel a.

209
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.280
<v 0>Little better than me. You helping out. Yeah.</v>

210
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.200
That's what I think we can leave this next. Next, next, next generation.

211
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.080
Have a real good possibility of like making things work out better.
