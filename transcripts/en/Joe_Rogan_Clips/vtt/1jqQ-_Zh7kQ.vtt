00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Gravity. This is one thing.</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.570
<v 1>That I was hooked on gravity. Yes.</v>

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.370
<v 0>I'm always hooked up on gravity. Um, because, uh, as you should be, well,</v>

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.100
since we've talked last, I've been reading a lot about it.

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.710
And one of the things that confuses me the most is that we don't really

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.850
understand what gravity is, but we know it's a facts.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.240
We can measure them. We know how to measure them.

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.540
We know what that mass is involved,

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.420
but we don't really know what gravity is.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.980
<v 1>There's a similar question in the book,</v>

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.860
but they got a little more philosophical than you just did,

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.140
but they both lean philosophical.

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.070
It's science can describe how gravity works,

14
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.590
but can they describe why it works? So this is the how,

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.990
why duality here and allow me to just answer it from a, how,

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
why point of view. And then we can apply it to gravity. After I say that, um,

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.960
in science,

18
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.530
if we can describe how something works and predict its future behavior,

19
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.870
we claim to understand it. And we move on.

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.760
You can ask deeper question about why is there gravity and what is the meaning?

21
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.560
What is the purpose? And go ahead. But I'm good with what I've done.

22
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:18.210
And I can land a spacecraft on Mars inside of a crater,

23
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.260
in a hole in one using my understanding of gravity. So I'm pretty good with it.

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.453
Okay.

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.620
So I'm not distracted by the more philosophical side of that.

26
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.300
Why does it work? Okay. Einstein.

27
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.430
So Newton was deeply puzzled by how you can have something called and which he

28
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.130
coined the phrase action at a distance. Okay.

29
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.650
He wrote down the equation that worked. He walked any equation.

30
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.540
Moon goes around the earth, earth grows on the sun,

31
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.260
the moons of Jupiter go around Jupiter. He

32
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.070
accurately described that with his equations of gravity. Okay. He said,

33
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.180
one day,

34
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.760
I think we're going to find some way that they're connecting to each other,

35
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:05.700
but I don't know what that is right now, but I know my equations work.

36
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.510
He called it spooky. It was spooky to him. That's his word?

37
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.160
Spooky action at a distance. All right. Fast forward,

38
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.190
300 years, 300,

39
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.400
no fast forward two hundred and fifty two hundred thirty years.

40
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.850
Get to Albert Einstein. Um,

41
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.080
gravity is the curvature of space and time.

42
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.140
And you're moving on the curvature of that fabric. That's gravity.

43
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.750
Oh my gosh. Is it even a forge then?

44
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.010
Is it even so there's no need to think of it as an action at a distance

45
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.100
and in a phrase, um, first uttered by I think it was John Archibald Wheeler,

46
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.920
a student of Einstein. And he,

47
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.520
I learned relativity from John Archer boat effect.

48
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:57.900
That's where I met my wife in relativity class in graduate school. Um,

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.210
it's space matter.

50
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.410
Tell space how to curve space tells matter how to move.

51
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.890
It moves on the curvature of space. You don't need an action at a distance.

52
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.850
There is no action. It knows it can't do anything else, but do that.

53
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.790
It's like you have a funnel and you take a ball and you roll it on the funnel.

54
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.040
The ball can only do what that funnel tells it to do.

55
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.420
And it'll serve. If you give it a sideways motion, it'll start spinning around.

56
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.030
There's no magic hand coming in there.

57
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.370
It is following the curvature of its space, time continuum.

58
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.880
This construct that you provided for it.

59
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.980
So now I can describe what gravity is doing.

60
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.050
I even have a mechanism for it. Are you going to still ask me?

61
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.590
Why is there gravity? Is that answered?

62
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:02.920
Not fulfilling enough to you? Even in the why department,

63
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.630
you can say, well, why would a particle curve space?

64
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.510
You can just keep doing that. That's fine.

65
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.330
But is there a point weirdly where you'll be satisfied with the answer? Oh,

66
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:20.500
that answers my, why I can say, well,

67
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.480
why did this half liter of water drop off the

68
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:29.380
edge here while it's no longer the forces are imbalanced? And it's a no,

69
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.590
but why did it fall? Well, there's nothing holding it up. Why did it?

70
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.290
There's a point where it's not especially productive to continue to think about

71
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.950
the world that way, because I, what I'm,

72
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.220
what I'm claiming is answers to the how,

73
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.640
when you understand the, how enough

74
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.270
are tantamount to having answered the why question, that's all,

75
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.890
that's what I'm telling you about in terms.

76
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.530
<v 0>Of the ability to measure it and accurately use it.</v>

77
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.030
<v 1>Correct. So we can say, okay, you got a Barrhead. We can say, well,</v>

78
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:08.500
why did you go bald? Well, okay. The hair follicles at,

79
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.110
when you start in your late twenties and early, when did you go bald?

80
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.420
When do you start losing your hair? Probably late twenties. Early thirties.

81
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.560
Yeah. That's that's common. If you, if you have your hair, when you're 30,

82
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.560
you'll probably have it for the rest of your life. That's how that goes.

83
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.640
You start losing it up, right. Going up until you're 30. So you can say, well,

84
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:28.000
the hair follicle begins does not produce any of the keratin or whatever.

85
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.340
We get the explanation. Then you say, well,

86
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.420
why does the hair follicles stop doing that? Then you say, oh, well,

87
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:39.340
because the DNA has a pre-coded about the hair, kind of the liver.

88
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.720
Well, why does the DNA have the hair? Well, because so.

89
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.111
<v 0>Right.</v>

90
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:49.030
But we know far more about how and why people go bald than we

91
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.560
do about what gravity really is.

92
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.180
<v 1>Yes. Correct. I'm telling you,</v>

93
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:55.660
gravity really is the curvature of space and time.

94
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.790
That gets us the big bang and everything we've ever known.

95
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.720
<v 0>Time, but it's also based on mass, right? It's based on the amount of.</v>

96
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.550
<v 1>Situation of matter and energy and or energy will curve the fabric of space and</v>

97
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:15.290
time and the movement of matter on that

98
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.230
fabric of space and time we call gravity.

99
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.610
And I'm good with that. Okay.

100
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.240
<v 0>But you seem a little oddly defensive about something that scientific.</v>

101
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.360
<v 1>No, I have to say I'm good with, but you, you.</v>

102
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.310
<v 0>You are cause you kind of defending it. No.</v>

103
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.460
<v 1>You can say, well, defend does matter. You need to know why,</v>

104
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.100
Why does it know what I'm saying?

105
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.850
Why does matter and energy curve,

106
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.910
the fabric of space and time you can ask that. Okay. Why? And I,

107
00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:47.720
I don't have an answer for that. I can say, well, that's all I'm asking. Well,

108
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.090
no, but what I'm telling you is, okay,

109
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:52.610
you don't need to know what got you to the point. Right?

110
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.800
We had to walk to that point where your why got

111
00:06:57.801 --> 00:06:59.210
unanswered. I understand that.

112
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.230
<v 0>But before we got.</v>

113
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.100
<v 1>To that point, I answered otherwise.</v>

114
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.960
<v 0>But I'm not disputing.</v>

115
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.950
<v 1>That. Good. Good.</v>

116
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.900
So what I'm telling you is that I can answer your why question most of the time,

117
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.000
but then you'll come back to a point where there's a point where there's the,

118
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.450
Y doesn't have the answer. So you say, why did it fall and say,

119
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.180
there's a force of gravity operating on it. Why didn't fall that way?

120
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:23.120
Because of the curvature of space and time I'm answering your why's.

121
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.800
I understand then why does matter and energy, Kurt space and time.

122
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.760
Okay. That's a frontier. We're still working on that, but that's all I'm asking.

123
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.450
<v 0>That's good. That's fine. You are a man of science. So you,</v>

124
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.150
you are a person that should probably embrace wise.

125
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.430
<v 1>Except many people who ask why questions they're really want to know purpose.</v>

126
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.330
<v 0>Not asking purpose.</v>

127
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.100
<v 1>Well, then that distinguishes you from many other people who ask why questions.</v>

128
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.000
Oh, okay. I.

129
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.020
<v 0>Don't think, I don't know if there's.</v>

130
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.260
<v 1>Gap. Why did you bang the table? I was angry. There's purpose.</v>

131
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.220
There's a purpose behind it. Okay. So, so yeah. So if your,

132
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:03.110
why is just a curiosity of what's going on? That's one thing,

133
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:08.090
if you are inquiring about purpose, then you get to theological. Okay.

134
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:12.050
Because when you're theological, then religions give purpose to life.

135
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.190
<v 0>Clearly I'm not doing that. Right.</v>

136
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.810
But I just think it's amazing that something that's such a massive

137
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:22.370
part of life on this planet that we stayed glued to the

138
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:23.600
ground because of gravity.

139
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.140
<v 1>Can you pull up my Instagram account? That I only posts.</v>

140
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.050
<v 0>The Instagram account now, because you had a fake one for awhile.</v>

141
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.110
I took it online. Actually. I know the guy, I took it over. He gave me.

142
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.980
<v 1>Oh, do the guy who had it? Yeah, no, no, no, no. I actually, I, sorry.</v>

143
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.430
I went to Instagram said, people think this is a real account and it's not,

144
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.100
can I have it back? And if it's an account,

145
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.050
that's an imposter and followers don't know it it's illegal. Right.

146
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.150
So, uh, so there's,

147
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.930
there's one that says fan of Neil Tyson and that's a different one. Okay.

148
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.050
So I only post art house photos. Okay. That I've taken most of which I've taken.

149
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.640
So just scroll down and look for muscle beach. There it is. Click on that.

150
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.450
Okay. So here's my CA go to my caption, go full screen on that.

151
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.600
Remember my Kevin. Okay. For most of our life on earth,

152
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.640
we either resist or succumb to the force of gravity at muscle

153
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:17.580
beach. Gravity loses every time.

154
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.723
<v 0>Of the punch room.</v>

155
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.410
<v 1>I was proud of that. Caption. You go, you call me.</v>

156
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.060
<v 0>Out on that caption that's nonsense.</v>

157
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.060
Gravity never loses gravity. Doesn't even have like little tiny losses.

158
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.830
It's not like there's a war.

159
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.190
<v 1>He loses a battle, was just listening to this. So I was at, I was in Venice,</v>

160
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:41.370
California, and the sun was setting behind some guy who was doing,

161
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.080
who was doing, uh, uh, uh, hand pressed hand presses,

162
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.970
suspended up on his chin up bar. Right. And it was real. So it was cool.

163
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:54.330
He was silhouetted. There's a Palm tree. There's the beach. He's.

164
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.450
<v 0>There. Gravity is going to beat that. Let me tell you eventually.</v>

165
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.440
<v 1>But while he is, while he's there, he's conquering gravity.</v>

166
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.740
Are you getting too old? You haven't conquered gravity lately. No.

167
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.540
<v 0>I work out all the time. I'm not buying it. No, I ain't concrete.</v>

168
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.540
<v 1>Yeah. He's pulling rank now. He said I work out and you don't.</v>

169
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.060
Cause I see your middle-aged man belly.

170
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.620
<v 0>Um, well, when I've talked to other astrophysicists and science.</v>

171
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.050
<v 1>Are these conversations supposed to have like a theme or a purpose or is it just</v>

172
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.510
you sit there and just whatever comes to your head, you send my way.

173
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.690
<v 0>Yeah. Well clearly it's just whatever comes to mind.</v>

174
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.430
<v 1>How do you say this episode is about you? Can't say that I don't ever do that.</v>

175
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:41.310
You don't do that. Okay, fine. That's just episode number two. My.

176
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.020
<v 0>Success is that.</v>

177
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.090
<v 1>You've got no obligation, no commitments.</v>

178
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.910
<v 0>I have a thread. Think about all the different people that,</v>

179
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.250
of course it's like impossible, of course,

180
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.450
fighters and scientists and scholars and crackpots,

181
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.250
a bunch of different people coming through here, man. I can't have any agenda.

182
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.480
I mean, that's probably the only reason why this thing is successful as it is,

183
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.450
but that's a weird one for people that this one thing that is so powerful.

184
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.110
<v 1>What is.</v>

185
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.090
<v 0>Oh gravity. That's a weird one for people.</v>

186
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.040
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it seems like.</v>

187
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.700
<v 0>You're frustrated by all the various questions. I was like, no,</v>

188
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.620
you seem a little, a little defensive there.

189
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.060
<v 1>I thought you were taking your why to ultimately mean purpose.</v>

190
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.040
If it's just why I'm claiming that many responses to

191
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:33.330
how are also responses to a Y that that's,

192
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.830
that's the point I'm making. And I don't like splitting definitions.

193
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.870
<v 0>We'll ultimately understand gravity.</v>

194
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.380
<v 1>I think we do. That's why we can land things on Mars. We understand what we do,</v>

195
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:47.790
which is why your cell phone gets time from GPS

196
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:52.530
satellites that is pre corrected for Einstein's general theory of relativity.

197
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.630
Cause you're in a different gravitational field than you in orbit.

198
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.430
Then you are on earth surface. We got this angry.
