00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 1>Inflammation is a, the big difference is when I eat a lot of carbs,</v>

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.010
if I go off the rails and I'll cheat and have pasta or bread or something like

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:15.210
that, I experienced more inflammation. I experienced more soreness in my joints.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.410
I've um, you get more fatigue, you get tired,

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:24.240
you get that insulin crash. You get all those big factors that I don't.

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100
I just don't get. When I eat clean,

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.050
when I eat just meat and salad and vegetables and high

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.340
fat diet and low carb, my body is just way more efficient and just, it,

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.480
it feels better.

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.380
And the big thing that I keep trying to stress to people is you don't need a nap

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.070
that afternoon nap, which I just thought is something you need.

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.780
All that is is just your body recovering from lunch, from carbs. Yeah. Your,

14
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.220
your carbs at lunch. If you don't have that, the day is much more efficient.

15
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.220
I get more done. I have more energy, you know, it's like when people say,

16
00:00:56.221 --> 00:01:00.390
how do you do like all these podcasts, two podcasts a day? Like, no, I eat good,

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.610
eat good. And it's not hard. It's not hard.

18
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.370
Your brain is functioning all day long. But man,

19
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:09.960
if I stopped at noon and had a pizza and then tried to do a

20
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.230
podcast, I'd be here like going, oh, is this done yet? I need to sleep.

21
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.560
You just get tired. Yeah.

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.430
<v 0>You get exhausted. We've been doing this diet since the mid nineties,</v>

23
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.240
since like 1993. I think it was around the time we kind of started.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.460
We've been doing them on and off for a long time.

25
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:28.200
And more recently I used it to drop 70 pounds. But I think one of the,

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.700
one of the things with keto that I noticed was it almost doesn't really matter

27
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.330
that, I mean ketosis all the time. I think the effort to be in ketosis,

28
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:37.890
I think is important, uh,

29
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.460
by getting rid of a lot of the carbohydrates that you have the effort to kind of

30
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.840
eat a little bit more fat.

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.650
But what I've noticed is I don't think I need to really go out of my way to eat

32
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:47.700
tons and tons of fat.

33
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:51.810
I don't need to be dumping tons of MCT oil on stuff I don't need to, uh,

34
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.240
or there's enough fat. Usually in the stakes that I'm eating.

35
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.500
A lot of times I'll get ribeye. Um, sometimes I'll eat bacon, eggs,

36
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.170
things like that. I put up on my Instagram the other day,

37
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.360
about seven or eight foods that I thought,

38
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.690
if you just stuck to these seven or eight foods for a handful of days,

39
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:10.230
you would lose a lot of weight. And the response was amazing.

40
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.170
People were writing back and they're like, holy, man, I'd lost 10 pounds.

41
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.170
<v 1>Well, a lot of people do lose weight off of keto. There's no doubt about that.</v>

42
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.380
But even mark Sisson, who was one that got me into it,

43
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.570
mark goes on and off.

44
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.780
And he thinks that there's some benefit to going on and off key. I don't.

45
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.030
<v 0>Think he has to be in ketosis, ketogenic.</v>

46
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.980
<v 1>Diet. Yeah. But even when you go off,</v>

47
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.300
you're not switching your diet to spaghetti. You know, you're not eating,

48
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.390
you know, wonder bread or like that. Like I'd love.

49
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.180
<v 0>It. If you switched up spaghetti, right? That's your thing, pasta. Well.</v>

50
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.070
<v 1>I like it. I like it when I cheat,</v>

51
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.250
but I don't like the effect on my body for sure. I just like the taste of it,

52
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.950
like linguine with clams is one of my favorite things to eat.

53
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.740
But the way I feel afterwards, it's not my favorite.

54
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.250
<v 0>Butter. Why is that so wonderful. Why is that so good.</v>

55
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.460
So good people are out in California. They don't even know.

56
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.900
We always talk about this hard rolls.

57
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.800
Used to go get like a butter roll in the morning.

58
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.180
<v 2>And we grew up in New York. So you should get a buttered roll with butter. Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:07.240
It was the best thing ever. Yeah. And out here they don't have them. Thank God.

60
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.610
I'm actually glad that I'm out here.

61
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 1>Love sour dough, bread with grass fed butter and honey.</v>

62
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.270
<v 2>Oh my God, man. Sourdough sourdough.</v>

63
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.510
<v 1>Is really good. What honey? On top of the butter. Oh Jesus.</v>

64
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.970
<v 2>Oh, with all this ketogenic sounds amazing with all this Cheeto stuff going on.</v>

65
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.950
I've been wondering when somebody is going to make some bread,

66
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.360
like figure it out.

67
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.320
<v 1>It's not that bad. No foods is good. I like their bread.</v>

68
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.820
I make egg sandwiches with their friends.

69
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.420
<v 2>I w I haven't tried that one yet. A lot of good stuff.</v>

70
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.790
I know they just came out. I tried the waffles.

71
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.040
I tried the good that donuts and stuff like that.

72
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.960
But I think a lot of those things for me,

73
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.140
they have way too many carbohydrates for me, you know, way too many.

74
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.420
<v 1>Isn't there something about the type of carbs they have an unusual host.</v>

75
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.610
They don't raise your blood level bludge some level. Yeah. Well, I, you know,

76
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.250
I don't want to eat regular waffles on a regular basis,

77
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:03.730
but if I'm going to cheat and I eat what they have, you know,

78
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:07.630
and they also have a very low sugar syrup too,

79
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.790
that tastes very good with some butter. It's just, it's the best option.

80
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.980
If you're going to do something like that. Exactly.

81
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.900
You should mostly eat real foods.

82
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.790
Like I feel better when I eat meat and vegetables. That's when I've, when I'm,

83
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.330
you know,

84
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.570
I had Jordan Peterson on and he had some pretty serious auto-immune disorders

85
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.520
and his body was really in trouble.

86
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.680
And his daughter had similar problems and his daughter went to essentially a

87
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:34.330
diet of just meat and greens.

88
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.070
And now I think she's on a carnivore diet and she's got a Instagram page to

89
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:39.904
documenting it,

90
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.130
but he went to meat and greens lost a ton of weight. What was losing?

91
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.330
I think he said he was losing, what did he say?

92
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.280
Like seven pounds a month for something like something along those lines lost a

93
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:55.270
ton of weight and looks great. He said, he's thinner than he's been in 25 years.

94
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:57.970
It feels great. All his autoimmune issues were done.

95
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.180
I think a lot of what people are dealing with is inflammation.

96
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.330
That's caused by too much processed carbohydrates,

97
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.400
too much simple refined carbohydrate.

98
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.340
<v 2>Fruits and sugars, and the inflammation leads to disease.</v>

99
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.140
So if you look at what they call the five scourges of health, they are,

100
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.760
uh, obesity, cancer, cognitive decline, heart disease, and diabetes.

101
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.870
Those are all metabolic. Those are all things that we get through food.

102
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.130
And over half the people that are in hospital today right now in the United

103
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.200
States are in there for metabolic issues.

104
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.170
So that's crazy is crazy most so,

105
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.990
more than half of the people that are in the hospital are there because of what

106
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:35.824
they eat.

107
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.521
<v 1>It is crazy.</v>

108
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:40.120
And you see a direct correlation between the amount of refined sugars and

109
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:41.020
carbohydrates,

110
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.730
human beings have adjusted and started eating to the rise in diabetes and heart

111
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:48.400
disease and all these other issues. And you know, the,

112
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:51.850
one of the things we're talking about for the podcast is sorry.

113
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.070
I went running today. For some reason, I can't stop coughing.

114
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.030
People are dealing with a lot of

115
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.980
various health issues,

116
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.540
and they're always trying to pin like one cause of these

117
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.673
health issues.

118
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.690
And one of the real problems is when people develop these ideological answers

119
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.280
like veganism is one of them.

120
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.380
They do not want to think that there's anything healthy about meat and that what

121
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.800
they do is the only way. And this is the way. And like, I'm watching this,

122
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:25.190
there's a thread right now going on on Twitter between some cockamamie vegan

123
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.503
doctors, full of.

124
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.010
And all these people that are citing science and he is getting off and he's

125
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.650
showing his degree and photos of his degree. And they're like, look,

126
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.360
there's real science to the fact that dietary cholesterol is necessary.

127
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.920
It's it's the building blocks for cells. I mean, it literally is. It's the, the,

128
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.950
it's the reason why your body is converting it to,

129
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.310
to all the sex hormones, cholesterol, saturated, fat,

130
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:55.160
your body processes, that it's healthy for your brain.

131
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.170
It's healthy for your heart. All of these things are a fact.

132
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.180
He's not recognizing the fact that their issue is not saturated

133
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:05.510
fat. It's saturated fat in conjunction with all these other things.

134
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.980
And that's a problem with these studies.

135
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.140
Like one of the studies they did recently,

136
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.610
where they showed that people who ate meat more than five times a week were much

137
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:14.870
more likely to have heart disease,

138
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.480
but that's not a good study because they didn't say,

139
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:18.740
what are they eating the meat with?

140
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.270
<v 0>What are you eating the meat?</v>

141
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.970
<v 1>Are you eating it with bread? Are you eating it in a, in a, in a, as a burger?</v>

142
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.300
Are you drinking a soda with it? Right? Like this is not a good study.

143
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.590
A good study would be, have someone, you know, get a large group of people,

144
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.600
put them on a carnivore diet, have a large group of people,

145
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:36.500
put them on a keto diet,

146
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.140
have a large group of people put on a standard American diet,

147
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.670
let them eat burgers and fries and chocolate shakes and sodas. And let's, let's,

148
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.370
let's find out what the it is. Put people on a vegan diet.

149
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.040
I have had tons of friends, including Sam Harris,

150
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.240
who was on a vegan diet and his blood sugar was off the charts. He had to try.

151
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.510
It was trying to figure out how to stay healthy. Like he tried,

152
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.920
he tried it for a long time, but he felt like. And then he went,

153
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.290
switched to fish and he felt like, just doing that too.

154
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:05.330
And then he went back to me now he's healthy.

155
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.990
<v 0>The answer,</v>

156
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.560
the answer always seems to come back to being in the middle of somewhere. Right?

157
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:12.770
Like we veer off so far and we're like, oh man,

158
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:14.960
we got to retos and we got cookies.

159
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:18.380
And we got all this stuff being thrown at us every single day and it's

160
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.900
convenient. And then somebody will say, okay,

161
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.770
you don't know more carbs and you just go the complete opposite route and you

162
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.570
end up with something like a carnivore diet.

163
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:30.080
But I think just if you're just sit there and think about stuff logically,

164
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.750
it would make sense to me that you can overdo it on me.

165
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:34.160
Like I think you can overdo it on just about.

166
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.240
<v 1>On anything. Yeah. I,</v>

167
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:39.140
that's why I lean towards balance and that's why I like vegetables,

168
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.273
but I can't talk.

169
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.330
<v 0>Yeah. I think your balance is probably is probably ideal, but, uh, you know,</v>

170
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:45.440
the balance of the average,

171
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.490
American's not great because I think they think they can just grab and reach for

172
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:50.400
anything. That's their level of.

173
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.140
<v 1>Well, I think the average American is just trying to feed themselves, you know,</v>

174
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.420
they're just trying to they're and they're tired and look,

175
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.430
there's a great Tom Henry Thoreau quote that most men live

176
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:04.020
lives of quiet desperation.

177
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.920
And I think that applies to so many different things. And one of them is work.

178
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.580
Most people are working all day and they're sad and they feel like.

179
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.480
And when you get out of there, you're like Wendy's drive through comma,

180
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.520
baby hit me up with one of them, double cheeseburgers, chocolate shake, please.

181
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.300
They get a little reward and you know, and then they feel even more.

182
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.630
And then they crash and they get up and they do it all over again with a egg

183
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.890
McMuffin and a cup of coffee with three scoops of sugar in it. And this is the,

184
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:34.050
this is the rollercoaster that most people are on. Right.

185
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.150
<v 0>And it all started with them going to bed too late.</v>

186
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.020
Cause they stayed around the around on their phone or watch TV.

187
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.990
I went to bed too late. They woke up later than they wanted.

188
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.600
They're tired because they didn't get the sleep they were supposed to get,

189
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.070
they drank the coffee. Right. And it's just, it's this one thing snowballing.

190
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.430
Yeah.

191
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.470
<v 1>After another now what are you guys doing in this documentary?</v>

192
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:54.210
Like what are you trying to document, or.

193
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.330
<v 2>We're basically just going around interviewing people, uh,</v>

194
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.220
that are sort of in the know, you know,

195
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:01.980
that are writing these books like mark Sisson and Robb Wolf.

196
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.760
Those are some of the people that we interviewed and just asking them, you know,

197
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.170
basic questions about diet and nutrition and sort of seeing what, uh,

198
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.290
where they stand. And then, um, we're we sorta,

199
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.030
we shot about 15 interviews right now and then it's my job to sort of figure out

200
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:21.510
like, well, how does this all correlate together? How, you know? So we,

201
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.220
we don't really have, uh,

202
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.890
I'd say it'd be disingenuous for me to come on and say,

203
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.650
this is exactly what we're going to do because I have no idea what it's going to

204
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:32.040
be. And I think that's the beauty of it when we shot bigger, stronger, faster,

205
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.500
I had no clue how that was going to turn out.

206
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.710
And I think a lot of documentary filmmakers, they go in with like,

207
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.480
here's the point I'm going to prove, right.

208
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:42.630
Let me find all the people and string them along and then figure out how they

209
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:45.630
fit into the puzzle. And if they don't conveniently fit into my puzzle,

210
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:48.810
they're out. And I just, I don't know. I,

211
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.700
I developed a different way of doing it.

212
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:54.050
I just like to try to get as much information as I can and,

213
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.570
and think about it a lot and then put it in a way that makes sense to me. Okay.

214
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.290
<v 1>So you're basically doing the opposite of a lot of these propaganda films.</v>

215
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:04.500
Like this is one of the problems that I know a lot of people that have had heart

216
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:06.150
disease or all these various issues.

217
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.690
They've paid attention to some of these propaganda films.

218
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.600
So there's a couple of vegan ones that are out there right now.

219
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:17.400
What the health that's been widely dismissed by

220
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:18.430
scientists.

221
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.100
<v 2>And I would love to interview him or any of the doctors that are involved in</v>

222
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:26.400
that because you know, why not let them see, let them,

223
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.520
let them speak their mind and let's hear what they have to say,

224
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.900
and then let's talk about it. You know? And, and I think that's,

225
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.530
that's another interesting thing because the other thing I also feel is like the

226
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:42.210
guy that made what the health, uh, I just feel like he has good intentions also.

227
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.050
Yes. Right? I mean, he's not trying to like kill people, kill people.

228
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:49.200
He's trying to help people just like I'm trying to help people.

229
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.710
So he's over here going like this guy is trying to help people eat and meet.

230
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.620
He's crazy. The problem is I'm not doing that to him.

231
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.320
I think like there is a lot of benefits to a vegan diet.

232
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.270
There are a lot of people that could benefit from it.

233
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.610
Can everybody benefit from it? I don't know.

234
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:07.360
There's a lot of things missing also. So I, I definitely question it,

235
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.640
but I don't all over it.

236
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:12.100
I don't think that's the way to help people that way to help people as a,

237
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:13.840
sort of bring them together and figure.

238
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.350
<v 1>I think it's very rare that people do it right. And I think if you do it right,</v>

239
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:22.270
and you have, uh, you know, some sort of B12 supplements, whether it is, uh,

240
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.160
you know, from, um, like, uh, greens, like, um, what do they use? Uh,

241
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:28.060
the what's that.

242
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.010
<v 0>Algae, the algae stuff there. Dominic D'Agostino. Yeah.</v>

243
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.720
<v 1>Yeah. There's a lot of that stuff that you can,</v>

244
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.310
you can get your B vitamins from and, and if they're not opposed, I mean, well,

245
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:42.460
some of the simplest organisms on the planet are mollusks, you know,

246
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.460
and I know that people think of them as animal life,

247
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.100
but they're more primitive than plants. I mean, there's,

248
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.610
there's certain clams and mollusks and things like they don't, they don't feel.

249
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.920
They're not suffering. They, they literally don't have the capacity for pain.

250
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.530
And they're one of the more primitive life forms on earth. I mean,

251
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:02.530
we deviated from them 600 million years ago or something like that.

252
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.280
They're barely an animal. We can call them an animal. There are some,

253
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.880
but see what we say is because they move, you know,

254
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:12.040
because the clam closes its mouth.

255
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.410
We've decided that that's a living thing let's move.

256
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.290
<v 2>To. I mean, do you have the plant that eats the rats?</v>

257
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.160
<v 1>That thing's awesome man or Venus Flytraps when the thing is,</v>

258
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.910
plants are far more complex in their ability to communicate and their ability to

259
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.860
even express predation pain and protect themselves through various

260
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:33.070
chemical, uh, means to protect themselves from predation.

261
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.070
They change the way they taste to keep from getting eaten.

262
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.600
And there's been studies also that you just play the sound of a caterpillar

263
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.400
eating leaves next to plants.

264
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.060
They recognize that sound and they change their taste profile,

265
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.193
which is just fine.

266
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.280
<v 2>And those are,</v>

267
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.090
those are chemicals like lectins things like lectins and stuff that, um,

268
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.910
it can be very damaging to people. A lot of people don't know, but if he,

269
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.040
you know, cucumbers and tomatoes and stuff like that,

270
00:13:57.041 --> 00:14:00.820
you're getting a lot of these lectins that a lot of people are,

271
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.230
they have adverse reactions to. So a lot of people will be eating, you know,

272
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.620
a variety of vegetables in our diet and not understand why they still don't feel

273
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:11.920
good. Uh, they need to look into that. They might have a lectin issue, you know.

274
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.600
<v 1>It's, it's entirely possible.</v>

275
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.640
<v 0>So let me start this film, you know, we were gonna call it the war on cars.</v>

276
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.770
That's what we were, that's what we were talking about. And that's,

277
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.160
that's what we've, uh, been talking about for quite a long time.

278
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:26.710
But as we started to go through the movie, we're like, oh,

279
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:27.970
I don't know war on carbs.

280
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:30.820
Like maybe that's going to isolate and that's going to, uh,

281
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.920
pigeonhole the movie into one style.

282
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:35.290
But as we started interviewing more and more people,

283
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.010
we realized that the problem is carbs. It's.

284
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:43.630
<v 2>From a war on refined carbs and vegetable oils and sugars, you know,</v>

285
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:44.464
sugar, which is.

286
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.060
<v 0>When you say cars, we're talking about pizza,</v>

287
00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:49.600
basically an ice cream and all the, all the excess things that people are using.

288
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:50.500
We're not really talking.

289
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.770
<v 1>Spoils, refined.</v>

290
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.310
<v 2>Carbohydrates, refined sugars. And these are all product of the modern world,</v>

291
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.380
modern industrialized world call it Western. They call the, uh,

292
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.921
diseases,

293
00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:05.600
Western diseases because they didn't used to have these diseases

294
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.560
on another level in other countries. And then when we started exporting,

295
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.500
you know, molasses, and we started exporting rice and everything else,

296
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:15.830
we were exporting, um, to these other countries that didn't have it.

297
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.230
They all got sick, they all started getting sick. You know,

298
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:20.360
they all start at their obesity rates, went up,

299
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.580
their diabetes rates went up and that's,

300
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.910
that's just proof right there that if you eat that stuff, you know,

301
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.170
it will have those consequences.

302
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.490
<v 1>Well, one of the, one of the great ways, uh, um, I've seen someone talk about,</v>

303
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.920
I forget who it was, it was discussing this. They were saying, look at humans,

304
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:37.730
teeth, people did not suffer from the type of tooth decay they suffer from now.

305
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.120
What is that from? What's from refined carbohydrates and sugar.

306
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.550
That's what it is. And especially sugary drinks,

307
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.340
like people were constantly drinking soda. I mean,

308
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.290
you are just torturing your teeth.

309
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:50.210
You're just throwing an acid on your teeth all day.

310
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.660
<v 2>Yeah. I can't believe I used to eat all that stuff. When I looked back,</v>

311
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.720
you know, I don't man. I used to eat all that and look forward to it too. Right.

312
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.280
And I, I guess I thought I felt okay, but I really didn't, you know,

313
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.830
like thinking back on it, I'm like, I feel way better now.

314
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:07.310
But back then I thought I was okay. I thought I was doing a good job.
