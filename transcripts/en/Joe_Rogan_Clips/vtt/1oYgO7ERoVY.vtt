00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I mean, it's almost, isn't always,</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.980
doesn't always kind of seem like the most boring,

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.320
possible solution is usually the right one. It's like,

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.430
what's the most boring thing. The most boring thing is nothing's happening,

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.350
but you're imagining the dog is somehow has a telepathic link

6
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.500
to you comes razor, right? Yeah. Arc is the simplest,

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:30.090
but it's also the most boring, like, you know, these crazy UFO's,

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm sorry if you've talked about this, a bunch in the podcast,

9
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:35.160
but the UFO's that we're seeing that the, you know,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.960
Navy is releasing these videos of these tic Tacs zipping around and it's Navy

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.590
pilots. It's not the people we interviewed in that show.

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.690
It's Navy pilots who are like, yeah, I don't know what the this is. And I was,

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.380
I have great conversations with Uber drivers and like we were talking about it.

14
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.800
And this guy was like, in a lot of them are programmers and.

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.230
And this guy was like, it's probably a technique.

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820
It's a glitch in the type of radar they're using. I think it must be at glitch.

17
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:05.760
I mean, that's the most likely reality.

18
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.670
They're not seeing it with their own eyes. I don't think so.

19
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.520
I think they're just picking it up on radar. And so he's like,

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.650
maybe it's a glitch or maybe it's like.

21
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.200
<v 1>We should find that out. Can you Google? Um,</v>

22
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.290
if the pilots were picking it up on radar,

23
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.050
the pilot spotted UFO to see if they've,

24
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.180
because I know some guys have spotted things with their own

25
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.060
eyes. I know, I know for sure. Some guys have.

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.820
<v 0>Um, I just, I'm not sure if that data is probably.</v>

27
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.620
<v 1>Relevant to the conversation though.</v>

28
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.380
It's probably a good thing that we know people listening, going. Yo, what the?

29
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.660
Um, I get super skeptical. Yeah. I feel like,

30
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.250
I feel like almost like it's a plot. I don't want to go full Eddie Bravo,

31
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.970
but I feel like when I see people talking about UFO's, I'm like, okay,

32
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.070
what else is going on? What are you distracting me from?

33
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.480
Is this really a big issue? I was like, is it really happening? Well,

34
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.280
can I see it? What do you got? Got nothing. Oh, you got like some radar.

35
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.480
You got radar from one, two pilots, three pilots. Okay. I believe it.

36
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.900
But I want to see more. Why do I want to see more? Like, what am I?

37
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.110
And you'll get caught up in it and it'll chew up hours of your day.

38
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.110
There's a lot of those guys that we ran into on that show.

39
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.030
I felt bad for them because they didn't understand what had happened to them.

40
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.770
They'd gotten caught in this weird loop of looking for

41
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:30.330
secrets and looking for mysteries to be solved and looking for

42
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.200
hidden conspiracies. And they get caught in that.

43
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.910
And some of that is real, which is part of the problem. Some of it,

44
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:42.900
you can come across the Gulf of Tonkin in the north woods, operation Northwest.

45
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.560
You can come across a bunch of them that are real and raw and you can see how

46
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.180
they put that together. You're like what?

47
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.290
You could see real crazy conspiring.

48
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.450
And then you can get lost and think it's okay.

49
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.470
<v 0>Everywhere. That's right. Yeah. Well, I mean, this is like, dude, I was just,</v>

50
00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.560
is.

51
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 1>This Jamie? Oh, according today, the AA vs.</v>

52
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.130
What does that mean? Is that the new you? How about you say UFO, you firms.

53
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.440
<v 0>Are we really going to change UFO?</v>

54
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.520
<v 1>They have their, like, they have their own little thing. They were AAVs.</v>

55
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.310
We don't refer to us as UFO's isn't my pronouns

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.370
Davies appeared at an altitude greater than 80,000 feet,

57
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.240
far higher than commercial or military jets. Typically five fly.

58
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.710
Initially the print Princeton's radar team. It's a radar,

59
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.260
really high price. Our print story is what it's called.

60
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.220
It's like a really high processing radar system. Why is it spelled prince ton?

61
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.020
Oh, it's prince story. Oh, I'll pause there for you in a weird spot. Oh, okay.

62
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.010
Um,

63
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.030
the radar team didn't believe what they were seeing chalking up the anomalies to

64
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.590
an equipment malfunction,

65
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.100
but after they determined that everything was operating as it should,

66
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.460
they began detecting instances, which the AAVs.

67
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.080
I want to know what the that means dropped with astounding speed to lower

68
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:06.730
busier airspace day approached the Princeton's commander about taking

69
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:08.800
action. He said I was chomping at the bit.

70
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.650
I really wanted to intercept these things. What? Yeah.

71
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.400
That's why we have the craziest people in this country. Like there's a,

72
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.430
there's an alien man. I want to chase it. I want to catch that.

73
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.823
<v 0>By the tail.</v>

74
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.050
<v 1>Anomalous aerial vehicles. [inaudible].</v>

75
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.930
<v 0>You ever invented that new name as an?</v>

76
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.410
<v 1>Oh, so actually the one who decided to call them AAV, come on. You know,</v>

77
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:38.530
technically it's not an unidentified flying object to.

78
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.340
<v 0>You're not taking our UFO's man. I'm I'm going to fight that.</v>

79
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.480
<v 1>What is it again? What is the exact phrase? Anomalous aerial vehicle anomalous,</v>

80
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.160
aerial vehicles and SAV. You're an. It's an anomaly.

81
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.780
<v 0>I proposed a new name for UFO's anonymous. Ariel.</v>

82
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.820
<v 1>Yeah, probably a part of a billion dollar study to two fighters were diverted to</v>

83
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.090
intercept. One of the strange objects. When they first arrived on the scene,

84
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:06.010
the pilots didn't see any flying objects,

85
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:08.680
but they did observe what the lead pilot commander,

86
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:13.090
David Fravor later referred to as a disturbance in the ocean. Oh,

87
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.620
the water was churning with white waves breaking over

88
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.670
what looked like a large object, just under the surface.

89
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.020
Then they noticed one of the objects flying about 50 feet above the water

90
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.250
Fravor, the commander of the elite black ACEs squadron,

91
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:34.180
this a Nicholas cage movie who was a top gun program graduate with

92
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:38.380
more than 16 years of flying experience described it as about 40 feet long

93
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.730
shaped like a tic-tac candy with no obvious means of propulsion.

94
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.800
It's white. It has no wings. It has no rotors. I go, holy.

95
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.233
What is that?

96
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.530
<v 0>You know, the guy, whoever the company is that makes tic Tacs. And they're like,</v>

97
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.920
tic-tacs, it's free.

98
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 1>Totally protect tax is the one sponsoring this whole deal. You think it is?</v>

99
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.410
I mean, people are buying tic-tacs right now. Listen to this.

100
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.610
You just say ticktack enough. Like you remember those old subliminal things.

101
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.700
He's doing movie theaters. When you're watching a movie, it would say hungry.

102
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:14.660
He popcorn, like every like 5100th frame,

103
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.570
they would stick like a hungry eat popcorn.

104
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.430
They would like put subliminal texts on the screen. But, I want some popcorn.

105
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.480
If you just say tic-tacs tic-tacs people are buying tic Tacs right now.

106
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.330
<v 0>Yeah. Well we do know that pilot's got great breath, right?</v>

107
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.320
That's a tic-tac man. It's like the first time you see a UFO,

108
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.190
the first thing that pops into your head is it looks like a mint. That's nuts.

109
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.020
There had to be other ways to describe.

110
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.750
<v 1>It. That stocking tic-tacs bro. For sure.</v>

111
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.420
<v 0>I Googled tic-tac after he said that to her,</v>

112
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.480
because I couldn't remember if they were square or if they were like take,

113
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.583
you know, the.

114
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.380
<v 1>They learn to expect a good photo. O'clock.</v>

115
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.363
<v 0>Yeah, yeah.</v>

116
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.730
<v 1>You know, boring. Yeah. Like super apple, like,</v>

117
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.440
like if apple made a UFO.

118
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.070
<v 0>It's like a pretty bleak, pretty sleek,</v>

119
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.380
but going into the ocean part,

120
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.580
that's the part I liked the best because that kind of lines up with hollow worth

121
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:12.080
theory and that, and like maybe like they're flying down. Yeah. In the,

122
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:13.100
in the center of the earth.

123
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.450
<v 1>Why would you have a base in the ocean? We never go there. Do you ever fly over?</v>

124
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.450
I was just no. Why you fly over five hours of water?

125
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.960
<v 0>Just water or yeah. Well, that's that Strava app thing.</v>

126
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:26.720
I feel like we've talked about literally everything, you know, the Strava app.

127
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.990
Okay, good. It's great, man. I love it.

128
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.260
I have to think if pretty sure we've talked about this, the heat maps,

129
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:34.420
the Strava heat maps.

130
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.660
It seemed to show people walking under the ocean and stuff. Walking. Yeah,

131
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.280
we haven't. No. So yeah. Cause like Strava, you know, it's like, um,

132
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.910
I think it was Strava, right? It was like a way for you to track your steps.

133
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.230
And some people apparently were in some spaces in the Arctic or in the ocean

134
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.600
walking around and it showed up before they could like turn that function

135
00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:00.530
off for top secret facilities. Like the places they blur out on Google maps.

136
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.890
<v 1>So do you think there's like a military base under the water somewhere with</v>

137
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:05.030
submarines go.

138
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.770
<v 0>Ah, man, you know, I want to think that, but I'm always a movie. The Meg. Yeah.</v>

139
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.780
I think it's probably a technical error, but maybe. I mean, I don't know.

140
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.700
It's like the implication of these take tax and all of

141
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:21.980
it. If you really want to like the first to me,

142
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:26.750
the most obvious one minus the churning water evidence is that it's some kind

143
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:28.130
of equipment malfunction.

144
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.870
<v 1>What's also that they have an unlimited budget for black ops.</v>

145
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.160
We don't know what that number is. We don't get to know right.

146
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.150
All that weird they do. And they're making stealth bombers and all that area,

147
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.510
51 stuff like how much money goes to that?

148
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.000
Like what is the number let's Google this?

149
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.170
How much does the us spend on black ops?

150
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.920
I had, I was going to bring this up in the middle of where you guys are talking.

151
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.440
Uh.

152
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.270
<v 2>There's a program here that was going on the eight,</v>

153
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.010
eight tip advanced aerospace threat identification program was going on and

154
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:05.844
had.

155
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.800
<v 1>Um, you out of your money. But I'm just going to use the AA tip.</v>

156
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.850
