<v 1>They decide what sport you compete in? Like how did you choose wrestling?</v>

34
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:05.380
Was that just something that you loved or was it, did you like other sports?

35
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580
Like how did you choose to focus on wrestling.

36
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.333
<v 2>Que.</v>

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.380
<v 3>No. Yo in the beginning, I want to make it boxing, boxing,</v>

38
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.300
boxing. My daddy, uh, you know, for the family, for my dad, uh, uh,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.251
I don't like it.

42
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:37.650
You make it probably boxing because boxing is too much punching in the face-hmm

43
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.650
&lt;affirmative&gt; it's not good. It's not good. But you know, I'm in the beginning,

44
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:44.960
make it boxing as by he would.

45
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.000
<v 2>Hide it from his dad. Oh really? Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.160
Six years old. He was boxing and would hide it from his dad,

47
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.000
Little Ramos, the Olympic, uh, whatever, 1980.

48
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.480
He would sneak around.

49
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.240
<v 3>With him. UN.</v>

50
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.680
<v 2>He would learn with him how to box hiding from his dad. Ah.</v>

51
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.920
<v 1>So when did you focus on just wrestling? Like when did wrestling take over?</v>

52
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.830
<v 3>Okay. Um, we in my city,</v>

101
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.120
<v 2>Like that, the Olympic center. So they take it to a different center.</v>

<v 1>Facility, Matt brown told me that he did his camp for,</v>

104
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.230
I think it was the mikepyle fight. Did his camp in Cuba? Yes. And he said,

105
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:26.110
it's just tremendous talent. He said,

106
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:28.950
he just couldn't believe how good the boxers were, how good the wrestlers were.

107
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.630
It was just unbelievable. Yeah.

108
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.150
<v 3>I, I hear he, that Matt brown stay in Cuba. I hear.</v>

<v 3>Stayed and, and, and ma my.</v>

111
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.700
<v 2>He went to the highest level when he was down there.</v>

112
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.460
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. He said he got worked.</v>

113
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.913
<v 2>Decent.</v>

114
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.780
<v 1>I know. Good guys, man. He said they were good.</v>

115
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.620
<v 3>Adam MIMO. I think</v>

116
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.170
central Olympico.

117
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.530
<v 2>He thinks he can't even go back there to that Senti. Now, now they would.</v>

118
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.490
Now they would spank him at his age. Wow.

119
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.890
<v 3>I tease him. I tease him. I teach. So &lt;laugh&gt; I think.</v>

120
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.000
<v 1>I it's crazy crazy when you were there. Um, Matt,</v>

121
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.240
one of the things that Matt was saying,

122
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:25.480
and Matt brown had tremendous respect for the Cuban athletes.

123
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:29.160
And you said it an amazing, amazing system that they produce. Great,

124
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:32.720
great talent. But he's saying that as you get higher and higher levels,

125
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.360
your accommodations are better. Where you sleep is better. Your food,

126
00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:37.680
you get more food. No.

127
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.030
<v 2>My hope going a lot. UN.</v>

128
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.230
<v 1>It's a lot of incentive to improve. It's true.</v>

129
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.333
Yeah.

130
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.740
<v 2>It's, it's hard to say, but it's a reality, but he's gonna tight.</v>

131
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.593
<v 3>Queque.</v>

132
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.700
<v 2>He went to a lot of Olympic centers all over the world.</v>

133
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.660
<v 3>An Nu Nu</v>

134
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.433
de.

135
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.450
<v 2>The number five and the number six wrestlers from those countries</v>

136
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.970
Eats the same as number one In Cuba.

137
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.833
It's not like that.

138
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.773
<v 3>Understand.</v>

139
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.520
<v 2>If you're number three, you don't eat what number one eats.</v>

140
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.440
And you're not gonna eat the same as number two, either

141
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.760
The number one guy has the most privilege. It's good. And it's bad.

142
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.353
<v 3>Que.</v>

143
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.000
<v 2>Because it pushes you to be the best you want to get more's food.</v>

144
00:08:59.001 --> 00:08:59.834
What's that part.

145
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.120
<v 3>That not.</v>

146
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.400
<v 2>Everybody has, could be the best of what they're doing. Right. That's.</v>

147
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.233
<v 3>The</v>

148
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.710
right. Um, you're not gonna have.

149
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.590
<v 2>The privilege to give lobster. Yeah.</v>

150
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.230
<v 1>But if you look at how small Cuba is,</v>

151
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.230
but how many great talents have come from Cuba, obviously it's effective.

152
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.700
I mean, it ha it has its merits, right? Like that system it's a brutal system,

153
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.220
but it seems to be very effective in producing super high level athletes.

154
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.580
<v 2>They ain't gimme no trophies for second place. There's no. Yeah, no, there's no.</v>

155
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.633
<v 3>Unto.</v>

156
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.730
<v 2>You don't want, there comes a point where you don't want the trophy anymore.</v>

157
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.370
<v 3>To, to get a.</v>

158
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.120
<v 2>You want to eat with the best guys. You want to sit with the best guys eating.</v>

159
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.120
<v 3>Okay. I.</v>

160

Matt brown and he he's in Kentucky and you're in Denver training,

202
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.993
<v 3>You.</v>

203
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.080
<v 2>You have to become a machine machine.</v>

204
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.880
<v 3>But not, but it is not only machine in the fight, in, in the fight. No, no,</v>

205
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:33.720
no machine in your life. Yeah.

206
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.533
<v 2>When you're sick.</v>

207
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.990
<v 3>If he broke something, this guy not only one, he says 10 guys. Hmm.</v>

208
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.323

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.720
<v 2>You got that. No,</v>

211
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.000
you have to become a machine inside and out and out because those 10 guys know

212
00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:04.320
when you're sick. Right. You know, they know when you get hurt.

213
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.680
So now I'm training with you. But I saw that you hurt your wrist in training.

214
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.080
I'm going after that wrist. Right. Right, right. You know what I'm saying? Like,

215
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:12.880
it's just, it's, it's, it's intense.

216
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.470
So that's why he's the machine is,

217
00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:20.190
he says it only trains you to be a machine on the outside.

218
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.310
It also trains you to be a machine on the inside.

219
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.430
