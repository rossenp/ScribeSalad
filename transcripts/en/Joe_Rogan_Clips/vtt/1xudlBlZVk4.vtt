00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.010
one of the things that I have found interesting is the concept of what is

3
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:12.090
natural and I've, I've gone over this many times, myself. I'm like poisons,

4
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.120
natural. Like everything's natural computers are natural, really?

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.680
Because they come from the ground they're made by people.

6
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:20.670
They're essentially like, you know, the humans version of, uh,

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.390
anything like a bird would create, right? Birds create birds.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.590
Nests are those natural. But this pyrite, this is pirate, right?

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.970
Which is fool's.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.130
<v 1>Gold, right. Fool's gold. But.</v>

11
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.850
<v 0>It's naturally in these cubes, in these, this,</v>

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.780
this square form, this perfect, these perfect angles,

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.400
which you would never believe, you would think somebody left the there. I.

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400
<v 2>Didn't believe it. It looks like it looks like aliens left them in there.</v>

15
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.180
Even in like, what that's called is it's in the matrix. Oh wow.

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.700
So sometimes you can just get the cubes. They're just the cube,

17
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.450
but they call the rock that it's in the matrix, which I think is, dude,

18
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.620
that's kind of appropriate. Dan.

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.770
<v 0>Is going to have a permanent spot on this desk with all this other craziness</v>

20
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:02.630
here. Thank you so much. That's really cool.

21
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:07.520
I did not know that it came like that. I found pyrite when I was a kid in rocks.

22
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.320
You know, when they call it fool's gold,

23
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.060
Jamie's going to bring that up to you there. Um, fool's gold, but it's,

24
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:17.300
you know, it's usually like specs and flex and stuff. There's.

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.230
<v 2>Another one called F I forget they're called like Illinois minors dollars or</v>

26
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.660
something. This is another form that pyrite takes.

27
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.940
I'm kind of obsessed with weird rocks. Um, but they look just like sand dollars,

28
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:32.060
but they're gold. They look like they're golden. And so these are, you know,

29
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.030
I think one of the things I actually changed my mind over writing,

30
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.650
like over the course of writing this book, oh.

31
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.640
<v 0>There they are. Jamie. Pull-ups, that's crazy. They're incredible. Right? What,</v>

32
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.320
what causes it to take on these different completely unusual forms?

33
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.250
<v 2>So I tried,</v>

34
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
I tried to find out there's like a local rock store where I live and I asked the

35
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.920
guy and apparently I don't understand how it works at all,

36
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:56.180
but the way all crystals work is they have different kinds of structures.

37
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:59.420
And the way those structures come together, determines whether, you know,

38
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:03.920
it makes like a quartz crystal or what shape it takes. Um, it's very, it's,

39
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:06.110
it's very surreal, I think is true.

40
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.820
<v 0>This is very bizarre.</v>

41
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:10.220
I did not know until you gave this to me that that existed.

42
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.420
<v 2>Yeah. Uh, th th and this is so like for me, I went into this book,</v>

43
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.280
like you said, right? With this question of what's natural,

44
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.440
there's some people like often scientists who will sort of scoff at the idea of

45
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.330
naturalness, right? They're like, everything's natural, right.

46
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.870
Humans are natural we're animals. We made all this stuff. We made,

47
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:30.560
the microphones were all made out of space dust. Everything's natural.

48
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.120
It's stupid to distinguish between natural and unnatural. And honestly,

49
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.630
that's where I was. When I started writing the book, I was like,

50
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.960
I'm going to make, I'm going to show this as a stupid idea. I'm going to,

51
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.870
I'm going to be Richard Dawkins, but for naturalists. Right. But,

52
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.710
uh, I, I was wrong. I don't know what shifted it for you will.

53
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:56.300
So one of the things like with that pirate, right. People ask, is it natural?

54
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.640
That's the first thing they ask, does this occur naturally. Right.

55
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.420
And an important question, because there's a difference,

56
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.730
like a sort of profound difference between knowing that that was just spewed

57
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:10.750
up by the earth forces that are not human, right.

58
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.530
Versus humans sitting down and deciding to make a cute, right.

59
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.820
It's like a diamond that has been shaped by millions of years of natural forces.

60
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.660
And what I realized is that it really does make sense to distinguish between

61
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.440
naturalness and unnaturalness, you, you have to, maybe it's a, it's a spectrum,

62
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.510
obviously, right? So it's not an easy binary,

63
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.590
but New York city is not as natural as Yellowstone. Right.

64
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.120
And what I realized was I wasn't really against the idea

65
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.600
of naturalness or even valuing nature. Right. I mean, we'll talk,

66
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.180
hopefully we'll talk about, I went back country in Yellowstone.

67
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.400
It was unbelievable. You know, I mean,

68
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.380
everyone values naturalness in certain ways,

69
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.610
it was worshiping nature that I had a problem with this idea that the more

70
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:55.510
natural something is the better it is or that what we need to do. Like,

71
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:57.880
if you want to raise your kid, right. You got to raise your kid naturally.

72
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:01.360
You like, you know, let them in the corner or like elimination, communication.

73
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:05.870
Do you know about this? No, I swear. So, uh, so I think so some,

74
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.860
some celebrities been into like Alicia Silverstone's, uh,

75
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.030
did it with her son bear. And isn't it funny.

76
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.160
<v 0>That that automatically dismisses.</v>

77
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.590
<v 2>It. I cut. You mean the fact that his name is bear? No.</v>

78
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.830
<v 0>No, no. Just the fact that it's a celebrity thing, like celebrities do it.</v>

79
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.030
It's like I dismiss it.

80
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.940
<v 2>Interesting. That's a different,</v>

81
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.820
I actually thought it was the name bear that they dismissed it.

82
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.820
<v 0>No, I have a good friend with who has a son named bear.</v>

83
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.990
<v 2>I mean, I guess it makes sense if, uh, if, if you're,</v>

84
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:35.940
if you're really obsessed with naturalness, right.

85
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.000
And you're toilet training your kid, then you don't,

86
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.710
you don't want to like be using diapers and you don't want to be using a toilet.

87
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.860
You want it to be like nature. Right. Like, so when I talked with, uh,

88
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.710
with anthropologists who work with hunter gatherers, you know, ask them like,

89
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:51.600
how do you know, how does potty training work? And they were like,

90
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.320
what do you mean? Like people just in the forest and right. You know,

91
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.160
if you take a in someone's lap, they're going to be really upset at you. And it.

92
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.430
<v 0>Doesn't, you know, you picture that daddy's lap. Exactly.</v>

93
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.360
<v 2>Um, but there's this idea, right? That, that, and so that's how,</v>

94
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.610
that's what we should be doing with our children. And,

95
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.960
and I don't know about you, but like, when I, you know,

96
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.270
when we had our daughter, I was online and I'm like, okay, well,

97
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:14.670
how do I parent my child? What are the right things to do? Like,

98
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:17.370
should she be in my bed? Should she be in the crib and time and time again,

99
00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:21.450
I always read about how hunter gatherers parented their babies. Right.

100
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:24.450
And it was always like, this is the natural way to parent your kid.

101
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.810
So it must be better. And, and I realized that was,

102
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.230
that was where I had my problem. That, that it's fine to love nature,

103
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.760
but you shouldn't worship it.

104
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.750
<v 0>Well,</v>

105
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.290
human beings have done horrible things to their children from the beginning of

106
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:41.100
time, without anybody telling them to do it or not to do it.

107
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.380
And I don't know if that's natural, but yeah. I mean, if it occurs enough,

108
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.600
it's kind of like pedophilia occurs a lot. Is that natural?

109
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.610
<v 2>So, so there was a there's a, there was, yeah. I mean, essentially again, right.</v>

110
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.490
If is defined as whatever sort of emerges spontaneously out of

111
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:05.180
forces that weren't willed by human beings, which is what I think natural is.

112
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:07.400
Right. So we say we have natural instincts. In other words,

113
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.280
it's whatever we didn't will. It just comes out of us. Right. There's a,

114
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:12.140
there's a woman, who's an expert on captivity.

115
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.800
So kidnapping slavery and Catherine Cameron,

116
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.170
and I was interviewing her. She said, you know,

117
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.830
it is as natural as the nuclear family to have slaves. Right.

118
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:26.780
So slavery is a thing that has been done forever and

119
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.260
ever. I mean, you imagine, right? So you're pre agricultural your tribe.

120
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.840
Your group requires certain population can't get too high, can't get too low.

121
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:40.640
And so kidnapping other people's children, it's often a common thing. Um, yeah.

122
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.060
So is that good? Well, clearly not right. Or, you know, dying in childbirth. Um,

123
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.640
these are, these are all things that are natural, but are obviously not good.

124
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.300
And so I started, I started to see the way in which this word was being abused.

125
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:57.530
Basically people would use natural,

126
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.060
describe whatever they favored unnatural to describe whatever they didn't like.

127
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.730
Right. People do have sex. People do it with child-rearing.

128
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.770
People do it with economic theories, right?

129
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:09.770
You want a natural market with no interference.

130
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.760
And that's how people justify free market. You've got other people who are like,

131
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.360
actually money is a natural. You really want a barter system.

132
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.970
That was what emerged naturally out of humans.

133
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.140
And I'm sitting here looking at both these organs. I'm like, no,

134
00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.840
you want an economy that works, right.

135
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.160
It doesn't matter whether it's natural or not.

136
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.880
<v 0>That's a really good point. You know, one of the things that I saw in your book,</v>

137
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.050
uh, was you were talking to Joel, Salitan who I love. And, um,

138
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.470
he's a strange man. Um, but a, a beautiful person.

139
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.290
I really love what he's doing with Polyface farms,

140
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:44.210
but he drinks the water that the cows drink out of so that he gets

141
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.780
that in his biome. You know, he's, he's a real freak,

142
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.830
but when you were talking about New York city and, uh, you know,

143
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:56.750
would his method of farming work to feed a city as big as New York?

144
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:59.810
He's like, do you need a city as big as New York? Then I'm like, okay,

145
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.830
hit the brakes right now. We're in the weeds because I love New York.

146
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.250
It's a great place to visit. I don't want to live there, but it's awesome.

147
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.200
I mean, when you go to New York, if you you're,

148
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:12.980
if you're in a hotel that has like a 30th floor and you look out and you see the

149
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:17.660
skinny, the city's skyscrapers, you know, you see all the, the w you know,

150
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:21.020
the skyline, all the different, beautiful buildings lit up at night. I mean,

151
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:25.670
that is an amazing spectacular site that I am very thankful, exists.

152
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.210
I love it.

153
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.790
<v 2>There. Yeah. I'm great. I'm in grateful for all that. I mean, there's so many,</v>

154
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.900
it's, it's, it's insane really to be right now.

155
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.960
If someone's listening to this podcast, here we are. We've got microphones.

156
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.160
We're beaming this conversation to millions of people.

157
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.480
And to think that that simultaneously people would be thinking to themselves,

158
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:46.550
the criteria I'm going to use to judge,

159
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:51.230
whether something is good or bad with a capital G or a capital B is how natural

160
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:55.470
it is, right? This is totally unnatural as unnatural, as natural as it gets.

161
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.430
Meanwhile, the coronavirus, right. Which is, you know, natural, of course,

162
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:00.390
people will say, well, actually,

163
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.150
we wouldn't have been infected if only we lived more naturally, right?

164
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.590
So the problem is urban density,

165
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:08.160
or the problem is that you shouldn't be going into the jungle and getting

166
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.770
things. But like, this is, you know, it's actually.

167
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.690
<v 0>An argument against that though. The, the,</v>

168
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.850
the virus itself more evidence is coming out daily, that it's been manipulated,

169
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.640
that it most likely did come out of that lab.

170
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.430
I had Bret Weinstein on the podcast. Who's a biologist.

171
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.590
And he was talking about all the various aspects of the virus that really don't

172
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:30.500
exist naturally in, in, in,

173
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.680
in this form without having evolved for a long period of time,

174
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:37.940
the fact that it just emerged and made this leap from bats to the form that it

175
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:41.840
is now, and people he's like it's far too contagious. It's far too prolific.

176
00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:44.300
It's, there's so many different. Um, I'm going to it up.

177
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.780
If I talk about the technical details of it. But when he was describing,

178
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.650
and he was saying more evidence points to the fact that it was actually

179
00:09:51.651 --> 00:09:55.850
something that had been manipulated by people, then that it was a natural virus.

180
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.370
So.

181
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.320
<v 2>I mean, I don't, I'm not a biologist. Um, I have no idea,</v>

182
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.010
but I think what I think what's weird or what I would want to push back on.

183
00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:06.140
And this is a religious studies scholar, right? Because this is,

184
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:11.330
this is where I came to all the naturals natural stuff to begin with is if

185
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:14.480
something's bad, I think people are immediately going to think, oh,

186
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:16.400
it makes sense that it was unnatural.

187
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.470
It makes sense that this bad thing that's hurting us, couldn't be natural.

188
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.270
But, but the truth is some things that hurt us are natural

189
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.670
cyanide. There you go. You know, again,

190
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.180
I keep going back to childbirth and I went to Peru. I got to tell you the story.

191
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:33.620
So I went to Peru beacon for,

192
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:37.460
to research this book because I wanted to talk with like,

193
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.850
as close as I could get to pre agricultural hunter gatherers. Right.

194
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:43.000
And I can't get, you can't get too close, but there,

195
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.600
there are people called the [inaudible], the mochi Ganga, um,

196
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:44.600
 in the rainforest that I got to talk to, and I got to ask them about, you know, their relationship with technology and all that stuff. I'm never 

197
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:44.600
going to forget. I go up to this, this guy and I asked him

198
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:44.600
, they've just had solar lights installed, like in the main sort of area of their village. And I go up to this guy and I was like, how do you feel about having these artificial lights installed? And he, and I'm thinking to myself, you know, it's this pollution, right? Isn't it better to just have, you know, the stars in the sky and the moon. And he looks at me and he goes, he goes, this is good. We can see 

199
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.433
at night, he's just like, look, he was talking to just a idiot.

200
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.960
Of course I'm happy. Right. Or this and that. There was this old lady.

201
00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:32.090
I was like, they'd had, you know, they had a,

202
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.240
they had a pump like running water installed, basic clean water. Right.

203
00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:38.330
So you could wash your dishes and your clothes. And I'm thinking, oh my God,

204
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:43.400
this is ripping them away from the natural way of life. And I asked this lady,

205
00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:46.220
I'm like, how do you feel about the water? And she's like, it's we don't,

206
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.700
we don't get bacterial. I mean, she didn't say bacterial infection.

207
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.320
She was like, we don't get sick anymore.

208
00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:55.030
From the water that we're drinking from the river. I was like, oh,

209
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:58.720
and she's just looking at me like, who, like, why, why is he asking me this?

210
00:11:58.721 --> 00:11:59.441
Right. And meanwhile,

211
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:02.590
I'm coming from this place where everyone wants to get closer to nature. Right.

212
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.330
Because we have been alienated from it. And,

213
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:07.840
and I'm asking from the perspective of someone who thinks it just must be

214
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:12.490
paradise living so close to nature. And she's like, no, we want the,

215
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.490
we wanna be able to wash our clothes and have lights on at night.

216
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.210
And I was like, right. There was a shaman.

217
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:21.160
I'm talking to the shaman in the village. Don't Alberta. Right.

218
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:23.290
And he's talking, he's like, you know, it's true.

219
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.500
That technology is messing up the world. We've got climate change. We've got,

220
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:29.050
you know, all these species are going extinct and he goes on and on. Right.

221
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:32.680
It's, he's very close to nature. Very, very wise, man.

222
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.570
He's got a cell phone also. Right. And I'm like, well,

223
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.610
so is technology bad? And he's like, he's like, yes. Well, yes, yes. And no,

224
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.490
he's on Tinder. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's what he's really doing.

225
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.570
He didn't tell me, but that's, and that's, I want people,

226
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.670
I just want people to understand that there just aren't any easy categories you

227
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:58.990
can use to divide up the world into good and bad.

228
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.120
And now that people now that organized religion,

229
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:03.370
sort of the sphere of authority is shrinking. Right?

230
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:05.110
You don't go to your priest to find out what to eat.

231
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.890
You don't go to your priest to find out how to cure your disease.

232
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.800
Now that that authority is shrinking.

233
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.090
I think people are looking to other similar kinds of authority.

234
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:17.800
And so they're like, okay, I can't go to my priest,

235
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:19.330
but if I'm walking through the store,

236
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.610
what sort of criteria can I use to divide the world up

237
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.080
easily into good and evil, clean and unclean,

238
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.440
organic, organic, and inorganic, right? Yeah. Artificial.

239
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:36.850
And it's built into our language, Joe, like art, a fish are, are artificial.

240
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.250
Artificial might be a thing someday. Uh, artificial right. Is,

241
00:13:40.251 --> 00:13:43.240
is linked to artifice, which is deception, right?

242
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.310
So you've got manipulated,

243
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.260
which really just means humans got ahold of it and changed it with their hands

244
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.670
also means something bad. So really built into our language.

245
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.660
We have this idea that natural means good

246
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.840
artificial manipulated. That's bad.

247
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:07.380
<v 0>I think maybe it's because we have this</v>

248
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:11.220
insane power to manipulate things. And we,

249
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.960
we all collectively use the power to manipulate things that was

250
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:20.820
created by scientists that have a far greater understanding of what the

251
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:24.750
implications and like what the process of this manipulation is.

252
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.320
And we just come along and use their technology. I mean, that's, I think that's,

253
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.340
that's a problem with so much of what people do. Like we've,

254
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.320
we've earned this power just by virtue of being alive and

255
00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:41.040
being able to trade in goods and services for whatever that they've created.

256
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.850
And then we don't think about the consequences of utilizing this stuff.

257
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.210
Like what is, there's gotta be, there's some sort of a balance, right?

258
00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:50.200
There's a balance between like,

259
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:54.560
if you want have a fireplace in your house, that's wonderful.

260
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.790
Fireplaces are great. It's a nice smell, right? W you walk in the house,

261
00:14:58.791 --> 00:14:59.870
you smell a fireplace.

262
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.780
If you're walking down the street and someone's got their fireplace on smells

263
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:06.320
good. But if the whole place is on fire, it's terrible.

264
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.130
You're filled with smoke. You can't breathe. It's like, there's a balance.

265
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.100
And clearly when you see polluted cities,

266
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.240
clearly when you see polluted rivers and we're destroying the environment,

267
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.520
there's a lack of balance.

268
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.850
We've utilized this power that we have to manipulate our environment,

269
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.600
but we've done it completely irresponsibly, or we've done it without the,

270
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.360
without the awareness of the consequences of 8 million people doing the exact

271
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:33.194
same thing.

272
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:33.761
<v 2>Well, that, I mean,</v>

273
00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:37.300
the scale you can do stuff on with technology has really increased. I mean,

274
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.610
it's, it's made us incredibly powerful, right? There's Stuart brand,

275
00:15:39.611 --> 00:15:41.530
the guy who started the whole earth catalog, you know,

276
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.290
said basically we've become like gods.

277
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:46.360
So we have to be able to wield this power responsibly.

278
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.420
I think it's easy to see that and say, well,

279
00:15:49.421 --> 00:15:53.400
then the evil is in the form of the power itself, right.

280
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.650
Obviously then if we've got a nuclear bomb or we've got, you know,

281
00:15:56.651 --> 00:15:59.140
if we're polluting the world, then the problem is with,

282
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.430
with the technology itself. So you locate the evil in that technology. Whereas,

283
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.120
you know what you're sending take, take burning wood, which is a great example.

284
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.370
You know, we've got a lot of people on earth.

285
00:16:09.371 --> 00:16:13.480
Now we have them because kids aren't dying all the time. Right. I mean the,

286
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.440
so there's, there's some,

287
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.540
there are some things that I discovered while I was reading this. For example,

288
00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:20.980
if you've seen that cartoon, um, where there's two cave men in a room,

289
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.430
it's a new Yorker cartoon, and they're talking, they're not in a room.

290
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.380
They're cavemen, they're in a cave. Sorry.

291
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.830
So they're in a cave and they're talking to each other. And one of them is like,

292
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.100
you know, we eat organic. We exercise all the time. And like,

293
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.820
nobody's living past the age of 35, what's going on. Right. So there's,

294
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.030
there's this that's and that's the people that are like, nature's take. Right?

295
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.270
They're like, but, but actually it turns out that that cartoon is.

296
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.060
So people didn't just die at age 35.

297
00:16:46.061 --> 00:16:50.200
That was average lifespan because tons of kids were dying between the age of

298
00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:53.290
zero and five truth is if you made it past five,

299
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.690
then you had a pretty good shot at like 60 or 70. Um, so,

300
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.410
so it wasn't so bad in the state of nature at the same time.

301
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.840
There's another vision of what's happening to us. Now,

302
00:17:04.841 --> 00:17:06.130
have you seen that evolution?

303
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.590
There's like an evolution cartoon where it starts with, I don't know,

304
00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:10.960
like paleolithic man or a chimpanzee or something.

305
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.590
And then it gets to like a big strong hunter with a spear.

306
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.240
And then technology comes in and they hunch over at the end and they get obese

307
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.710
and they've got like a Coke in one hand. And there's this idea like, well,

308
00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:27.190
technology is now. We were perfect when we were natural.

309
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.720
And then technology has made us worse. And for me, it's what you were saying.

310
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.830
It's a balance, right? There are ways in which technology like my dad,

311
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:40.330
my dad is, is 91 that I talked, you know,

312
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:43.580
I talked to anthropologists and like, despite what you might, you know, you,

313
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.320
you might think that there aren't a lot of 91 year old hunter gatherers.

314
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.200
They're just not out. So I'm like really grateful that my dad, you know,

315
00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.660
is super healthy 91 year old. That is, that's crazy.

316
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:55.770
That's an incredible thing we've done.

317
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:58.860
I'm glad that kids aren't dying all the time. I'm dad, you know,

318
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:00.360
I'm glad that mothers aren't dying in childbirth.

319
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.750
That's those are incredible things like New York city, right. At the same time,

320
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:07.200
it's, we're destroying the world. Right. So we gotta,

321
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:11.760
we gotta work out these problems without using simple

322
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.910
binaries to figure out what's good. And what's bad.

323
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:19.560
It's better to have solar power than billions of humans burning wood. Right.

324
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.880
But solar powers, obviously to me, at least less natural than lighten it.

325
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.400
<v 0>This way, it doesn't bother me at all. Yeah. I mean, I love solar power,</v>

326
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.790
but I I'm, I'm totally on board with what you're saying.

327
00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:33.010
And there is some sort of a balance.
