1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>70 Cause he was going to fight aspirin at 70 and then they gave asker and Robbie</v>

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.160
Lawler. Oh.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.330
<v 1>Well, both fights. I love, but you know that guy's just soul.</v>

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.050
He was so much bigger than cowboy. He was so much bigger way bigger.

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:14.220
When you looked at him in there, I mean,

6
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.340
he looked like he was two weight classes, bigger, at least one weight class,

7
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:20.250
bigger. Look at ease, at least on the upper end of the next weight class.

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.910
Lawler makes.

9
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.880
<v 2>Sense. What are you talking about. Yeah, that makes sense.</v>

10
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.660
<v 0>It may make sense. No, it doesn't.</v>

11
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.620
<v 2>It's gonna be hard to take down and he's vicious with this.</v>

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.340
<v 0>Perfect. So the night of the fight I dig it.</v>

13
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.690
But the thing that makes Ben Astron special too, is his, you know, his mouth,

14
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.060
his mind came, so Robbie's not gonna play that game.

15
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.100
He doesn't have a dance partner. Oh, that's what.

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.860
<v 2>Makes it great. Is that he can't, he can't uh.</v>

17
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
<v 1>What, what is it going to do? This is the fashion lover talking.</v>

18
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.873
None of this is.

19
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.090
<v 0>Hold up. No, th this, this is the Dana white, me talking.</v>

20
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:54.420
This is the moneymaker your boys, the exact same way. Let me here.

21
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.860
Because if you give Ben Askren who can talk right up there with the best we got,

22
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:03.750
man, if you give him a guy, you know, you name anybody, you give anyone in the,

23
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.540
in the fight game and he goes back and forth. He's gonna be great.

24
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.610
You can Colby come into news a talker. Yeah.

25
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.550
The fans are gonna be able to gravitate towards that and see the story.

26
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.130
<v 2>That's the first fight. That's the first, this is only one fight.</v>

27
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.030
It's a big fight.

28
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.010
[inaudible] physically that talking to side.

29
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.260
You're right with the talking for sure. Xs and.

30
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.360
<v 0>Those amazing fight night. Love the fight.</v>

31
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.260
<v 2>The physicality of the fight. Is that a word? Probably.</v>

32
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.910
<v 0>I'll tell you. It's.</v>

33
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.890
<v 2>Probably Jamie, you got a name, right?</v>

34
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.510
<v 0>Physicality. That's a word.</v>

35
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.153
<v 1>That seems right.</v>

36
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
<v 2>Come on, man. That's the hold on. This is not easy for Ben.</v>

37
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.350
That's going to be a hard.

38
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.720
<v 0>Fight.</v>

39
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.640
<v 2>Is easy for him. He just grabs everybody and man I'm set for the Russian guy.</v>

40
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.360
I'm saying.

41
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.880
<v 0>Full advantage of what Ben Askren brings to the table.</v>

42
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.090
Robbie Lawler is not the matchup. I would give him off the bat.

43
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.510
I would have gave him a Darren till or Colby, Covington, something like that.

44
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.730
Who will verbally go back out to build up.

45
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.610
<v 1>To that has been the game too long. I.</v>

46
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.200
<v 0>Understand what the night of the fight.</v>

47
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.620
<v 1>I don't think, I think you just want to see the fight.</v>

48
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.910
I don't think we should ever make decisions based on like

49
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.130
talking and encouraging talking.

50
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:16.470
I think what's interesting about Ben Askren has been aspirin.

51
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.610
I want to see what the he can do to a real former world champion.

52
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.330
Who's fought at the highest level. That's a great, great match with.

53
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.820
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

54
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.770
<v 1>Allows the legend. Whether he talks back, no one's going to give a. Look.</v>

55
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.090
Ben asked him when he was at, we live in Joe Ben Askren. When he was at the UFC,

56
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.280
they put a camera on him and the crowd went nuts.

57
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.050
He hasn't even fought in the UFC yet.

58
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.000
Everybody knows about him from the internet.

59
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.790
A lot of people know about him from you and me.

60
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.050
And a lot of people know about him from Bella tore fans and one FC fans.

61
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.090
I think people didn't realize how popular he is and how people want to see

62
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.800
what an undefeated,

63
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.610
undefeated wrestler who dominated guys like Lima and chorus, coffin,

64
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.430
Bella tour, still hasn't laminated. I want don't.

65
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.230
You want to see what the that guy can do?

66
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.610
And if you don't want to see what that guy can do against the ruthless one,

67
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.970
Robbie Lawler, Robbie Lawler is not done, man. No, he's not done. He's

68
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.980
scary. He's always scary, man.

69
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.940
P he's had multiple like periods in his career.

70
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.790
He had the Strikeforce period. He had the UFC period.

71
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:28.300
He had the championship period. You know, he had his younger wild days.

72
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.370
Why he's fallen on some hard times now.

73
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.140
<v 2>He's not the greatest Robbie. Lawler is not the greatest wrestler of all time.</v>

74
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.610
He's dead Russell growing up and what the equalizer

75
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.830
or his hands dude with the rustling, you could say, he's, you know,

76
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.300
he's like right in there, you know, a decent wrestler, but it's hands.

77
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.720
Do you know?

78
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.140
<v 1>That's been taken down and is anybody in the UFC? He might eat everybody,</v>

79
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.970
but he might finding out.

80
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.190
<v 2>He was going to be entertaining as.</v>

81
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.590
<v 1>I'll do it again. I think it's coming at me.</v>

82
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.790
Like I don't think it's a great fight. I'd love the fight. I just went, ah, man,

83
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.430
I'll get him. Colby, come at 10. I would have gave him that's coming.

84
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.470
That's coming. This is after the first time world champ, but, or,

85
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.800
or Robbie Lawler gets cubby. Colby covered 10. If he wins.

86
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.800
That's a great way to, for Robbie to get back into the mix.

87
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:20.950
And plus you don't want to make it easy on Ben Askren because you know,

88
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.720
everyone's going to, uh, out of the UFC organization,

89
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.480
champ, let's see what he's made of Robbie lodged. A tough test.

90
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.560
Good take down defense.

91
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.540
But it gives Rob an opportunity to reset to if Robbie

92
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.650
can beat him, you know,

93
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:38.830
Robbie didn't have a good fight with Hotmail Dosantos but he did have a good

94
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:42.340
fight with cowboy, right? Those were the last two fights he had. I believe.

95
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.450
Am I right about that? He lost Osan Josephine cowboy. He lost the dos.

96
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:47.830
Anjos right. Last time.

97
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.220
<v 2>As aspirin fought anybody at Lawler's level. No, no, right? No way.</v>

98
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.680
<v 1>Uh, Douglas, Lima, Lima, Lima.</v>

99
00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.770
<v 2>Didn't Russell's growing.</v>

100
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.570
<v 1>Up. It was a younger Lima. So the same new Dolores Cubs, a monster,</v>

101
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:08.230
but he's bought those guys. He dominated them. So they were young.

102
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.790
<v 2>But Lala brings in wrestling and ferocious striking.</v>

103
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.310
<v 1>At the highest levels of competition and a great champion in the UFC.</v>

104
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.510
I mean he fought warriors. He fought some of the best, the best. I mean,

105
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:24.460
he's one of the best, the best I'm interested in.

106
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.680
<v 2>Safe times.</v>

107
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.203
<v 1>Kenny.</v>

108
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.930
<v 2>Can, can add. Is there something about Lawler that asks him can talk about.</v>

109
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.500
<v 1>What? Can you say? Nothing. No, everyone. There's a few guys.</v>

110
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.640
You can't talk about it's fricking Robbie Lawler, Dan Henderson,

111
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.653
Matt Hughes.

112
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.990
Like you just can't you remember people starting there before Tyron Woodley,

113
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.110
beat him. People thought he was the boogeyman who? Robby Lauer,

114
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.610
like used to get his out of here.

115
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.560
<v 2>I'll never forget Dana white at the comedy store and my 2002 or three.</v>

116
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.950
And he was like, it needs we're we're at the parking lot.

117
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.220
Dana white went to see you. And he's like raving about this new kid.

118
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.300
Oh my God. I got this new kid. Robbie Lawler's ferocious. He's a wrestler.

119
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.730
Who's just knocking everybody out on the local level.

120
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.790
You're going to hear a lot about Robbie Lawler. I'll never forget that.

121
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.900
I was like 2001, 2002, something like that. Talking about.

122
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.840
<v 1>Hall of fame. Legit hall of Famer. Yeah. So for sure,</v>

123
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.140
it's the toughest opponent of Ben astrons career or? Yeah,

124
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.230
I would say it's the toughest, but for sure, it's nice to validate.

125
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.670
I have to be totally honest. I never, I never watched his fights in one FC.

126
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.920
I'd never figured out. Get it off.

127
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.190
<v 2>The Russian wrestler. Yeah, he does.</v>

128
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.000
<v 1>One guy. What's the best way. I mean, if I just saw highlights,</v>

129
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.860
I saw highlights two. I didn't watch one FC either.

130
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.140
<v 2>Well, all I saw was Ben,</v>

131
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.540
as soon as he puts his hands on people is at something's up,

132
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.810
but he has bionic hands or something because as soon as he's able to get his

133
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:54.560
hands on, he just doesn't let go. And I'm not going to say names you down.

134
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:58.090
I can say names, but he's shy. And Khabib he does that too.

135
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.750
<v 1>Everybody guys we know that are good. Grab diamond free, bud. Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:03.800
That's exactly what I hear.

137
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.420
Which is why you and I both w we went on like a campaign to get that.

138
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.590
<v 2>I know.</v>

139
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.170
<v 1>I love having him on the podcast was great too,</v>

140
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.120
because people could get to see who he actually is. You know, because you,

141
00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:21.800
you want a guy like lock and these little talk in blurbs.

142
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.290
That's not really like this guy, an who is this guy,

143
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.690
but then you sit with them for an hour and he's fun.

144
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.620
Hey smartest really well educated.

145
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.640
<v 2>Looks like a Greek statue, right? Doesn't.</v>

146
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.730
<v 1>He get extra? [inaudible] take a shot. Like no one, man.</v>

147
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:41.060
He takes knees. When he shoots and gets clipped with knees.

148
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.190
Not good enough was the greatest.

149
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.240
<v 2>Um, there's,</v>

150
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.380
there's a couple others that used to used to campaign for the greatest fighters

151
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:52.040
that never fought in the UFC. Ben Askren has one. Who's the other one.

152
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.400
There's another one, a black guy, a black guy,

153
00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.080
black guy has never fought in the UFC, not sad campaign for, for 10 years.

154
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.943
It was.

155
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.050
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

156
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.760
But I wasn't really fighting that much MMA outside of

157
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:10.460
pride rules. Right? Like he fought anywhere else.

158
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.871
<v 2>You know what?</v>

159
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:15.800
He's the kind of guy that's going to knock you into another dimension or he's

160
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:20.240
going to get choked out. But either way, it's you bring them in? Why does.

161
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.640
<v 1>Right with Robbie Lawler? How come we never got Melvin into the,</v>

162
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.883
because you want.

163
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.780
<v 2>Is that what it was? Once you suggest the fire, they're never coming out.</v>

164
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.060
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

165
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.360
<v 2>No.</v>

166
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.220
<v 1>Ben, Dana hated Ben.</v>

167
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.730
<v 2>Ben who asks him. They hated it. They talk online.</v>

168
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.870
<v 1>Yeah. They went back and forth. He chose brilliant data. Blocked him on Twitter.</v>

169
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.410
Yes. But Valley's in,

170
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.210
I got ahold of Dana and I said, he's a nice guy. I said, he's a fun guy.

171
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.010
He's talking. He ended up. They probably will.

172
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.380
Especially if Ben becomes him a shitload of money and she's going to this and

173
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.710
they're going to be happy. They made this top of his bed. He's not that old.

174
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.000
He's 35 thirties, early thirties, 34.

175
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.270
He's still been doing it for a hot minute, but he's still people up.

176
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.080
Zero damage. He didn't take a punch in his last two fights.
