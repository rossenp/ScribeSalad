00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.150
So when we're talking about San Diego being very fit place,

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.960
do you do any sort of strength and conditioning or anything for skateboarding?

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.190
Is that something that people do?

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.440
<v 1>Some people do it.</v>

6
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:18.360
I never found it to help my skating and I always felt

7
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.720
like skating kept me fit. So I never really did it. I mean,

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.420
outside of swimming and surfing,

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.590
which is more upper body than skating obviously. But, um,

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.730
but I do feel like that would have benefited me later in life.

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.260
It just got stuck in my mode and then just skating. Was it, you stay there.

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.180
<v 0>You're in your mode now. You don't do anything.</v>

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.650
<v 1>I don't do anything else. I do. I do make an effort to like swim some laps.</v>

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.390
Um, cause my mom lived, uh, till her nineties and she swore by swimming.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.640
Swimming is amazing. Yup. Yeah. Um, she would go through, I mean,

16
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.590
I remember all as a kid, she would definitely,

17
00:00:55.591 --> 00:01:00.240
she had to get her 20 laps in every day. Um, and,

18
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:04.110
and we, we are our, uh, where I live,

19
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.530
the residential area had a community swimming pool that was like Olympic size.

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.790
So the whole thing. Yeah.

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.571
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:14.100
We were talking before about surfing and I was saying that I think that surfing

23
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.870
at least partially would kind of mimic some of the muscles that you use in

24
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:19.704
skateboarding.

25
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.280
And then you were telling me about getting towed in by Laird Hamilton

26
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.990
While you drink his coffee. Wow.

27
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.750
<v 1>Um, yeah, so, well, my brother,</v>

28
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.760
my older brother was a surfer and he got me into skating because he

29
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.580
skated in the seventies when that was the thing was,

30
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.950
they were trying to emulate surfing with the skateboards.

31
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:43.860
And so he actually gave me one of his old board that was my first skateboard.

32
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.280
Um, and then he would drive me to the skate park once a week,

33
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.400
like come home from college and take me to the park. And then I just got hooked.

34
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.240
Like that was, that was my home away from home from that point on. Um,

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.220
and so I surf pretty regularly,

36
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.170
I would say less now, but, um,

37
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.850
but it was hard not to with my brother's influence and we were in

38
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:09.510
Hawaii. My brother actually used to be the, uh, editor of surfer magazine.

39
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.620
So he knows all the surfers. Um, cause he's, he's a journalist, um,

40
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.890
really good writer, uh, teaches at Stanford now actually.

41
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.730
And so we went to Hawaii,

42
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.000
we went to Maui and he said, Hey, Larry had said,

43
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.330
he'd take us out tow in surfing. If you want to go,

44
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.650
we're going to go tones over with Laird Hamilton.

45
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.950
Like I don't think his level of what is mellow is something that is what

46
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.620
we would consider and he's, and I go, but you know,

47
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:41.880
we gotta go like it's a once in a lifetime. Right. So they took us out, uh,

48
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.910
to Spreckels, which is near a jaws, which is there a big spot?

49
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.470
This is like early two thousands.

50
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.980
So towing serving was just starting to come into play.

51
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.270
I'll never forget Dave Kalama. Who's one of the surfers, one of his homeys.

52
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.950
He was trying out the first foil board there. Oh wow. And he had,

53
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.240
he was wearing ski boots attached to the foil board.

54
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.670
That's how he was writing it. I was like,

55
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.990
these guys are out of their minds and uh, and so.

56
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.850
<v 0>Uh, detach like a ski boot, if you.</v>

57
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.890
<v 1>Fall, I never saw detach.</v>

58
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.220
<v 0>Oh God. Yeah. So you have to recover and swim to the surface while you're.</v>

59
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.300
<v 1>Mean I was too focused on trying to survive myself to worry about what he was</v>

60
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:30.250
doing, but um, yeah. So, uh, rush Randall.

61
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.350
Who's another wind surfer there.

62
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.450
He was telling me and Laird is telling my brother and I'll never forget

63
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.700
them being outside. And then, you know,

64
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.380
they're saying it's a small day and they're like, oh,

65
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.350
I think there might be like some 10 or 12 foot sets.

66
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:48.610
And I know what 10 or 12 foot in Hawaiian measurement means.

67
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.170
And I was like, just don't tell me any one of those. Okay. And, uh,

68
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.920
and then I'll never forget looking out and, and rush said, here comes one.

69
00:03:56.921 --> 00:04:00.550
I'm like where, where, because you're so far out. Right. And he's like,

70
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.320
get ready. Okay.

71
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.560
And so then I got ready and I'm getting towed and all of a sudden this thing,

72
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.430
this mountain just swells up underneath me. And before I know it,

73
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.150
I'm just in the pit of this move this way that it was like double, overhead,

74
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.070
biggest way I've ever written for sure. Um, and for me it's backside.

75
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.720
So when you're going backside, you're,

76
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.330
you're just sort of looking down the line. You're not looking back at the,

77
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.060
at the barrel. What does that mean by backside? Um,

78
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.220
so the wave is breaking this way and my back is to the face

79
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.500
of the wave. Oh, okay. Right.

80
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.970
And it backsides a little more challenging just because of the, the turning and,

81
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:40.660
and the way you're facing. So when you go in front side, you're facing the wave,

82
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.840
you can really see down the line, you can look back easily. Um,

83
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:47.590
so I'm going backside. And I remember looking at looking at the wall,

84
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:51.250
thinking like I've written 20 foot skate ramps. And I'm like, that's,

85
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.810
that looks like about a 20 foot skate ramp.

86
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.070
So I was going and I was cruising and then I did a little cutback.

87
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:01.900
So I started going to back towards the barrel and I looked at the barrel and it

88
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.290
was like the most frightening thing I've ever seen in my life because it was,

89
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.120
you know, it was like a massive hollow way of that you see in

90
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:14.710
movies that you see Lehrer just dancing around in. And I'm like, I can't,

91
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.790
I'm not getting near that thing.

92
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:19.090
And I immediately just turned back and went down the line even further.

93
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.220
It's just get ahead of it. Um,

94
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.600
and then I did find myself after a few waves getting cocky and I tried to pull

95
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:30.460
into the barrel and it just clobbered me in the head. And then I, you know, you,

96
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:33.640
weren't a life vest. And then I went down, I'll never forget.

97
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:36.820
Like I felt myself going down one shelf and you know,

98
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.970
trying to swim up to the top. And then I felt a good down another shelf.

99
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:42.430
And I was like, oh, this is bad. Um,

100
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.450
and then finally made it up to the surface and rush is like three feet from me.

101
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.260
Oh, wow. Cause he's just been chasing me. Those guys are they're the masters.

102
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.050
<v 0>Experts in covering people that get clobbered.</v>

103
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.070
<v 1>Yeah. And I was just like, how long were you down for? I, you know, it wasn't,</v>

104
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.350
it wasn't like a crazy hole down,

105
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.550
but in my inexperience and not conditioned body,

106
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.960
it felt like a long time. Um, and I, and I told rush, I was like, oh, that was,

107
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.290
that was scary. I've never been held down that much. He's like, yeah,

108
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.440
I've had my worst hold downs out here. Cool.

109
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.920
<v 0>Thanks. I was telling you, I was, you know,</v>

110
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.340
I get in the sauna every day and I said something to Larry and he sent me a

111
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.160
picture of his sauna. Pull it up here.

112
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.840
It's he's at 250

113
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.660
degrees. You're in his sauna. I mean,

114
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:36.650
I don't even understand why he would do that, but he's like,

115
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.910
I'm that this thing doesn't go any hotter. Let me.

116
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.440
<v 1>He lives on a different plane.</v>

117
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.420
<v 0>He gets in there with oven mitts at 250 degrees with, oh, here it is.</v>

118
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.380
Look at this crazy. Look at that. So.

119
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.290
<v 1>Does he wear oven mitts? So his skin won't melt off. Yeah. Cause.</v>

120
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.120
<v 0>He rides his Airdyne bike.</v>

121
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.980
So the metal of the Airdyne bike would literally cook him. I mean,

122
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.730
I cook a steak at 250 degrees and the smoker,

123
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.430
this is crazy. And it's 200. It's actually like probably it's,

124
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:14.180
it's pinned at two 50. Cause that's as hot as this thermostat gets. Right?

125
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.360
Like it's probably hotter than two 50. He's out.

126
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.230
<v 1>Of his nuts. Um, he's faster is.</v>

127
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.410
<v 0>Always better. His, his, his quote to me, I just,</v>

128
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.980
there's gotta be a point. I did it once here. I was trying to,

129
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.110
after he came on the podcast, I was trying to copy him.

130
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.800
So I was doing it like two 10 and I did once a two 20,

131
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.450
I was burning like the inside of my throat from breathing in the air. I was,

132
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:41.240
I felt like killing myself. Cause I was in there for like 20 minutes.

133
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:42.650
I was like, and then I'd get out.

134
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.170
And it was as tired as I've ever been in my life.

135
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.260
I would just collapse on the mats. After I got out of the sauna, I was like,

136
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.320
I gotta stop doing this. And then I'd come in and do podcasts. And like,

137
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.610
I was having a hard time talking. I was like, like my throat was,

138
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.440
was cooked. It was basically.

139
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.210
<v 1>Cooked. Yeah. I never did well with that stuff. We, um, we got one,</v>

140
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:04.310
actually we got one of the, uh, infrared ones.

141
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.480
<v 0>There are different. Those are the, he doesn't like the infrared ones.</v>

142
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.930
Laird said that they gave him a real bad skin condition. And that like,

143
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:12.920
there's something about his,

144
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:14.900
particularly the temperatures and he's putting them at.

145
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.570
<v 1>Yeah. Um, well I got to start somewhere. I'm not going to.</v>

146
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.600
<v 0>I think the dry heat, it's like,</v>

147
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.730
that's where the studies have been done on them.

148
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:26.300
And I'm sure there's some benefits to the infrared one. But according to him,

149
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:27.134
he's not into it.

150
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.850
<v 1>Uh, like I said, I don't really do it anyway. Um, my wife and my kids,</v>

151
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.360
they like going in there, but I usually go in for a little bit and like,

152
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.180
we'll watch one episode of something and I'm like, okay, I'm done.

153
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.740
<v 0>Have you done his crazy water workouts? [inaudible].</v>

154
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.600
<v 1>No, I would never survive that. Not there's no.</v>

155
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.090
<v 0>I have a bunch of friends that have got up there and train with them and then</v>

156
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.710
they just texted me afterwards. What the?

157
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.190
<v 1>Yeah. Cause he's just not no one, no one can,</v>

158
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.660
can.

159
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.010
<v 0>Go easy. No, he's not. He there's no easy with Larry. There's only two speeds.</v>

160
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.890
I was telling you about his ankle people don't he came in here and showed me his

161
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:08.400
ankle. He has an ankle that broke that he never did anything to,

162
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.840
he never bothered getting a cast. He never bothered getting surgery. And it's,

163
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.640
it's like the root of a tree.

164
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.930
It's this up thick knee of an ankle.

165
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.820
It's so weird. And like, wow, that's next level. He's just a next level. Human.

166
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.510
Yeah.

167
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.780
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I, I respect him and admire him,</v>

168
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.250
but I don't want him to train me.

169
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.230
<v 0>Well, his workouts are so crazy.</v>

170
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:34.470
Like they take a 75 pound dumbbell and they swim with it,

171
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.390
like the whole 75 Don Dumbo.

172
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.680
And then you're swimming across the pool with one arm while holding the 75 pound

173
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.030
dumbbell while trying to pop your head up and breathe. I'm like, oh, okay. Yeah,

174
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.223
whatever.

175
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.890
<v 1>Yeah. So, uh, not, not my conditioning.</v>

176
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.300
<v 0>But I'd like to, there's a guy like that out there out for sure. I think.</v>

177
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.200
<v 1>It's important leading the.</v>

178
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.150
<v 0>Charge. Yeah. Just some maniac.</v>

179
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.680
Who's just so he's so psycho about everything.

180
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.270
The guy sends you a 250 degrees sauna that he's mad that doesn't get any higher.

181
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.360
It's just so interesting.
