00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Welcome back to civilization. Jamie kilsstein.</v>

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.833
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.880
<v 0>Dude. Um, so a lot has changed since the last time we spoke. Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.160
And, uh, for people who don't know, you used to be, uh, the host of,

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.670
or one of the co-hosts of citizen radio, like super progressive lefty podcast,

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.630
and you were a vegan, but now all Hells,

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.590
you made a stake with standhol all.

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.070
<v 1>Hell's broken loose. &lt;laugh&gt; all. I don't know what's happening.</v>

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.990
I don't know where I am. Yeah. I, I,

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.990
I remember I was thinking about like being back in the studio and, uh,

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.430
I never met Jamie before and I was like, all right,

13
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.710
everyone's being really nice to me.

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.100
I' literally feel like I'm like this isn't this isn't a trick.

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.380
Joe sent me very nice emails and I'm like, but I'm a very trickable guy. Uh,

16
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.900
and I came in and yeah, everyone's just lovely and nice. Uh,

17
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.060
yeah man, uh, a, a lot change. I went into hiding. Uh, I went into hid, hiding.

18
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.500
Well, what.

19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.260
<v 0>Happened? Because I only got like a peripheral story of like, what,</v>

20
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.210
what went sideways. All right. So like some people girls accused you of, well.

21
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.290
<v 1>Yeah, that this is, look, this is the worst time for me to be like,</v>

22
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.730
you know what, now that everyone's talking about,

23
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:13.490
Weinstein's time for killsstein to make his return&lt;laugh&gt;.

24
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.730
<v 0>Weinsteinilsstein dude, it's too similar.</v>

25
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.170
<v 1>I, I like wrotete. Yeah. It's like very like ju and predatory. Uh, when I wrote,</v>

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.560
I wrote Stan hope, uh, when the wine scene thing happened, I was like, Hey man,

27
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.680
you wanna like push off this return? He's like, you're fine. Uh, yeah.

28
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:33.560
So here's what happened. So, uh, it kind of started where I was a comic, uh,

29
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.360
for years and, you know, as it got more progressive, um, it, it,

30
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.030
it got more into thatjudgmental territory. I, where,

31
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.830
you know,

32
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.710
I feel like I definitely became one of those people who would just be on Twitter

33
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
all day. And instead of sort of talking about real issues, it just becomes like,

34
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.590
who are we mad at that day? Right. Like who used the wrong word that day?

35
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.790
Who can we get fired that day? Yeah. And it's Twitter Mo stuff.

36
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.310
And it happens on the right. And it happens on the left. Um, and it's just like,

37
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.910
kind of just people who are sad, who just live like in their box,

38
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.660
which I was like one of them. Right.

39
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.340
<v 0>That's why I think this is such an important conversation because,</v>

40
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.740
because you've kind of stepped away from it and you see it for what it is.

41
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.540
I think people don't realize it when they're caught up in the swirl of it.

42
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.820
The momentum of it, that it's almost like a natural human behavior pattern.

43
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.780
It's very tribal.

44
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.460
<v 1>Yeah. Well, it's tribal and it's, um, physically addictive.</v>

45
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.130
Yeah. Um, you know,

46
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.450
like I've like gone back and forth with like drinking and,

47
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.690
and not drinking and pot and, and not smoking pot.

48
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:34.450
And I can tell you that the thing I was addicted to the most was Twitter.

49
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.330
It was refreshing Twitter. It was like,

50
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.810
you literally get dopamine hits from that. Yeah.

51
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:43.050
Like I remember when I first tried to get off Twitter, I like,

52
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.160
I was fighting with stranger, uh, in my living room on Twitter. And I was like,

53
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:50.840
you know what, this. I'm gonna go take a walk. I don't need, uh,

54
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.960
I don't need to be involved in this guy's life. I closed it.

55
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.640
And before I even knew it, I'm like walking in the park,

56
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.000
fighting with some other guy on my phone. And I'm like, it follows you. Yeah.

57
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:01.960
Like if someone's calling you a cut,

58
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.000
they're calling you a cut at dinner with your girlfriend,

59
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.280
they're calling you a cut when you go to like, uh, your brother's graduation.

60
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.040
And you're just like refreshing it. Yeah.

61
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:13.240
Waiting for someone to tell you that you're good. Um, and sort of,

62
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.960
so that I got addicted to that, um, more than anything.

63
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:21.830
And a SP actually, when I finally got an audience, um,

64
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.950
with like the left of left, um, I mean, just to be very clear, uh,

65
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.150
it's not like I'm gonna come on this show and suddenly like,

66
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.270
do a Sean Michael's heel turn and be like, I'm Johnny rap joke, those,

67
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.990
all had it coming. Um.

68
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.110
<v 0>You're just being a person.</v>

69
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.770
<v 1>Well,</v>

70
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.260
and that's what I like isn't doing for a very long time is I feel like I don't

71
00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:43.980
wanna speak for people, but I feel like with me,

72
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.420
I always needed something to like, define me. Right, right. Where it's like,

73
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.780
I'm a progressive, or I'm a, I'm a vegan, or I'm just jujitsu and whatever I,

74
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.060
whatever I would become kind of currently obsessed with,

75
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.620
I would sort of like throw the other away and kind of like all over that. Um,

76
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.650
because you know, a lot of times I would feel like a failure.

77
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.770
Like that's really where the progressive, um, I mean,

78
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:11.370
I still hold a lot of progressive ideas, but that's when I went from comic to,

79
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.970
um, political.

80
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.970
It wasn't that I like wanted to make comedy. My,

81
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.800
my like, nemesis. Right. It was that, oh, I felt, I feel like I, I failed.

82
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.520
Um, you know, I dropped outta school to start, uh,

83
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:31.000
comedy at like 17 and I did the things you're supposed to do. Um,

84
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.760
and yeah, I did Montreal a couple times and, uh, Conan once, uh,

85
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.480
and I had this year where it seemed like things were gonna happen. And then,

86
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.350
you know, I was kind of that guy that people were like, oh, we like you,

87
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.110
we can kinda do anything with you, but we like you.

88
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.590
And so I started to kind of make my own audience and the audience was great.

89
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.430
It was like a bunch of, you know, when that show started,

90
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.950
it was a bunch of just weird, um,

91
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.870
sweet nerdy comedy fans.

92
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.380
And then everything just started getting pushed, uh, to,

93
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.980
to crazy though. Like when I knew,

94
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.020
I said this on Doug's podcast when I knew got nuts is when I was defending

95
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.380
a trans person. So already like a left issue, like I'm doing the right thing.

96
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:14.940
Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I called this transphoic guy an idiot,

97
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.540
and we get an email that said, uh, while we appreciate you using, uh,

98
00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:25.290
defending trans P people, the word idiot is ableist. And I want it to be like,

99
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.730
you're retarded, you're a retarded kind. Explain.

100
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.850
<v 0>Ableist for people. People ablelist able is making fun of people who,</v>

101
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.490
I don't know.

102
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.130
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know what it means anymore. I thought ableist was just like that.</v>

103
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:40.130
Guy's in a wheelchair. him. Right. But I guess like all these different terms,

104
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.120
these everyday terms, I guess idiot is ableist. Cuz, I don't know,

105
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:46.640
there an idiot in a wheelchair.

106
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.640
<v 0>No, no, no, no. It's ableist because if you are not an idiot,</v>

107
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.360
if your brain works well, you're mocking someone whose brain doesn't work well,

108
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:56.400
they are not able to think. Correct. Oh, okay. So you're an ableist.

109
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 1>Joe, you just outgressiveed me.</v>

110
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.400
<v 0>Well, I'm pretty progressive. I know. Better or not. I mean, I, I,</v>

111
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.120
I look like a meathead and I espouse some right wing ideas,

112
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.240
but when it comes to like social issues, I'm very.

113
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.000
<v 1>Progressive. That's why we became friends.</v>

114
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.760
You saw a gay rights thing I did on Twitter. Yeah. Like you weren't, that's why.

115
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.940
Um.

116
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.430
<v 0>But I, but I, what I saw happening, I don't mean to interrupt you. No,</v>

117
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.590
but what I saw happening with you and what I see happening just in general

118
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.990
online, you know, I mean, I was on citizens radio when you guys first started.

119
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.570
Yeah.

120
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.403
<v 1>You were on our poster.</v>

121
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.990
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

122
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.310
But I think there's something that happened where people around the time of

123
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.350
occupy wall street, things got really heated up. Yeah.

124
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.140
And people started moving way left and then some folks started moving way.

125
00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:43.500
Right. And I really truly believe to this day,

126
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.140
the way left is what started the whole Trump movement.

127
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.580
It's in response to the way left. Yeah.

128
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.060
I think all these shitheads got together and they didn't like being

129
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.930
accused of being or ableists or rapists or whatever it is by the ultra

130
00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:03.930
progressives. So they went far. Right. Yeah. And alt-right,

131
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.990
I mean, the,

132
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.850
the alt-right essentially was people who didn't identify with these old men who

133
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:11.010
were bankers &lt;laugh&gt;,

134
00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:14.690
but they also didn't want to have anything to do with these ultra lefty

135
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:18.560
progressives that were calling everyone a racist, everyone rapist,

136
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.240
every man's a piece of. Oh.

137
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.880
<v 1>I, I, I did all of that. Yeah. I straight up did all of that.</v>

138
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.560
And I think one of the things with the,

139
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.080
the ultra left and maybe this is me like, uh, you know,

140
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.080
maybe this is me desperately trying to defend myself,

141
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.360
but I think in a weird way, it was harder for me.

142
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.230
And it's harder for a lot of people to see themselves slipping into the extreme

143
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:40.070
left. And so like,

144
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:44.870
what I mean by that is I never thought when I heard people say the extreme

145
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:48.710
right. Is as, is as bad as the extreme left, I was always like, you.

146
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.030
Because like the extreme left, isn't like, you know,

147
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:54.230
bombing Palestine being like, give us free healthcare.

148
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:57.310
Or like let trans people in the right bathroom. Like, you know, uh,

149
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.060
even that like, uh, this shooter, not in Vegas, but that DC shooter,

150
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.820
like he was like a crazy guy. He wasn't, uh ableless, I'm sorry.

151
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.820
He wasn't like shooting the politicians screaming, like, you know,

152
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.580
I mean he liked the Bernie Sanders page, but it wasn't like we are launching,

153
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.860
uh, wars against Islam for, uh, Christianity. It wasn't, um,

154
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.770
you know, uh, what we're doing this for, for free market capitalism.

155
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.770
It was to me, the extreme left when I heard people say it.

156
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:28.970
And the reason I would scoff when someone like you would say it is cuz I'm like,

157
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.330
dude, like the left should just be like, stand for like equality.

158
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.370
Everyone has the right to an education. Everyone has the right, um,

159
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.050
to not go hungry, um, to have health insurance, um,

160
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.840
gay people knew whatever they want with their. Um, the,

161
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.760
and by bag and vaginas and vaginas, um.

162
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.720
<v 0>It really should be essentially like that on both sides. The, the right, what,</v>

163
00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:53.720
what being a conservative used to be was small government and people

164
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.440
having the government stay outta your lives and some, and they,

165
00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.840
the others opposite. It's morphing.

166
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.360
<v 1>Yeah, totally. Where it's like, we will stay outta your lives,</v>

167
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.800
but we will be like in your, if you want a abortion, we'll uh,

168
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.240
tell you like who's Dick, you can.

169
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.920
<v 0>Suck. Well, the abortion thing is where it gets real squirrely. Right?</v>

170
00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:12.160
Because the abortion thing is essentially, it's a religious thing.

171
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.950
And it's a, I just think it's, and it's a moral thing and it's,

172
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.870
it's also what is an abortion? I mean,

173
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.670
you are ending a life, but you're ending a life inside a woman's body. Well,

174
00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:28.270
when is it okay to do that? Is it okay to do that at one day?

175
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.270
<v 1>And does the, the grown woman's life matter more than the cells are more than.</v>

176
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.260
<v 0>Well, no, may. Yeah. That gets to a point. But initially it's like,</v>

177
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:40.260
when is it defined as a life? I mean, if, if the moment of conception,

178
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.500
if that moment, if 30 seconds later it's an abortion, right?

179
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.020
Like if you could hold your breath and then the baby's dead, you know,

180
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:49.620
like if we found out that the moment of God comes in a moment,

181
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:53.060
if she could just hold her breath for a minute, that just goes die. Yeah.

182
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.770
I mean, is that, why does that sound worse? Be murdered &lt;laugh&gt; but,

183
00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:01.730
but it is look, abortion is weird. Right' weird. And I's, I'm pro-choice. Yeah,

184
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.530
but abortion is weird because like, when you, when it gets older,

185
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.410
when you're four weeks in six weeks in and it's still legal and it's a little

186
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.210
baby, I mean, it is a little baby look, man,

187
00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:15.290
you look at it it's it looks like a little baby.

188
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.440
Some times they have a heartbeat. If it gets to a certain age. Yeah.

189
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.560
What's going on. Like I, I'm not saying that it,

190
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.920
it should be my choice to define whether or not someone should do it or not do

191
00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:29.400
it, but it's very disingenuous when people frame this argument as it's a woman's

192
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:32.760
right. To choose period. And that's what it is. It's not just that. Yeah.

193
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.623
It's also killing.

194
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.320
<v 1>A baby. I don't know, man. Feminists don't like me anymore. So I'm like coat,</v>

195
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:39.630
hang her up. I'm out of this debate. &lt;laugh&gt; I don't give a. Well, it's, it's.

196
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.330
<v 0>A, it's a,</v>

197
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.270
it should be an honest debate because it is a very controversial and a,

198
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.230
a very nuanced issue. So it's not as simple as, you know, the right.

199
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:52.190
Doesn't want a woman to choose and stay out of my body.

200
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.990
It's not just stay out of your body. It's like, what are we doing?

201
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.580
We're killing a baby. That's in a woman body at what age should.

202
00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.341
<v 1>That be legal? Well,</v>

203
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:01.980
and I think that's the whole thing that we were talking about before with these

204
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:06.780
like echo chambers where, you know, for the first time ever,

205
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.060
I've been listening to sort of like both sides of issues.

206
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.390
Um.

207
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.980
<v 0>First time ever. I mean the.</v>

208
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.060
<v 1>First time since recently. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well,</v>

209
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:19.930
because like you just Sur again, you, you, the majority of people like, yeah,

210
00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:21.490
I'll totally fess up. Sure. Right.

211
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:25.010
Like I didn't ask a lot of follow up questions because your Facebook feed is

212
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.930
curated and your, your Twitter is all of your friends and,

213
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:30.450
and for the most part people you agree with and, you know,

214
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.570
comedy was actually comedy now.

215
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.490
Like I've been listening to like a ton of like backlogs of your shows cuz once I

216
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:39.400
was just like, oh it doesn't, maybe I can listen to the show again. Great.

217
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.560
I never hated you. No, I know. I know. I never hated you. And so, uh,

218
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:46.680
but I started listening to the show and like hearing pretty equal,

219
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.281
um, you know,

220
00:11:48.281 --> 00:11:52.960
progressive to conservative ideals and comedy was always kind of this cool

221
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:57.960
place where you could explore ideas because comedy and jokes and

222
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.320
laughter would sort of take the, um, take the edge off a little bit,

223
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.800
you know what I mean? And you could actually talk about issues.

224
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.760
And once I kind of became part of that crew that would, um,

225
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.950
even on comedy, then it was like, well, I can watch democracy now.

226
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.910
And I guess that's it. Um, and I have my, and, and I would feel stupid.

227
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.950
I hung out with journalists. I didn't hang out with comics.

228
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:22.950
I hung out with people where I was sort of like,

229
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.150
felt like the joke monkey and like, um,

230
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.750
the high school dropout part of me would get really like,

231
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:29.270
what do you mean by you.

232
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.103
<v 0>Felt like the joke monkey.</v>

233
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.180
Did you feel like you had to be funny when you were around the, those.

234
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.901
<v 1>People? Yeah, because,</v>

235
00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:37.340
because when I tried to say something like political or that I thought was

236
00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:42.260
smart, it would just be kind of like, uh, uh, hushed. Cause I'm not that smart.

237
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.900
I'm not, I'm good at like telling stories. Um, I'm,

238
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.820
I'm good at like, I, I think listening and asking like decent questions, uh,

239
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.730
but I was never like a INEC. Um, and a lot of that crowd is,

240
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.250
um, and that's good. We need those people. Right. Um, but I would,

241
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.570
I, I, it, it was really easy for me to be like, just shut up,

242
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:08.690
you know what I mean? But is.

243
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.490
<v 0>This all in your mind? I mean, you, you're a human being, right. I mean,</v>

244
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:14.840
if you're just talking to these people, you're not an unintelligent person. No,

245
00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:15.121
I think so.

246
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:17.760
Is this just an insecurity that you carried around with you when you were around

247
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:18.594
them? Holy.

248
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.280
<v 1>Um, yeah, a lot. You were.</v>

249
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.520
<v 0>Venturing. The reason why I ask you this,</v>

250
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:25.160
your show was sort of in a lot of ways, venturing into the world of journalism.

251
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.000
<v 1>Oh. So that's where I was going. Uh that's right. That's where I was going,</v>

252
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.520
like sort of way back, which was, um, you know, the,

253
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.550
the show, the show's started as a comedy show. Right. Um,

254
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:40.550
it was called drunken politics before it was called citizen radio. Um,

255
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.110
I think we changed it maybe around like occupy, um,

256
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.910
but it was comedy and like we had progressive ideas.

257
00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:50.670
So that's sort of what we talked about, but it wasn't that we had to talk about,

258
00:13:50.671 --> 00:13:54.110
it became this thing where any progressive issue in the news that day or on

259
00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:58.460
Twitter, we had to, we had to talk about that day. Right. And, um,

260
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.580
it sort of lost, I don't know. Did you did it also? Sorry.

261
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.500
<v 0>Sorry. No, please. Sorry. Interrupting here. But did it also, you,</v>

262
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.940
you guys went to a, sort of a subscription service.

263
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.700
<v 1>No, we actually, uh, didn't you? No, the thing I'm really proud of, uh,</v>

264
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:17.690
about that show and, and, and why, uh, I'm definitely bummed out. I lost, um,

265
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.930
a lot of those fans or, or whatever was we, we started ages ago. We, uh,

266
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.650
we were pretty early on with podcasts and we never had commercials and we never

267
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.050
had, you didn't really get anything. If you paid, it was voluntary.

268
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.410
It was like a version of NPR where it was like, everybody gets to show for free.

269
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.520
Right. Is like us trying to be socialist. Everyone gets the show for free.

270
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.680
If you can't afford $5 a month, $10 a month, $50.

271
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.480
<v 0>Right. But a lot of people do that way. I mean, Sam Harris does that. Totally.</v>

272
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.840
Yeah.

273
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.200
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. We just didn't really have, like,</v>

274
00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:48.400
we couldn't afford to send you like a tote bag or whatever, but yeah.

275
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:51.440
So it wasn't a pay model, everything we said anybody could hear. Right. Um,

276
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:54.640
we occasionally did like little, like goofy bonus shows for like subscribers.

277
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.680
<v 0>But that was, was it that, that was the question. So some,</v>

278
00:14:56.681 --> 00:15:00.320
there was some shows that only people who subscribed could do. Yeah. Not a.

279
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.200
<v 1>Most of it. Not a lot though. Yeah. And it was five days a week too. Right.</v>

280
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:05.560
So it was a lot, that's another thing when you're doing a show,

281
00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:08.880
five days a week, you gotta dig for things to be like off about, uh,

282
00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:09.880
to not be redundant.

283
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.910
<v 0>Yeah. I've done five day a week shows and, uh,</v>

284
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.950
I don't think I'm at my best five days a week.

285
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.590
I think four days a week is where I like start to break down. Yeah.

286
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:21.950
Like anything after four days a week, unless I'm doing like fight companions,

287
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:23.430
which are just a goof, that's just hanging.

288
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.430
<v 1>Out and like watching fights. That's easy. Yeah.</v>

289
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.070
<v 0>Um, you don't want to get stale little bored.</v>

290
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.150
You don't want to force it into being a job.

291
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.380
And I think what I got outta you was that you were,

292
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.220
you were getting a lot of praise and you were, you were being hailed.

293
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.860
Like I saw Jezebel wrote something where they called you an,

294
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.220
a great example of an.

295
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.260
<v 1>Ally. Well, that was pre this yearjeabbel &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

296
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.330
<v 0>Yeah. But I mean, but that expression is a, is a very odd expression. I mean, I,</v>

297
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.890
I hate to sound like this in disingenuous egalitarian,

298
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.450
but I really do believe this. I mean, we are, we should be allies to each other.

299
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.410
We all should be, we, this idea that like, there's a team war going on. Yeah.

300
00:16:05.411 --> 00:16:08.130
And that Jamie kilseen is out there bucking for the females. Right.

301
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.290
&lt;laugh&gt; but that's what it's like, it's like, that's what they,

302
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.880
but they reward that. Yeah. See, this is the thing it's like some,

303
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.480
and this is not to single out Jezebel.

304
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:19.160
Cause I think they've got some great writers. Sure. It's, there's,

305
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.800
there's something that happens with people when you write a lot of

306
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:29.000
mean, uh, very critical stuff. And you,

307
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.600
you become this,

308
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:35.430
this attack machine and this is how you promote your ideas.

309
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:39.430
This is how you push your agenda by attacking people that some of them'em

310
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.790
deserve it. For sure. Some of themem are definitely,

311
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.910
but it becomes almost like the currency that.

312
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.390
<v 1>You deal in. Yeah. And that goes back to the insecurity, right. By the way, uh,</v>

313
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.790
my dad, well, but let me finish that. Oh.

314
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.500
<v 0>Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Is that when, when you're an attack machine like that,</v>

315
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.940
and I'm not saying that jeabil is,

316
00:16:57.941 --> 00:17:01.460
but there's a lot of the blogs that are attack machines when you're a attack

317
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:04.700
machine. And if you can be, uh,

318
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.820
an ally on the other side or not even on the other side,

319
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:10.660
but an ally to the attack machine, like, and then they single you out as that,

320
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.250
it gives you this feeling like, oh, I'm not going to get a attack act by them.

321
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.193
This is good.

322
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:20.170
And you reinforce that behavior by ramping up the types of things that you say

323
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:22.570
that they like yeah. That they appreciate.

324
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.410
And it becomes a sort of weird exchange. Yeah. Where, you know, it's like imply,

325
00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:31.170
like, I think this is what a lot of what goes on in political circles as well.

326
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.240
Like there's not as much bribery as there is an understanding that if you

327
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.880
do what we want you to do and you say what we want you to do, then you're in,

328
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.720
then you're on the good side. Yeah.

329
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.080
<v 1>And that goes back to that insecurity. And I think a lot of people, uh,</v>

330
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.920
are insecure. I know. Well, I think we're all insecure. Yeah. Everyone is.

331
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:54.240
And when you do find that tribe yes. And you do find people who are going yeah.

332
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.640
And the, the more you attack on Twitter cuz not just blogs,

333
00:17:57.641 --> 00:17:59.760
like remember like individuals on Twitter like me,

334
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.960
like when I would see like who's getting piled on today. Right. Uh, okay, cool.

335
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.320
This writer wrote something about mansplaing don't need to read the article.

336
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.950
What's a hash tag. That's the hashtag, I'm gonna say the meanest funny thing,

337
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.030
cuz I'm a comic and I'm funnier than journalists. And then, uh,

338
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:18.030
famous people are gonna retweet me or FA me.

339
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.030
And then I get to feel like a civil rights hero. Right.

340
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:24.310
Because that's what would happen where like I would literally tweet even if I

341
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:25.144
not even a joke,

342
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.950
even if I tweeted somebody sincere and this like sucks to admit, but even if I,

343
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.180
I tweeted like hashtag black lives matter, I'm refreshing that to be like,

344
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.700
dequis love, favored it. You know what I mean? Like I'm not doing it to be,

345
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.780
you know, and then you can feel good about yourself. Then you can go.

346
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.621
Not saying I did this,

347
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:43.780
but you can go on the street and you can ignore the homeless person and you can

348
00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:46.260
cross the street when you see like the scary black guy, cuz you're just like,

349
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:50.330
well I'm technically the Rosa of parks of Twitter because I did that joke. Wow.

350
00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:53.410
At that writer who said that thing that no one's gonna remember tomorrow,

351
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.170
but we were all angry about, um, today.
