00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.330
Now there's going back to what you said about seals writing books. Uh,

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.910
interestingly enough, in the first book, there's an interrogation scene,

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.110
a interrogation, uh, an interview, meaning not a, not a torture scene,

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.070
but sitting down with MCIs. So the Naval criminal investigation service,

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
and so some bad things, my career wasn't all, all wonderful. Um,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.070
like the downrange stuff, very lucky,

8
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.680
very fortunate to be in a couple of right places at the right times to do some

9
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.280
interesting things. Um, but when we got back a good buddy of mine, uh,

10
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.680
Mark Owen, he writes a book called no easy day.

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.760
And that's the one about the Binladin rate. And that one, whoa,

12
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.310
that was like a tipping point because in our community at the time there'd been

13
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.820
active valor that movie with, uh, it was seals, active duty seals,

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.570
playing characters in an actual movie. There were other books out there.

15
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:47.460
So there was already discussion happening like, Hey,

16
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:49.380
are we too much in the limelight here?

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.690
We're supposed to be these quiet professionals, but you know,

18
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.520
going back in time, I,

19
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.160
I read all these Vietnam books growing up and every autobiography I could about

20
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.710
people in the military, you know, grant has his memoirs or whatever.

21
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:00.900
So there's a precedent, not just in this country,

22
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:04.170
but worldwide of people getting out, talking about their experiences.

23
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.530
And that's part of a first person account that historians will use later.

24
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.590
So it wasn't frowned upon at all. So it, it got,

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.770
it was starting to get even more and more frowned upon, uh,

26
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.540
right up to that point. And that was the tipping point.

27
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.350
So when that book came out, that's when everyone said, or not everyone,

28
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.190
senior level leaders were like, okay, stop all stop. Um,

29
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.730
and they really well because of that book,

30
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.360
they went and invented all the investigations that happened. They went in and,

31
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.090
uh, essentially anyone that had a connection with him,

32
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.310
they pulled in and investigated as a way to put pressure on him to get what they

33
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.080
wanted. Uh, so,

34
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.250
so I was one of those guys I've known him for since 99 or something like that.

35
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.380
So we've been dear friends since that time.

36
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.170
And so we have emails going back all these years.

37
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.460
So I got pulled in to this interrogation room and they pulled out

38
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.120
single personal emails, single sentences,

39
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.740
totally out of context,

40
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.150
to try to get me for something that would put pressure on him.

41
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.280
And they did that, not just with me,

42
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:07.830
but with almost anyone that had some sort of a connection with him,

43
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.020
they investigated. Cause he's already out of the military.

44
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.660
<v 1>So things that you said totally out of context,</v>

45
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.010
like joking around about something or is just statements about things. Yeah.

46
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.430
<v 0>Just statements. Like what did you mean by what did you mean by this? Um,</v>

47
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.950
and I used that in the first novel,

48
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.740
cause I'm sitting there in this interrogation,

49
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.520
he got these guys across from you and essentially ensis air from my perspective

50
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.970
are people that, uh,

51
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.620
they couldn't make it to the FBI or the CIA and they weren't tough enough to be

52
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.454
street cops.

53
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.210
So now they're busting people on tests in the military and that sort of thing.

54
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.811
Uh,

55
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:43.020
actually my first experience with them was after September 11th and you know,

56
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:45.750
I think we're all on the same team and we're doing these ship boardings in the

57
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:49.710
Northern Arabian Gulf to enforce the UN embargo for oil tankers that are leaving

58
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.420
Iraq and then going to Iran.

59
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.840
And so our job was to take those ships down before they got to Iranian waters

60
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.080
and then the UN would take over after that.

61
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.570
But it was really interesting time cause like a cop pulling over someone and

62
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.270
you're walking up and you don't really know what's going on. And so they would,

63
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.130
uh, come out of, out of Iraq, they had all these metal over all the windows,

64
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.890
it cut off all the ladders on the ships.

65
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:14.650
So you'd have to use a caving ladder to hook and climb up and then you'd have to

66
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.790
breach and get inside these things and get them back into the Gulf before they

67
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.650
hit Iranian waters. Otherwise you have to get off.

68
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.590
So it was kind of a crazy deal, but during what,

69
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.780
and we're doing a couple of nights on a couple of nights off that sort of thing

70
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:30.400
with another platoon and then NCRs shows up and they pull us all into these

71
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:32.620
different rooms and they said, Hey, so,

72
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.450
and a and M 60 some sort of like machine gun type thing, uh, was,

73
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.050
has gone missing on one of these ships that you guys were on. And I was like,

74
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.720
oh, that's terrible. You know? Okay. Um, well, how can I help you?

75
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.070
And so we started talking and they, how, how would you get one off a ship?

76
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.100
If you wanted to steal a machine gun, a permission, how would you get it off?

77
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.670
And me, I'm just going to create it. I'm like, we're on the same team here.

78
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.820
I'm like, oh, this is what I would do.

79
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.670
I'd take it off piece by piece and whatever I said. So I gave him my,

80
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.350
and then as I was nearing the end,

81
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.720
I'm seeing it in their face and seeing the notes they're taking, I'm like,

82
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:04.540
wait a second. Are they like trying to get me to,

83
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.910
I didn't take item 60 off a ship piece by piece.

84
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.640
We were only on there for like a problem is you're an author and I'm trying to

85
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:12.970
think of all through. Yeah. And so I'm like, you're, you're being creative.

86
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.540
So even back then, I had a bad experience with them. But, uh, so what are they.

87
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.360
<v 1>Saying to you anyways, do this, they start accusing you.</v>

88
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.960
<v 0>Uh, in, in with the Marco and over there. No, they didn't accuse me,</v>

89
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:24.310
but I could tell it, things shifted it.

90
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.380
I'm getting so creative and telling them how I do it.

91
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:30.370
And I mix it in with this and we'd get it off. I get excited. Smiling. Totally.

92
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.720
Yeah. It was like, I am now, these guys are just like, anyway,

93
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.600
so I kind of figured it out near the end and I'm like, oh wow, this is not,

94
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.400
this something's not feeling quite right here.

95
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.440
Like these guys are just after a win. That's what they're,

96
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:43.150
they're just trying to get somebody that's their job.

97
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.920
And if they can get a seal even better. So after, so after Mark Owen wrote book,

98
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.750
no easy day, same thing.

99
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.770
And you saw these guys across the table, um,

100
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.740
and this is years later. So it wasn't like immediately. Um,

101
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.150
they went after some guys immediately, whatever,

102
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:01.330
but they've put all this together over a long time and following what's their

103
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.140
strength.

104
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.860
<v 1>And what do they want?</v>

105
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.160
<v 0>I think they wanted him to, uh, they wanted to build a case against him,</v>

106
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.350
a criminal case against him, for what,

107
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.670
for not submitting his book to the department of defense for review. Um.

108
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.910
<v 1>And is that so they can redact certain things that are classified.</v>

109
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.550
<v 0>Yeah. Which is why I was hypersensitive to it.</v>

110
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.770
And even the minor fiction I submitted them. Um.

111
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.060
<v 1>And that is a protocol.</v>

112
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.850
So when all those things in your book where it says redacted,

113
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.480
is that why it's redacted? Really? So it's because of the.

114
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.600
<v 0>Yep. So they may be hyper sensitive to it. Uh,</v>

115
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.020
so no other author of fiction that has the classification, the,

116
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:39.250
the security clearances that I had, no one else submits fiction, but I was so,

117
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.000
uh,

118
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.180
just tied to this because of my experience with the Mark Owen book and what they

119
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:45.850
tried to do, I was like, oh, I just want to make sure. And I said,

120
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.750
what they've taken out. Absolutely ridiculous. So the first book, uh,

121
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.170
I didn't appeal it because, uh, they took 45 days to do it,

122
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.430
which I thought was pretty good. Cause they say,

123
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:56.590
they'll take 30 and that's pretty good.

124
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:58.970
They took out nine lines or something like that, which was fine.

125
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.800
But the second one they a month goes by and two, then three, then four,

126
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.270
then five, then six.

127
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.230
And they get almost to the seven month mark when they can finally get back to

128
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:09.350
me.

129
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.010
So at this point we had to push the publication date out of April to the summer.

130
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:15.170
It's like a movie trying to figure out like when you don't want to Avengers

131
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:18.380
movies coming out at the same time from the same studio. Uh, so it,

132
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.000
so these are thought well ahead of time.

133
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.080
So it was not convenient to have to push it all the way to the end of July.

134
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:28.370
So it was a pain and every single thing in there that was blacked out,

135
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.810
my attorneys found in publicly available government documents.

136
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.860
So not just like on Wikipedia or from somebody else that wrote a book or no

137
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.930
publicly available government websites,

138
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.820
government documents that anyone on earth.

139
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:43.760
So they download done their due diligence to check if that's tough,

140
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:46.700
had actually been released already publicly. My lawyers did. Yeah.

141
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.590
But the people that they know,

142
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.020
the people you submit it to at the department of defense,

143
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.830
they just have this black pan and they're just taking things out.

144
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.650
And then they see, oh, CIA, we'll send it off to the CIA,

145
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.230
even though I don't work for the CIA, but they send it off.

146
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:03.320
And then that starts at the CIA clock looking at it. It's just, it's ridiculous.

147
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.160
And this is not something you had to do it by precedent. No,

148
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.910
because it's fiction because it's fiction by precedent. Now,

149
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.340
like we talked about those laws earlier three felonies a day,

150
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.690
the laws are written.

151
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:18.350
If you look at them very broadly so that the government can interpret them the

152
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:21.830
way they want to. And that didn't always used to be the case. Um, uh,

153
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.080
if you go back 50 years, uh,

154
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:27.650
the idea was you had to write a law that the average guy could understand.

155
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.870
In one, when you looked at it one time, read it,

156
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.590
it's evident what that law means. Not anymore. The language involved,

157
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:37.430
how long they are, uh, how tough they are to decipher, uh,

158
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.850
even for attorneys to decipher. Uh, so it's,

159
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.410
it's written in a way that they can come after anyone they want for anything,

160
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.820
which is by design. And they used it to go after Mark Owen.

161
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.780
They used it even though that's nonfiction, uh, you know, maybe he should have,

162
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.830
he went to an attorney that had experience in this space, which you would do.

163
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.300
Who's the best attorney for this? Oh,

164
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.230
the guy that did a book called kill bin Laden with someone from Delta force, uh,

165
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:07.310
that guy has experience, I'll go to him. So he went to that lawyer who said, no,

166
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:08.330
you don't need to submit this.

167
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.230
So there's lawsuits and all sorts of stuff that are associated with that. But,

168
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.430
uh, for me, what they did, this is years later, his second book,

169
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.980
he sends it to me. So I'm getting ready to get out of the military. Uh,

170
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.080
he sends me a second book and says, Hey, what do you think of this?

171
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.190
And so I read it and uh, you know, read it quick.

172
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.820
And then I sent him like one note that said, Hey, awesome. Uh,

173
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.290
maybe in the first part in the preface,

174
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.780
maybe talk about your experience over the last couple of years with the first

175
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:35.180
book and what the government did to you and how you reacted.

176
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.730
Just people would probably interest in that. So I wrote that.

177
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.200
So now I'm in an interrogation room with these NCS guys and that's one of the

178
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:43.550
things that they pull out and said,

179
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:47.870
so why are you editing classified material that hasn't been approved?

180
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.490
But like, I don't know, guy, this guy's a good friend,

181
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:54.020
sends me the sends me the thing. I look at it.

182
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:56.610
So what they wanted was to just put pressure on him and said, Hey,

183
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.240
we're going to go after your buddy. Uh, if you don't do this for us, um,

184
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.210
which was totally to say, so what did they want from him?

185
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.060
I think they wanted him to admit he was guilty. Uh,

186
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:10.200
and they also wanted a statement of not of not submitting it to the department

187
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:13.620
of defense office of pre-publication and security review, not going through,

188
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.040
they want to make an example of him so that anybody else getting out would know

189
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:17.851
that they had to do that.

190
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.690
And I don't think it work is there's plenty of books out there that a nonfiction

191
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:24.330
that have not been through that process. Right. Um, but, uh,

192
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.220
that's what they wanted from him. They wanted all the money from it,

193
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.700
which was a significant money. Yup. And interestingly enough,

194
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.350
all the money and he was always going to give it all.

195
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.360
That's the other part of this is so interesting is because I've known him for so

196
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:37.830
long. He was always going to give it all away.

197
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.520
And he had no reason to tell me that, you know, year before the whatever,

198
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:42.660
however long it was before,

199
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:44.850
like he wasn't setting this up as some criminal mastermind,

200
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.860
but he was always gonna give it away to a seal foundation.

201
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.310
And when the book came out, it all went into a bank account.

202
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.580
But guess what came out of the bank account, lawyer fees after that.

203
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:56.640
So he still had all the money except for the lawyer fees.

204
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.070
And then they still go after you for taxes that you're supposed to be anyway,

205
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.550
it's the government. So, uh, so they wanted that money.

206
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.890
Anything money going forward? Like if they made a movie from it,

207
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.220
all those proceeds, they just wanted to crush them and make an example of him.

208
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:11.430
So other people would submit or make people think about not,

209
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.250
not even writing anything anyway, how did it all end up?

210
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.080
So it's a lawsuit with the attorney that gave him bad advice.

211
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.170
I'm not sure exactly where that is. Uh,

212
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.170
and then all the money went back to the government that was in the account and

213
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:27.600
he's paying off the rest of it that went through attorney fees.

214
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.420
So he didn't make anything. No. Wow. One penny,

215
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.400
all the money went to the government, all the money,

216
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:33.900
went to the government plus taxes.

217
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.080
<v 1>So double money. So,</v>

218
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.250
so all the money goes to the government because he lost. Is that the idea?

219
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.113
<v 0>Yeah, because,</v>

220
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.180
because they finally put enough pressure on where the lawyers do their thing and

221
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.380
they figure out a settlement of some sort, and that was the settlement.

222
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.940
<v 1>All the money. Wow. And his second book, the same.</v>

223
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.480
<v 0>Deal. Uh, no that one went through the process, uh, went through the, uh,</v>

224
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.590
but after I read it, so he sent it to me before he sent it in. Um, but you know,

225
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:02.820
there's nothing, I don't know, but you read it and that's what they,

226
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:03.220
that's what they,

227
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.820
one of the things they use to try to get him to do what they wanted. So,

228
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:08.310
and that, wasn't the only one. There's all, everybody that knew him got,

229
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.720
got pulled into this thing. And, uh, but point being is that,

230
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:17.340
had that not happened then that an interrogation scene in my novel

231
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.130
where James Reese sits down after what happens to his team,

232
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.180
sits down with those guys across the table. And I changed it to Afghanistan,

233
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.530
changed it from San Diego to Afghanistan.

234
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.440
But that's how I felt about the guy sitting across the table from me.

235
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.020
So it feels real because I wasn't just like, Hey,

236
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.370
have you run into an interrogation room?

237
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.040
Or I'm arrested in a couple of cops shows where they have somebody in an

238
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:35.611
interrogation room,

239
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:37.650
I'll just kind of write what that looks like or feels like no,

240
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.500
that's what it feels like to be in there. Having these eyes on you,

241
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:43.530
having them tell you that there's no cameras on when you know that there are,

242
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.720
uh, and all, all that sort of thing.

243
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:48.330
So I got to put all that together and make the book what it is.

244
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.710
So without that happening,

245
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.590
without them trying to go after me to put pressure on him, uh,

246
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.990
and everyone associated with that, uh,

247
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:59.350
the first book would not be nearly as good, like the combat stuff. Yeah.

248
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.190
It's different. But the other stuff, the conspiracy side of the house, uh,

249
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.580
and the NCS guys and that interrogation in particular and some of the bad guys

250
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.130
that's, once again, you can't kill people in real life, but you know what,

251
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:10.930
you can't, you can't in fiction. Uh,

252
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.290
and so it made it so much better than it would have been otherwise.

253
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.580
So now looking back and I thank him to this day, I'm like, you know,

254
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.410
that first book that resonated with Simon Schuster, for some reason,

255
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.290
and a lot of it's what happened down range and those feelings and emotions.

256
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.900
But a lot of it is because of what happened with, uh,

257
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.150
with you as I was getting out. That's interesting.
