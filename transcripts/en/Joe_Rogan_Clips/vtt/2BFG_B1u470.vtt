<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.390
<v 2>When you're training athletes for jujitsu.</v>

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.840
And one of the interesting things about the Gordon Ryan conversation that I had

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:13.950
recently, I didn't know that you are Gary Tonin striking coach as well,

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.630
which is pretty amazing that you can do both,

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.260
that you can train them in both jujitsu and also train them in striking.

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:23.940
And I know you have a background in striking,

8
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:27.960
but still when you're training an athlete like Gary,

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.670
um, if you're training someone like Gordon for jujitsu,

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.880
I'm sure there's some emphasis on take downs,

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
but it's not a primary concern. The primary concern is submissions, right?

12
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:44.550
Like the, oftentimes we'll see, um, Gordon will sit, pull guard,

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.300
all these things that are not, uh, possible in MMA,

14
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:50.460
or very rarely what,

15
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.050
how much of a shift is it to train them for mixed martial arts?

16
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:58.530
Because you're clearly training him to strike and training him straight,

17
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:00.030
but ultimately this,

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.680
the skill set the best part of their skillset involves in submission.

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.030
<v 1>Correct. Um,</v>

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.080
the big challenge for most jujitsu players,

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.520
when they try to apply their craft and mixed martial arts is

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.280
one, can they get it to the ground?

23
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.760
That's a challenge in itself and an even greater challenges.

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.420
Can you keep it on the ground? Okay. It means nothing. If you take someone down,

25
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.000
if they just spring back out within three to five seconds,

26
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.470
it's it's energies spent it had no reward. Um,

27
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.270
a sad thing about jujitsu is that when it's practiced,

28
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.920
there's almost always a kind of gentleman's agreement that there's going to be a

29
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:44.850
top player and a bottom player. And if you start in the bottom,

30
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
you stay in the bottom. The moment you get into a mixed martial arts context,

31
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.360
that goes right out the window, and now you have two responsibilities.

32
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.600
You don't just have to pass your opponents gone from top position.

33
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.950
You have to hold them down while you're doing it. And that's, that's not easy.

34
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.590
Um, when you look at the notion of escape in jujitsu,

35
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.970
the overwhelming majority of escapes in the sport of jujitsu,

36
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.500
our escapes to God position. If you're mounted you elbow scape,

37
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.820
you put them back in God. If the guy's got side pin on you, your elbow escape,

38
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.180
put them back in God. If the guys behind you, you do a forward roll,

39
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:28.950
spin back into them, put them back and got 90% of the escapes in jujitsu,

40
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.750
our escapes back to God position.

41
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.530
And so when you start in bottom position,

42
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:36.990
you tend to stay in Portland position.

43
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.450
Now contrast that with the sport of wrestling,

44
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.940
where the overwhelming majority of escapes are escapes to standing back up to a

45
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.290
mutual position on your feet.

46
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.770
That means that when jujitsu players face other forms of grappling,

47
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.230
they're not trying to put us back in God.

48
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.720
They're trying to stand up and you do supplies,

49
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.760
never practice against when they're doing their daily training.

50
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.320
And so suddenly you've got a guy who just assumes for his entire career,

51
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.270
that if he's on top, the other, guy's going to play God,

52
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.670
and this guy's not playing God at all. He's just pushing your head,

53
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.790
stand it up and hit my up to his feet. Legitimacy guys.

54
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.940
I w I had taught position. Why did you play in God?

55
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.370
And so they're now put into an area where nothing in their training

56
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:25.570
has really prepared them for this. And jujitsu's going to have to mature.

57
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.550
I've always said you'd at,

58
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.220
Sue's one of the greatest products I ever saw in my life.

59
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.020
I wouldn't have invested 30 years of my life and to Jesus,

60
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:37.210
if I didn't believe that with all my heart and all my soul,

61
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.150
but like any great product,

62
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:44.710
it has its deficiencies jujitsu always had three major

63
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:49.000
deficiencies leg logs take downs.

64
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.553
And thirdly,

65
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.090
the one that no one talks about the ability to impose top position,

66
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.260
once it's gained

67
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.200
a huge part of my career has been the recognition

68
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.060
and the attempt to change these three great faults in jujitsu.

69
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.190
As much as I loved you to Sue,

70
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.920
we've got to take a step back and take an honest look at it.

71
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.880
It's got these three deeply entwined faults within it.

72
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.380
Leg was the most obvious one and a game,

73
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.950
which was supposedly all about control. Leading to submission.

74
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.800
There was an arbitrary rule at 50% of the body couldn't be attacked.

75
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.750
That was lunacy. And over the last 10 years, I believe it's fair to say,

76
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.060
we've reached a point where that is no longer the case.

77
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:38.950
That that is a great weakness within Judah.

78
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.660
So the younger generation of jujitsu,

79
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.690
I would match them against any grappling out in the world on lake logs with

80
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.830
no fear whatsoever that I couldn't have said that 15 years ago,

81
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.110
but things have changed.

82
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.750
Now we need to address you have the two great weaknesses.

83
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.350
Jujitsu has to do something about the crisis,

84
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:02.770
which is starting to emerge around takedowns and the ability to impose top

85
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.604
position.

86
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.120
What you're seeing among jiu-jitsu athletes now who go into mixed martial arts

87
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.880
is they just have to turn to other arts. They have to learn wrestling.

88
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.280
They have to learn these, and there's nothing wrong with that.

89
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.590
But the truth is that you did,

90
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.330
Sue has become a relative smaller and smaller component of mixed martial arts

91
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.640
rather than what it was when it first started,

92
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:25.660
which was a dominant force in mixed martial arts. Now for most of the athletes,

93
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.840
jujitsu is something you learn to stay out of some pesky submission holes.

94
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.310
It's not the be all end focus for most of the athletes in mixed martial arts.

95
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.110
Most of them are centered around kickboxing skills and race line. Um,

96
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.080
I think that we have done a great job of overcoming one out of

97
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:46.360
three great problems in jujitsu,

98
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.120
but there's still two more to go.
