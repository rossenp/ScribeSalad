00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.890
<v 0>There's places that have good white pizza.</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.940
I didn't experience good white pizza until I had it at a Nicky's in white

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.290
Plains. Roche's pizzeria and white plastic right down the street,

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.910
right down the street from executive billiards.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.520
They had white pizza that will knock your Dick right in the dirt.

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.790
It had melted butter and garlic on it and, and ham and.

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.990
And you'd bite and be like, yeah. That's why a lot of Italians were in white,

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.250
white Plains. I mean, Hey,

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.440
this is not my favorite now it's white castle is white castle still around,

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
remember white castle, small burgers. Yeah. 41,

11
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:35.790
bro. They make a vegan white cow. Yeah.

12
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.221
[inaudible] I'm pretty sure.

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.670
White castle for all the friends to make a vegan burger.

14
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:47.910
Now white castle does, which is time, which is like,

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
that's literally like a, buy-in a vitamin from a poison factory.

16
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.790
That's a bad idea. Vitamins too. Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.310
If you're vegan and like you're buying vegan burgers,

18
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.870
soy from a company that does millions of animals a

19
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:11.490
year. That's impossible burger, impossible burger. You feel better. Well,

20
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.420
how about taco bell?

21
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.010
Taco bell puts essentially sand it well sodium by

22
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:21.330
carbonate, bro. No Silicon by carbon, I think called Silgan.

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.110
So they're they're they're they're beef filling.

24
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:27.450
They're not allowed to call it beef filling.

25
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:30.000
They have to call it taco filling because it's not beef.

26
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.860
That beef has silicone in it to make it fuller and more. Um,

27
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.270
look it up that. That is delicious. Look up.

28
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.350
What's in taco bell.

29
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.350
<v 1>How would you, how would you doubt that? Why do you,</v>

30
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.800
how would you need evidence for that? It's taco bell taco.

31
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.290
<v 0>That's a conspiracy theory, dude. A double Decker taco. I don't give a,</v>

32
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.920
dude, bro. There's no.

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.270
<v 1>YouTube. It's not real.</v>

34
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.940
<v 0>Where'd you hear this wash from silica, dark silica.</v>

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.280
<v 1>Brian, I believe you were talking about taco bell.</v>

36
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.390
<v 0>It's not in there. Isolated Oak products, chili pepper, onion powder,</v>

37
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.740
Silicon dioxide, anti caking agent. Now look that up.

38
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.840
So carbon dioxide agent, how about you guys?

39
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.673
<v 1>Love tacos.</v>

40
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.000
<v 0>Go guys. What does it say? Anti caking nature to avoid clumping and supplements.</v>

41
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.030
It's used to prevent various powdered ingredients from sticking together.

42
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.990
As many food additives,

43
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:35.880
consumers have often often have concerns about Silicon dioxide

44
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:37.440
as an additive. Is it safe?

45
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.480
Is this cancer that sand see that they put in there also frequently found in

46
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.020
health food, nutritional supplements as an additive cells, Silicon dioxide,

47
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.420
primarily functions as an antiquing agent,

48
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:50.520
which prevents ingredients from binding together.

49
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.990
But it doesn't say if it's cancerous,

50
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.060
you'd do it every now and then [inaudible] look at this proven carcinogen.

51
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.970
Well, who sat in McDonald's answer that's in their buns.

52
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.940
So Silicon dioxide is a proven carcinogen wives.

53
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:07.420
McDonald's opt to use this in buns, potentially hurting human health.

54
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.540
Silicon is categorized as a trace mineral then,

55
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.920
which means that it's needed in minimal amounts to maintain health. As,

56
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.870
as his requirement is very small.

57
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:21.220
It's recommended daily allowance for Silicon has not been specified cause it's

58
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:22.630
not food. Duh.

59
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.920
However experts suggested a daily consumption in the range of 20 to 30

60
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.840
milligrams is needed to stay healthy.

61
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.830
<v 1>Does that McDonald's chase</v>

62
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.860
[inaudible].

63
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.030
<v 0>I guess it is just a trace mineral maybe, but maybe it is. Yeah. It's important.</v>

64
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.860
<v 1>To Donald's is sailing for sure.</v>

65
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.910
<v 0>But you know, it has, you know, but here's the thing.</v>

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
If they can't really say all this, if it's not true, if they do,

67
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:53.554
they get in deep.

68
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.090
So it might be real that Silicon is a trace mineral.

69
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:59.350
It's an important part of our own feed,

70
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.130
but it also you're putting dirt in your burgers pro food, food grade.

71
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:07.450
So maybe it's different. So it's like, why is it in there though?

72
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.890
Even if you you're saying

73
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.630
[inaudible] Can't have it. Cranky can have K filler man, 36%.

74
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.710
<v 2>Beef. Oh.</v>

75
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.340
<v 0>It's only 36% beef. And talk to them about 64%.</v>

76
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.370
<v 2>Is a wide range of fillers that cocoa powder.</v>

77
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.810
<v 0>36% Beef, 64% is made with fillers.</v>

78
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.210
Don't we all know this and preserve it.

79
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.450
<v 2>This is a hundred percent beef.</v>

80
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.450
<v 0>You killed you really think it was 64%.</v>

81
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.140
<v 2>When I eat them, I'm like, listen, man, this isn't going to be good.</v>

82
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.170
I'm going to, my pants, but I love their toast. Yeah.

83
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.160
<v 1>Have you heard that conspiracy theory that McDonald's, you know,</v>

84
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.850
it's a hundred percent beef that that's an actual trademark name,

85
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.300
a hundred percent beef. Is that for real or it's not.

86
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.980
<v 0>I don't think they can say that. I mean they can get sued. No, no, no.</v>

87
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.590
It was like, it was like, it's like.

88
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.630
<v 1>A slave, their beef they're called a hundred percent. So they named.</v>

89
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.500
<v 0>A hundred percent.</v>

90
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.180
<v 2>Beef even though it's 40%.</v>

91
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.020
<v 1>Right. That's the conspiracy theory. So I don't know if that food is.</v>

92
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.290
<v 0>She does some is McDonald's the same as taco bell in terms of like what</v>

93
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.470
percentage of it is actually beef. If you just look up their chicken,

94
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.690
the one thing that's really weird about that,

95
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.100
the one thing that's up about the beef that you get in hamburger from the cows

96
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.480
is those cows can come from 10 different parts of the globe.

97
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.670
So you're eating the, the cows from China, Argentina, United States, who can,

98
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.533
all those cows.

99
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.453
<v 1>Killed there.</v>

100
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.750
<v 0>They all been killed. Then it's brought together.</v>

101
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:44.290
So it's all smushed to like one cow, bro. I don't give a.

102
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.800
My burger has come from ice to know cows name. I have to do this.

103
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.690
<v 2>I'll tell you though.</v>

104
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.480
I think the healthy healthiest thing for you at McDonald's.

105
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.393
<v 0>Is to make it true.</v>

106
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.500
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fish is made from real fish.</v>

107
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.900
The Lego fish is awesome. Have you had a McRib? Those are real ribs. You know,

108
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.920
they take me to present real. They take me as a rip.

109
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.540
<v 0>Let's read the McDonald's McDonald things. Not true. I love it.</v>

110
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.500
Make that larger, please. I want a fish sandwich, Eddie. Well smaller again.

111
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.840
So it fits the screen. There you go. Why? This is a fascinating premise.

112
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.140
There is nothing to at McDonald's hamburger patties in the U S are made with a

113
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.960
hundred percent us da inspected beef.

114
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.620
They're cooked to prepare with salt pepper and nothing else. No preservatives,

115
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.240
no fillers debunked.

116
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.610
<v 1>So it's pretty healthy debunked.</v>

117
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.840
<v 0>How's that possible?</v>

118
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.470
<v 1>Say what is the top of that site? What is the title of it?</v>

119
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.680
Are McDonald's hamburgers? A hundred percent beef dude. Why does it taco bell?

120
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:40.640
Get on that train.

121
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.990
<v 0>Nah, it. They're like, it. We just go, bro. You know it's for you. Yeah.</v>

122
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.610
They're way worse than McDonald's then.

123
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.330
<v 1>Yeah. McDonald's buys their meat from a company called a hundred percent beef.</v>

124
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.233
That's not true.

125
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.510
<v 0>That's not true. That's.</v>

126
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.180
<v 1>What it says. Oh that's the conspiracy theory.</v>

127
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.380
<v 0>Yeah. The whole thing it's false. So it is look man,</v>

128
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.520
you could probably get beef pretty cheap if you do it that way and just grind it

129
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:07.670
all down. I still like Del taco.

130
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.540
So all that stuff is so gross. But if you go to a real taco spot

131
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.170
[inaudible].

132
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.190
<v 1>I love McDonald's.</v>

133
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.550
<v 0>Up. I will up an egg McMuffin will up</v>

134
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.130
[inaudible].

135
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.640
<v 1>Sausage.</v>

136
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.420
<v 0>McGriddle. I think it's an egg that's. Here's the thing.</v>

137
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:30.950
If you get egg McMuffin with ham, they really can't with that. If you get,

138
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.730
you get that sausage, who knows what's in that sun. But if you get that.

139
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.453
<v 1>How about the bread.</v>

140
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.680
<v 0>Curious? No, the eggs actually lately they, they make their, what?</v>

141
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.190
The egg McDonald's said that they would the mouth chickens and eggs they use.

142
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:50.180
Now. They don't have, I think they don't use antibiotics. Beaks, look at it.

143
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.320
The tinny eggs that are freshly cracked in McDonald's restaurants,

144
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.090
that's impress the chains, egg items,

145
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:58.640
such as scrambled eggs and egg whites are made from liquid eggs.

146
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.540
But so that's what you go where you go with the regular chicken or you go with

147
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:05.690
the regular egg McMuffins who doesn't get egg on their egg. Me I'll fit.

148
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.360
I'm going to just get the sausage Patty. Well the sausage patties,

149
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.130
you don't know what you're getting with. That tastes good. Doug bacon,

150
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.930
those sauces. They have scientists and they're working on tastes for real.

151
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:18.764
They do a good job.

152
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.570
<v 1>The bread soaked in syrup. What about that? You're talking about the McGriddle.</v>

153
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.460
<v 0>Come on. The McGriddle. It's brilliant candy. It's brilliant. It's candy was.</v>

154
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.440
<v 1>Handy. Having a very good.</v>

155
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.630
<v 0>Very good. I like it. I feel good when I eat it.</v>

156
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.910
<v 1>What does play a fish filet of fish? I love, I never had one.</v>

157
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:40.330

well all these like little cheeseburger spots,

204
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.370
how come you can't have a sausage with peppers in Hoboken,

205
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:44.820
New Jersey in the nineties, all Italian. You'd go into those delis.

206
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.910
And they'd had the water mozzarella. They're making them the back.

207
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:51.600
They'd make the mozzarella and they put that on a, an Italian sub.

208
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.820
Oh my what's baking the bread right there. Send Janeiro's aerospace.

209
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.690
Yeah. Yeah. That's a little, little, they always have these big sausage vendors.

210
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.500
Just giant grill sausages, laid out.

211
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:07.720
You're walking by and you get one and immediately

212
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.560
[inaudible] busting your mouse. Oh my God.

213
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.550
The bread bread is just got this density to it. And you're like, holy.

214
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.060
<v 1>You guys ever with the kitchen sink cookie. What's that?</v>

215
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.680
The kitchen sink cookie, all ingredients are in the cookie at Panera bread.

216
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.910
Every pair, they got a cookie called the kitchen sink. It's five bucks, dude.

217
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.270
This is a good deal. We usually with chocolate chip cookies.

218
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.790
I don't with the oatmeal or cinnamon cookie.

219
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:39.880
It's gotta be a good chocolate chip cookie, maybe some peanut butter in there,

220
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:45.010
but kitchen sink has everything and it's addicting as. You gotta be high,

221
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:46.900
right? No, no, no, no. You know what?

222
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.190
There was a Panera Panera bread next to Chipola.

223
00:12:49.191 --> 00:12:53.140
So I go to Chipotle and go get the salad. No, no burrito.

224
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:54.760
I'm going with the south site clean.

225
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.780
I clean it Chipotle and then the Panera bread's right next door. And I'm like,

226
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.500
should I just walk to my car and just get in and drive the away?

227
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.490
Or am I going to go next door and this all up and get a kitchen sink.

228
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.170
So I've always had this struggle.

229
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:11.290
I go to Chipola and I'm eating like an Olympian at Chipotle.

230
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.680
And then I walk out and sometimes they get in my car and just burn rubber and

231
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:18.760
I'm out. But it's, it's been, uh, a problem of mine. But luckily,

232
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.080
luckily, luckily I struggle with these same seriously. I was,

233
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.120
I had a salad. No, that's not it. I had a salad and I walked out and I was,

234
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.730
you know, I was on the fence of whether I should get a kitchen sink and I said,

235
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.180
it. I'm going to get it. And I walk next door and the place closed down.

236
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.650
I'll probably be like, holy, legit. Totally. I feel good now,

237
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.900
now there's I don't, I don't have a choice to leave.
