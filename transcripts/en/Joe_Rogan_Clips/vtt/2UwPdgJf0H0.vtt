1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's a great time in the sport though.</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.600
There's so much exciting, so many exciting, possible matchups.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; are you, uh,

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:12.200
what do you pump for like when you look at the, the, like the, the UFC,

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.560
the straws? Yeah. All everything.

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.520
<v 1>Or just everyone. Well, the straws.</v>

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.080
<v 0>You have to be paying attention to the title fight. Yeah. Yeah. Next.</v>

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.310
<v 1>Month rather. Yeah. No, I'm definitely paying attention to that. Um,</v>

9
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.230
were you surprised.

10
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.870
<v 0>When you watched Whaley and, uh, Jessica, Dr.</v>

11
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.470
<v 1>Not really. Like, um, the thing is like, I,</v>

12
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.470
I was catching and Dr. When she would run in and it wasn't

13
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.030
until the third round that I decided to, uh,

14
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.380
use elbows and I I'm pretty sure I dropped there third round and

15
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.540
she popped right back up. But like ever since then, I noticed that like,

16
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.180
she would get hit, like she would get hit and rock, like in the,

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.620
in the TA's fight, like Tisha isn't known for having like knockout power,

18
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.740
crazy hands, but she dropped her like a good, like two or three times in the,

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.210
in the TA's fight. Um, so I could see that chin was getting touched.

20
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.450
<v 0>Well, you remember the Yoani and J check fight. She just,</v>

21
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.890
she ate a load of shots in.

22
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.370
<v 1>That fight. Yeah. But it didn't look like she was getting wobbled no, as much.</v>

23
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.450
No. Um, but maybe she did because like,

24
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.250
when she came back and fought Tisha,

25
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.040
she was like going like wobbly leg, like every now and then,

26
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.040
then like, eventually she closed the distance and took her down, but it's like,

27
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:32.320
she sacrifices her chin to get that distance. Right. You know, and like,

28
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.720
same thing with the rose fight, she was getting picked apart the entire time,

29
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.480
sacrificing her head to get in and get the throw or whatever.

30
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.470
And then finally, like you, you know, gave out on her in the way Lee fight.

31
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.390
Yeah. So I wasn't like super surprised. I wa I was, I, I mean,

32
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.270
everyone was surprised, so I won't say that,

33
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.870
but I did see that coming eventually. Like, I'm like,

34
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.310
eventually someone's gonna put her out just because it's not just a person's

35
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:01.350
power that she's fighting,

36
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.580
but it's her pressures so aggressive and she's coming in so hard.

37
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.500
So it's like her force versus the other person's punch when they connect,

38
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.220
like she's knocking herself out essentially. Yeah. So, um, so yeah,

39
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.740
like I wasn't super surprised. And like, that was, that was what my,

40
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.340
what I thought would happen when I fought her. Like, I,

41
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.490
I didn't go into that fight thinking, oh man, this is gonna suck. You know,

42
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.570
I was like, dude, I can catch her.

43
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.210
Like she drops her hands when she comes forward, like my,

44
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.090
I can strike going backwards. Like I know I'm gonna catch her. And like,

45
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.490
I can put her out because of the way she strikes.

46
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.090
So I've always seen that her hands were a bit sloppy,

47
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.530
even though she's super aggressive.

48
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.320
And the fact that she's so aggressive gives her that much success. Like you,

49
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.680
you can't ignore the fact that she's punching you as much as she is,

50
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.840
but it's still like very offensive and like

51
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:58.640
with zero defensive mind. So, you know, so yeah.

52
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.360
I wasn't like super surprised when someone finally did drop her, but,

53
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.920
you know, I, I hadn't really seen that much of a Whaleys Ang. So,

54
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.320
so I was surprised that she was able to get the title that, that fast.

55
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 0>Have you ever seen her strength and conditioning routine that she does? No, I.</v>

56
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.960
<v 1>Haven't for.</v>

57
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.950
<v 0>Goes hard. Yeah. She goes hard. It's pretty wild. It's pretty wild to watch.</v>

58
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.950
It's very inspiring.

59
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.830
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; how do you feel like she matches up with Yoanna cuz that,

60
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:27.270
that fights real that's real soon.

61
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.070
<v 1>Um, I, I think it's gonna be, uh, I think it's gonna be an even match. I think,</v>

62
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.030
uh, she has a lot of output. I think she isn't afraid to go to the ground.

63
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.860
Um, I saw that and when she fought Tisha, um,

64
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.060
they had like a lot of crazy scrambles.

65
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.700
She had good reverses for like Tisha's take down attempts and stuff and um,

66
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.180
and yeah, just think it's gonna be like,

67
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.900
she's gonna force Yoanna to move and to react more than most people.

68
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.050
I think like, as long as she's like, I haven't really seen, I haven't really,

69
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.890
um, paid attention to like how much head movement she has,

70
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.290
but I do know that she just throws a lot of volume and wherever the fight goes,

71
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.770
she seems comfortable. So I've never seen her in a spot where she looks like,

72
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.770
oh, what do I do here? You know,

73
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:19.890
like you see people freaking out against the cage or freaking out when they get

74
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:22.160
to taken down and she seems to flow.

75
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.120
She has that athletic flow through everything. So yeah,

76
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.680
that's the one thing I think she has, uh, going for.

77
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.400
But I do think Johan's reach is what's made her so dominant.

78
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.920
She's a big old girl, like, uh, watching her fight and draw.

79
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.190
There was a moment where like she's pushing and draw up against the cage and she

80
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:44.630
looks like a big old, like praying Manti. &lt;laugh&gt; like, you know,

81
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.590
like just like bit someone's head off, like,

82
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.230
and drag looks like this little thing.

83
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.390
So like she's a big girl with a really long reach,

84
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.870
really long legs and everything. So I think I'm kind.

85
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.750
<v 0>Of surprised to see her back at one 15 cuz.</v>

86
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.390
<v 1>She really dude I was too well.</v>

87
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.500
I was gonna try to like fill in in that last minute. Uh, I don't know if you,

88
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.260
you heard, but it like kinda, uh, upped my like,

89
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.300
I don't know, like props or whatever when she was about to fight Michelle,

90
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.860
there were rumors that she wasn't gonna make weight.

91
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.010
And so people were scrambling and then my manager, well, uh,

92
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.650
yeah, I think I could talk about that.

93
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.330
My manager &lt;laugh&gt; hopefully fingers crossed my manager, got the call, like,

94
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.530
Hey, um, Hey man, I'm, I'm just worried about this Yoanna fight.

95
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.130
And my manager was like, whoa, I bet Angela would take it. If,

96
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.130
if you guys wanted a fight and he was like, seriously and he is like, yeah,

97
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.600
she's crazy. I was there cornering, uh, my, uh, my teammate,

98
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.640
Lauren Mueller at the time. So I was there chilling. Uh, where were we Atlanta?

99
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.720
I think maybe I forget where it was. It might have been Atlanta,

100
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.640
but I was there chilling, cornering my friend and um,

101
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.160
and then my manager calls and he is like, Hey.

102
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.240
And it was like that time of the night that, you know,

103
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:08.080
it's a fight offer &lt;laugh&gt; so he was like, Hey, what time is that?

104
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:11.640
What time is it was like, it was like maybe 11 ish or something.

105
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.320
So weird's going on? Yeah, it was like 11:00 PM. And I was like, who?

106
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.950
And he like, he's like, would you fight Yana at 1 25?

107
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.310
And I was like. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;. And I was like,

108
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.310
I was probably walking about 1 25 at the moment. Like, and if they,

109
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.470
I think we were talking back or he was talking back and forth and he was like,

110
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:35.390
well, what about Michelle at one 15?

111
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.380
He just wanted to know just so we can relay the message. I was like, yeah,

112
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.740
just let me know. So I can like cut weight or not cut weight, you know?

113
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.420
So I was sitting,

114
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:48.820
waiting for waiting for the call and then the rumors got like blasted and then

115
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.140
people knew my name was in it for some reason. I was just like, who is talking?

116
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.890
You know? But like it went viral and I was, and I just leaned into, it was like,

117
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.010
Hey, anytime, any place let's go. And I waited, waited and then yeah,

118
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:04.810
nothing happened. Yana made wait. I was like, &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

119
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.010
<v 0>I heard that she wasn't making wait.</v>

120
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.170
<v 1>Either. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone was talking about it.</v>

121
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.210
And then somehow somebody knew that my name was in the mix,

122
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.210
like Angela Hill might fill in for Michelle and instead

123
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:18.360
of fill in for Yana, like,

124
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.440
because she was like the name that was that they were promoting for the

125
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:27.640
fight, so right. So they wanted the former champ to get her fight.

126
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.480
So they were like, all right. If it comes down to it,

127
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:34.520
Angela will fighter at 1 25 5. Yeah. So I was pretty stoked. I mean,

128
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800
I felt like, uh,

129
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.470
Yoanna does a lot of things and it's similar with my matchup that I have now

130
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:45.790
only she's a lot bigger. Yoanna does a lot of things that I've seen a lot of,

131
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.710
you know, in training, just like in my, in my first years of Moai,

132
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.110
like she has a very conventional style when it comes to

133
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.870
Moai. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, she's just very good at it.

134
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.140
So a fight with Yona is always something that I've wanted to have. Uh,

135
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:05.100
just because I felt like it, it would be something that I've seen before.

136
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:08.820
It would be like, I'm not gonna be, you know,

137
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.340
I'm not gonna be afraid of the clench, you know,

138
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:13.780
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; which she's really good at.

139
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.940
I'm not gonna be afraid of the clench.

140
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.260
I'm not gonna be afraid of when an elbow's gonna come because of elbow sparred,

141
00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:22.490
like entire fight career. So it's like, it's like,

142
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:27.010
things that I see with her are less scary than a fight with someone that she's

143
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:31.170
beat before, like Andra or, or, uh, GA Delia or someone like that.

144
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.410
So we're gonna learn.

145
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.250
<v 0>About her a lot, this coming fight, like what she's got left. Yeah. You know,</v>

146
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:40.600
because that the transition 25 didn't really work out like shifts Chanco was

147
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:41.880
just a little too much for her.

148
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.520
Shechen had already beat her outside the UFC and beat her again. And then it,

149
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.400
she just didn't look like she had the firepower to keep her off her at 1 25

150
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.600
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then, so she goes down to 15 again,

151
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.320
but we know how hard it was for her to make 15 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's one

152
00:08:57.321 --> 00:09:00.880
of the things that they had said her camp had said about her chin when, um,

153
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.560
when she fought rose, like she just couldn't take a shot. Mm.

154
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.840
It was because she was so depleted. Yeah. Yeah. So we'll find out,

155
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.120
cause whale hits hard. Yeah.

156
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.320
<v 1>Yeah. And she's like, I don't know the Yonas so determined.</v>

157
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:15.670
Like I feel like she'd kills self to make weight. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

158
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.870
you know, like she's just.

159
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.750
<v 0>That kinda fight's career though. Yeah. You know, the long combat sports career,</v>

160
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.230
when you know, and at a certain point in time, you gotta wonder like,

161
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.190
when that catches up to you or, you know,

162
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:29.390
one of the things that she was saying that she was in a real bad relationship

163
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.710
and there was a giant distraction and now she's done with that.

164
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.910
And that was a contributing factor to a lot of her lost.

165
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.060
So we're gonna find out because, you know, when you go back to like,

166
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:41.460
when she fought Jessica Panay, she was the scariest woman alive. Mm-hmm like,

167
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.420
she was ferocious. Yeah.

168
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.180
When she was the champ and she was lighting everybody on fire,

169
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.820
she was terrifying. Yeah. She was so aggressive. And so technical. Yeah.

170
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:51.654
She got that long.

171
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.620
<v 1>Jab. She also had, uh,</v>

172
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.010
a lot of fighters who aren't that technically sound sure and striking or at

173
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:01.370
least not confident what they're striking. Yeah. You know,

174
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.810
so when she did fight someone who was good, who could,

175
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.570
who was actually a better striker than her and rose,

176
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.170
like the fact that just the fact that rose could move laterally, you know,

177
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.600
like Yana was always like a back and forth fighter because that's like style of

178
00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:21.440
very Mo Thai and rose, just moving to the side every now and then,

179
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.040
or having head movement. I think that really her up. And like,

180
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.960
it's hard when you, when you fight someone like that for the first time,

181
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.480
or even spar someone like that for the first time you can't find them, you know,

182
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.240
all your punches, miss you gas out,

183
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.830
you freaking out because you're missing your punches. Then you're getting nerd.

184
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.790
And it it's like a lot to deal with for a straightforward Mo Mo fighter.

185
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.310
So.
