00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 1>Quick question, before I go, because this is coming up in the next time we meet,</v>

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
I want to ask you about what you think the vaccine are you taking it.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.150
<v 0>I'll take it. If it works. If I feel that the doctors, uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.220
have all gotten their opinions behind it and they think, you know what it is,

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.980
it's like an MRN, a vaccine, this new vaccine,

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.690
it makes your body think that it doesn't introduce actual COVID into your system

8
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:30.441
and you fight it off.

9
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:33.470
It makes your body think that it's COVID and your body builds the proper

10
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:36.680
proteins to fight it off. A guy explained it to us yesterday.

11
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:39.500
Nicholas Christakis he's from Yale. Um.

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.440
<v 2>He's a good man. He, uh, he thinks that be boy.</v>

13
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.720
<v 0>He's a great man. And I won't want you to disparage.</v>

14
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.130
<v 2>Your mind. No, I'm not disparaging.</v>

15
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.910
He's like he's a certain is so it beat him up. He was soybean. He's a doctor.

16
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.930
Okay.

17
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.760
<v 0>Anyway, he, uh, he thinks the vaccine will be, uh, very effective. And,</v>

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.460
uh, even if you, if it doesn't keep you from getting it,

19
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.270
it'll prevent or hopefully prevent you from getting a bad case of it.

20
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.270
I don't know though. So I'm scared.

21
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.560
<v 1>Would you, would you,</v>

22
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.700
would you need just the consensus of a body of doctors you trust.

23
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.510
<v 0>And people's experiences because people have already taken it until people have</v>

24
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:20.510
taken it, like, what is the experience? And they say that they, you know, had,

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.670
uh, they felt like for a few days. That's it now? Is that true?

26
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.510
I mean, who are they? Have you talked to them? What's a few days.

27
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:31.280
And what do you mean by feel like? Like,

28
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.580
did you try running four days later and you still felt terrible? Like.

29
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.750
<v 1>So it apparently they're distributing this vaccine almost now. Right?</v>

30
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.153
I don't think it's true.

31
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.750
<v 0>Totally ready, but it very soon we'll be ready. And uh, if it's effective,</v>

32
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:46.130
they're gonna encourage people to take it.

33
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.060
<v 2>But then they say they're going to have it for like doctors and like essential</v>

34
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:50.894
people.

35
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.870
<v 0>First. And then, um, it's going to probably people that are high risk, like, Oh.</v>

36
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.220
<v 2>Yeah. But the thing is, it's going to have people have a sense of like,</v>

37
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:01.730
there is something that could be done now. Like it's a sense of hope.

38
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.240
It's a sense of progress. It's a sense of like, you know, we,

39
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.120
it was at one time when we didn't even have a thought of a vaccine.

40
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.630
Now we got competitors and on people to think different.

41
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.780
<v 0>Uh, listen, if it works, we should take it just,</v>

42
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.770
but I know how people get real nervous.

43
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.310
<v 2>Black people don't with vaccines. I told you that son,</v>

44
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.100
how do you feel about that? Black people don't with no vaccines today?

45
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.761
<v 1>Well, I mean,</v>

46
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:27.350
I feel like it's inconclusive because your caveat was I take it if I felt

47
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.410
safe about it. Yeah. That's just, just the thing.

48
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.150
Don't you feel like that same way. Of course. But so now, you know,

49
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.380
for the first time we're learning,

50
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:40.460
we're learning how it drug the process of a drug, you know,

51
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.370
going through trials, but learning this literally as a nation,

52
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.020
we're all watching this thing. Take place,

53
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.600
accelerated version of it and accelerated version.

54
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.680
<v 0>Cause usually a vaccine takes multiple years to develop. Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.940
So this is a really quick to be able to have something this quick and turn it

56
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.400
around and fix it.

57
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.090
<v 1>Where they find a cure by the end. And you're like, Oh, that's. They doing it.</v>

58
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.000
Well, not a cure, but a vaccine. That's a big deal.

59
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.620
<v 0>It's the good thing is if another one comes around,</v>

60
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.430
they're going to be more prepared to do something like this quicker, right?

61
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.140
Like I think people needed to really understand that in our lifetime,

62
00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:20.160
something can kill the world's economy and kill hundreds of thousands of people

63
00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:23.250
here and a million people worldwide. I think everybody, I don't think we,

64
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.990
I think we knew it, but I don't think we really expected it. Right.

65
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.103
They knew it.

66
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.010
<v 1>The Obama administration had prepared for precisely that eventuality.</v>

67
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.090
But I mean, of course we couldn't wrap my mind around.

68
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.560
<v 0>Even if they told you, even if you watch bill Gates,</v>

69
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:39.720
speech and Ted talk in 2015,

70
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.310
you would never internalize it and think there's, there's a pandemic coming.

71
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.090
Now we know by now we know there is now the, the,

72
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.720
the we're going to want to invest in the, the,

73
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.490
the medical infrastructure to make sure that they prepare better. Next time.

74
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.380
This is, hopefully people are going to learn from that.

75
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.120
<v 2>Oh yeah. 100% people, no glasses, nothing. Nothing is going to be new.</v>

76
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.700
There's nothing going to be new about it. No.

77
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.950
<v 1>Well, the debate is, is largely philosophical, right? I mean, to, to this end,</v>

78
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.260
there's two schools of thought,

79
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.920
one school of thought is just going to be what it's going to be.

80
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.570
And you got to keep moving, like why close anything?

81
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.880
And the other school of thought, which I thought was, you know,

82
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.530
it's more than just a philosophy. It was, it was a science, right?

83
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.520
They remember the premise when they locked us up was we have to wait to catch up

84
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:30.900
to our medical infrastructure.

85
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.880
So we don't overburden our medical infrastructure.

86
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:36.270
We got to suppress the disease till we can build up the infrastructure.

87
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.090
And they gave us an early estimate of two weeks.

88
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.360
This is how comedian does when a comedian is doing a real long send. He goes,

89
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:45.330
one more thing before I go. And then he does it four or five times.

90
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.460
And he realized that was a, guy's going do another hour. Oh yeah.

91
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:52.350
That's so rude because that's what the pandemic,

92
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.070
the quarantine felt like two more weeks, three more weeks.

93
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.070
Maybe we'll open bars and you know, that kind of.

94
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.140
<v 2>But there's no way to control it other than create it yourself. Right.</v>

95
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.760
What do you mean? Like the, the whole vibe of the, the scene.

96
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.610
<v 1>Right? The vibe of which scene depends on.</v>

97
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.050
<v 2>You said, how do we get used to it? What can we do about it?</v>

98
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.590
<v 0>He's also saying here's the thing we'd never signed up to let people tell us</v>

99
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:23.520
that we can and can't take risks or go to work. And by saying that,

100
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:26.910
if you do it, you can to kill other people. That's what changed the game. Right?

101
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.940
And so everybody has to figure out how much of that they're willing to accept

102
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.340
and how much of that are they not?

103
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.150
And whether or not they're willing to take a shot, um, take this, uh,

104
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.580
this vaccine without, you know,

105
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.390
knowing the longterm effects of it or worrying about the long-term effects of

106
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:45.870
it. And some people are naturally averse to taking any kind of medication.

107
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:47.460
They don't want to do it. And other people are like,

108
00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:51.960
if you tell me it's good and all the doctors agree and then it'll help mankind.

109
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.260
I'll do it. That's how I feel.

110
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.630
If I listen polio, okay, doesn't exist anymore.

111
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:02.530
Smallpox doesn't exist anymore. At least not in the numbers of it used to be.

112
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.290
Right. But that's because of vaccines.

113
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:10.940
Like the idea that vaccines have done bad things only,

114
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:12.740
or that they're dangerous. Only it's crazy.

115
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.040
Like vaccines are the responsible for the giant vaccine.

116
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.320
<v 1>At the core that says you just trust. Do you trust these sources?</v>

117
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.810
And people realize that they're at the mercy.

118
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.530
That was someone that they don't necessarily trust. Right? That's the,

119
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.430
that's the right.

120
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.740
<v 0>Well maybe, maybe that's the problem.</v>

121
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.020
<v 1>Faced and don't go outside. I'll tell you when to come out. Love of renown liar.</v>

122
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.330
Yeah. Right. Tough one. That was a tough one. It, especially here,

123
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.380
it goes, something really touches something really. So in the core of,

124
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.640
in Americans' identity, like you said, how can you tell me to do this? Yeah.

125
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.100
It's crazy, man. This was a tough one here.

126
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.330
<v 0>It's a weird one. It makes us redefine what it is to be a person.</v>

127
00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.760
Like if all of a sudden you have other people that got elected into a position

128
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:02.290
of power, that's all they did.

129
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.640
They won a popularity contest and they're dictating whether things go this way

130
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:09.970
or that way. And they don't necessarily have the right answer.

131
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.380
They just have their own answer.

132
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.760
And Dallas is doing a different that this town and, you know, Washington,

133
00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:18.880
state's doing it different than the Vada. Everyone's doing a different,

134
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.830
but everybody's trying to do it also. Yeah.

135
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.540
But governors can tell you what you can and can't do. It gets real weird.

136
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.690
And I get it. They're trying to keep the hospital numbers down,

137
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.530
but you told us it was going to be two weeks.

138
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.610
Like you guys said two weeks, and now here we are like nine months later.

139
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:38.980
And everyone's just waiting for only for a vaccine.

140
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.970
<v 1>And I'm not speaking about, you know, the it's right. If it's wrong,</v>

141
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.940
not speaking about it like that, I'm just saying whatever it was.

142
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.080
That was very difficult. Yeah. That was very difficult. Very difficult.

143
00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:54.400
You know, I was fine, but not knowing when you can work,

144
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.330
not being removed around, not being able to see my mother, you know, you,

145
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:02.200
you would never thought if someone had told me 11 months ago,

146
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.640
even the night before they,

147
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.430
the last night we went to where we were in Milwaukee. Yes.

148
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.010
It was perhaps the last show,

149
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.560
but it was the last night between shows. Right? It's the two show night, uh,

150
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.730
and the energy had changed.

151
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.500
It went from festive to like people look worried when I got off stage and Tom

152
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.500
Hanks had had it, the one NBA guy who would touch everything and had it.

153
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.890
And then the horn starts bringing it. They're going to shut the country down.

154
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.720
I literally go, that's impossible. That's shut.

155
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.190
We're going to shut down the world. Isn't possible. This is about,

156
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.140
this is what I thought, my initial reaction.

157
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.540
But the energy changed now, I go out and do the second show. And immediately,

158
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.520
I wasn't even think about this earlier at night.

159
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.990
I come out on stage and everybody raise your hand. Hey, I thought about it.

160
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.470
Okay. I start shaking people's hands. Oh, worried. But yeah.

161
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.840
But the day before wouldn't have even been concerned about it,

162
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.540
went into the agreement for 40 minutes and talked to people.

163
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.290
Who've been glued to the television, watching the news. And then they,

164
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.830
they scared the out of me. My behavior changed almost instantly.

165
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.720
It was interesting. I want to get too heavy. I mean,

166
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:14.070
I'm only hanging out with no, man.

167
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.960
<v 0>It's not too heavy. That's exactly how I felt about it too.</v>

168
00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:19.970
I remember I shook a dude's hand on a flight.

169
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.190
I was flying to Vegas for the fight.

170
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.770
So it was like one of the last fights before they shut it down. And uh,

171
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.530
some dude goes, I don't know, you want to shake hands? I go,

172
00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:29.720
I'll shake your hand. And we shook hands. He had a mask on already.

173
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.960
And I was like, wow, he was ready to go down. He was,

174
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.480
I think this was the very beginning of March.

175
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.231
<v 2>This was the first,</v>

176
00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:41.000
the first time I would have been tested in any capacity was when I did just show

177
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:45.290
that time. That was the first time I had an antibody test or anything.

178
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.910
<v 0>I would have never expected that here we would be deep into November.</v>

179
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.130
And we're all still kind of.

180
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.760
<v 1>When this started, he lived in LA. He had no plans to come here.</v>

181
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.670
<v 2>Yeah. You didn't text him your whole life.</v>

182
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.540
<v 1>What's interesting about this time. This is another thing we should talk about.</v>

183
00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:06.950
Next time we come, is that the in mass,

184
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.930
it feels like we're rewriting our social contracts. You know, the whole thing.

185
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.240
And COVID is an accelerant on this process that I could

186
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.280
have never imagined. Yeah. You know,

187
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.900
they're locked inside, man. People are stuck in our house with their choices.

188
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.830
Do you like your house? Do you like who you're with? Do you like these things?

189
00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:33.440
You've accumulated. I hope you like them because you stuck with them.

190
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.160
I made great choices. I liked my choices. You know,

191
00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:38.630
when I was faced with it like that, I was like,

192
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.850
I had it much better than many people. But imagine people doing that in mass,

193
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.290
it's pretty powerful. It's pretty powerful. What is this dude with society?

194
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.350
This type of isolation and, and.

195
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.840
<v 0>And almost forced reflection. Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.980
<v 1>Which is not necessarily a bad thing. And.</v>

197
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.220
<v 0>We've always talked about how life is a rat race, right?</v>

198
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.310
People get just because he's stuck in this rat race, it feels never ending.

199
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.390
It's not good that all these people lost their jobs.

200
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.700
It's not good that all these people are going to lose where they live,

201
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.160
but it might help.

202
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.090
Some people recognize that if you just keep going in this rat race, it just,

203
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:19.190
it never ends. You got to figure out a way out.

204
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.100
And now is a better time to figure out a way out than ever,

205
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.310
because you kind of have to, you kind of have to,

206
00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:28.670
and society as it existed 10 months ago, it's not the same place.

207
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.000
<v 1>What's the country. That is a country.</v>

208
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.330
Maybe somewhere in South Pacific or something that measures the,

209
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.160
their successes and nations with what they call their gross national happiness.

210
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.990
Just a totally different premise. What countries are, I can't remember. Maybe,

211
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.920
maybe you'd Google gross. National happiness, Jennifer. Thanks fingers.

212
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.240
There it is. Blue towel. You go, this is a real, this is a real principle.

213
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.630
It's a philosophy guys. The government thinks about this.

214
00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:03.670
This is a philosophy that guides our government of Bhutan and includes an index,

215
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.160
which is used to measure the collective happiness.

216
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.800
This is the metric that they use to define it.

217
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.140
<v 0>If they try that in America, they turn into an app and it would up everything.</v>

218
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.800
Oh my God, people would just be striving to win the points on the app.

219
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.750
It would make people insane.

220
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.060
They'd get addicted to trying to be a better person.

221
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.240
<v 1>This is, this is the vast thing. This is a vastly better metric. I'm not,</v>

222
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.860
you know, communist, none of that.

223
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.960
But I think that I know too many people who are very wealthy,

224
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.870
who have what I consider a poor quality of life.

225
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.450
Just because like you say, the wealth is the point. Yeah.

226
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.130
They chased it. They chased it.

227
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.560
<v 0>And they didn't have any friends. Right? You're very.</v>

228
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.650
<v 1>Welcome. We are hunting. You love your dog.</v>

229
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.020
Your dog hangs out with you like school. We do.

230
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.940
Your kids likely get kids like you, you you're living in adventure of a life.

231
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.090
Now you're doing the same thing you're doing in LA in a totally different city

232
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.510
jazz because you're following that knowing feeling, I gotta be free.

233
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.180
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

234
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.330
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

235
00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:14.760
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

236
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:18.450
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

237
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.470
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

238
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.270
That's all we're asking. Go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.

239
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:31.680
<v 3>Okay.</v>
