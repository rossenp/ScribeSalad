00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. It's also when someone,</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.730
when someone has a S a continuous message, it's always the same.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.420
And it's always positive. It makes me really suspect.

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.720
Cause I'm like this self-help guy on the Metallica documentary who was offering

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.590
the lyrics. That's the best movie ever made, probably about music.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.860
It's like it beats spinal tap. It's like, if there was a competition,

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.140
I have to come down on some kind of monster. It made me actually like the,

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.930
I mean, it made me as a fan, appreciate those guys in a weird way.

9
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.363
Their dysfunction,

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.710
like they became characters one time. I'll watch the movie and be like,

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.820
oh man, like Lars is so annoying, then I'll watch it again. Like,

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.870
like I'll still think Lars is annoying, but like, I still think he's right.

13
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.700
Or I have a different view every time I watch it. But ultimately I do. I am.

14
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.010
I just, I ended up liking those guys because of it more.

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.940
<v 1>He stepped out in a big way with that Napster thing. It was,</v>

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.890
it was an odd moment for everyone because everyone was trying to figure out what

17
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.470
is this file sharing thing. How's it going to fit?

18
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:10.020
And then the music business you guys felt at first,

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.810
like you guys were the big hit more than anything,

20
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.830
because it's not the same to watch a movie on your TV.

21
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.290
Even if you can download the illegal movie,

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.910
I'm sure it'll have a little bit of a hit,

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.600
but people want to go to the movie theater, but with your, they can,

24
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:28.950
once it starts, people start sharing things, you get just, you just get a file.

25
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.910
And everybody kind of just assumed that. Well, I mean,

26
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:36.900
this is like this new frontier and it's not really stealing.

27
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.870
You're just copying. It's just, you're not giving them money for it,

28
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.980
but you're not really stealing.

29
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.430
Get this weird sort of enlarge was the first guy to say, Hey,

30
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.440
you you're stealing like this. But it was a weird fight to have because it's,

31
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.510
you know, hindsight is always 2020.

32
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.570
We know what the internet has become since then.

33
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:59.130
It's incredibly difficult to try to keep a wrap on things and to keep things,

34
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.790
uh, to keep someone from downloading things like they just get there.

35
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.240
So if you have songs, they get out there. You know,

36
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.480
whereas that Napster thing was the first time this was happening.

37
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:10.950
And he was the guy who is as a really,

38
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:14.700
really wealthy guy who was a huge success saying,

39
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.940
don't do this. Like this is stealing.

40
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.120
<v 0>Well, yeah. It's like David versus Goliath type of thing. I mean,</v>

41
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:23.520
clearly people shouldn't steal, but

42
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.000
is it Metallica's job to tell people that maybe, but maybe he,

43
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.070
maybe they should have gone directly to Napster or to their record label.

44
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.810
But I, you know, when streaming first started becoming like a real thing,

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.360
we had to talk with a friend of ours who basically encouraged us to look at it

46
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:46.470
and not do it.

47
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.800
And I went into with our manager went when I'm talking to someone at Warner

48
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.140
brothers and said, we didn't want to do it. And they were like,

49
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.520
kind of outraged. And like, you can't not do it. You can't not do. And, um,

50
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.190
I didn't really know at the time,

51
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.260
but I found out a couple of months later that they, they,

52
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.690
I found out a couple of months later because I, I,

53
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.820
I w I was quoted in rolling stone talking about like Sean Parker and Spotify.

54
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.043
And it,

55
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.930
what happened is I ended up getting a phone call or an email from di from

56
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.970
Daniel, the owner of Spotify.

57
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.490
And we had lunch together and he's cool guy. He's a nice, nice guy,

58
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:29.110
very intelligent. And I, and I really saw his side of it for the first time.

59
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.530
And he basically, without explaining it directly was like,

60
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.900
you know, that he's paying our label to get our music,

61
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.600
what they do with the money he can't control.

62
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.240
He's not really like that at that moment, I realized, oh yeah,

63
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.340
there's some stock being floated to these companies,

64
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.820
which there was billions of dollars of stock was sent in.

65
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:51.910
The label has no obligation to give you. They gave us, they gave us,

66
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.690
they gave us like a couple hundred thousand dollars of it, uh,

67
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.790
out of the billion because they paid it to us in the way the label does was they

68
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:03.490
paid it as an artist royalty and it took all these deductions off of it.

69
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.460
And it was a made up number. It's, it's,

70
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.760
there's a lot of money in the music industry right now that, you know,

71
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.500
and the problem is, is that it's like not like, okay,

72
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.760
so my, my favorite bands for the most part don't have hit songs.

73
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.810
They don't get played on K rock.

74
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.600
They don't have like a mock arena type on there.

75
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.460
That's going to be coming their way. I mean, and that,

76
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.830
and that's what pays money is like they,

77
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:30.670
cause they treat almost every stream the same. It's like, there's a different,

78
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.610
there's a royalty rate for if you pay for Spotify.

79
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.640
And there's a royalty rate for if you're listening on the free service,

80
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.500
but what they need to do in my opinion is they need to say this guy

81
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.980
is a Joe listens to music. He has good taste in music. He, he, he,

82
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.380
he follows 500 bands,

83
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:50.770
which means that there's no possible way that he's going to be listening to all

84
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.980
500 of those bands in a, in even a six month period of time.

85
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.070
But when he does choose to listen to a song,

86
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.040
it it's worth like X,

87
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.590
like 10 X versus this person.

88
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:05.170
Who's listening to old town road a thousand times a day

89
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.890
because Joe is like actually engaging with our thing and not just streaming the

90
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.570
song for free and like a monkey, like, you know, like a Pavlov,

91
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.530
you know, whatever mouth salivating, every time they hear the little,

92
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.350
little old town road, wherever I was,

93
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:25.950
I look at my Spotify thing and I'll go months. I,

94
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.610
and I have all I pay for all of them. I have like YouTube, apple, whatever.

95
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.120
I don't have title, but that's because they didn't, they,

96
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:36.040
they gave ownership to like 12 artists and they were like, you,

97
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.370
what the is that? Just keep the ownership and pay a higher royalty.

98
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:44.080
You cocksuckers. You know what I mean? Honestly. So I'm like,

99
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.330
so anyway, I look at my Spotify. I listened to like,

100
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.700
I was like a hundred songs a month. It's barely anything.

101
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.810
And I'm like the way to really do this, it's fair is you take my 10 dollars,

102
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.930
right. And listen to a hundred songs. That's it?

103
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.210
Because I've got so many ways to listen to music that you listen,

104
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.140
you take that 10 songs and you give every buddy

105
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.900
10 cents, but that's not the way they do it. They're like we pay 0.0 0, 0 5, 6,

106
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:13.850
7 cents per stream. How could you know what you paid for stream? If you're,

107
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.280
if you're a distribution service, do you see what I'm saying?

108
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.670
I'm giving you $10 and you're going to take 30% off the top.

109
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.770
Like apple music used to do when you would buy a CD.

110
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.950
And then you take seven bucks and throw it towards the artists.

111
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.820
That would make sense to me. But they don't. They're like they're paying,

112
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.850
they're keeping all this cash or they're keeping it in a pile.

113
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.270
And then at the end of the day, they're just satiating. Like, you know,

114
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.330
Rhianna's hundred million dollar check she gets every year.

115
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.360
You know what I mean? I know a lot of artists who, who just,

116
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.770
they get checks for like $2 and 50 cents for a whole year on a record that

117
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.020
normally would sell like five or 6,000 copies.

118
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.160
But there's no ne like you have to basically be an idiot to buy a CD

119
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.650
nowadays, you know,

120
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.540
because it's a digital file that you ultimately could download

121
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.850
from Spotify under your phone and have it with you forever. Yeah. You know,

122
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.710
unless you don't have the internet, you know,

123
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:09.620
if you're in Alaska or in North Dakota, maybe you need to have a CD.

124
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.680
<v 1>So, so few people are printing CDs.</v>

125
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.460
Then it boils down to how much of an infrastructure do you need as an artist?

126
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.000
Who, who D how many people do you need to be representing you? What,

127
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.610
how does your stuff get out there? Doesn't it? Does it get, I mean,

128
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:26.390
especially with you guys, doesn't it just get out there because I mean,

129
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:29.930
I've just found out about you guys. Cause somebody tweeted it. I got like, oh,

130
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.823
who are these guys?

131
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.450
<v 0>I'm not worried about us, man. I it's like the new bands coming out, new bands,</v>

132
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:39.050
trying to break it. And that's what I'm worried about. Yeah. It's like,

133
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.290
we're fine. Um, but it bums me out because me.

134
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.460
<v 1>For anybody in the business,</v>

135
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.640
how much of an infrastructure do you need in this digital time? Well,

136
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.930
you just need someone to figure out how to.

137
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.010
<v 0>I think, I think in a way it's like when we first started,</v>

138
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.420
our first record deal was with a small label,

139
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.870
not far from where we are here and the deal was this, give us 12 songs,

140
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.220
pay for the recording yourself, we'll master it,

141
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:07.850
which is the final process of making a record that costs a couple hundred bucks.

142
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.610
And we'll send you 50 albums and we'll give you like 12% of the money we make.

143
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.230
That was it. And I'll end there. We're going to have a $500 marketing budget.

144
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.070
That was, that was the, that was the deal. You know what I mean?

145
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.400
So we basically, I mean, we made this record and paid for it ourselves.

146
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.380
And we went on tour. Um, with this agent named Ralph Carerra, booked us a tour.

147
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:34.130
And I kind of a mercenary agent. Who'd like booked. He booked the label,

148
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:36.170
I think, paid him a couple hundred bucks to book us this tour.

149
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.400
And it all kind of started steamrolling. You know what I mean?

150
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.700
But we had no infrastructure. We had no management, we had no agent,

151
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:46.310
we had nothing. We just kind of got an advanced started going.

152
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.090
And I think in a lot of ways, nothing has changed. Except for that.

153
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.690
When we got to the second level, you know, the set like it,

154
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.060
there was a couple thousand dollars there for us to make a record.

155
00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:01.380
There was opening slots that, you know, touring was a little bit different than,

156
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.450
um,

157
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.290
but I think we've always kind of done it in a way that was pretty DIY and the

158
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.330
way it's the same way it has to function. Now,

159
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.390
the only difference is there's fewer record labels that are going to sit there

160
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:17.010
and give you $15,000 to make a record and maybe give you 10 grand to help you

161
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.710
buy a van. And that's the hardest step that's,

162
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:23.670
that's the threshold where things bands are having a hard time getting through,

163
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.400
you know, once you get through there, then it's like,

164
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.220
then you get to where we were for years, which is you're,

165
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.330
you're on a bigger label.

166
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.820
You're making records and no one's paying attention to you.

167
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.470
And the only reason why we ended up getting attention paid to us,

168
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:41.100
I think by Warner brothers was for our wreck,

169
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.100
our six record brothers. Um,

170
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.160
uh, it was a kind of a heavy time. I just turned 30. Dan just turned 30.

171
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:52.950
And you know, when you turn 30, it feels like you've gotten old.

172
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.350
You know what I mean? And like,

173
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.850
especially in the rock and roll business and we had this good, this record,

174
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.570
I thought was great. And I went into,

175
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.320
went to talk to Lee or Colin with our manager as well.

176
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.710
There was this, one of the guys heads of Warner brothers. And I, and I was like,

177
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.430
we're, we're like, we're the most sinked band on Warner brothers,

178
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.690
which is when you get a song on a TV show or movie or a commercial,

179
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.000
or that there's no other band for the last two years,

180
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.610
this had as many sinks as we have had, but we've never,

181
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.880
I've don't even know who works the radio department at Warner brothers.

182
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:31.010
And we've been on your label for like four or five years and Lee or basically

183
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.760
was like, oh, that, oh. He prioritized us like that week.

184
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.240
And for the first time was like, we're going to work on your band.

185
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.520
And when that happened, that's when the Lollapalooza that's when radio K rock,

186
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.740
everything changed. I mean,

187
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:49.230
it took us six albums and it took us all those sinks, all that.

188
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.380
I'm getting called sellouts all the time for awhile, for Gavin,

189
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.200
our songs calling, uh,

190
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.790
the same dudes that were at our first shows with their arms crossed.

191
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.750
<v 1>It's a funny one. You still doing the same music stupid to say music.</v>

192
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.990
<v 0>I mean, it's, it's, I think that for different, I think it's,</v>

193
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.240
I think that for this type of thing, it comes from that idea that like, uh,

194
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.880
maybe like, oh, that band, like there,

195
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.850
I liked the better when it was at my secret, my friends and I see her.

196
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.130
I don't want to share it with this dude. That's why, like,

197
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:25.710
it's dangerous to have your song in certain things.

198
00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:29.400
Like if your song comes on in Walgreens, you better watch out, man.

199
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.230
Like that's a red flag.

200
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.580
Cause we've had opportunities to have our songs sent to like top 40 radio.

201
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.210
And, um, there was this thing where like, we,

202
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:42.480
if we won record of the year for lonely boy Warner brothers was going to service

203
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:45.270
that song to top 40. It would have never, probably been a hit.

204
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.830
But if we would have won that Grammy,

205
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.250
it could have our whole band up. I've seen it happen with lots of bands.

206
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:58.390
Like you just kind of, it just like you become like play school level.

207
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.420
<v 1>Yeah. But do you really think that you guys would change? Just,</v>

208
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.493
I think you've got it.

209
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.930
<v 0>It's not that we would have changed, but the thing is,</v>

210
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:06.760
is like you start accessing, like

211
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.570
you start accessing, you started, you started acquiring a fan base.

212
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:17.710
That's more fickle and maybe more annoying, you know what I mean?

213
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.280
It's like, okay, I got Chicago. Like I bet you as a Cubs fan,

214
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.750
like a Chicago Cubs fan in 2017 was like, this world series.

215
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.810
Yeah. Every wearing a Cubs hat. Do you know what I'm saying? Yes. And,

216
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.800
and I know exactly what that would feel like that there's probably the same

217
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:38.080
thing. It's like, if someone's going in there to get like,

218
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.090
someone's going to get shaving cream and this band that used to play it,

219
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.950
like the KA Casbar in San Diego is playing while they're checking out.

220
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.440
Like, they're probably like, this.

221
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.410
<v 1>This. Listen, if you guys put out the same music that you put out in that time,</v>

222
00:12:56.411 --> 00:13:01.000
period, it wouldn't have mattered. Your music is, uh, it's.

223
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.570
It is it's you guys, you know? I mean,

224
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:09.280
it's not it's even though you've gone experimental and you've done different

225
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.720
styles of songs and some of them feel more bluesy,

226
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:16.600
some of them feel more, right. It's like, it's still black keys.

227
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.780
If you guys just did that, it wouldn't matter what you were on. Nobody gives a.
