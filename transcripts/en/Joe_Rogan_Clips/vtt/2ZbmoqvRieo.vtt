00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.880
<v 1>Experience a recent CNN article. That was, uh,</v>

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.200
wondering how long it's been around. They were saying, see if you can find this,

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.020
um,

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.680
was COVID 19 around in humans longer than is currently believed.

6
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.200
They think it might have existed for months.

7
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:21.030
If not years before it broke loose and became a pandemic. Oh.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.630
<v 0>Did it mutate? Because it.</v>

9
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.510
<v 1>I don't know. I didn't read the article. So what.</v>

10
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.750
<v 0>It's a video, not an.</v>

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.630
<v 1>Article. Oh, it's not. Yeah. Oh.</v>

12
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.230
<v 0>Let me see if I, you say CNN, is that what you said? CNN.</v>

13
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.030
<v 1>Fake news. Yeah. Fake news. You heard me. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.350
<v 0>Where'd you learn that CNN. There's still just the library.</v>

15
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.990
<v 1>The news folks. It's the news.</v>

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.300
Leading scientists tell CNN that it's listen. CNN's trying to do their best,

17
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.260
but they, they have perception that other people don't agree with.

18
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:51.580
Just like everybody else. Leading scientists tell CNN that it's possible.

19
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.860
The virus didn't just come from baths in the past months,

20
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.900
but it may have existed in humans many months,

21
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.580
even years before it grew into a deadlytamp pandemic.

22
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.300
CNN's Nick poton Walsh reports.

23
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.210
<v 0>By the way, CNN is not doing a good job. I just, I, I think the entire.</v>

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.930
<v 1>What are they doing? Bad.</v>

25
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.090
<v 0>The incentive like they're,</v>

26
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.050
they're choking out the investigative deep

27
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:20.090
investigative journalism. It's it's exactly what you just said. The,

28
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.880
the click bait, like, like look at the title. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; look at the.

29
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.160
<v 1>I think they're trying to stay alive. Well.</v>

30
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.160
<v 0>Yeah, but that's, that's a.</v>

31
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.640
<v 1>Problem. I think it is a problem.</v>

32
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.360
But I think in the defense of particularly online journalism,

33
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.680
I think they're trying to stay alive. I don't,

34
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.360
I don't think it's a good time for journalism now. What, what I've,

35
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:38.180
from what I understand,

36
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.360
the only thing that keeps New York times functional is the podcast.

37
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.910
The podcast podcast is huge. And that, that, that podcast earns a lot of money,

38
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.510
but.

39
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.990
<v 0>That's not. That means they need to innovate. They needs to be,</v>

40
00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:51.390
they need to become a podcast. Does.

41
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.870
<v 1>It, does it? Well, we need the New York times though.</v>

42
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.950
The problem is they need to figure out a way to make money off of it,

43
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.070
but we need, we need the top of the food chain journalism. Right.

44
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.740
And that's what the times is always represented. We need them.

45
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.500
So when someone is, someone's done something for the times,

46
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.900
it's not so good or flawed. Yeah. Okay. But it's still not they're there.

47
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:13.740
That one person, that one article, whatever it is is not the times,

48
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.820
the times stands for something. Right.

49
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.060
What the New York times is supposed to stand for. What,

50
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:22.380
what it always did when I was a kid and does now to a lot of people,

51
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.850
still it' cream of the crop. It's the very best journalism.

52
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.010
It's the very best it's, it's the, the ones that have the deepest insight,

53
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.330
the ones that nail it. And we'd like, it free of bias,

54
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.210
but they're, it's, it's run by humans. You know, this is the problem with CNN.

55
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.330
It's the problem with any news source, but we still need news sources.

56
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.890
<v 0>But it's run by humans that need high salary.</v>

57
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.120
And there's a huge amount of people involved in making that system.

58
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.000
That is a CNN. So there's several mechanism of innovation required.

59
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.480
First. Like this podcast here podcast in general require very few people to run.

60
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.440
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they can,

61
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.040
now that there's an infrastructure to communicate with a lot of people.

62
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.080
And then there's the Wikipedia model. Yeah.

63
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.520
So like Wikipedia is thousands of contributors that creates

64
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.680
extremely strong factual information. Yeah. And that's not like,

65
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.990
like it is very little money required to run Wiki. EDIA incredibly. So,

66
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.920
so.

67
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.230
<v 1>There are some journalists out there that are online though,</v>

68
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.390
that are thriving because of the problems with legacy media,

69
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.350
it's an opportunity it represents for God's like Tim pool, my friend, Tim pool,

70
00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:38.270
YouTube, Tim. Pool's a fantastic journalist. He's he's really objective.

71
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.500
You might disagree. Agree with him or you,

72
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.380
you might not find his perspective to be in aligned with yours,

73
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.820
but that guy is,

74
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.900
he holds those journalistic ethics at the highest level. I mean,

75
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.020
to the highest standard with him, it's everything.

76
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.980
And when you read his take on or see him make a take on things,

77
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.170
he is giving you the most, most honest objective take on it possible.

78
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.010
And it's really hard to get that from a network. First of all,

79
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.690
it's really hard to get what he does for a network,

80
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:11.490
because you're gonna get these giant chunks, uh, where he'll he'll.

81
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.490
He can talk about something for as long as it takes to describe what the issue

82
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:19.810
is. Whereas CNN has a segment, man, that segment is seven minutes.

83
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.480
You better be done by seven minutes. We're going to commercial.

84
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.440
And then we're coming back with Don lemon and he's got a sassy take on things.

85
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.040
And then Andrew, Cooper's got new glasses. Look at that handsome bastard.

86
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.960
And then they're all gonna talk about and you gotta listen. And it's, uh,

87
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:37.640
Trump is bad coronavirus, deadly. And uh, holy, Chris, Cuomo's got it.

88
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:38.920
Let's go to Chris. He's in his basement.

89
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.630
And then you see Chris in his man with Sanja Gupta and they're holding up chest

90
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.710
x-rays you know, they, they, they have their segments, man. Segments are.

91
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.470
Yeah. It's dumb. You have these,

92
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.110
these standards that you've created a long time ago.

93
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.790
And this is the biggest handicap that legacy media has other than their

94
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.420
inability to be free. Like a, how like Tim pool is, they're not,

95
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.820
he's an independent, they can't be free. Like he is,

96
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.780
you have too many working pieces, too many producers,

97
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.060
too many people that are telling you what direction,

98
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:12.900
the se there's people that bring you the segments. You're a talking head.

99
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.220
There's a lot of going on there, man. A lot of going on there. Well.

100
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.580
<v 0>I, but you have to innovate and you have to make more, more.</v>

101
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.330
I actually disagree with about, I mean,

102
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.610
I think it's impossible to be perfectly objective or whatever. He's just,

103
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.730
he's just one voice. He tries.

104
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.730
<v 1>To be perfectly objective. Yeah. But if I look at,</v>

105
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:31.410
he tries to be as objective as he can be.

106
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.050
<v 0>No, I know the, the, you need to, uh,</v>

107
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.250
aspire to it and not be polluted by other influences,

108
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.970
but I can see people like, I think I'm OB,

109
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.200
but I have very different views than Tim pool on some things and not others.

110
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.240
<v 1>Well, there's subjective objectivity. Isn't there.</v>

111
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.320
<v 0>I don't know. &lt;laugh&gt; only one of us is just does, is it.</v>

112
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.040
<v 1>Possible? But people can look at things like you have a, an idea,</v>

113
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.440
a subjective idea of what something means when you're looking at it objectively.

114
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.800
So you're looking at a thing objectively. You're being honest about what,

115
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.740
what it said,

116
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.440
but you also have preconceived notions of what each individual aspect of that

117
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.680
certain thing means. And what's good and what's bad.

118
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.350
That's where the subjective aspect of objectivity comes in.

119
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.830
When you look at certain things that happen,

120
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.030
there's certain ways you can look at something and not have a bias,

121
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.750
but look at something and you have a preconceived, uh,

122
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.830
idea of what aspects of it should or should not be tolerated.

123
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.550
And maybe sometimes it takes someone else to come along and say, okay, well,

124
00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:36.910
why do you hold these beliefs?

125
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.140
<v 0>So, yeah, you're absolutely right.</v>

126
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:44.140
But the problem is that based on your skillset and your

127
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.300
momentum in history, you might look at a very particular aspect objectively.

128
00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:51.780
Yeah. And not see the bigger picture for sure. So like, uh,

129
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.420
Tim pool has revealed and has focused on certain aspects of problems in the

130
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:58.890
system mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he continues to focus on them.

131
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.730
Maybe not seeing the bigger picture, uh,

132
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:04.090
that's impossible for any one person to see the bigger picture.

133
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.410
I think like I tend to, I tend to see in, in a lot of things,

134
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.570
the beauty of things, and I focus on the positive. Yeah. You.

135
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.570
<v 1>Talk about that. Even with viruses, you, and even with.</v>

136
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.080
<v 0>Viruses there's you can, but that is that not objecti to, I, I,</v>

137
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.880
uh, like if I, beauty is not an objective, uh, word, but I,

138
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.080
I just mean that there's, well, it kind.

139
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.400
<v 1>Of is what we're just saying.</v>

140
00:07:26.401 --> 00:07:30.760
There's a subjective aspect to your objective view of a virus.

141
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.800
<v 0>Right. But it's choosing on which parts I focus in on.</v>

142
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.880
And also the other thing is choosing the ways you talk about it.

143
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.350
So the ways you revealed that objectivity, right? You can be positive.

144
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.630
You can be negative, you can be very cold and fact based. You can be, uh,

145
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.590
very flamboyant and very kind of excited, uh,

146
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.270
use a lot of visuals, all the,

147
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.590
all those kinds of things and all of that changes the way the message just

148
00:07:55.591 --> 00:08:00.380
carry. Yeah. Which is why we should have thousands of Tim pool, uh,

149
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:00.820
as opposed.

150
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.381
<v 1>To sort of, well,</v>

151
00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:05.020
I think they're gonna spring up out of the void that's been created by this

152
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.300
distrust in legacy media.

153
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.700
<v 0>Especially now J I don't know if you've been paying attention,</v>

154
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.100
but like YouTube there's so many people like my brother

155
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.220
has not like put the camera on themselves. Right. And say their opinions.

156
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.090
Yeah. You know, say like he,

157
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.970
he is doing like a bunch of reviews of scientific papers. Like they're,

158
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.970
they're all, like, they started a show mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

159
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:30.370
there's so many just there's thousands of shows springing.

160
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.050
<v 1>Up, dude. There's 900,000 podcasts.</v>

161
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.250
<v 0>Yeah. It's crazy. Well, it's over a million now. I think it's hit a million.</v>

162
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.170
When did it hit a million?

163
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.560
<v 1>Probably last week. I'm for sure. People starting podcast right now.</v>

164
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.840
It's a crazy number. Well, especially now, right? Whether they're on lockdown,

165
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.480
people are doing like the lockdown Chronicles, I think, um, it's,

166
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.080
it's a symbol of where we're going, right? Yeah. It's, you're,

167
00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:54.560
you're becoming look, when I do this thing,

168
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:56.120
I'm doing this thing four or five days a week,

169
00:08:56.121 --> 00:09:00.600
and I'm becoming more connected with people in some weird way that no one ever

170
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:02.000
thought it was ever gonna happen before,

171
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.960
where there's people that are listening to my voice right now in their ear while

172
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.480
they're running. Right. A lot, not a small amount.

173
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:13.600
If you could see the actual number of people right now with earbuds in running

174
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.830
list, sitting to this podcast, you'd be like, whoa, that's kind of crazy.

175
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:18.970
Stay hard.

176
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.700
<v 0>You're running.</v>

177
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.430
<v 1>Stay hard. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

178
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.590
<v 0>But running faster right now.</v>

179
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.870
<v 1>This kind of connection is, is a,</v>

180
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.030
it's a dip into the next dimension. Yeah. That's what this is.

181
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.350
And it seemed like it wasn't,

182
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.550
it seemed like it was just a radio show you're doing on the internet.

183
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.020
But then somewhere along the line, it became this weird thing.

184
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:38.100
And that's what it is. Now. Podcasts are a weird thing,

185
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:42.020
especially one that reaches the, the numbers of people that this one reaches.

186
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.820
And for that to be in my hands is a weird position. And I'm a, um,

187
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.260
you know, while it's happening, I'm like, oh, look how strange this is. Huh?

188
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.180
I didn't anticipate this.

189
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.410
I always anticipated this being some weirdo fringe thing that very few

190
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.610
people would connect with, which is why I never tried to censor it at all.

191
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:07.010
I tried to do a, a vast majority of it completely high outta my mind and,

192
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.810
uh, and hang out with fun,

193
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.370
fun people and just talk and have a good time and not have a different

194
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:14.640
perspec.

195
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.320
Some people have a public voice and a private voice mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I

196
00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:23.160
try to have the same voice. Just be me. Just, just do that. Um, this is.

197
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.800
<v 0>Yeah. That's why I tell people when they say what,</v>

198
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:26.480
what what's Joe like behind the scenes,

199
00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:28.000
that'd be awesome if you were totally different.

200
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.880
&lt;laugh&gt; but I just tell 'em it's the same, same guy. It's just,

201
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:31.720
this is Awesomes a bummer.

202
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.880
<v 1>Wouldn't it be a bummer if someone was like a super Dick behind the scenes.</v>

203
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.740
Yeah.

204
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.750
<v 0>And I've you, yeah. That that'd be a bummer or like it,</v>

205
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.110
you don't have to be a super Dick, but it's just a totally different person.

206
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:42.350
Put.

207
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.430
<v 1>It on an act. Yeah.</v>

208
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.150
<v 0>Like a mini you put on that mini skirt. &lt;laugh&gt; Dick off.</v>

209
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.070
<v 1>The tattoos hug those curves baby. But the point is I, what I think this is,</v>

210
00:10:51.071 --> 00:10:54.030
is a step into the way humans are going.

211
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.220
And this is just one step that we didn't was a step it's a podcast.

212
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.860
I thought it was just like a radio show that you do on the internet, but it's,

213
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.520
it's not,

214
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.340
for some reason it's more involved and more entangled and more intense.

215
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.060
And then, and then also it has an impact. Right.

216
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:17.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>
