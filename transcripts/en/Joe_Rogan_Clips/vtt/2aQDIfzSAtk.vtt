00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Let me ask you this, cuz you're this big coast to coast art bell fan. Right?</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.440
How much of that UFO stuff do you pay attention to?

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.520
None. None.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.720
<v 1>Yeah, major zero. When,</v>

5
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:15.800
when people contact me on LinkedIn and their major credential, as they do a,

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.080
a UFO magazine or something like that, I don't add them.

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.830
<v 0>I used to love that stuff. I think it was so interesting and intriguing.</v>

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.310
Tell us to, yeah, I started actually paying attention to it. Yeah.

9
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:27.870
When I started interviewing some of the people that are involved in the

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.750
movement, you find the same thing over and over again, this just

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.350
wantant disregard for reality, this,

12
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:38.190
this absolute desire to prove something.

13
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.220
Instead of looking at the objective facts that that aliens are real proving that

14
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.220
we've been contacted. Okay.

15
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.860
Proving that these eyewitness testimonies are legitimate. Let me.

16
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.620
<v 1>Try to get across a weird idea. Okay. Okay. Um,</v>

17
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.820
once upon a time in the 1940s, there were two guys con Lorenze,

18
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:59.260
Nico Tinbergen who got a Nobel prize for inventing a field called letology,

19
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.450
which is a certain kind of observation of animal behavior.

20
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.970
And nicotenbergen would go off to the, uh,

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.930
coastal cliffs around Northern Europe.

22
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.370
And he would observe these sea birds and the sea birds would go out.

23
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.450
I don't know how many miles, 10 30, 40 miles,

24
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.810
and out to the ocean to feed and bring back food for the young.

25
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.360
And then they would come back at the end of the day and their nests they'd have

26
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:27.160
200 nests next to each other, but the nests had very low walls.

27
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.680
So when the seabird came back from her fishing and waddled herself into place,

28
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:37.400
moving her Hein back and forth to get in place, to incubate her chicks,

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.120
to warm the eggs, she'd often knock an egg out.

30
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.590
And when the egg was knocked outta the nest, the bird would reach her beak out,

31
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.933
pass the egg,

32
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.470
and then pull her beak back toward her chest to pull the egg toward the nest.

33
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.590
And she'd do it over and over again until she got the egg in the nest and Nico

34
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.070
tin Bergen had this weird idea.

35
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.460
I wish I knew where it came from that this is a reflex, you know,

36
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:07.300
like when your doctor takes a hammer and hammers your knee and your,

37
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.660
your leg shoots out and you had nothing to do with it,

38
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.220
he figured this is the same kind of a reflex.

39
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.020
And he figured that if you have a reflex,

40
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.020
you need a trigger for the reflex like that patella hammer that hammered your

41
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:21.854
knee.

42
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.370
So he looked to see if there was a trigger that triggered this yanking,

43
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.810
your beak back in, in order to scoop the egg back into the nest.

44
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.370
And he tried building artificial eggs to see if he could find out what the cues

45
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:41.170
were in the egg that were causing this reaction in the bird. And finally,

46
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.240
he got a super egg, which means, I mean, it was big than the normal egg.

47
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.040
It was browner than the normal egg. And he'd put the real egg. Now,

48
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.200
if you're the bird that real egg has your genetic legacy,

49
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.080
it's your genetic future. A lot is riding on that egg.

50
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.440
A lot of you and the phony egg and the phony egg

51
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.560
would attract the bird so strongly that she would ignore her own egg

52
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.360
and yank, yank, yank with her beak until she pulled the phony egg into the nest.

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.640
And they continued to do research with this kind of thing.

54
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.510
And they discovered that they could trick some song birds into taking a

55
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:22.270
basketball into their nest.

56
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.430
And then when the poor little birds tried to get on top of the basketball to

57
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:27.140
incubate it,

58
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.910
they would slide off and they'd be very frustrated and they would climb back on

59
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.150
again and slide off again. It was cruel.

60
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.350
<v 0>So the phony eggs like fake.</v>

61
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.390
<v 1>Those are things called super normal stimuli. Oh,</v>

62
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.420
and the eye idea is that they bring these reflexive reactions. Yes.

63
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.540
Well underlying what adollf Hitler was doing underlying what I was doing dancing

64
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.420
on that stage. Um,

65
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.860
underlying what you do in front of an audience when you get inesants and lose

66
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.020
yourself and something else talks through you, um,

67
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.610
all that is related to some super normal pattern

68
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.410
in us. Yes.

69
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.650
So Hitler was basically saying the world is about to end and the kingdom of

70
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.530
God is coming except the kingdom of God in his case was the

71
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:16.090
world will be controlled by the master race,

72
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.970
the blonde and blue-eyd S and a,

73
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.960
all other people will be slave people or will be exterminated. Um,

74
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.800
but it was this golden paradise that he was inviting the Germans to in which

75
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.200
they ruled the world because they were born to rule the world.

76
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.880
<v 0>So, and how did you describe the stimulation? Super.</v>

77
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.960
<v 1>Super normal stimulus. So super.</v>

78
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.070
<v 0>Superor still stimulus of this artificial egg is like super normal stimulus</v>

79
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.030
of this extreme behavior, right at the podium, right.

80
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:47.870
That attract people in, right. There's this.

81
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.910
<v 1>Hmm. And basically Hitler was saying,</v>

82
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.870
I was talking about the equivalent of extra terrestrials.

83
00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:57.390
He was talking about this magic quality of the Germans.

84
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:02.300
He was talking about the shared soul of the Germans and how people in Vagner

85
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.660
operas. Um,

86
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.700
and the gods of the old Germans had been in the souls of these people.

87
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.940
And he was evokking the group soul, the zeitgeist, um, the,

88
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.940
in this case is the, vokgeist the spirit of a people.

89
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.890
And the flying saucer people are after an end of the world that in which the

90
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.370
world will be remade and a guy named, well,

91
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.170
there was a Jewish kid from a backward town,

92
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.210
a really backward town who only had been trained in manual skills.

93
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.330
And he started preaching and he preached that the world was, as we know,

94
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:41.010
it was about to end. And we were about to enter a new kind of paradise

95
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.520
because he was Jewish.

96
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.640
He figured it's gotta happen to Passover because a Passover,

97
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:52.600
you put out a cup for Elijah and Elijah's there to proceed the savior. Um,

98
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.200
the guy who will save the Jewish people.

99
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.400
So he went up to theholah city in Judaism to Jerusalem,

100
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.720
and he had a dinner, um,

101
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.720
this Passover dinner and they put out the cup and that's when the kingdom of God

102
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.400
was supposed to arrive his prediction of a kingdom of God arriving at that

103
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:16.320
particular Passover ceremony turned out to be utterly wrong. And in fact,

104
00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:21.030
the Roman seized him and nailed him to a cross and

105
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.590
he died. It was the opposite of everything he'd predicted,

106
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.950
but the religion he'd put together was so,

107
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.030
and the religion really that Paul put together,

108
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.830
cuz Paul was an international figure. You know,

109
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.860
he was comfortable in the global world of the Roman empire,

110
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.100
but what Paul put together around Jesus was a super normal stimulus.

111
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.180
And it evoked a super normal response,

112
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.420
a super normal reflex and the flying saucer ideas that, you know,

113
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.300
here we are on earth, but there's this brace that's above us that can save us.

114
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.130
Um, that's pushing at the same buttons. Um,

115
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.690
Hitler was pushing at the same buttons. The world,

116
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.490
as we know is about to end and there's a new paradise and will Germans will rule

117
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.130
everything. Um,

118
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.090
so we are built to receive certain kind of stimuli.

119
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.610
God knows how we got built that way.

120
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.200
And when I went out in quest of the ecstatic of God,

121
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.240
the God's inside of us at the age of 13,

122
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.080
I was looking for that super normal,

123
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.480
those super normal responses in us and for the

124
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.760
superorimuli that evokeed them. And when you are doing art,

125
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.280
when you are doing commentary, when you're doing comedy,

126
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.990
you are hitting the buttons, you are creating super normal stimuli.

127
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.910
You are testing out jokes until they reach just the right shape.

128
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.390
And you know, what you can feel in the audience, what that shape is.

129
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.710
And then you repeat that shape,

130
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:56.710
knowing what its impact is gonna be on the audience. I wrote a new book. Um,

131
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.380
it took me a long time to write all of my previous books,

132
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.020
including how I accidentally started the sixties. And by the way,

133
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.300
it isn't the same 1995 manuscript.

134
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.540
I had 20 years of additional processing and was able to put a lot more meaning

135
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.700
into the book. And hopefully it's still really funny. Um,

136
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.340
but I was able to write a book in six weeks,

137
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.090
the first draft of 178,000 word book,

138
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.850
and a normal book is 90,000 words.

139
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.530
So this is almost twice the length of a normal book.

140
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.570
And I was able to do it because I had told all the stories in the book and I had

141
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:34.370
felt out how the audience was responded to the stories.

142
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.770
And I knew the words to use, and they were a well worn path in my brain.

143
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.400
So I simply put down on paper, an oral vocabulary,

144
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.560
but you it's the audience who shapes you by giving you

145
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.720
feedback. And eventually you perfect something. So it's like Nico Tinbergen,

146
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:58.120
super egg. I mean, new Nico timberberg was eventually able to make eggs,

147
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.280
super eggs that had de glow on them,

148
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.480
had polkadots on them that were absurd, but they still had the ability,

149
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.520
the way that flying saucer myths have the ability to evoke this sense

150
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.910
that there is a paradise beyond the world that we no.

151
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.670
<v 0>Don't you think when you think of a super normal stimulus that when you see, uh,</v>

152
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.190
you know, like a preacher on the pulpit, that's screaming with confidence.

153
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.430
When you see any of these things, like even when it comes to fake breasts,

154
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.350
like you, you're seeing something like, you know what you want,

155
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.380
you want a woman to be, uh, good at bearing children, right.

156
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.220
To have the right hip to waste ratio, uh, that she's, uh,

157
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.140
designed to breastfe has large breasts. Right. Even though, you know, it's fake,

158
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.340
it still hits whatever that genetic button is inside of your head. Yep.

159
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.620
And the alien theme, the idea behind it,

160
00:09:53.621 --> 00:09:57.050
the archetype is kind of like space data, daddy, right. It's like, you know,

161
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.003
I know we're stupid,

162
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.650
but just like this guy who's screaming on the pulpit has all the answers. Like,

163
00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:05.130
thank God someone has all the answers. Right. Well,

164
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.570
space daddy is for the atheists right. Space. Daddy is for the people,

165
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.490
you know what? I've listened to all these people down here.

166
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.330
I think they're full of, but space daddy's gonna help us out. Yeah.

167
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.960
<v 1>Well, that's the general idea. He's that what it is? Yes. And when you've,</v>

168
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.360
as I said, when you fashion a joke,

169
00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:22.280
you're fashioning it to be a super normal stimulus, but.

170
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.400
<v 0>Space, daddy might be real somewhere because we're dealing with, well,</v>

171
00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:28.080
look at the.

172
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.120
<v 1>Ordinary numbers. Okay. As a science person. Okay. Um,</v>

173
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.480
I have to tell you that there's only one place in which we've ever discovered

174
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.400
any evidence of life and it's down here on earth.

175
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.910
So I'm a skeptic about life being anywhere right now,

176
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.390
changing to a different scientific perspective.

177
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.990
There's this thing that I call super simultaneity,

178
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.910
super synchrony mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

179
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.710
And when the universe starts as a,

180
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.470
an rapidly expanding sheet of nothing but space and time it's space,

181
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.300
time and speed, that's all it is. &lt;affirmative&gt;.

182
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.620
And when it precipitates inquas,

183
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.540
which is unlikely, how, how can space time and speed become particlesquas?

184
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:08.460
Right. Um,

185
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.340
the fact is that there are only something like 16 different forms of thosequas

186
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.780
and there are gazillion of identical copies of eachqua everywhere.

187
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.730
And they all spray into existence. At the same time, fast forward,

188
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.610
a couple of million years,

189
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:28.410
galaxies all are pretty much the same and all of them spring

190
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:32.650
into existence, pretty much at the same time,

191
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.170
at least the first generation of galaxies stars ignite within those

192
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.600
galaxies, all following pretty much the same principles.

193
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.200
They're all just big gravity balls. Um,

194
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.520
gravity's gravity balls all the way that's planets, that's moons,

195
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.760
all kinds of things.

196
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.960
So there is this tendency for the universe to do the same thing at pretty much

197
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.520
the same time, pretty much, same damned everywhere in this cosmos.

198
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.880
And we do know that there are biomolecules,

199
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.960
carbon based molecules being formed in interellar cold

200
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.080
gas clouds, intersellar hot gas clouds,

201
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.040
all kinds of unlikely places in the cosmos.

202
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.470
But those are very simple little molecules,

203
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.870
even though we call 'em biomolecules,

204
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:21.390
it simply means they've got carbon life depends on molecules in the case of your

205
00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:25.630
genome. If we yanked just we took just one cell, you wouldn't miss it.

206
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.790
You have a hundred trillion others. Um, so we took just one cell from your body.

207
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.700
And we took out the genome, the, the what? Well,

208
00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:38.420
it's actually the genome. So we took out the genome and we stretched it out,

209
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.100
cuz it's all tangled up in the cell.

210
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.020
It would be three feet long.

211
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.500
So there's a big distance between a tiny little molecule of ammonia

212
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.810
in an interstellar cloud. And that huge, very complex X,

213
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:58.610
highly ordered three foot long moleculecu or MOS of single

214
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.890
molecule. That's your genome. Um,

215
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.650
and we haven't learned very much at all about how you go from the simple

216
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.570
molecules to that incredibly complex molecules.

217
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:12.450
The origin of life is still one of the big puzzles, but again,

218
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.880
because they're super single Graney and super simultaneity all over the cosmos,

219
00:13:16.881 --> 00:13:19.880
pretty much the same thing happens at pretty much the same time.

220
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.440
The odds are that there are millions of other planets that have

221
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:26.960
life. Those are the odds,

222
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.400
but I set all that aside because we don't have evidence of any life.

223
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.270
Uh, and we've been looking, okay, I'll tell you a story.

224
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.390
It seems to have nothing to do with anything. But once upon a time, uh,

225
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.990
a manager gave me an act to work with. It was earth, wind and fire.

226
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.910
And so I read all their lyrics. I read everything about them.

227
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.590
I studied them like otummodic scholar. I always did.

228
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:58.020
And finally I got to their album, em covers. And when I got together with, um,

229
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.620
the leader of the band, Maurice white for lunch, um,

230
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.460
cause I hadn't yet learned to set up my boundaries and tell people,

231
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.380
I'll only work with you.

232
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:10.140
If I can see you in your own environment for between one and three days,

233
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.540
that wasn't quite at that point yet I sat with my, with,

234
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.290
with Maurice said, Maurice, if I've got you right,

235
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.890
you believe that approximately 11,000 years ago,

236
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:24.250
people from another civilization someplace else and now our galaxy or beyond our

237
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.050
galaxy came to this earth and brought us all of our technologies and left the

238
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:31.850
messages of their technologies and the pyramids. If I got that right.

239
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.560
And Maurice smiled and he said, yes.

240
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.440
And so I said, okay, there's this scientist from Cornell university.

241
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.880
And he has just had a tremendous success with a science series on

242
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.400
PBS. It's the most watched series PBS has ever had.

243
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.160
And he's trying to put together an organization to find

244
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.760
extraterrestrial intelligence. So if I introduced the two of you,

245
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.960
would you be willing to do a benefit concert for him?

246
00:15:03.961 --> 00:15:07.840
Because right now he's struggling to get money together. And Marie said, yes.

247
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.950
So we track down Carl leggin's summer cottage telephone number.

248
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.150
And I put together a conference call between Maurice white and um,

249
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.670
oh God, what's his name again? Billions and billions and billions of planets.

250
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.150
Carl Saer. Yeah. And, um,

251
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.150
as soon as Carl got wind of where Maurice was coming from,

252
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.460
pseudoscience conversation was over.

253
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.860
Cause Carl was already gambling too much on ideas that could get

254
00:15:38.861 --> 00:15:43.060
him totally laughed out of science. So it was unfortunate,

255
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.860
but ever that was the early 1980s,

256
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.380
probably about actually, probably about 1980. Didn't he want to just.

257
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.930
<v 0>Sit down with Mor and sort of explain what we know so far. No,</v>

258
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:56.770
he couldn't afford this stuff based on was it was zachchararia.

259
00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.730
<v 1>You, you know, know it's all kinds of it's everywhere. Right?</v>

260
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.850
You can find it all over the place, but did it make.

261
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.850
<v 0>Did he have like.</v>

262
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.890
<v 1>A, a source? Uh, not that I asked him, no.</v>

263
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.730
So I was too busy trying to put this yeah. This thing together.

264
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.210
And it was unfortunate. Yes. It would've been neat.

265
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:13.240
If the two of them had been able to sit down and talk.
