00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>As far as what I'm gonna do next. Yeah. You know,</v>

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.760
I want to keep experiencing these things,

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.480
which to me are precious and rare. I,

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.160
I want to keep going out into the wilderness.

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.440
I wanna keep experiencing it and I wanna share it with people.

7
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:17.440
It doesn't mean anything to me. If I don't share it to people anymore,

8
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.400
I have no desire to go live by myself in the woods and not talk to anybody.

9
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.390
<v 0>It seems like you could have a skeleton crew of cameraman editor</v>

10
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.030
you. Yeah. And put it on like YouTube. That's what I've thought about. Yeah.

11
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.750
I think that's a move man, because you can make real money off of YouTube now.

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.670
I mean, obviously you see these YouTube celebrities,

13
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.380
they're very wealthy and they're just doing things on YouTube and you could just

14
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.500
transfer your show over to YouTube and I guarantee you, people would watch,

15
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.820
I mean, a hundred percent definitely.

16
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.660
<v 1>Would need a camera. I definitely would need a cameraman editor. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.340
<v 0>Cameraman and editor. Oh. So it's like a three person crew.</v>

18
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.940
So all the stuff that you had to deal with with all these other folks that

19
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:57.710
weren't even there,

20
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.340
these producers that were saying they wanted to fire you and all that other,

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.050
you wouldn't have to do it. That at all, it would basically.

22
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.010
And if you had an idea like, Hey, I want to try this.

23
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.410
I wanna make my own bow and arrow and go shoot a caribou with it, you know,

24
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.650
and do it with traditional methods and use the tendons from animals to make the

25
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:17.090
strings and all the stuff that like the native Americans did. You could do that.

26
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.130
Like you could do, you could do, you could do whatever you want.

27
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.090
You could do whatever you want.

28
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.760
And that's what I think would be really appealing to people.

29
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:26.880
Because just like if you started a podcast or just like anything else where

30
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.120
there's no one telling you what to do,

31
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.480
you get to find out who the person really is. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

32
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:32.360
and I think that would,

33
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.320
that would be a great way to give you all the freedom that you want,

34
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.960
where, you know,

35
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.030
I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to get enough advertiser dollars to pay for an

36
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:46.110
editor and pay for a cameraman and,

37
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.910
and put it up there and start generating revenue.

38
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.270
<v 1>Yeah. Some guys are really good. Like, um, you know,</v>

39
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.750
Les STR used to film himself a lot. Yeah. I tried that a little bit,

40
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:56.910
but I can't film myself. It's like, I need the interaction. Yeah.

41
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.310
<v 0>Les Les is, uh, I mean,</v>

42
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.020
he's the only one that really did that without horse. Yeah.

43
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:08.140
That live in the woods for seven days and survive off of whatever scraps he

44
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:08.501
could find.

45
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:11.620
Then find some sort of a scenario that they piece together for the show.

46
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.940
You know, the, the reason why bear grills happened,

47
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.100
the whole reason why that guy got a show is cuz they were trying to tell Les to

48
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.220
fake things. Oh really? And he wouldn't fake anything. And he is like,

49
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.210
I'm not gonna do that way. So they got, let's get this guy.

50
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.370
So he would just go along with them. Bear grills just slept in a hotel.

51
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.890
He'd pretend he'd drinking his own, all that stuff. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,

52
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.330
less was out there really surviving that way.

53
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.410
When you would see he would do like a seven day trip and,

54
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.730
and maybe he would find no food. And by the end of that seven days,

55
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.890
you could see how much weight he had lost. I mean,

56
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.800
he looked terrible and then he would get rescued as per you know how he would've

57
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:51.720
to go to a drop off point or a pickup point. But now he's all Bigfoot.

58
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.480
Les has gone, gone crazy Bigfoot, a hundred percent. I get more questions about.

59
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.320
<v 1>Bigfoot. &lt;laugh&gt; what is it?</v>

60
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:01.000
You live in the woods and you're supposed to be running into Bigfoot.

61
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.360
You're supposed to be a Bigfoot authority. Two, two questions.

62
00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:05.680
People are always asking about global warming.

63
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.800
I'm not a scientist and Bigfoot. Right. I mean, I'm, I'm not a scientist,

64
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:11.190
but you.

65
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.080
<v 0>Said you did notice.</v>

66
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.520
<v 1>At the ISIS thin. Yes. Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:18.200
Anecdotally I can say that it's definitely warmer where I am compared to.

68
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.750
It was 15 years ago, the winters have been warmer, but how many.

69
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.990
<v 0>Years in row have they been warmer?</v>

70
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.190
<v 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.510
I didn't keep the data cuz I know there are a lot of sinus keeping it and those

72
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:31.870
are the people I'm gonna defer to on global warming. Right.

73
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.550
And I believe in global warming, I mean,

74
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:35.950
I believe in the consensus of scientific opinion.

75
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.790
What I have seen personally is just overall

76
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.900
the ices thinner on my lake.

77
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.140
And that's a sign that over the whole course of the winter,

78
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.340
they've been milder winters 15 years ago, I'd get around four feet of ice.

79
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.660
Now the last few winters have been times when I went out there in April,

80
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:54.220
which is when it said his thickest and there's only two and a half feet of ice.

81
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.300
And I'm like, wow, that's crazy. I never saw that. You know, 10 to 15 years ago.

82
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.810
Um, the other thing is the absolute coldest temperatures.

83
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.650
Since I've been out there three times, it went to colder than 60 below zero.

84
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.130
They were all the first couple winners, first two or three winners.

85
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.570
I don't know if that was just, you know,

86
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.010
coincidence or what I'm not saying this is global warming.

87
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.250
I'm just telling you what I've seen. Um,

88
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.440
and like they've been recent winters where the coldest had ever got was,

89
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.990
you know,

90
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.480
once or twice to 45 below one of the first winters I was out there in March for

91
00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:28.640
like two weeks. It never went above 40 below.

92
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.320
I haven't seen anything like that in the last four or five winters. Mm.

93
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.720
Since I got on the show,

94
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.240
the coldest temperature we ever saw was one time it went down to about 50,

95
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.910
55 below, um, one day for a little while.

96
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.710
I've seen times, like I said,

97
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:49.950
where it would literally not go above 40 below for two weeks in March. Mm.

98
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.600
That was first or second year I was out there. So I mean, so.

99
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.240
<v 0>Anecdotally at least, yeah. That's just.</v>

100
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.870
<v 1>Look, we gotta, we gotta defer to science on this. I mean,</v>

101
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.870
they're collecting data all over the world.

102
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.310
You can see the Arctic oceans, there's less ice. You can, you know,

103
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.470
measure the temperature of the ocean by sending sound waves through it. You can,

104
00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:16.550
there's all different methods. Um,

105
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.230
so it doesn't really matter what one person sees in one place,

106
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.500
but there's a consensus of opinion. That's what matters. Yeah.

107
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.060
<v 0>But it is interesting your, your own anecdotal experience,</v>

108
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:28.380
seeing that the ice is that much thinner and the, the winters are warmer. It.

109
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.060
<v 1>Is well, I'm sure the national weather service has all kinds of data on Alaska.</v>

110
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.100
Sure, sure. I mean, we, for instance, in Fairbank, Alaska,

111
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.940
they never used to use any salt on the roads at all.

112
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.810
The reason being that it was too cold for out to work,

113
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.810
salt will only melt ice. If it's a certain temperature,

114
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:48.890
if it gets cold in that it doesn't work. So they didn't even store salt there.

115
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.250
The department of transportation didn't use it, which was nice.

116
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.490
Your vehicles didn't rust out.

117
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.640
But now there are enough times in the winter when it's warm enough that they

118
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.880
actually are using salt in recent years on the roads of Fairbank.

119
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.240
And you actually see times when it gets up to freezing,

120
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.480
even freezing rain events in the winter,

121
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:09.840
which didn't used to happen hardly ever.

122
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.840
And now that's not that outlandish to have it, you know, get up to,

123
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.710
to freezing in the middle of, of the winter some days.

124
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.270
<v 0>Bigfoot &lt;laugh&gt; what about Bigfoot?</v>

125
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.150
<v 1>I just can't believe people waste their time talking about stuff like that.</v>

126
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.223
&lt;laugh&gt;.

127
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.110
<v 0>Well, for someone like you,</v>

128
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.350
who actually lives in the wilderness and you actually live in Alaska,

129
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.940
which is one of the places is where people supposedly spot Bigfoot.

130
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.980
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It's cause a lot of nutty people go to Alaska,</v>

131
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.020
they call 'em end of the rotors. Yeah. You drive until you can't go any further.

132
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.220
And then you can't out in the woods for a while and see Bigfoot. Yeah.

133
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.140
Does Les STR really see Bigfoot?

134
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.380
<v 0>He, I don't think he's ever seen it. His shows, but he believes it's out there.</v>

135
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.460
He shows sad. It makes me sad. Cuz he was like,

136
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.010
like a really respected guy doing the survival thing. And you know,

137
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.490
I think it was a really interesting educational show and it showed people how

138
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.324
hard it is.

139
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.370
But then he got hooked up with this guy and he was filming these big foot shows

140
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.370
and the guy was completely full of. There's like a,

141
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.730
he's wearing a mask pretending to be big foot in the woods, filming it,

142
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.120
high resolution. It looks so fake. You should see the show. The,

143
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.560
the fake cuz it's so dumb. It's so dumb. It hurts your feelings.

144
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.240
Like you're like what you're doing this,

145
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.120
but it's real popular. That's the problem. If you have like a survivor show,

146
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.840
you might get X amount of people to watch it. If you have a big foot show,

147
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.150
you might get double the number. What does that tell you about our culture?

148
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.430
Not good. Look at this. This is the video footage. This is, he says, he said,

149
00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:49.910
this is a close up high resolution of Bigfoot. Look, look at that thing.

150
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.350
&lt;laugh&gt; how fake is that? Like he's gonna zoom in on it.

151
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.350
&lt;laugh&gt; it says the Todd standing Bigfoot video

152
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.420
as, and Survivorman Bigfoot show at Les route.

153
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.381
<v 1>What's going on.</v>

154
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:07.020
People are really are the people that are watching this stuff actually

155
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:10.140
believing it or they just find it entertaining. There's people. It's stupid.

156
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.820
<v 0>It's funny coma sitting on their couch, sitting in front of the TV,</v>

157
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:15.220
thinking about when they're gonna go to bed,

158
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.500
what are they look how dumb that looks, man, look at this stupid,

159
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.570
fake big foot face. And they're they're sitting there going well.

160
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.970
They wish it was real. They wish it was real. Yeah. They wish it was real.

161
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:28.804
They want it to be real.

162
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.530
They want there to be some large primate living by itself

163
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.370
in the forest, a small number of them, not that many,

164
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.290
just a small number of them.

165
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.800
<v 1>I seen some crazy stuff, but it.</v>

166
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.240
<v 0>Wasn't Bigfoot. Well, here's the thing. If there were Bigfoot,</v>

167
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.800
why wouldn't there be thousands of 'em all over the place what's gonna stop

168
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.320
Bigfoot from breeding. Bigfoot would beat the out of a bear,

169
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.440
kill a mountain line. Like what would stop a Bigfoot?

170
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.400
You're talking about an eight to 10 foot tall gorilla. What the hell would stop?

171
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:00.680
That that would be the king of the farmers.

172
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.280
And what would stop us from seeing the thing and would stop us from finding a

173
00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:08.640
body? Yeah. What would stop us from finding bones? Yeah, the skeletons. I mean,

174
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.680
how about an ancient one? You know, you know, in a sight like, you know,

175
00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:13.080
when they,

176
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.990
they find these mass and saber tooth tigers and things that existed here 10,000

177
00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:20.990
years ago, why don't they find a Bigfoot? Huh? FEMA.
