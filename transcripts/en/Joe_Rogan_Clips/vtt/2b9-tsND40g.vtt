00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 2>Let's talk about the metaverse cause like, uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm really fascinated by this decision of Facebook to change the name

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.490
of Facebook, to Metta and to the metaphor, which I think people are just gonna,

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.800
they're going to like re they're going to realize that

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.360
the, this is,

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.160
this is a crazy idea that you're going to give your life to some sort of

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.400
augmented or virtual reality world.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.260
That's created by a guy who's involved in this company

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.460
whose algorithms are sowing the seeds of distrust and hate all.

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.080
But now we're going to let him take over what you see and feel

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.620
because you're going to have a new company and this new company is going to be

13
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.330
virtually reality based where he's literally, he,

14
00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:53.370
he reenacted a scene from black mirror, which is.

15
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.030
<v 0>On ironically. I know. And you know what makes me a little sad.</v>

16
00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:01.080
I think that it's going to happen. Yeah.

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.270
I think that you and I are of a different generation dude.

18
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.570
I think there are a lot of kids who are growing up in Fortnite world and spend a

19
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:08.580
lot. And I think the pandemic really accelerated this.

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.160
There are a lot of people who lived on the line for the entire pandemic.

21
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:14.550
And so for people like me and for people like my parents,

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.730
not seeing other humans for a long time was actually quite painful and terrible.

23
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.000
Like we actually did want to get out and be with the community and see friends

24
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.630
and do that sort of stuff.

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.270
What if you spend your entire life from the time you're a little kid interacting

26
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.104
with screens.

27
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.690
What if those screens are getting increasingly sophisticated so that they are

28
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.870
interacting with you in ways that humans would? What, if you get to be whatever,

29
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.490
like where's society, we were just talking about this,

30
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.710
where you get to be whatever you want to be.

31
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.410
What if there's a world where you actually can be,

32
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.360
and everybody sees you the way you want to be seen.

33
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.840
Would you rather live there where you're like rich and good looking and

34
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.651
everybody likes you,

35
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.740
or would you rather live in the real world where you're disconnected from all of

36
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:48.750
that? And you end up with like ready player one world. I think.

37
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.033
<v 1>It's going to happen.</v>

38
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.750
It's as long as it can become indistinguishable from reality,

39
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:57.690
which will be able to be it's, it's going to take time,

40
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.500
whether it's five years or 10 years, if you go back and look at pong,

41
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.430
which was the first game that I ever saw when I was a child, it's ridiculous.

42
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:09.150
It's like a white ball that bounces across and you have a straight two bottles.

43
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.430
That's a paddle. And it's the,

44
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.610
it's the dumbest game that you could never convince a child to play today.

45
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:18.780
They'd be like, get the out of here with that stupid game. I can go play halo.

46
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.260
Right? But back then when I was a child, that was a big deal.

47
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.610
If you extrapolate, if you go,

48
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:27.390
just go in the future from now what they're available, what they have available.

49
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:30.840
Now, these insane video graphics, the unreal engine,

50
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.510
and then move yourself 20 years in the future. Yeah,

51
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:34.344
it's going to be indistinct.

52
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.770
<v 0>And the AI is getting better and better in terms of being able to imitate human</v>

53
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:40.920
behavior in terms of being able to innovate on its own and haptic.

54
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.970
<v 1>Back suits and all these different things and all these video games that they</v>

55
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:46.650
have that emulate sports.

56
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.420
They're getting so close when you watch these basketball games and the UFC has a

57
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.110
game when you watch these, uh, the, the players, the fighters move around, like,

58
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.950
God, it's so close. It's not quite there, but they're getting better,

59
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.170
better with each iteration. And it's just a matter of time.

60
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.670
<v 0>What I wonder is if we are innovating ourselves and when it comes to this stuff</v>

61
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.220
before innovating ourselves out of existence as a civilization,

62
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.180
but don't you think that's.

63
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.280
<v 1>Probably where this goes, no matter.</v>

64
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.710
<v 0>What, no, I think that, I think then the barbarians come to the gate.</v>

65
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.500
I think that's what happens because the real world still exists.

66
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.970
So if you innovate an entire generation of people and let's just take this on

67
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:24.340
those baseline demographic level, none of them get married.

68
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.310
None of them have babies and two generations that the same can matter.

69
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.080
You're going to have a good time in the virtual reality.

70
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.730
And then they're going to be no babies to carry this on.

71
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:32.950
And the only people on earth are going to be religious Jews,

72
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.990
religious Catholics, and religious Muslims. And that's it.

73
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.690
<v 1>Th the vulnerability lies in the power grid.</v>

74
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.880
The power grid is so vulnerable that if someone just detonated the power grid,

75
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.440
all this stuff stops. And then you have no life. Your life is completely,

76
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:52.000
you've invested it completely in this augmented world is virtual

77
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.990
world. But this virtual world, all you have to do is pull the plug and it's out.

78
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.890
And it's out for millions of people that it's like the equivalent of dropping a

79
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.300
nuclear bomb on a culture.

80
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.280
I give you really all live inside of a computer system.

81
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.720
Some sort of a.

82
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.320
<v 0>Yeah. It's virtual reality. Yep. No, that's right. And it's,</v>

83
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.780
and what I fear is that when you do that to a civilization,

84
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:17.080
it's basically the equivalent of you bringing a wild animal and you put it in a

85
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.600
cage for a long time, and now you can't release it back in the wild.

86
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.230
The right's going to get eaten. What happens to you as a civilization? Right?

87
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.200
What happens if you've taken an entire generation of people told them that their

88
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:29.050
entire life exists online. They don't have to interact with other humans.

89
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:30.910
They don't have to interact in human ways with other humans.

90
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.750
And then there's like an entire other earth out there that isn't doing any of

91
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:38.410
this. Right? And by the way, China is not doing this right. China is banning.

92
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.850
It turns, banning it, trying to say,

93
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.460
you're not allowed to go online certain days of the week. If you're a kid,

94
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.830
right. We're going to ban the kind of stuff that you can see.

95
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.040
So in the long run, which civilization is going to be more durable,

96
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.370
the one that actually understands the vulnerabilities of human nature or the one

97
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:55.840
that says we're going to use those vulnerabilities to make you feel subjectively

98
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.440
happier. It's I think I'm amazed at the level of conditioning.

99
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.020
Like here's what killed me about the pandemic. Honestly. Like what,

100
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.410
what killed me? The level of conditioning that it took in order to rejigger,

101
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:08.350
how people think was so low, it shocked the hell out of me.

102
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.230
It really shocked me. And I was talking to my business partner, Jeremy,

103
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.960
boring about this. And early on, depending on me, he was like,

104
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.910
people aren't going to stand for this. Like when they shut everything.

105
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:18.700
And he's like three months from now, people are going to be losing their minds.

106
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.890
They're going to be out on the streets, protesting to get rid of the masks.

107
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:23.320
And they're going to be out of ball games again. I was like, that's not right.

108
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.520
I think it'll take a year.

109
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.700
We're like a year and a half in and half the country is still like, oh,

110
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:31.810
you know what? If this just kind of continues like, all right, I guess like the,

111
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:36.340
the amount of dependency that was bred by people saying,

112
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:37.930
just go back to your house. And people will be like,

113
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.410
human beings are really adaptable. And this is something that Bret Weinstein,

114
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.120
Heather hiring and talk about, right? That's our superpower.

115
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:44.590
We're super duper adaptable.

116
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.820
So we're super adaptable to our own detriment sometimes to our own detriment.

117
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.870
So if we change our social circumstances radically in a way that's unhealthy for

118
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:53.440
us.

119
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.380
And we are now interacting with technologies that were built to take advantage

120
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:57.214
of our lizard brain.

121
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.240
Then what happens when there are people who are just not engaging in the same,

122
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.060
they're not playing the same game that we are, right?

123
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:07.670
We're we're essentially drugging ourselves.

124
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.460
Robert nausea cause the libertarian philosopher, he,

125
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.760
he talks at one point about what he calls the experience machine.

126
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.060
It's the thought experiment. And the experience machine is basically VR.

127
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.190
He's writing this in early 1960s. He says,

128
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:20.930
what if there was a machine where you could plug into it,

129
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.200
you'd feel the illusion of choice you'd feel as though your choices had some

130
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.450
sort of significance and it would give you the dopamine hit that you get in

131
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.310
regular life. Would you plug into it or would you not?

132
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.190
And his theory was you wouldn't plug into it because you still want to feel like

133
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:35.720
your life has real-world consequences. But what if everybody is in everybody,

134
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:39.470
you know, is in that experience machine, then you're the one who gets left out.

135
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:40.850
If you're not in the real world.

136
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.460
<v 1>What does real-world? I mean, that's,</v>

137
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:46.880
that's what the problem is that that analogy was created before

138
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.770
the sophistication of computer systems has reached the point now

139
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.140
where you can look at it two, 20 years from now,

140
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.210
and you kind of get an understanding of where it's going to be when you're,

141
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.540
when you're dealing with what's possible.

142
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:04.400
Now I don't think you're going to be able to stop people from doing it

143
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.640
because I think it's going to be so overwhelmingly addictive.

144
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.180
You look at how many people are just addicted to looking at their Instagram.

145
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.920
Yep. It's it's simple. Yeah. It's nothing. I mean, it's nothing.

146
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.000
The dopamine hit, you get off of this little phone. It's it's minimal,

147
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.160
but people are completely all in on it.

148
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.650
<v 0>Yep. And I, I think that what that's going to,</v>

149
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.570
what I do wonder if there's going to be,

150
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.800
and I w I wonder what you think about this.

151
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.690
If there's going to be a bifurcation in the same way,

152
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.380
there has been a bifurcation about so many issues between the people at the top

153
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.820
of sort of the elite spectrum and the rest of the population where the people at

154
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:39.530
the elite spectrum are making the metaverse,

155
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.210
but their kids aren't actually in the metaverse.

156
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.190
<v 1>Steve jobs. Didn't let his kid use an.</v>

157
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.150
<v 0>IPad. Exactly. Like I'm on the internet. My kids are seven, five,</v>

158
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:49.910
and one they're not allowed to, we don't have the TV on in our house.

159
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:51.740
My kids don't watch TV. I'm not,

160
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:53.630
my kids don't get internet access until they're like 18.

161
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.980
Like that is not a thing. I want them,

162
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.620
they can be out of my house and they can get internet.

163
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.450
<v 1>They're going to do drugs. They're going to be in the street.</v>

164
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.510
It's going to turn tricks. It's going to be a real problem.

165
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.670
<v 0>That's a pretty wild ride. You took me on there, Joe. That's really upsetting.</v>

166
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.330
That's what I do. Yeah. So that was when we went straight from my kids.

167
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:15.010
Aren't watching Coco Mellon to they're turning tricks in the streets, turn off.

168
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:15.843
<v 1>Florida.</v>

169
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.610
It sounds so cute for what it actually is. You know, it's a terrible thing,

170
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.430
but it sounds like cute. Oh, the turn tricks.

171
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.310
Like you didn't understand English. You'd be like, oh, they're magicians.

172
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.800
You know, like, no, no.

173
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.460
<v 0>Yeah. But yeah. And I mean, we're going to limit,</v>

174
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.410
but I think that that's one of the stories.

175
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.450
If we're talking about the elite kinda versus everybody else, gap,

176
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.040
maybe everything that gets created.

177
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.870
<v 1>Is concerned about their children.</v>

178
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.480
<v 0>Everything, right? I mean, like people,</v>

179
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:48.110
promulgating technologies and value systems, they don't actually live in.

180
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.470
And then everybody who is watching is like, I will do that.

181
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.020
And then those people themselves don't do it. Watch.

182
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.200
<v 1>The tire episode for free, only on Spotify.</v>
