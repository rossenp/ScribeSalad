00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 1>Yeah. Well, that's a good move because people are tired of Trump jokes.</v>

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.860
You know, it's one of those subjects. People like enough already.

4
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.080
<v 0>Man. I've been tired of them. And now I'm like they coming back around,</v>

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.810
they'll come in to be frustrated,

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.800
to be frustrated when to do this on his way out, you know,

7
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.490
it doesn't make no sense. It's like he is still getting to you. You know,

8
00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:26.960
it's just a matter of time. If you want to say the people,

9
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.710
the voice of the peoples was heard. It was a close situation,

10
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:32.810
but it is what it is. And he's gone.

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.950
<v 1>Oh man,</v>

12
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.070
people have some legitimate gripes and I understand where they're coming from.

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.690
But my perspective is it's not changing anything and it's not doing you any

14
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:44.480
good to still be holding on your,

15
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.900
if you are an anti-Trump Biden's seat. I mean,

16
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:52.790
I don't think it's 99% official, right? I mean, they just haven't said it yet.

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.180
And they, when they say it, then he will be become president.

18
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.480
And then Kamel Harris will be the new vice-president.

19
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.250
So concentrate on good voters. Now it's over. Right.

20
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.080
But people are so obsessed.

21
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.600
<v 0>The other day. I might've said this earlier.</v>

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.460
Look at Mike Pence and I'm having a meeting with no mess, man. Okay.

23
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.510
Why you still keep getting mad? Cause this don't have a mask on.

24
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.130
It's gotta be something else to do.

25
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.940
<v 1>But this, they, they want to talk about negative things. That's the thing.</v>

26
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:26.600
Some people get addicted to talking about negative things and they can't regroup

27
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.630
even after a victory. And now focus on positive things.

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.460
They want to continue to focus on negative things.

29
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.300
And I can see their perspective too. Especially with all these crazy tweets.

30
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:38.810
Like I won that election, you know, it's all fraud. It's all this.

31
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.460
It's all that like, man,

32
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:44.000
if you've got some real claims now I don't know what the claims are.

33
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.000
I haven't really honestly investigated them. But if you've got some real claims,

34
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.500
you got to present the evidence and then once you present the evidence,

35
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.620
you say all the stuff like I got robbed, I really want it.

36
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.770
If you want to be in a position where you're respected,

37
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.250
if you're the president of the United States, this isn't a regular guy.

38
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.690
It's not like if you were involved in some ridiculous,

39
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:10.670
like small neighborhood election and you were joking around on Twitter,

40
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.390
I won that election. That's that's that's to be expected.

41
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.110
But when someone's in a position where they're in charge of the nuclear football

42
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.860
club, it's literally are the commander chief of the greatest army in the world.

43
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.600
No. You're saying like that and firing people that don't agree with it. Yeah.

44
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.740
<v 0>From up did like, I know these other places, like what?</v>

45
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.790
This would be a great time for a terrorist attack right now.

46
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.290
<v 1>Well, one of the guys he fired what the guy said was he didn't believe there was</v>

47
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.270
widespread voter fraud. And he's like, you're fired.

48
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.040
If you don't believe that you're fired. Like this is, this is like a madman.

49
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.110
<v 0>The interesting part for me is like you try and to</v>

50
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.930
switch the thoughts of a person that is a huge Trump

51
00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:59.030
fan. It's a waste of,

52
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.410
it's only going to be the only thing you're going to be as frustrated.

53
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.260
<v 1>Here's the thing though. I don't know. And this is where it's really important.</v>

54
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.660
I don't know exactly how the election went

55
00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:13.860
down in terms of like,

56
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.720
was there like 0.01% fraud was,

57
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.380
was there 0.5%? How much fraud was there?

58
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.020
We gotta assume that when there's people counting stuff,

59
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.130
there's some fuckery going on.

60
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.701
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:30.330
But the fuckery that's been reported as bit light still no more than like 40

62
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.060
people, bro. And then the only other.

63
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.790
<v 1>Problem is that it's all done through these machines. Right?</v>

64
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.290
And then there's been all these conspiracy theories about

65
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.730
machines that were supposed to have been giving the votes to Trump,

66
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.150
gave those boats to Biden. Now I could repeat those things,

67
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.890
but I don't know if they're true.

68
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.820
<v 0>But I don't know what I do. Know what I'm saying? I do know. I know Georgia.</v>

69
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.460
I know the pulled all them envelopes up to the built-in and they cut

70
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:04.290
them open and they took a man by hand. They did them hand by hand yo, those,

71
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.640
those ones that were recounts or whatever, those you can't,

72
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.450
it's no machine that is hand by hand. Right? It's problem.

73
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.270
<v 1>How does that work? Did they have someone watch while they do it? Like,</v>

74
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:16.260
do they have a supervisor?

75
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.650
Because I would imagine you would want to have like almost like two people watch

76
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.850
while one person does it, which is so ridiculous. But it seems like you kind of,

77
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.820
if you don't trust.

78
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.910
<v 0>People, I know you don't trust me, but you kind.</v>

79
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.260
<v 1>Of have to have someone watching it.</v>

80
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.770
That's part of the argument that Trump's administration was saying too,

81
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.760
was that there were certain counts that they weren't allowed to observe.

82
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.950
They had to be really far away and they couldn't actually see.

83
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.490
<v 0>That sounds like people that like soy beans, but that's the first,</v>

84
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.820
that's the first soy boy attitude.

85
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.030
<v 1>But what if you're telling the truth? Here's the thing I don't know.</v>

86
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.923
And you don't know either.

87
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.430
So if they were telling the truth and people were counting votes incorrectly,

88
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.240
or.

89
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.920
<v 0>They find no evidence of that every time that every time that they came out with</v>

90
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.260
all these losses in the jaw, dropping them,

91
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:07.380
dropping them because there's no evidence of it. He's probably made he's.

92
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.320
He's had to have made every argument he can make.

93
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.480
<v 1>No, listen, I agree with you. I agree with you.</v>

94
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.740
There's no evidence that they can present.

95
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.540
That's going to show people right now that there was so much voter

96
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.260
fraud that they got to return everything and start all over or they got to give

97
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:26.850
it to Trump. I agree with you.

98
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:28.860
I think this is what all these experts are saying.

99
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.890
They're all saying that even if there was voter fraud,

100
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:33.720
it wasn't enough to tilt the election one way or another,

101
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.760
but I don't know how these machines work. So if I'm even commenting on it,

102
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.520
if I'm saying they couldn't have done it, that's ridiculous.

103
00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:44.130
I'm saying they must have done it. That's just as ridiculous.

104
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.030
I really don't know. That's like when you're talking about voting,

105
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.130
you're talking about how many millions of people are voting and all this

106
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.770
information is coming in and they got to sort it out.

107
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.010
You're going to some mistakes. There's no way around it. But the question is,

108
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.110
does it overall balance out or are there mistakes all for one

109
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:10.160
side, if you find out that mistakes are all for Biden, then you're going to go,

110
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.230
huh? Really well,

111
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.370
who owns the company that makes the machines and then who,

112
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.730
how are they financed and who programmed that? And how are they programmed?

113
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.720
Is it possible to with the data? It is possible. Can you show me how to do it?

114
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.700
You can do it. So

115
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.980
everybody wants to know exactly what happened. I think,

116
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.340
but I know a few people that know exactly what happened.

117
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.370
<v 0>I know the machines and all that type of,</v>

118
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.150
but when they take the machines away and they say, okay, we're counting these.

119
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.100
And by hand, the results of that have to be official. Yeah.

120
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.100
Well they understand like the machines, but they was like,

121
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.930
these melon was they, they had to count every vote.

122
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.720
<v 1>Yeah. It's a matter of how they're recording it. Right.</v>

123
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.240
You would want to make sure that everybody recorded it accurately.

124
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.950
I don't know how they do it. But I would imagine that when I,

125
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.100
when I was talking to a guy like Mike Baker and he was saying that even if there

126
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.710
was fraud, there's not enough fraud to overturn it.

127
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.700
I would imagine he knows some things. Yeah. I don't,

128
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.810
I'm a moron. So me talking about, he w we all do that. You know, we talk about,

129
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:19.910
he won. She won and there's no way there was fraud, or it was definitely fraud.

130
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.550
Or I think Trump won by a landslide. Like people get, they get real,

131
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.050
um, connected.

132
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.080
They get real connected to who's who's winning or losing this election.

133
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:29.914
And I get it.

134
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.780
<v 0>Man. I'm going Ms. Donald Trump, sir. Yo, I like not going anywhere, man. TV,</v>

135
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.620
bad, man. I been missing him on TV. This is TV.

136
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:43.150
Persona is what sucks. What sucks that it's his TV persona is like,

137
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.463
he's a TV.

138
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.660
<v 1>It sucks that it's even possible that someone could monkey with an</v>

139
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.500
election to the point where you change the outcome.

140
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.280
It sucks that that's even a thought that we could get into our head.

141
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.650
That's what's one of the crazy things about people were so nuts.

142
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.700
But if we believe in a side,

143
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.830
like people that are good people we'll do some shady to have their candidate

144
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:12.010
win. Yeah, for sure. That's politics.

145
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.260
We're so crazy.

146
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.190
<v 0>That's politics. Anything goes, anything goes.</v>

147
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.480
<v 1>What bothers me? And I do think that Biden won the election.</v>

148
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:25.390
And I do think that, I mean, I think there's probably some shenanigans,

149
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.270
but I think the result is most likely correct,

150
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.740
but it bothers me that there's even a question.

151
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.430
It bothers me that anyone would ever think that anyone could fail.

152
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.430
But I think that there's Republicans, the Democrats could do it.

153
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.910
And I think there's Democrats that think Republicans can do it. And I think

154
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.710
it's, it's going to be real hard to 100% trust the election.

155
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.030
That's one of the things that's kind of dangerous about someone going after it.

156
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.410
This election is rigged the selections rig when Trump is doing that,

157
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.970
he's encouraging P and you know, maybe that's a good thing if they are rigged,

158
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.790
because maybe they're going to be able to figure out how to stop that from

159
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:05.130
happening in the future. Or maybe it's going to road,

160
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.650
or maybe it's going to road people's confidence in the elections.

161
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.230
And the more he does it, the mortar roads and the market's dangerous.

162
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.400
There's a real argument for that too. But it looks, and again, I'm,

163
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.780
I don't know what the I'm talking about.

164
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.470
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

165
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.590
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

166
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.020
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

167
00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:30.740
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

168
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.730
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

169
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.560
That's all we're asking you. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.

170
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>
