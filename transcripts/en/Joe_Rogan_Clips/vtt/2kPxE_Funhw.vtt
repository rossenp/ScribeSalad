00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.590
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.670
<v 1>3, 2, 1. Stir it up.</v>

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.780
Nick we're live.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.510
<v 2>Hello everyone. Hello, everyone.</v>

5
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.600
<v 1>Put the, uh, ear cups on and cheers.</v>

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.390
<v 2>Um, and thank you, Joe. Thanks for being here, man. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.510
Thank you for bringing me out here, man. I know we meant to do this before,

8
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:23.570
but I hope now with all this good energy between us,

9
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:25.100
we can do this properly for you. Yeah.

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.310
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. Listen, man,</v>

11
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:33.020
to say that you've had a crazy experience in this life is one of

12
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:37.100
the most understated things a person could ever say. I mean,

13
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.570
where do we begin? Right? Let's tell everybody your story.

14
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.080
So you were wrongfully committed of murder.

15
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.270
You spent 22 years on death row before you were

16
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:52.640
exonerated by DNA evidence.

17
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.850
<v 2>Hello everyone.</v>

18
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.860
My name is Nick Harris and I was ex Joe said convicted

19
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.410
and sentenced to die for rape and murder.

20
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:06.920
I didn't commit at the age of 21 in 1981,

21
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.170
a woman named Mrs. Craig was murdered in Delaware.

22
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.480
I have never met the woman.

23
00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:18.740
I was in prison on unrelated charges and I stupidly made up a story to try and

24
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:20.060
get out of those charges.

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.850
The police soon realized that I was a liar and they fabricated the

26
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:30.200
charges around me then. So it's ironic. Then in a few days,

27
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:33.980
you're going to upper Darby, Pennsylvania, and that's where the murder happened.

28
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:36.680
Really? Basically. And Linda May,

29
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:41.420
Craig was leaving her job at 4:05 PM on December 15th, 1981.

30
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.780
She's going home. She gets abducted. I don't know any of this,

31
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.630
but I tried in desperations to get out of a lie that this officer put on me for.

32
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:52.010
I, I got pulled over in a stolen car. The cop beats me up.

33
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.070
He puts charges on me. I'm facing life imprisonment.

34
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.220
And I'm a junkie because all of my life,

35
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:01.130
I was destroyed by what happened to me at the age of seven.

36
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360
I had my head beaten in, by a man with a rock in his hand,

37
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.950
after he sexually assaulted me.

38
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.180
And I did all the stupid things that people can do in the aftermath.

39
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.990
I kept it a secret and I let it foster all the anger in me.

40
00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:19.280
I became very aggressive as a child and I ended up in trouble all the time.

41
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.750
And when I was in prison on these unrelated charges to the murder,

42
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790
I stupidly fell into that mindset of desperation of trying to get out of it.

43
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.510
So the police put a prisoner in the cell next to me. He said,

44
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:35.840
I confessed to him. I was given a three-day trial.

45
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.700
I was sentenced to death and put on death row. And then stupidly,

46
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.070
I escaped from prison in 1985 and ended up on the FBI's most wanted list.

47
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.163
<v 0>Have to get out.</v>

48
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.210
<v 2>I was being transported to court and the sheriffs were being cool with me.</v>

49
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.930
At first, they were talking about what was going on in Philly.

50
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.810
They were two nice guys, like 60 S 68 67.

51
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.400
And we drove five hours from one of the hardest prisons in America called

52
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:07.234
Huntington.

53
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.370
And I left there after spending two years of my first two years in silence.

54
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.490
So if you opened your mouth, they would come in and beat your head.

55
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.900
And so I was so glad to get in the car cause my mom was waiting in my lawyer's

56
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.290
office because they were going to give me a review of my trial because they

57
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.630
withheld so much evidence.

58
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.280
So I was eager to go to court and it was the coldest day of 1985,

59
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.480
February 15th.

60
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.310
We stop at a gas station in Exton, Pennsylvania.

61
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.920
And as I got out of the car,

62
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.100
the officer driving pull past the cubicles.

63
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.060
Now we all got out of the car and ran over to the cubicle together.

64
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.920
And I went in to start a pin and the officer's holding the door for me and my

65
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.410
eyeglasses start fogging up. You know what I mean?

66
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.520
Cause you go from the freezing cold to the warm, to the cold, your eyeglasses.

67
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.630
So all I know is I turned around and I come out and he has the door like that.

68
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:03.190
And I put my head down,

69
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.600
go under his arm and I turned left and go back to the car and to do smoke a

70
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.850
cigarette. Doesn't know that his partner,

71
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.560
when a cubicle to and as I'm running back to the duty,

72
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.700
pulls his pistol out and point blank shoots at me, Joe, like, wow.

73
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.050
And as it went past my face, I was like, oh, I hit the ground.

74
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.800
I ran and he's following me with the gun. I could feel it like, um,

75
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.790
like I was waiting from the blast. Me, you know, did he shoot at you?

76
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.570
Cause he thought.

77
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.160
<v 3>I overpowered his partner. Oh he does. No. His testimony.</v>

78
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.640
<v 2>At trial was I turned around Knicks running at me. My partners down are gone.</v>

79
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.740
I pulled my gun and he runs and I,

80
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.050
I wasn't going to let a death row prisoner run.

81
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.000
So I've tried to stop him my shot. So I run around the corner. I hit the ground.

82
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:49.740
I ripped all the skin off my hands.

83
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.460
I've run around the corner and I fly towards this restaurant.

84
00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:57.570
And there's all these people innocently eating dinner and I'm running right

85
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:00.390
towards the plate glass window. Cause he ain't going to blast me. You know?

86
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.790
And I ran, like I knew he couldn't shoot.

87
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:06.150
And then I shot around the corner and I ran down to a gas station.

88
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:10.830
I tried to steal car that didn't work. Then I ran like 400 yards,

89
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.880
400 yards, 400 yards. And I hid behind the car. I just escaped from.

90
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.080
And I was laying in the weeds behind a gas station, about 50 yards from a mud.

91
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.780
They were screaming who was the bigger idiot for letting this happen?

92
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.500
And I was thinking, oh my God, like, what am I doing? What do I do, Joe?

93
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.920
Where like, how do I just jump up and say, wait a minute. It was a mistake.

94
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:31.320
You know, he already tried to shoot me in the face, right?

95
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:35.580
So I go hide behind the police station next four hours. Oh my God.

96
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:37.560
I'm Jane Page chased by a helicopter.

97
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.460
And he chases me and he pins me and he chases me.

98
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.470
And I was so fit that I ran for four hours through the woods without care,

99
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.790
what the branches did to my face or nothing. Man. I blew out both, uh, quads.

100
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:53.700
I did my, my hamstrings. I ripped my feet open.

101
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.490
I've ran so hard in terror that I didn't care, man. And I got away and I,

102
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.850
I made it all the way to Florida and I was going to lead the country and all

103
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.880
this. And I said, I got to go back. How did you get to Florida?

104
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.860
I stole a dude's wallet, New York.

105
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:10.580
And I got on an airplane and I went down to Florida and I tried to Rob a drug

106
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:14.690
dealer and I tried to do just, I was sitting there. I was so angry.

107
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:18.260
I was going to kill myself. I was on, uh, I'll never forget this day.

108
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.780
I didn't want my folks to see me in prison handcuffs no more. You know?

109
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.190
So I was going by a raft and was going to go out in the ocean and I was going to

110
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:30.530
have one last party. But all the foods that I loved,

111
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.730
then I was going to stab the raft, wait for the sharks, had to cut my wrists.

112
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:39.170
You know, now let's go to cap myself and go. Then I said, no, I'm going back.

113
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.280
So I turned myself back in, they put me on death row in Florida.

114
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.830
And I went back in my face that, you know, say beat me for four minutes, man.

115
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.210
They broke my face, broke my back, crushed me, man,

116
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.640
tortured me. And I thought, I'm going to get you back. You know,

117
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.390
for all the days you made me go in a cage and beat some other prisoner.

118
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:05.180
While you stood there with a club laughing at me, I'm going to get you back.

119
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.480
I'm gonna make sure I start being a loving person again.

120
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.670
So I'm sitting there in 19 85,

121
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.780
19 86 with 105 years plus a death penalty. And I decided,

122
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.970
this. I'm going to be a nice guy. So I started to learn,

123
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.010
okay. I suffer from a phasia.

124
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.920
I had my head beaten and when a rock sewed it, what is aphasia?

125
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.940
Aphasia can be identified simply in people who have stuttering disorder,

126
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.160
their brain and their of vernacular abilities are

127
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:42.230
distorted by a disruption in her brain.

128
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.010
Either their brain is functioning too fast or their mouth is functioning too

129
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:46.844
fast.

130
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.470
There's a combination of misfiring and aphasia can be

131
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.930
through trauma or through genetics and aphasia effected my life so much as a

132
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:57.591
young person.

133
00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:01.040
I never had the respect to listen to people because I couldn't function.

134
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.340
I couldn't articulate. I couldn't speak. When I was at trial.

135
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.270
People spoke words that I didn't understand and it frustrated me.

136
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.560
And when I tried to speak and I stuttered people would be like, dad, come on,

137
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:16.910
retard. What he got to say? So after that beaten,

138
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.430
would they beat me for four minutes and he broke face.

139
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.690
I began practicing speaking to myself every day.

140
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.940
I learned new words and I taught myself how to correctly articulate

141
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:35.690
that word into a sentence beautifully from my own self,

142
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.480
my cell every day. And then I became very,

143
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.700
very good at writing. I began helping other prisoners.

144
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.230
I became the most dangerous prisoner that they held because I cared about other

145
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:54.410
men. I wrote to their mothers. I wrote letters to their lawyers.

146
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.530
I gave opportunities for people to write books about me so I could help another

147
00:08:58.531 --> 00:08:59.191
innocent man.

148
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:02.910
I did all those things because that's how I got back at him for like they did to

149
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.390
me. So in 1988,

150
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.250
I'm sitting in my cell and I read about DNA and I knew right

151
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.600
then I could prove my innocence.

152
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.580
So I was the first man in America and February of 1988 to ask for DNA

153
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.960
testing, to prove my innocence. And he threw away all the autopsy material.

154
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.880
And when I discovered new evidence that destroyed that and his woman who came to

155
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:30.180
meet me and start visiting me, fell in love with me. And she believed in me.

156
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:34.250
So she stood by me and told me that she would be with me

157
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.870
either to the gallows walk or to the moment I approve medicines.

158
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.310
And for nine years he stood by me, you know? And finally

159
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.280
we found some evidence that was testable in 1995. What, what was the evidence?

160
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.990
It was sperm from the rape and it was being sent out here to California,

161
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:58.640
to Dr. Deb, Edward Blake. And it broke open and transport spilled.

162
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.460
So Jackie left me, had nothing left.

163
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.750
And then they put me in a special unit and it started torturing me.

164
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.140
I keep this part quiet. I never told the story.

165
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.100
It would ruin what happened in fear with 13. It's now out on Netflix,

166
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.230
but they finally closed down the old prison.

167
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.520
I was in for 12 years where the average rate of survival was only five.

168
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.520
And I was wanting heart as Jews there. And I made it,

169
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.450
they closed the prison down and open up green county supermax.

170
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.230
And the courts ordered that every prisoner in Pennsylvania be loud,

171
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.300
other sell for eight hours. The administration looked at each other as that.

172
00:10:41.301 --> 00:10:43.610
Not the crazy cannibals, not the serial killers,

173
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.430
not the dudes that have been assault and rape in each other.

174
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.690
So they picked 48 of us out and they put us in Pittsburgh in a special

175
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.320
penitentiary setting in which we were in a sealed unit.

176
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.960
And they put all these guards in there.

177
00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.140
They weren't allowed to touch other prisoners because they were so violent and

178
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:04.220
told them there were giving you the craziest of the crazy, you know,

179
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.310
Buffalo bill from silence of the lamb was a real man, right?

180
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.170
His name was Gary hygienic.

181
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.320
He abducted black women in Philadelphia and put them in a pit under his house

182
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:15.710
and fed one of them to the other survivors because he was building a master

183
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:19.100
race. He was my neighbor man, like,

184
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:21.920
so they started torturing us and doing all this psychological,

185
00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:25.280
crazy to his word, a refeed and this to each other like wolves.

186
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.110
So I kept it all quiet until this year. When, once again,

187
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:33.040
misfortune fell on my life and I released, Monster's a madman,

188
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.080
a new book that I was going to give you today. And I thought,

189
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.540
and I got to tell that story, you know,

190
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.980
but it's been so hard to come back from these moments, Joe. It's just like,

191
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.420
I look at what they did to me and how I went to that moment,

192
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:50.480
where to DNA is gone. Jackie leaves me.

193
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.690
And so I find I'm dying from hepatitis C that they did when, uh,

194
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.520
they infected me of it when they broke my teeth, when they beat me.

195
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.140
So I asked to be executed. I said,

196
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.840
I studied all the world's religions. I read over 9,000 books.

197
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.290
I did everything in piety. My mother asked me to do,

198
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.430
I don't want a guide like Dale Carter did with the cards,

199
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:23.650
come into a cell and taught them, you know,

200
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.020
teasing them and listen to a man scream in agony because the bile in his belly

201
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.730
is killing them. So I wrote to the courts and asked to be executed. I said,

202
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.410
it, man. I want to die as a man.

203
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:40.870
I love who can respect himself.

204
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.650
The court intervened and ordered DNA testing that was going to be done on

205
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:52.330
evidence is spelled in July of 2003.

206
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.000
The DNA test come back and he proved me innocent.

207
00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.540
<v 1>So the, the D evidence spilled and they just captured it. Once it spilled.</v>

208
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.950
<v 2>It was in a box would all this evidence and Dr. Edward Blake,</v>

209
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:09.180
who did the OJ Simpson trial DNA said that there would be challenges to it.

210
00:13:09.181 --> 00:13:13.530
If he did the DNA in 19 99, 19 98, in 2003,

211
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:17.280
they had advanced mitochondrial DNA separation. So welded,

212
00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:21.660
he felt confident in his results. So the federal court got involved and said,

213
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:25.680
look, I don't want to have this man executed. I want the DNA done.

214
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.080
So they did that. And it was amazing that on the day that I called the lawyers,

215
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.510
they revealed a truth to me. I called his lawyer and I'm like, what's up?

216
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.100
He goes, Nick, we got DNA from three separate sources that prove you innocent.

217
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.070
I said, that's amazing, Mike. I, uh, I'm, I'm really grateful.

218
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.300
He goes, you know,

219
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.810
we used to tell people you're crazy that we never believed in you.

220
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.370
I'm really sorry for that, man. Really?

221
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.640
You want to take away my joy now, man.

222
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.500
So I was really downcast at the day. I called my mother, my brother,

223
00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:04.771
Mike.

224
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:08.100
He was having a seizure at her feet cause he was an alcoholic after he fell off

225
00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:10.380
a roof and he died shortly after. So.

226
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.983
<v 0>It just went.</v>

227
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.180
<v 2>Crazy from there. They take me off death row and they put me in a psychological</v>

228
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.580
cell and they tell me they can't trust me that no human being

229
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.620
that is had done to them.

230
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:30.510
What we've done to you can not be angry that we opened this door up and we'd

231
00:14:30.511 --> 00:14:32.580
let you out. You're going to get us.

232
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.550
So we're going to leave you until the day they let you out.

233
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.660
We're going to leave you in this cell because we don't trust you not to kill us

234
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.790
for what we did to you. What did they do to you?

235
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.100
That he used to have a thing called gladiator day

236
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.310
said a Lieutenant will be off on a Sunday.

237
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:56.390
And the guards who started to come from the Philadelphia area

238
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.660
were black and they didn't like the guards up in the hillbillies beaten on black

239
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:00.290
prisoners.

240
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.490
So a weird thing happened where this Lieutenant came up with the idea we'll

241
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:05.120
look,

242
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.290
let's let the prisoners get this frustration out of you guys by you pick out the

243
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:10.940
biggest guy and you pick out this guy.

244
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.740
So one day I'm sitting there minding my own business and they open up my cell

245
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.140
and there's four of them were clubs, Europe.

246
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.490
So I gotta go in the cage and I got to go and hurt somebody while they stand

247
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:23.810
outside. And if you don't fight,

248
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:26.300
they're going to come in and they're going to beat you worse than you can beat a

249
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.740
man or get beaten by one man.

250
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.220
<v 1>So they did all this for their entertainment. Will they ever punished for this?</v>

251
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.480
<v 2>Not until after the riot,</v>

252
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.480
when one of them testified against the others for the murder and stuff,

253
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.160
I watched the 11 people commit suicide. I've been stabbed,

254
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.980
strangled, beaten, senseless.

255
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.140
The guards used to talk because I was a QS of a psychological

256
00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:01.560
murder of going out and stalk and his poor woman because she looked like my

257
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:04.290
girlfriend. They said I was never treated like a prisoner.

258
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.390
I was treated with deference. The worst word I know in English dictionary,

259
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.050
the way I was treated was so harsh that it was cruel beyond cruel.

260
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:18.900
And yet all I wanted to do was have enough

261
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.420
within me to learn the beautifully speaks.

262
00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:23.250
It didn't want a date at the executed me.

263
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.400
I could tell them how much I cared about myself.

264
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.860
I was more important to me than living because

265
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.940
somehow when you suffer,

266
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.480
like I have suffered your head cracks open,

267
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.900
and you have Hybris sensitivity to life

268
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.390
so that when you touch the human beings, you never forget the 14 years,

269
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.130
no one was allowed to touch you. You know what? this.

270
00:16:53.131 --> 00:16:54.030
I ain't crying in war.

271
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.820
<v 1>It's all right, man. There's nothing wrong with crying. I just.</v>

272
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.893
<v 4>Thought about it.</v>

273
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.061
<v 2>I do,</v>

274
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:03.720
because I feel if we're to you shouldn't know because I look in your arms and,

275
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.250
and your eyes and I see the hurt that I'm causing you. No, no.

276
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.880
<v 1>No, no, no. Don't worry about that, man.</v>

277
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.490
All I'm doing is trying to imagine what your life has been like.

278
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:15.690
Don't you worry about me at all.

279
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:22.080
<v 2>I'm harder than life and I'm kinder than love secretly. I'm a Saint.</v>

280
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.030
I never hurt anyone.

281
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.980
I tried my best to be played every day and I've had misfortune

282
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.503
and I've returned

283
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.750
and a very sorry that I sit in his chair today after

284
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.940
it came about you see, I believe in good.

285
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.070
I believe good is going to win Joe.
