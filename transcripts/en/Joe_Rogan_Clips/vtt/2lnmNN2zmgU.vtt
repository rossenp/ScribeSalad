00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.020
Have you spent any time at all playing virtual reality games?

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.320
<v 1>I it's funny. I, when I was doing the research for this book,</v>

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.400
I spoke to a game designer, um, brilliant guy at NYU.

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.320
He sent the NYU game center named Bennett Fati, and, um, he teaches,

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.790
he teaches game design. He's designed a number of, of phenomenal games himself.

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.210
And he told me something that I found fascinating and I took it on board.

8
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:32.870
He said to me, uh, I asked him about world of Warcraft and I said, you know,

9
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:35.330
do you enjoy it? What do you think about it? And he said to me,

10
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:40.190
I know that if I start playing that game, I either don't play it at all.

11
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:44.570
Or I'm going to basically be giving up years of my life and I don't have the

12
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:48.470
time to do that. So I just have never even opened the game to play it.

13
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:51.080
It's just not something I want to do. And that's,

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.500
that's how I have felt about most of those experiences.

15
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:58.340
I did play one virtual reality game. Um, it was with a haptic suit.

16
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:02.950
So it basically fits over you. It was this Ghostbusters game and I,

17
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:06.050
I grew up watching Ghostbusters and loved it. So, so the,

18
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.350
the ghosts fly through you and you could feel the suit compresses.

19
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:12.380
And so it feels like they're actually kind of budding into which maybe it

20
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:14.650
doesn't make much sense cause they're ghosts, but you,

21
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:18.290
you fly around with one of the little Ghostbusters guns and you're in New York

22
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:22.130
city and you're running around. This was a 10 minute experience.

23
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.530
But if you had told me that I could give up the next 48 hours of my life,

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.160
put on the suit, run around, no food, just,

25
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.660
just do this for 48 hours.

26
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.810
It was so incredibly immersive and engaging and interesting.

27
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.080
I would have done it. It was, it was amazing. And it wasn't even like,

28
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.200
that's not even where we're going with this stuff. This was, you know,

29
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:44.870
step one out of step 10 in terms of sophistication.

30
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.600
This is the early days it's only going to get more compelling.

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.090
<v 0>Aware of sandbox. You've heard of the company. Sandbox sandbox is a,</v>

32
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.730
it's a virtual reality game destination.

33
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:59.720
So you go to this place and it's essentially a warehouse. And inside of it,

34
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.980
they have these arenas set up for games and a series of games that you play.

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.480
And I plan with my whole family.

36
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:09.440
We put the haptic feedback suits on virtual reality helmets and you kill

37
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.650
zombies. You fight off skeletons on a pirate ship.

38
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.750
There's a bunch of games and it is wild. And you, you see it and you go,

39
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.130
I see where this is going. Like this is right now, pretty immersive,

40
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.030
pretty immersive, really, really fun, very engaging, exciting to do.

41
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:26.811
But you know,

42
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.200
for a fact that it's just going to keep getting better and keep getting better.

43
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.970
And right now it's insanely addictive.

44
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:35.670
Like I get so pumped up to do it when we do like, I'll go with my family,

45
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.830
like every couple of weeks or so.

46
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.440
And we get so excited when we're on our way over there.

47
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.590
Luckily it's got a set time. It's,

48
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.800
it's a one hour experience and when it's over, it's over. But my God, you know,

49
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:46.880
you're, you're in it.

50
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.580
Like there's one of them where you're in a haunted house and you're fighting off

51
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:52.880
zombies and they're just running at you like hundreds of them and you're gunning

52
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.240
them down. It's so exciting when they get ahold of you,

53
00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:00.430
you feel their touch like in the haptic feedback and you see red in front of

54
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.130
your face, like you're getting torn apart. It's wild.

55
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.140
And you know that this is essentially like doom, right? If you play doom today,

56
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.960
it's the pixels are enormous. It's just like,

57
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.880
it looks clunky and squarish and blockage. And I mean, it's fun still,

58
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.710
but it's so,

59
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.660
it's so crude in comparison to a modern game,

60
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.910
you know, the modern games have like,

61
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.150
there's a new unreal engine and we were playing a video of it the other day,

62
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:32.410
because it's so hard to believe that this is just a video game.

63
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.660
And in this, this video game,

64
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.770
the lighting and the textures and the shadows are so exact,

65
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:39.970
it's so incredible.

66
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.590
And you just have this feeling of inevitable inevitability.

67
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.060
Like there's just going to come a time where you're going to be in this virtual

68
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.960
reality thing.

69
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.120
And you're going to have a whole haptic feedback outfit from your fingers to

70
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.300
your toes all over your face. And it's going to,

71
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.200
it's going to be better than real life. And that's what everyone's terrified of.

72
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.230
<v 1>Yeah. And I mean, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to avoid that, right. That, uh,</v>

73
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.440
that feeling, that excitement that you have as you're about to apply,

74
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.920
imagine if that were always available to you at any moment of the day,

75
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.880
it'd be hard to resist it. Um, yeah. I, I, I, I,

76
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.530
I felt the same way about that.

77
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:22.500
That very brief experience with Ghostbusters that goes bust this game.

78
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:25.890
It was just, um, there was a level of excitement and, you know,

79
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:29.110
you used to have to kind of suspend disbelief like you, as you say, would do,

80
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.890
and you'd have the pixels and you'd be like, yeah, it's not quite real,

81
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:32.850
but it's real enough.

82
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.840
And then there was this point where everything just the processing speed,

83
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:40.020
the sophistication of the development, the design, you could make,

84
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:43.380
it seem basically real and it's only going to become more so.

85
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.170
And so you don't have to suspend disbelief at all the minute you're in that

86
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:49.830
experience, it's there it's real. It might as well be real.

87
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.120
<v 0>What bothers me is people way smarter than me that aren't worried about it.</v>

88
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.370
You know, I had John Carmack on the podcast who I'm a gigantic fan of, you know,

89
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:04.080
he's the guy who created doom and quake and engineered those engines.

90
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.280
He's his take on phones was basically, well,

91
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:10.140
people enjoy them and they make life better.

92
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.520
And he just doesn't seem to be worried at all. And, you know,

93
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:18.180
obviously he makes games and he's working with Oculus. He was at the time,

94
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:22.550
at least working with Oculus, making all these games. And, uh, he,

95
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.690
he's also a very disciplined person. So he he'll code for 16 hours a day,

96
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.500
you know? And he's also, he plays that, um,

97
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.090
there's the one game where you have the,

98
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:36.840
the drumsticks and the things are coming at you and you're swinging at the air

99
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:39.600
and knocking these things down. What is that game called? Do you know?

100
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.570
<v 1>I can't remember. I know the game. Yeah. I can't remember what it's called.</v>

101
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.260
<v 0>Beat saber. Jamie says beat saber. Um,</v>

102
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.060
but he does it at an insanely high level where he's

103
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:54.780
basically getting this wild cardio workout in like, uh,

104
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.980
like he's doing some sort of stick fighting art. You know,

105
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:02.630
it was like swinging his arms back and forth through the air and he actually

106
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.300
gets a cardio workout. Like you can do that. And there's,

107
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.760
there is some benefits too,

108
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:12.650
like there's a boxing game that you can play on Oculus, um, or no HTC, Vive.

109
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:15.830
I played it on. And when you play this boxing game, you're,

110
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:18.800
you're squaring off against the opponent. And when you get hit,

111
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.300
your screen lights up,

112
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.990
like you got hit in sparring and you can maneuver around.

113
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.400
So it's actually a workout.

114
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.510
You actually move around this person coming at you and they turn with you to try

115
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.440
to meet you. They know where you're standing and they swing at you. And you can,

116
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.040
you can do certain things where it's actually beneficial.

117
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:40.640
You can get some exercise. I've seen some of 'em, uh,

118
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.300
they're in engineering now with, uh, omnidirectional treadmills.

119
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.750
So you have a harness around your waist.

120
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.780
You're connected in position on this omni-directional treadmill.

121
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:54.470
So you can go any way you want and you're running and you're shooting at things

122
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:58.190
and running and you get this great workout while you're having fun.

123
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.440
So it's not all doom and gloom.

124
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.520
<v 1>No, I totally agree.</v>

125
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:07.930
I think there's a temptation to fall on one end of the spectrum or the other.

126
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:10.750
And I don't think that makes sense as with most issues in life. You know,

127
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:13.150
there's, there's some nuance that's got to come in. Um,

128
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.610
so there are people who will just talk about, you know,

129
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:16.960
screens are going to be the end of the world.

130
00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:19.360
And then there are people who will say, there's absolutely no problem.

131
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:22.000
And everything we're doing is good for us and healthy and making the world

132
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:24.940
better. And that the, you know, the truth is somewhere in the middle.

133
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.660
And I think it also varies by,

134
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:29.380
by the person and what kind of experiences you're having.

135
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.410
If you're someone who is sedentary, you, weren't working out,

136
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:36.280
you weren't moving. And suddenly you find this game that encourages you to,

137
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.080
to run and move around. That's got to have some beneficial effects. Um, if you,

138
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.910
if you're someone who's a naturally disciplined, like John Carmack, then great,

139
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.160
then you know, you're able to say,

140
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.250
I'm going to take the best from screens and I'm going to resist the worst.

141
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.830
And I'm just going to move on with my life. But you know,

142
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.790
the data don't lie and the data suggests that the amount of time we're spending

143
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:59.830
in front of screens has gone up dramatically.

144
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.220
And when you speak to people about it, they don't say, I'm happy about that.

145
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.720
They say, what, what is going on? Where is all that time going? So, so that's,

146
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.450
that to me is the, the most compelling thing that we want to try to work out.

147
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.770
How do we extract the best and leave behind the worst with, with screens,

148
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:17.590
with any kind of technology, with any kind of shift in the world.

149
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.320
You always want to try to do that across the population,

150
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.030
find the stuff that's damaging,

151
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:26.100
weeded out and find the stuff that's useful and try to capitalize on it and

152
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.660
emphasize that. I think that's what, um,

153
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.720
that's what this project is all about is it's a,

154
00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:34.300
it's about certainly not throwing out the baby with the bath water and not,

155
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.170
not trying to roll back to the 1950s here. We want to retain the screens,

156
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:41.050
but work out the best way to use them and the best way for us to resist them

157
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:41.884
when we need to do that.

158
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.200
<v 0>Yeah. These a dance, dance revolution, people, they figured out a way how to,</v>

159
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.760
how to get something positive out of a video game, right?

160
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.580
There's a lot of people that played that game that lost a ton of weight.

161
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.490
So there are some things that you could say would be beneficial because the game

162
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:04.200
is addictive, but while it's addictive, you're also getting in shape.

163
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.580
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's a, there's a good example.</v>

164
00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:09.170
So that there's the physical side of it.

165
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.980
And then of course like the mental experience of being on screens can be very,

166
00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:15.560
very positive for us too. Um, you know,

167
00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:17.960
you're learning languages that you wouldn't have otherwise been able to learn.

168
00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:18.240
You're,

169
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.590
you're being exposed to people and experiences that you could neither experience

170
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:24.020
because you live far away from them. Um,

171
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.760
I moved to the U S in 2004 from Australia. And, um, you know,

172
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.930
it's hard to believe it's only 16 years ago, but this is before YouTube.

173
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.810
This is the same year that Facebook came about. Um,

174
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.290
I couldn't really find a good enough internet connection to be able to speak

175
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:40.910
with video to my family in Australia.

176
00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:42.410
And that only came a couple of years later.

177
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.040
So that's a miracle that during this time of locked down,

178
00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:48.020
when we're also far apart from each other,

179
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.710
we are able to actually communicate through these screens in a way that's

180
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.210
basically seamless.

181
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.090
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

182
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.240
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

183
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:04.670
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

184
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:08.360
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

185
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.380
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

186
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.070
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.
