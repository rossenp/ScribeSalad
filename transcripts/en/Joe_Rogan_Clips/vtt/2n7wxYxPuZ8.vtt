00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.540
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.340
I started my immigration process when he got elected. Oh no,

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.980
it's, it's, it's been a trip. You know.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.060
<v 1>How does that work?</v>

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.440
Like if you are a Mexican born citizen and you want to become a United States

6
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.760
citizen, obviously it's very.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.470
<v 0>Difficult, but so married to an American, having an American kid.</v>

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.430
That's how I went through the process myself. And, uh, you know,

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:34.050
I got a green card. Um, the, the thing is that when he got elected,

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.580
everybody said, you know what?

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.580
Maybe our time to get a green card is going to get be less and less.

12
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:40.020
So let's all try and get one.

13
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
So what would take normally six months to two years. Oh, wow.

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.770
So those two years you can't leave the country.

15
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.320
<v 1>So if you w what happens to people that are illegal, that's, what's up about it,</v>

16
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.270
right? So like, there's people that came over here illegally 20, 30 years ago,

17
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.380
and they've done no crimes. They've been an integral part of society.

18
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:06.060
They've had great lives, but they, they can't pay taxes. They can't vote.

19
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.520
They have to live undercover.

20
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, that's stupid. They're they're, uh, you know, and they do provide,</v>

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820
you know, they do provide, they pay taxes through other.

22
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.670
<v 1>Sales tax, buying things, but they're not paying taxes. They're not,</v>

23
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.320
but if you made them citizens, you would make money. Yeah.

24
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.180
<v 0>Well, it's not a popular view.</v>

25
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.580
<v 1>It's a stupid view. It's just,</v>

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.200
it's stupid that we have these people and they're permanent illegals and they

27
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.680
will be here until they die illegally. And we know they're here. Like,

28
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.630
how about work with what you've got? Look,

29
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:43.260
you've already do you do in your best to stop the border traffic. Great.

30
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.820
Fantastic. But listen, let's just forget about the past. These people are here,

31
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.000
they're here and they're a part of our community. Like, how are you,

32
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.640
how are you going to deny them citizenship to the day they die?

33
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.653
And they're still here.

34
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.730
<v 0>Well, legal immigration. And it's like, I went through is hard enough.</v>

35
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.910
<v 1>You got to find some American lady that's just difficult.</v>

36
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.520
<v 0>Yeah, I did. You know, and, uh, you know, but it,</v>

37
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:13.410
it was a hard process. Uh it's uh, it's, it's, it's a difficult process.

38
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.480
<v 1>And you speak fluent English.</v>

39
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.790
<v 0>I, yes. That's another thing. I saw people in the line with me, uh,</v>

40
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.840
you know, that did not speak a lick of English,

41
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.250
but they were from a country that had a quota and, uh.

42
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.430
<v 1>Like Holland or some from.</v>

43
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.790
<v 0>A country that has a quota. But you don't, you're not, you're not.</v>

44
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.680
<v 1>Car for Canadians, man.</v>

45
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.280
I have friends from Canada that come over here to try to become citizens.

46
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.870
It's a grind.

47
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.770
<v 0>Yeah. And, and, and, and don't get me wrong. I love this country a bit.</v>

48
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.930
I'm new here. And I like what I see.

49
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.530
I don't like where it's going in some places, what don't you like? Uh,

50
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:53.940
I don't like, I mean,

51
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:57.510
I left my country because I couldn't defend myself from the bad people out.

52
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.410
<v 1>There who the second.</v>

53
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.590
<v 0>Amendment second amendment.</v>

54
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.100
<v 1>Is. It's a beautiful thing. You have no idea how beautiful that thing is.</v>

55
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.820
Tell you don't have an option to have it. That's one thing, uh,

56
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.080
I like the opportunities this country provides. I've had a lot of opportunities.

57
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.680
I would never get anywhere else. I like to actually work and work your,

58
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:19.360
the work you put in matters here. Um, I like, uh,

59
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.160
I like how it's segmented in different.

60
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.540
You go to Tennessee and you meet people out there and they're great people,

61
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.590
you know, there's some, you know,

62
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.590
people have preconceived notions of what some part of the countries are,

63
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.424
but I've loved it.

64
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.090
And then you go to California and you meet people that are on the same boat as I

65
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.700
was. And they're forgot completely what Mexico is.

66
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:40.510
And they're completely Americanized Americanized.

67
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:44.470
And they're completely against you as a new, as a new person here. Yeah.

68
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.000
So you find that re like Americanized Mexicans or, or, or like second,

69
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.530
third generation Mexicans, a word.

70
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.950
<v 0>First enemy of a Mexican is another Mexican. That's that classic.</v>

71
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.450
That's a classic, that's a classic Mexican saying. And it's true. That's.

72
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.490
<v 1>A classic Mexican saying that really.</v>

73
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.970
<v 0>Most of the negativity, negativity I got from being on your show,</v>

74
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:08.110
the first time was from Latinos, specifically, Mexican Latinos.

75
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.090
<v 1>What was the negativity? What was their criticism?</v>

76
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.570
<v 0>Uh, when I talked about how Mexicans protested,</v>

77
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.570
the caravans going through Tijuana and wrecking their city,

78
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.370
that was viewed as extreme to the right or conservative viewpoint

79
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.593
apparently.

80
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.190
<v 1>But yeah, but that was a fact.</v>

81
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.980
<v 0>But yeah, the apparently facts don't matter. Oh.</v>

82
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.800
<v 1>Oh, that's so silly. But that's people, that's, that's a good,</v>

83
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.260
that's a good example of people that are not there to talking about it.

84
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.900
You're not saying you didn't make a value judgment saying that those people

85
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:42.760
coming through were protested by Mexicans needed to go back to wherever rice

86
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.320
Patty they come from. You didn't say any of that.

87
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.520
<v 0>No. So th so this is what I saw when I, when I talked about it, uh,</v>

88
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.620
because I experienced it. I wasn't, uh,

89
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.570
I was in TJ for a while when that was happening. Byron caravan goes through,

90
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.900
obviously a lot of those guys were gang members.

91
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.050
A lot of them were not all of them. A lot of them were covering tattoos.

92
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.370
It's pretty hot outside wearing all the Wharton goodies cameras came by the

93
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:07.600
females and the children won't be in,

94
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.720
put in front parade in front of the media to anybody who was there.

95
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:12.190
You could see the circus that was going on.

96
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.220
And then a lot of the, a lot of the, uh, camp encampments,

97
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.170
they would, they would, you know, litter,

98
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.090
the encampments would needle on the outside.

99
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.490
One of them was next to a school that had to be closed down.

100
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.200
A niece of mine had a kid in there,

101
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.600
and the school had to be closed down because it was next to one of these

102
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.240
encampments. They would protest and close down lanes.

103
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.440
Most people that live in TJ, uh, some of them are Americans and they commute.

104
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.930
So that's affecting their livelihood. You know,

105
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.200
people that work on tourism and TJ white liquid went down.

106
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.530
So the fact that these people came in and disrupted all that whole thing,

107
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.870
and then you would see these, uh, Californian,

108
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.520
hippy Americans guys come down there and do puppet shows for these people and

109
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.210
handover, uh, donations in the form of canned food blankets and stuff like that.

110
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:58.430
And then you would see these guys go to the back door and sell all that stuff in

111
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:01.610
the back and just get money for whatever they were going to get the money for.

112
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.130
We would laugh at it, but it also, you know,

113
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:09.080
it's pretty disheartening having that point of view online because I started

114
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:11.780
posting some of this stuff online for people. This is what's happening.

115
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.770
And that was like, no, no, no. You're going against the narrative narrative.

116
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.270
<v 1>Yeah. The narrative and the, and the people that are talking about you going,</v>

117
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.780
yes. The narrative, really no idea. They don't care about the truth. That's,

118
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:25.460
what's crazy. The absolute.

119
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.800
<v 0>There's a thing. So if you're against,</v>

120
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.340
if you're against this caravan going through Tijuana and effecting your you're

121
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.970
probably a Trump supporter. That's that's, and I'm like this simple,

122
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.380
I can't even vote here yet.

123
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.410
You don't have to be a full citizen to vote so that it doesn't even factor in

124
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.950
on.

125
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.970
<v 1>Oh, God. It's so crazy. What else about America bothers you?</v>

126
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.400
<v 0>Uh, I think, uh,</v>

127
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.680
there's,

128
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.450
there's definitely this tendency in America that I see the youth in America,

129
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.370
like, uh, like, um, I have,

130
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.480
I have a weird mental comparison of seeing my nephews down there,

131
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.280
playing soccer, um, going out and getting into trouble, uh,

132
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.830
going to cockfights, which is probably pretty dangerous,

133
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:11.150
but they go to cockfight, stuff like that.

134
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.800
And I see kids up here on their tablet, you know, playing games.

135
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.700
<v 1>Playing video games.</v>

136
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.810
<v 0>Uh, getting offended by something, you know, down there.</v>

137
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.660
You can still punch somebody in the face. If they get into your face in school.

138
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.880
<v 1>You're allowed to do that in school. I mean.</v>

139
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.570
<v 0>There's, there's going to be some issues, but it's fine. You know, there's,</v>

140
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.390
there's still that, you know, up here, it's gone. All of that's gone.

141
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.050
You're going to get into some issues,

142
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.550
probably going to get out of school or something. You know, you see this weird.

143
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.700
<v 1>Classification of American children, safe spaces.</v>

144
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.860
<v 0>Don't say that that's politically incorrect.</v>

145
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.440
<v 1>It's a good word for it.</v>

146
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.590
What's the police come up with a politically correct word for that.

147
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:50.690
That has just as much kick and I'll use that.

148
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.093
<v 0>And I know.</v>

149
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.540
<v 1>They can't, it doesn't exist. It's the pussification.</v>

150
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.620
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, and, and w when I came up here,</v>

151
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.290
like the first year I was up here, uh,

152
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.980
I saw the California gun laws change.

153
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.660
Like I got to see the weird California compliant rifles come to the

154
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.290
range and you have to push a button to release the magazine and.

155
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.950
<v 1>Yeah. And make it more difficult to reload. Yeah.</v>

156
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.240
<v 0>So strange. Well, I mean, if, if, if, if, uh,</v>

157
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.460
I've never seen a California compliant gun in the hands of a criminal myself.

158
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.170
Right. So why, why are the good, like the good citizens falling along?

159
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.430
<v 1>Yeah. The idea that you're just kind of handicap law, abiding citizen citizens,</v>

160
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.360
and that's going to somehow, or another save lives in mass shootings.

161
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.300
And here's the other thing about you, and I'm waiting for this to happen,

162
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:48.530
but it's just not happening.

163
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.220
They're never addressing people using psychotropic drugs. They're not,

164
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.560
they don't address that. All those school shooters,

165
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.970
all those mass shooters are all on drugs.

166
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.030
They're all on some kind of psych drugs. And there's,

167
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.430
there's no mention of it whatsoever. Like what,

168
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.750
what is the action of these things?

169
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.590
It's all about the guns and the guns are a huge issue. I mean,

170
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.160
the fact that these people who are up and yeah, they,

171
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.120
that they have access and they can get access to these guns and they can wind up

172
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:19.140
shooting people. Yes. That is one issue. Security is another issue.

173
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.960
There's another issue and that's mental health. And this,

174
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.660
that to me is the biggest one, because without the mental health issue,

175
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:25.440
you don't get.

176
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.273
<v 0>Yeah. Shooters.</v>

177
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.120
And that's a interesting thing we do when I get people in conversations about

178
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.240
the violence in Mexico and, uh, perspective,

179
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.440
Mexico cartel guys, you know, go into a town, shoot up a bunch of people.

180
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:40.380
And it's pretty horrible. Uh, but on the Mexican side,

181
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:44.880
we only had one school shooting, uh, that like a notable one. Right.

182
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.240
And it was mentally old kid when you took a gun to school. Right.

183
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.490
And as Mexicans,

184
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:53.160
we look at what happens in the U S in schools and we're horrified by it.

185
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:57.000
That's like completely, you know, horrific, not amazing.

186
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.520
It's again, being on both sides. I'm just trying to figure things.

187
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.220
<v 1>I knew about pharmaceuticals being prescribed to children in Mexico.</v>

188
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.150
Is it similar.

189
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.620
<v 0>At all? I mean, w we're still behind in some, in some instances,</v>

190
00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:14.370
as far as you know, I didn't know about PTSD.

191
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:18.740
So I came up here or TBI, right? Yeah. I didn't know anything about that.

192
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.190
<v 1>When did you learn about.</v>

193
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.080
<v 0>TBI? When I started talking about.</v>

194
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.530
<v 1>We should say what that is a post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain</v>

195
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:26.850
injuries for people. Like.

196
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.863
<v 0>I learned about it.</v>

197
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.770
I learned about it from talking to most of my Marine friends that were coming

198
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:34.290
back from there. Like he had,

199
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:38.340
like what you're describing that you're feeling sounds like TBI. Really? Yeah.

200
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.390
You should get yourself checked out and then you go down there. I was like, ah,

201
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.600
you know, things would happen. And people would get, you know,

202
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.060
get a few days off, take a few shots of tequila. You're fine.

203
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.273
Get back at it.

204
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.890
<v 1>Well, that's the old school mentality. I mean,</v>

205
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:58.950
that's what they deal with in world war two and Vietnam and.

206
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.400
<v 0>Yeah, but you've got, I mean, when it comes to that,</v>

207
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:06.750
but mental health down in Mexico, there's like, it's not, it's not anywhere.

208
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.100
As far as medicating it, kids being diagnosed with things like autism.

209
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.050
Autism is a thing that I only recently kind of heard about 15 years ago

210
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.920
in Mexico.

211
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.340
<v 1>In Mexico. And what about, um,</v>

212
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.420
anti-psychotic drugs and all these different drugs that you're seeing,

213
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:25.350
that these, a lot of these.

214
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.530
<v 0>School shooters are taking in Mexico. It's not a thing. Uh, you know,</v>

215
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.350
people think that it's pretty permissive in Mexico. They can get any drug.

216
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.900
If you pay somebody off. The thing is that a lot of these, uh,

217
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.440
psychiatric level they're, they're not,

218
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.490
they're not available down there where people there, you can go to them.

219
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.680
They're like, what do you want now? This is not available here.

220
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.660
<v 1>So it's not a part of the cultural, it's not a.</v>

221
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.460
<v 0>Park. No, no. Yeah.</v>

222
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.910
<v 1>In America, it's such a huge part of the culture that people want,</v>

223
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.970
that people are constantly wanting to take something to take the edge off or

224
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:58.720
take something so they could feel better or take something to, you know,

225
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.530
to just to alter their state. And the doctor will prescribe it to them.

226
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.280
And then the pharmaceutical drug companies are just raking in the cash from it.

227
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.890
So it just becomes a part of reality.
