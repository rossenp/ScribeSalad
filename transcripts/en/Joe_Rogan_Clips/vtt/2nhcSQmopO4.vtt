00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.480
<v 2>Have any of the people that were initially skeptical or pushing back against the</v>

3
00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.640
idea that it came from this level four lab?

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.240
Are they coming around or are they still digging.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.040
<v 1>Their heels in? So some are, are, are coming around. And, um,</v>

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.320
so certainly there are people like, uh, like Matt Ridley,

7
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.390
who's a member of the house of, in the,

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.830
in the UK kind of very well known science communicator.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.150
He was firmly on the other side and now he started to be more open

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.510
and actually has been quite, uh, quite vocal.

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.630
<v 0>What was his motivation for being on the other side? Did he, yeah,</v>

12
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:36.230
I think that in.

13
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.820
<v 1>The,</v>

14
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.620
it's a really interesting story because in the earliest days a pandemic,

15
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:46.340
there was a concerted effort by a relatively small number of high

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.260
profile, uh, scientists, virologists who recognized, um,

17
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.620
that if the story was that this came from a series of what are called zoonotic

18
00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:01.140
jumps between animal hosts in, in the wild, that was going to lead to kind of a,

19
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.690
that have outcome where we'd say, Hey,

20
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.130
let's be very mindful of our encroachment into wild spaces, climate change,

21
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.570
all those things that we should be very mindful of, but they were,

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.690
I think probably worried, um,

23
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:16.690
that if this story became dominant of an accidental lab leak, I mean,

24
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:21.370
that would have huge implications for all of the research that people are doing.

25
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.480
And, and a is, is very well intentioned. So early last year, um,

26
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.520
there was a process where a series of, uh, of scientists did two things. One,

27
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.960
they came out with a letter in the, in the British, uh, medical journal Lancet,

28
00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:38.960
which we've subsequently learned was highly manipulated by a small number of

29
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:42.750
people who may have had vested interests. And there was a, a,

30
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.910
a academic paper and a journal called nature communications and both made the

31
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:49.070
case, oh, this isn't a lab leak.

32
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.150
And then there was a concerted effort to label anybody else as a

33
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:55.750
conspiracy theorist. And so I,

34
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.790
I kind of spent last year in that uncomfortable space. I mean, I,

35
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.500
I, I don't live my life as a conspiracy theorist.

36
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.740
I try to be data driven in everything that I do,

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.100
but I really felt that this was a very real possibility and it deserved a

38
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:15.820
full investigation. And it was only in the beginning of this year, uh,

39
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:20.500
2021, that that started to turn. I know I had, uh,

40
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.010
I wrote some things, uh, uh, someone named Nick Nichol and BAK.

41
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.010
He had a great piece in New York magazine. Um,

42
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.690
the wall street journal did a great job, um, covering this. And so the,

43
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.010
the space was starting to, to open up. Then they had that really in my mind,

44
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.210
ill faded press event in Wuhan where it was this independent committee and

45
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.930
the Chinese government. And they said, don't invest,

46
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.360
investigate lab lake investigate the frozen food hypothesis.

47
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.120
And then in every newspaper around the world,

48
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.480
the headline was the world health organization, um, says, uh,

49
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.560
don't lab. Lake is not, is not possible essentially.

50
00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:02.400
And so I immediately sent messages to my, my friends, uh,

51
00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:05.200
at the world health organization and saying, look you,

52
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:10.120
this is being misreported, the world health organization, hasn't said this, uh,

53
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.760
and the, the position of the w H O must be,

54
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.600
we have to investigate all hypotheses.

55
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.750
And I was very pleased that three days later,

56
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.830
so the press event was on a Tuesday that Friday, uh, Ted rose adeno,

57
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.190
who's the director general. He then, uh,

58
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:31.190
said an press event that we believe that every hypothesis needs to be

59
00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:34.870
investigated, which implicitly meant the lab league hypothesis.

60
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.590
And then our letter, uh, came out, uh, which was just,

61
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.660
just last week. I mean, it, it feels it's been such a whirlwind since then,

62
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.900
and that's been picked up in newspapers all around the world.

63
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.420
So now I feel like there is an opening and I hope that we can continue.

64
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:55.180
And the goal in my mind, isn't to prove like, I don't,

65
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.380
I don't feel like I need to, maybe if it's provable, I'd love to prove it,

66
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:02.770
but is not to prove the it right at this point that it is a lab leak or isn't,

67
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:07.570
but we at least need to have the most thorough unrestricted

68
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.730
unpoliticized investigation into what happened with access to

69
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.050
all the lab records, all the samples there,

70
00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:19.490
there's tons of scientists in China who were working on these issues.

71
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.520
Very, very few of them have been interviewed. We don't have access to them.

72
00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:26.720
And frankly, I think a lot of them are afraid that if they speak up, uh,

73
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:27.920
they'll be imprisoned or.

74
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.440
<v 0>Worse. Yeah. That is the problem. Right? The,</v>

75
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.480
the people that were initially very vocal, um,

76
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.280
and biased towards the idea that it wasn't a lab leak.

77
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.990
And you said they were highly motivated and yeah, they,

78
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:45.230
they labeled other folks at conspiracy theorist. What, what was motivating them?

79
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.390
<v 1>Yeah. So this it's a really tricky point. And,</v>

80
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.390
and so there's been a lot of controversy.

81
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.990
I got around a guy named Peter Deza and Peter is an

82
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.550
interesting figure, because if you had asked me, uh, a year ago,

83
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.900
a year and a half ago,

84
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.940
who are the people who you respect most in the field of virology?

85
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.940
He would be really at the top of my list.

86
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:13.780
He was one of the heroes of understanding where the first SARS came from.

87
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.100
He has a, an organization called EcoHealth Alliance.

88
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:19.620
It was really trying to get ahead of the curve on understanding these, uh,

89
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:20.454
these pathogens,

90
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.370
but he all through EcoHealth Alliance was a funder of

91
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.890
the Wuhan Institute of virology,

92
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.490
specifically the gain of function research that was being done there. And I, I,

93
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.330
I truly believe it wasn't anything nefarious. It was, the idea was, well,

94
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:38.850
if we're, if we wanna understand dangerous pathogens,

95
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.720
we have to do it in the place where those day dangerous pathogens are.

96
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.520
Then under the Obama administration, there was a moratorium on this kind of, uh,

97
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.800
of, uh, of gain of function research. Um,

98
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.160
and then it was lifted in the Trump administration. So that's one,

99
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.920
one piece of it. And so for Peter,

100
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.520
I understand that his whole experience of his life has been well,

101
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.520
this is where these kinds of outbreaks come from. Um, and,

102
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.120
but this could be just a very different story. And, and for me personally,

103
00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:13.520
that's,

104
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.310
I think one of the reasons why I was able to see this a little year perhaps than

105
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:18.790
other people, is that, you know,

106
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.390
part of big chunk of my life has been in the world of science,

107
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.510
but another big chunk of my life has been in the world of understanding China.

108
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.870
And so I think if you're just in the world of science,

109
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:30.150
you don't understand China, you think, well,

110
00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:33.270
the Chinese government says that this isn't from a lab.

111
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.430
Like it must not be from a lab league,

112
00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:39.700
but I know that the China nineties government they've totally suppressed the

113
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:43.500
entire basically history of Mau and all the beat millions of people who died

114
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:46.580
under Mau when they got their speed trains, uh,

115
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:50.780
going the first train had this terrible crash and they just buried the whole

116
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.620
train and, and pretended like it,

117
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.980
it never happened until there was outcry and they had to, they had to,

118
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.460
to dig it up. So I, I,

119
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.970
I feel like I understood a little bit more about the pathology of the, uh,

120
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:02.770
of the Chinese government. So, but coming back,

121
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.650
I think there were people in the kind of more traditional virology world who

122
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:11.330
felt like we're gonna open up a whole can of worms. If we say, well,

123
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.570
maybe it was a zoonotic jump and maybe it was, it was a lovely.

124
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.520
<v 0>So this one guy and his influence</v>

125
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.640
shaped the way the entire world was addressing this.

126
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.440
<v 1>Outbreak. I wouldn't say it's one guy, but it was a,</v>

127
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.680
I think a relatively small number of people, um,

128
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.320
because they certainly that the, uh, the Lancet letter,

129
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.280
and it was all kinds of big luminaries who signed it,

130
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.030
that really shaped things. Um, and so definitely if,

131
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.590
if the story in the beginning had been,

132
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.630
maybe this comes from a zoonotic jump, maybe it comes from a lab leak.

133
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.710
We need to look at both options. Or, um,

134
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.990
I think that would've been a much healthier place because there would've been

135
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:58.870
more pressure on China. So it wasn't just one guy,

136
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.420
but Peter certainly was, was very influential. And then in spite of this,

137
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.100
uh,

138
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.020
conflict of interest he's actually was selected as a member of this world health

139
00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:13.740
organization, independent advisory committee. So one of the,

140
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.420
the people who went on this mission to China was Peter. He also, uh,

141
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.250
is the chairman of the Lancet, the same, uh, British journal that I mentioned.

142
00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:27.330
They have a, a study, uh, study group. He's the chairman of that.

143
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:30.130
And I'm not saying he's doing anything wrong. I'm just saying,

144
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:32.330
if you have that kind of conflict of interest,

145
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.170
you shouldn't be in those kinds of roles. It's.

146
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.210
<v 0>Just always so disturbing to someone like me.</v>

147
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.880
Who's a non-scientist who relies on scientists to be unbiased.

148
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.040
And to just look at the data,

149
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.800
when you find out that things are being influenced by very human factors,

150
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.560
like ego and financial gain and

151
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.480
relationships with foreign powers and laboratories that

152
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.400
they're involved with, and that scares the outta me.

153
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.680
<v 1>Well, you know, this better than most anybody, Joe,</v>

154
00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:04.240
because you kind of are here every day,

155
00:09:04.241 --> 00:09:07.600
looking into people's psyche and people are people, even,

156
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:12.000
even scientists and everybody in the world has a story

157
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.030
that explains what they're doing and, uh, and why.

158
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:20.510
And so I'm sure that you could maybe even should have Peter on the show and

159
00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:24.430
he'll give you his, his story, but at least from the outside,

160
00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:27.310
looking in the way I would see it is well he's,

161
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.710
he's invested his entire life into doing the right thing,

162
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.900
trying to protect us from this terrible threat of a pathogenic outbreak.

163
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.020
He correctly recognizes that encroachment into wild

164
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.860
areas and climate change are big threats, wherever, wherever COVID, uh,

165
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.940
two, wherever COVID 19 SARS, two comes from still, those are, are,

166
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.093
are good things to do.

167
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.610
He has a longstanding relationship with the Wuhan Institute of virology

168
00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.450
and a friendship with the people who, uh, who, who work there. Um,

169
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.330
and so you, you can see how we ki he I'm my guess. And you know,

170
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.730
I can't speak for him. He's become kind of a stakeholder in this story,

171
00:10:09.731 --> 00:10:12.610
but we shouldn't. This isn't just about Peter. I mean,

172
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:17.520
there are lots of very prominent S so I would say there are more prominent

173
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.600
scientists who believe that this comes from a series of zoonotic, uh,

174
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.000
jumps through intermediate animal hosts in the wild than there are, uh,

175
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:30.600
who believe that it's more likely to come from a lab lake. But what I will say,

176
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.880
I get a lot, I'm in touch with lots of people who are world famous scientists,

177
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.710
scientists, who, many, many people what we'll know who are privately telling me.

178
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.390
Well, we think that there's a 90% chance that it comes from a lab,

179
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.510
but really don't wanna speak up because we don't wanna get pulled into the muck.

180
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.750
You were talking about Trump before people remember the Iraq war,

181
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.030
where there were all kinds of experts who were saying, oh,

182
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:57.780
they definitely have nuclear weapons. And then invaded country. It's like, oh,

183
00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:58.940
oops, they don't have it.

184
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:03.820
So people didn't want it to justify any kind of bad things. And as scientists,

185
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.820
I mean, the problem is the,

186
00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:08.540
the scientists rely on data and there wasn't data because China was,

187
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.060
was covering it up. And the,

188
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.540
the ch the journalists require scientists to make,

189
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.130
to legitimate claims about the origins.

190
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:22.690
And so there was this weird thing that's, that's lasted for a year,

191
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.330
and our hope is, and we're starting to see that our letter, um,

192
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.490
has opened up some space where we can have a real honest conversation about

193
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:30.851
let's.

194
00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:34.210
Let's look deeply into all the possibilities and try to get to the right answer,

195
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.190
catch.
