00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 1>To me KIB is one of the scariest too. Oh yeah,</v>

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.480
because he's beating you down. He's not only beating you now.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.800
He's breaking you mentally. And for me, that is worse than anything for me.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.920
Is the scariest one pound for pound KIB.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.400
<v 0>Is he the guy that you would come back for?</v>

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.870
<v 1>I would have, like you would have now it's all.</v>

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.790
<v 0>Over and now you're done. That's it?</v>

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.070
<v 1>Ah, I'm done it's three, three years ago. I.</v>

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.350
<v 0>Hey, GSP. It's Dana white. Listen, I gotta fight for you.</v>

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.070
<v 1>Now. I'm gonna explain to you if he, if he wants me to fight, he needs to,</v>

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.670
to do it. Like that's how he needs to do it. He needs to hide himself.

13
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.860
Wait that I'm in a gym training P pop pop. Like for example,

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.740
when I was in early with Fred Roach,

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.660
hitting the path and getting back because I haven't done this because COVID,

16
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:54.820
everything is closed in Montreal. Right. But I went back and now I found,

17
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.140
I found that found my mechanic back, man. And when you hit,

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.740
when you train in mixed martial art and combat sport,

19
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:05.370
you become a different person, you know, and Tata, Tata, and, and Freddy look,

20
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:10.250
look at me like, he's like, George, you, you get the hitch back. I'm like, ah,

21
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.170
stop saying that &lt;laugh&gt; and if Dana white would walk in right now in the gym,

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.730
in between round, I would sign the contract in a blink of an I Ooh.

23
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.320
But then after I go back home, go back and Montreal in my comfort. And I'm like,

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.380
hell.

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.040
<v 0>No, there you are working.</v>

26
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.600
<v 1>With Freddy. Yeah. And, and people are, are like, Hey,</v>

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.600
are you practicing lefthanded? I always been, uh.

28
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.440
<v 0>Bower. Yeah. I like how Freddy has a, a, he's got a mask on his chin.</v>

29
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.320
What's that protection, Freddy &lt;laugh&gt; take that stupid thing off.

30
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.310
<v 1>And, and, and, you know, I'm, I'm,</v>

31
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:48.390
I'm lefthanded because I always been lefthanded. It was a card that,

32
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.590
a secret card that I kept in my, uh, in my arsenal that I,

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.270
if I would've need to use it, you, you switch. Yes.

34
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.550
I was going to switch perhaps with besting in the,

35
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.710
in the Fort round or in the first. Oh, really? Yes.

36
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.780
<v 0>So you're more comfortable lefthanded, more comfortable.</v>

37
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.580
<v 1>In the south ball. No, I'm I'm.</v>

38
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.860
I would say I've started a more comfortable as a regular stand,

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.740
but because I do karate, I always, if you ask, if you ask my coaches,

40
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.820
everybody knows,

41
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.580
but I always fight one side because I believe it's a secret card that I,

42
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.970
that you can pull off and, and, and surprise I, everybody,

43
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.810
but you don't show your an when you play card,

44
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.410
you only show what you need to show to win the fight. Well.

45
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.730
<v 0>You see that with Wonderboy, like Wonderboy he's right-hand,</v>

46
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.050
but he fights in my opinion at his best when he is right leg forward,

47
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.930
because he throws front leg kicks. Yes. Like that's one of the things he does,

48
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:43.450
like he'll oftentimes will he'll switch back and forth.

49
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.800
Fluidly don't get me wrong. He can fight well from both stances. Yes.

50
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.080
But when he's right leg forward,

51
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.640
you see a lot of those front leg kicks and that that's some of the most

52
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:54.160
difficult to get through with that guy. Right?

53
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.223
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.040
There is guys that has a lot of problems fighting a SUPA. Yes.

55
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.200
There's guys like this switches, everything. Yes. Can change everything. Yeah.

56
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.080
So that, that's why it was for me a car, a secret card that I kept in case,

57
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.280
you know, like, like I would, I would need it. But unfortunately for me,

58
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:15.800
like Bisping was very good with SUPA as well.

59
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320
He knocked out like Ru Rockwell.

60
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.150
So perhaps it's one of these things that I should have used earlier in my

61
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:25.350
career, unfortunately. And I did not, I should. Well.

62
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.350
<v 0>Unfortunately, you're one of the greatest of all time. How about relax? And.</v>

63
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.190
<v 1>I'm very, I'm very critic about myself, Joe, and, and, uh, yeah. Yeah. Well,</v>

64
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.230
you got, it always can be better. Right. But.

65
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.750
<v 0>That's always one of the reasons why champions are champions is that they are</v>

66
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.580
self critical. That's what makes,

67
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.820
if you just think everything you do is amazing and you don't have any room for

68
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:44.654
improvement.

69
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.340
I think some of the reason why champions become champions is this terrible

70
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.300
discomfort of like analyzing themselves and like not liking certain

71
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:55.180
aspects of what they're doing,

72
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.700
finding flaws in their technique or watching a tape. Ah,

73
00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:01.290
I shouldn't have got hit with that. Why is that? Like, uh,

74
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.850
you get crazy and angry and then you train harder.

75
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.570
The people that are self satisfied,

76
00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:08.690
they're like really easily satisfied with their, with their work.

77
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.090
They never reach the level of champion because they don't feel that horrible

78
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.770
discomfort when you're looking at yourself and you don't like what you see.

79
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.590
Yeah.

80
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.360
<v 1>And, and my friend city Fletcher says, says that out.</v>

81
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 0>To CT. I love that dude. He's the man iron addicts for life, big,</v>

82
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:25.040
big inspiration.

83
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.600
<v 1>For, I love him. And he says to me the day that you're satisfied,</v>

84
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.000
choose to do something else because,

85
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.080
and it's a little bit what happened to me in fighting. I made peace with it. I,

86
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.320
uh, like I, I wanted to come back for CIB, um,

87
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.030
because it was, you know, for a fighter,

88
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.750
the scariest thing sometimes is the most exciting thing to do.

89
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.230
And it's a problem that never been solved before.

90
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.230
But to come back for another guy and fight for another title, if I win, I,

91
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.070
it is gonna be another one after and another one, another one,

92
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.100
and I'm gonna turn 40 years old and I hit to admit it, Joe.

93
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.300
And I refuse to accept it. But man, sometime I think so.

94
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.420
I think my best years might be behind.

95
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.260
<v 0>Me. Well, listen, you're retired. I just said it. It's okay. It's.</v>

96
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.100
<v 1>Okay. It's not okay. I'm not done.</v>

97
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.860
<v 0>But you, you Dana. You're hearing him right now. No, no, no, no.</v>

98
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.690
Let's make it happen. Cab's done as well. And KIB is, uh, what is he? 32.

99
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.690
I, I think KIB is 32 or 33. That's right. So he's in his athletic prime.

100
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.370
How old is, KIB find out. How about old KIB is I believe he's either 32.

101
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.690
<v 1>Or 33. Yeah. But it it's different for everybody.</v>

102
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.210
Some people reach their prime at 25. Some people at 22, some people at 35,

103
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.680
you know? Well, look at &lt;inaudible&gt; is incredible. Yes. I know.

104
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.840
<v 0>38 Years old when he's dominating the light heavyweight division,</v>

105
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.960
I think for KIB it was also a promise that he made to his mother.

106
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.760
And that I think that's where it lies when his father died, he told his mother,

107
00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:58.680
this is gonna be the last fight. And then he fought Justin GCI. Yeah.

108
00:05:58.681 --> 00:05:59.560
And he said, that's it.

109
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.080
<v 1>And I understand why,</v>

110
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.120
because fighting takes a lot out of you and takes a lot of

111
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.600
out of the people who loves you. Yeah. Cuz you play basketball,

112
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.360
you play baseball, you don't play fighting.

113
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.990
And the out the outcome of a failure it's could be

114
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.150
very, very bad. You know what I mean? It's not like, uh, you,

115
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.830
you lose a game of basketball or something like that. You lose a fight.

116
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.270
It can have huge re repercu caution on your, he, your health,

117
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:35.150
your wellbeing, but also your income and your family and everything. Sure.

118
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.580
<v 0>Like the like steep base loss to a, in Ghana and you watch that loss.</v>

119
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.140
That that's a horrible price that he paid when he got knocked out and you see

120
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:46.940
him out cold and France hits him with that hammer fist after all he CAD him,

121
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.780
CAD him with the left hook. That's a horrible place to be.

122
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.580
And if that's your child, you think of Khabib's mother looking at him.

123
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.260
And if that's your child, that's a terrible thing to watch.

124
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.220
<v 1>That's right. And, and,</v>

125
00:06:57.221 --> 00:07:01.970
but I think psychology psychologically for a fighter,

126
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.570
it's hard to come back from a, from a knockout,

127
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.530
but it's probably harder to come back from a fight

128
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.450
where you've been dominating and broken for five

129
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.680
round, like where you literally know that you did not belong

130
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.160
there with the right. You know, like, like, like, like CIBS, that's his style.

131
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:27.080
That's why I'm saying he's the scariest guy. Right? He can knock you out,

132
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.000
submit you, but he's he's if he wins the fight, it's not,

133
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.800
it's very less likely that it is gonna be on a, on a punch that clips you,

134
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.700
it can happen,

135
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.350
but he's gonna be on a very dominant performance and he's gonna Mo exactly.
