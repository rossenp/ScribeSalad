00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The thing I wanted to maybe discuss is,</v>

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.180
is the balance that that needs to be talked about. And, and we,

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.870
this is where I would have taken the conversation from earlier about the media.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.260
<v 1>W how do you feel about Sweden? The way Sweden's handling it?</v>

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.330
Because we're talking about balanced.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.310
Sweden has got a very different approach to it.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.570
Their approach is essentially listen, old people, vulnerable people,

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.230
please take care of yourself, stay home, they'll provide assistance,

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:30.840
they'll get you food. They'll do whatever they can get to you,

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.060
but people that are healthy, they want them to go out and live their lives.

11
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:39.900
They don't want the restaurants to shut down the pubs to shut down.

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.210
This is a disease that, you know,

13
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:47.180
it's ravaged people of all nationalities and all age and

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.780
demographic groups, but they're their ideas take care of your health,

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.160
be careful, but let's get society back on its feet again.

16
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.910
And they're widely criticized by that. And I would love to hear what you think.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.260
<v 0>Well, I think the jury is still out on whether that's a good strategy or not.</v>

18
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.510
Um, there's three different strategies. Okay.

19
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:10.830
And there's a Harvard white paper that, that delineates these pretty well. Um,

20
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.910
I spoke with one of the professors from the center of ethics that was an author

21
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:19.380
of this. And you can describe these three strategies in the following way.

22
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.870
One, they call freeze in place, which is basically what we're doing right now.

23
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.980
It's what most countries are doing, uh, a hardcore quarantine. Uh,

24
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.890
of course that's different depending on what part of the country are in, uh,

25
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.200
the second. Well, let me jump to the third one.

26
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.350
The third one would just be surrender. Okay. Let it happen.

27
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.190
We'll deal with it as we go, but we're not keeping anybody at home. Uh,

28
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.440
that's effectively what Sweden is doing.

29
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.700
The second option would be sort of a mix of the two,

30
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.180
which I think will end up being the American option or a better well should be,

31
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.290
uh, where we have a defined period where we remain in place.

32
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.950
But then we confront the enemy. And like I said,

33
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.050
we're in a tactical retreat right now, but a certain point,

34
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.320
we actually have to come back out swinging, and we need to be prepared to do it.

35
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.450
Sweden took on the third approach, which is like the, basically they,

36
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.800
they think they can deal with it.

37
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:14.040
And we're going to see now their cases are jumping up pretty dramatically.

38
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.170
I don't know how much they'll continue jumping up.

39
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.090
The Swedes are also very good at culturally following the rules, you know,

40
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.660
like Americans, don't like a lot of rules, sweetness, Swedes we'll, we'll,

41
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:29.010
we'll stop at a red light at 2:00 AM, even though there's nobody around. Okay.

42
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.710
Uh, same with people in Switzerland. Okay. This is,

43
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.200
this is w we have deeper cultural differences.

44
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.660
I think their social cohesion and their ability to follow rules,

45
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.130
kinda like the Koreans, um, is, is different than our culture where we are,

46
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.310
we are just way more individualistic and we're going to do whatever the hell we

47
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:46.410
want. We want a flame thrower in our office.

48
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:48.030
We're going to have a flame thrower at our office. And like,

49
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.820
don't tell me I can't have it. Right. I mean, you can relate to that.

50
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.613
<v 1>Right behind me.</v>

51
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.510
<v 0>I jealous, like I don't have a flame thrower, but I have a lot of guns. And, um,</v>

52
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.410
they're better. They're better having, yeah. It depends on the situation.

53
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.310
<v 1>They're always better unless you want to start a fire. Well.</v>

54
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.510
<v 0>That's what I mean, that's the only.</v>

55
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.343
<v 1>Situation.</v>

56
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.140
<v 0>Sometimes the situation is you just.</v>

57
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.330
<v 1>Want to throw it out unless you're in the movie alien.</v>

58
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.130
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, you know, the, the, the point is is you,</v>

59
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.450
you need a diversity of weaponry. That's, that's, that's the truth. Right. Um,

60
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.330
and so, and so, okay, so those are the three options.

61
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.180
I think the jury is still out on what if it works for Sweden or not?

62
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.390
I think it can work. And I would like to see us move to that rather quickly.

63
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.330
Now we need to be careful about how we do it, but I'm very,

64
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.920
I'm very concerned about these indefinite, um,

65
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.280
extension of the timelines of stay in place. I think,

66
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:49.810
I think we have to start having reasonable conversations about the costs of

67
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:52.360
that. And the costs are a lot more than just dollar signs.

68
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.260
The costs are a hell of a lot more than just people's 401ks, tanking.

69
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.140
The costs are actually people's lives. Also,

70
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:03.670
whether it's mental health or suicides or divorces, or putting off all of these,

71
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.750
um, all of these procedures that we're just putting a freeze on. So like,

72
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.440
and it's, and I have a lot of problem with this. I mean, in places like Houston,

73
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.830
our hospitals are not overwhelmed or like 50% capacity still.

74
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.410
Cause we're not just not getting that many more cases, but.

75
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.831
<v 1>Well,</v>

76
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:22.810
I think that is why do you think Texas is less prone to

77
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.644
this?

78
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.450
<v 0>Well, I guess I'll,</v>

79
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.890
I'll answer that question by stating why I think New York is the way it is and,

80
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:32.590
and new Orleans is the way it is. Um, New York is the way it is because it's a,

81
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.300
it's a giant city with enormous density. Uh, the most it's the densest,

82
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.920
uh, uh, city in the country by far,

83
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.060
it's also the most likely place that a lot of international travelers are coming

84
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.650
in and out of. And so I think there was,

85
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.250
I think it's safe to say there was multiple hotspots that occurred within New

86
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.820
York city and then it spread wildly because people ride subways and elevators.

87
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.290
I mean, it's not like Los Angeles.

88
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:00.310
It's not like Houston where we take a car everywhere, no matter what,

89
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.380
there there's natural social distancing that already occurs, um, in new Orleans,

90
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.340
well, they had Mardi Gras and Mardi Gras. They had, I mean, it's,

91
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.650
there's explanations behind these things.

92
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.330
And I do worry sometimes that our modeling is using these numbers in the wrong

93
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:20.050
ways and not taking enough into account into the fact that we just,

94
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.590
we have very different lifestyles and different parts of the country and also

95
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:26.710
take into account that we can target certain solutions.

96
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:31.180
And so regarding the Harvard white paper that that says the second solution is

97
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:32.470
mobilized and transition.

98
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.250
Once you've slowed the spread by doing what we're doing. And again,

99
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:37.840
I'm not against doing what we're doing.

100
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.980
I just think we need to stick to the timelines and maybe make those timelines

101
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:45.220
sooner than later, and then come out and fight. And what does fighting mean?

102
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.320
Well, while we're in weights,

103
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.260
we're basically we're ramping up production of protective gear.

104
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.520
We're ramping up production of ventilators. Again, our system is, is amazing.

105
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.410
Um, we are producing, we are going to be producing,

106
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.910
but I think next week or so up to 7,000 new ventilators a week,

107
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.690
we haven't run out of ventilators. I went through the numbers before,

108
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.050
when we're talking about socialized medicine,

109
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:10.340
like one of the benefits of our system is we are actually way better prepared

110
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:13.010
than people realize. Now we have a big lack of PPE.

111
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.900
There's a lot of reasons for that.

112
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.610
And I can go into one reason is that China was stopping export from 3m,

113
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.440
from going to China, to the rest of the world, back in January and February,

114
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.500
right? This was, this just came out. And, um, in an article that was written,

115
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.470
it was confirmed by 3m. And a lot of people in government,

116
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.400
they were preventing the export because 3m produces a lot of it in China.

117
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.920
And they were preventing those exports because they wanted to hoard the

118
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:39.860
supplies. And then they act like the good guy and go around the world,

119
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.750
giving it out. I mean, China has to,

120
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.590
is we're going to have to really look at our supply chains and our relationship

121
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:46.610
with China after this.

122
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.260
But that's one of the reasons we didn't have the proper amount of PPE and also

123
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.520
depends on the hospital. Again,

124
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.930
like there is some accountability that has to take place with specific hospitals

125
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.210
and specific cities and why they didn't prepare.

126
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.560
But what I've noticed as of late is this strange belief that the president is

127
00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:07.550
everybody's micromanaging boss, and that's just not how our system works,

128
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:09.230
nor should it. And, uh,

129
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:13.190
there has to be some level of accountability at the local and state level to,

130
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:13.730
again,

131
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.700
I just got off the phone with some of the doctors here at the Texas medical

132
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:20.090
center. And I'm like, how are you guys on PPE? And they're like,

133
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.040
we have so much PBE because we're used to disasters here and we prepare.

134
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.500
And so they're just not worried about it. Um,

135
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.580
we've supplied set up the supply chains, um, in advance. Like there has to be,

136
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.200
we have to work together. Uh,

137
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.700
th there's what I've noticed in all the finger pointing and,

138
00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:39.200
and a lot of it's just political opportunism. I don't know if you, if you, like,

139
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.050
if you, if you put these people up to a lie detector test,

140
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:44.960
I wonder if they really think it would be the president's fault that this

141
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:48.470
happened. Like, I don't, I don't think they could pass a lie detector test.

142
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:51.650
You know, I think it's, I think it's a lot of political theatricals,

143
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.270
but in any case, it's, it, it gets us away from the,

144
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.830
the right way to look at our system,

145
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:01.280
which is local and state government are our managers. They,

146
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.740
they manage on those smaller levels.

147
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:07.760
Like if California wants to try a single payer healthcare system,

148
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.680
let's see it work in California or a smaller state, and then let's,

149
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.270
then let's scale it. Hell let's,

150
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:18.050
let's see if it works in a city and then let's scale it. You know,

151
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.830
like there's a reason. Federalism is the way it is.

152
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.530
And it's hard to compare us to different countries in so many ways,

153
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:28.250
because these countries are like the size of our city. You know,

154
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:32.060
like LA is bigger than most, so many countries around the world. And like,

155
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.420
it's, it's, it's, it's a map. The scale matters to a huge extent. And,

156
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.290
um, it's like socialism works. If you've got maybe like 50 or 60 people,

157
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.030
because you can hold each other accountable,

158
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:46.880
there's a little bit easier to maintenance as you scale it out.

159
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:49.700
You just can't right. That's why co-ops exists in the, you know,

160
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:53.780
in this country. And like Bernie Sanders, lip balm one, you can make it work.

161
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.450
If you can see everybody all the time, right? A family,

162
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.420
a family unit is a socialist unit, teach their own, teach their need,

163
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.450
teach their ability when you scale things out, it dramatically changes things.

164
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.270
And we have to remember that as it pertains to dealing with the pandemic and

165
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:13.780
dealing with public policy as well. Um, the,

166
00:09:13.781 --> 00:09:18.150
the point I was making about the media a second ago, but one of the problems,

167
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.550
it's not just that they're not informing people correctly,

168
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:21.630
which we discussed earlier.

169
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.500
The other problem is that they're preventing us from having the right

170
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.334
discussions,

171
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.130
because we do have to have this discussion that we're talking about right now,

172
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:32.820
which is how do we, how do we responsibly move into a,

173
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.840
into a system where we're simultaneously combating the pandemic,

174
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.670
but also reopening our economy. And we have to have that. And, and,

175
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:45.120
and the natural reaction from disingenuous people is, oh, well,

176
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.980
how many lives is it worth to save a job? And I'm like, okay, that's,

177
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.810
that's not the right question. It's a very dishonest question. And, you know,

178
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:55.441
first of all,

179
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:58.620
it assumes that somebody going back to work will actually cost a life.

180
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.060
You can't prove that. I mean, if we're gonna,

181
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.550
if we're gonna play this dishonest game of counterfactuals,

182
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.490
but also it misses the point. You know, we,

183
00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:11.100
we live in a world where we take risks and we have to take those risks and then

184
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.840
mitigate those risks accordingly.

185
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.530
And we can better mitigate risks when we better understand what we're dealing

186
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:17.970
with and when we're better prepared.

187
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.970
And those are the two things we have to do over the next month is get better

188
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:24.570
prepared. And that's the answer. There is test more people,

189
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.240
especially test people with antibodies so that we can see what's actually

190
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:30.150
immune, and we can give them like a certificate or something that they can do,

191
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.170
go do whatever they want. Um, getting more ICU beds, where they might be needed,

192
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:37.080
getting more ventilators, getting more PPE. So that's the preparedness side.

193
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.080
And on the other side, we risk mitigate. It's just like, you know,

194
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:44.760
like you explained in Sweden, let's keep sick and vulnerable people away.

195
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.240
Let's target our efforts a little bit better.

196
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.480
Let's take a more vertical approach as opposed to a horizontal approach.

197
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.230
We can do this, we can do this. If we give each other,

198
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:57.480
the grace and the space to do it,

199
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.060
instead of like this bad faith finger pointing of like, oh,

200
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:02.850
you're just going to kill people and you don't even care. Well, it's like,

201
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.550
that's, that's a terrible way to think about it. I mean,

202
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:07.800
I could moralize this situation and say, well,

203
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:11.700
I could save 30,000 lives this year because I'm not going to let anybody drive.

204
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.380
And I am a better person than you because you have the blood of 30,000 people on

205
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:18.780
your hands because you want people driving. That's a great example.

206
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.760
<v 1>That is a great example.</v>

207
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.500
<v 0>I'm the more cold.</v>

208
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.810
<v 1>Yeah. And that's, I'm worried about that, but it's not, it's not at all. No,</v>

209
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.410
you're, you're absolutely right. And I'm worried about that when we do go back,

210
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:34.380
I'm worried about that finger pointing. I really am,

211
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:36.750
because I think it's just going to muddy the waters.

212
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:40.080
And I'm also worried about it being used as political opportunism.
