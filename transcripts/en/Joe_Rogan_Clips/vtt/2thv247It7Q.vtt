1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.360
<v 0>Oh, you know, we were preparing for the tapings and he never texted me back.</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.440
And I'm like, we're walking by this. And I'm like, just come in and look.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.480
And he literally looks at the iPhone, like,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.880
it's the enemy of the people phone. I have multiple phones, held it with.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.880
<v 1>Disdain. I have an iPhone. Also. I go, the guy.</v>

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.710
<v 0>Goes, you could do anything on this. You text, you can make a point.</v>

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.270
You can do anything. You can write shows, you can record your shows.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.790
And Dave goes, should we really play God?

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.430
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I had a couple of good lines, but I, I,</v>

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.270
I don't go past an iPhone too. I, I feel like, you know,

11
00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:37.230
that's pushing it cuz now it's like up to 10, right? You have an iPhone.

12
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.070
<v 2>Two like.</v>

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.220
<v 1>Yeah. How many are like how many iPhones, JV burst.</v>

14
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.620
How many iPhones compared to how many Rocky movies are there? &lt;laugh&gt;.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.620
<v 2>How many Rocky movies are there now? Cause our name is on creeds Rockies.</v>

16
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:54.580
Cuz now we have do creeds. The second creed is act now.

17
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.300
<v 1>I guess it is cuz it's working off of the actual uh, narrative of Rocky. Do you.</v>

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.050
<v 2>Hear Michael B? Jordan is talking about boxing. Roy Jones Jr. Yeah,</v>

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.923
I thought that was a.

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.930
<v 1>Oh God. I hope it's a joke. Just straight up boxing. Not like a Mo tie.</v>

21
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.130
<v 2>Listen, don't do that. Michael. Just don't do that.</v>

22
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.530
I'm I'm sure he's a great athlete. He's a beautiful kid. He's got a great body.

23
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.690
Looks like he knows how to box. When he throws punches,

24
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:18.370
it looks like he really actually knows how to box.

25
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.010
I'm sure he is a really good athlete and he's built like a brick house.

26
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.920
But boxing Roy Jones Jr. Is a.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.200
<v 1>Preposterous. You don't know how to get hit. What's the upside.</v>

28
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.920
<v 0>You never work again. Or you become a boxer.</v>

29
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.080
<v 2>You, you hang in there with them and you look like a hero. I mean you,</v>

30
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.920
you clip 'em and hurt him. I mean, it is, it is a humanly possible thing, right?

31
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:39.920
Like when two people are throwing punches at each other,

32
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.560
that one of 'em can hit the other guy. But.

33
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.630
<v 0>But downside, the downside is just ruined Roy Jones.</v>

34
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.391
<v 2>Juniors.</v>

35
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:51.270
One of the greatest boxers of all time and still to this

36
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.110
day knows how to box. It's not like he forgot. How is he?

37
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.790
He's pushing 50 he's 49. Yeah. He's pushing 50. Do.

38
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.660
<v 0>You think, you think somebody challenging? Whose idea was it? I think.</v>

39
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.140
<v 2>He was just talking. He was just probably being asked, like,</v>

40
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.460
who would you like to box? Who's your hero? How.

41
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.340
<v 1>Many rounds though? Did have to go a certain amount? What did it, what exactly.</v>

42
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.220
<v 2>Happened like that? He said.</v>

43
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.020
<v 3>He would, he asked him who, who would you wanna fight today? And he said,</v>

44
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.140
Roy Jones, he would probably beat me in his prime,

45
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.860
but I'd probably fight him today. It's probably just like that.

46
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.700
<v 2>Oh that is an outrageous thing to say. Just an.</v>

47
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.693
<v 0>Thing to say.</v>

48
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.770
<v 1>Says is George Foreman.</v>

49
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.050
<v 2>Listen, it, he probably would kill you in his prime.</v>

50
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.210
Mean the idea that he would just beat you. I mean, Roy Jones Jr.

51
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.130
When he was in his prime, you were just waiting to see he was in a, a NA song.

52
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.370
They said Roy Jones is in the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones. It's in,

53
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.360
this is like in, in the 1990s. People forgot how, how good Roy Jones Jr. Was.

54
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.400
He was putting his hands behind his back and then knocking people out.

55
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.160
He was doing ridiculous. He knocked out light heavyweight champion,

56
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.520
Virgil hit with a body shot. Do you wanna hear it? So.

57
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.280
<v 3>We so we can hear the context. Okay. Cause it's only.</v>

58
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.320
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; sure let's listen to it. So I heard that you.</v>

59
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.440
<v 4>After all your training for the creed movies, you can hold your own in a fight.</v>

60
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.400
<v 5>I mean, I could do my thing a little bit. You know what I'm saying?</v>

61
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.480
I've been working out with Rocky, been working out with like,

62
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.240
you know what I'm saying? Like Apollo creed. I'm do my thing. Absolutely.

63
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.100
<v 4>Apollo CRE.</v>

64
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.520
Now who all time would you wanna step into the ring with whether it's a boxer,

65
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:15.840
wrestler, fighter.

66
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.950
<v 5>Anybody like Roy Jones bro? Roy Jones. Roy Jones. That's my dude, bro drill.</v>

67
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.310
I feel like I do my thing a little bit. Yeah.

68
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.230
Hold my thing right now in it prime. Nah, he'll probably knocking my out,

69
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:25.470
but like right now I could do my thing.

70
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.510
<v 0>Why answer that question?</v>

71
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.350
<v 2>That's a, well, listen. He was uh, Hey Joe, were.</v>

72
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.990
<v 0>You funnier than George car in his prime? Can you just answer that?</v>

73
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.190
The middle of the street.

74
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.110
<v 2>Right now? Do my thing right now. Since.</v>

75
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.780
<v 0>He did. I know you've had a few drinks in the restaurant. I, the worst.</v>

76
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.460
<v 2>Question we'll tell you something right now I'm on Coke. Cocaine.</v>

77
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.060
Let me answer some questions. I'll boy Jones Jr.

78
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.740
Up that. But.

79
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.300
<v 1>He said he was training with Rocky. That was the best part in Apollo.</v>

80
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.260
<v 2>He doesn't even know their names. He doesn't know the old dude.</v>

81
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.180
<v 0>The old dude, the black guy and the black guy.</v>

82
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.090
<v 2>The black Panther too. He's awesome. Him plays a good superhero. He's.</v>

83
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.090
<v 0>A great he's bad guy. I love his movies. He.</v>

84
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.890
<v 2>Was a good, bad guy in that movie. But you know, it's like,</v>

85
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.410
you just shouldn't answer that. Just made a mistake. Yeah. You know, young,

86
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.250
cocky, full of life. Everything's going well, you know, and again,

87
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.810
built like a superhero. He thinks he could box the world. This's just a,

88
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.120
a thing that's gonna be happening if you're standing in front of Roy Jones Jr.

89
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.880
It's a different thing. He's he's got a computer. That's many,

90
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:30.880
many times you bring Roy more robust than yours when it comes to boxing.

91
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.480
<v 1>But just taking the punishment. It's not like, you know, it's like, okay,</v>

92
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.680
that's enough. What.

93
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.920
<v 0>If Roy Jones Jones just gives you a concussion and you never act again, my God,</v>

94
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:40.280
what's the upside for you. He can tee up on, by the way,

95
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.790
50 year old boxer looks at this actor, pretty boy. And it's like, uh,

96
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.750
when they brought then when they brought, um,

97
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.510
what's his name out of the box in pulp fiction.

98
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.230
<v 2>Yeah. I mean he's jacked though. Look at him.</v>

99
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:55.750
Dude's built like a seriously built like 50 year old. Wow. But see,

100
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:56.584
the thing is like,

101
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.740
there's such a giant difference between learning how to box and being a good

102
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:05.620
athlete. Like he clearly is and being Roy Jones Jr. The, the,

103
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.740
the gap is so wide it's. So it's like if I did a,

104
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.980
a movie about P playing basketball and then I wanted to, you know,

105
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.940
play a one on one versus Kobe Bryant, you know,

106
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:18.060
I've been playing this movie for a couple years, man. I'm feeling good.

107
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.090
I'm feeling good. Even though I never did any competitive basket ball plan,

108
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.730
like you were.

109
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.690
<v 1>In the white shadow or it.</v>

110
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.650
<v 0>So it looks like he got beat up. It's like, he's a.</v>

111
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.690
<v 2>Movie. He's.</v>

112
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.810
<v 0>A movie star, bro. He's got fake blood on his.</v>

113
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.570
<v 2>Welt. That was in the movie. I'm sure he knows how to throw his hands.</v>

114
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.490
I'm sure he does. He looks good in the movies.

115
00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:36.890
He looks like he really knows what he's doing. But Roy Jones Jr.

116
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.090
Is one of the greatest of all time. He was a phenom.

117
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.720
He knows how out a box in a way that you're never gonna understand.

118
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.720
<v 0>So how long has he been since he boxed 10 years? I mean.</v>

119
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.080
<v 2>Roy Jones had a fight within the last two years.</v>

120
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.480
I think his last fight was, I wanna say it was two less than two years ago.

121
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.800
I think he retired. He had a bunch of fights over in Russia.

122
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.240
He actually became a Russian citizen this year. Is that it? This year,

123
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.200
this year. Jesus Christ play some of it. Oops play.

124
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.840
<v 0>So he's not just challenging a retired boxer. He's challenging a.</v>

125
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.880
<v 2>Boxer's Roy Jones Jr. All right. Just,</v>

126
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.760
this is a different thing. It's one thing.

127
00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:18.590
If you're like hop level pro right now. Wow.

128
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.190
And you feel like you would've gotten knocked out by Roy and his prime,

129
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:24.670
but you can give him a go right now. Okay. That I, that is that's believable.

130
00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:26.390
You're a professional boxer.

131
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:30.030
You've been honing your craft in the gym for years and years.

132
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.590
You've been sparring and working with high level coaches. Look at him.

133
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.700
He's still Roy Jones Jr. Still Roy Jones. Jr.

134
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.900
Even though he is 40.

135
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.260
<v 0>I he's a boxing. It doesn't matter. I mean, he's boxing. One's an actor.</v>

136
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.460
One's a boxer.

137
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.620
<v 2>But Roy Jones is in a boxing match here and he's looking good, right? I mean,</v>

138
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.340
he's obviously not fighting a guy. Who's the best in the world.

139
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.140
<v 0>So if you're Roy Jones Jr. Do you call your, your agent right now?</v>

140
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.180
He's already been saying it. See if the kid serious.

141
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.770
<v 2>What's the he's already been doing all these interviews. He said like,</v>

142
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:02.250
I don't want to get outta bed early in the morning. But if, if you know,

143
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.570
if he wants to really do this, we could do this. Roy Jones.

144
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.330
It'd be a wonderful opportunity to show people what boxing is. Oh,

145
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:11.530
let me see what he said. I would love to see that here.

146
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.450
Let's hear what Roy says.

147
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.050
<v 6>Of course I saw the video. First thing is, you know,</v>

148
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.080
I never duck the fight in my I don't duck. Nothing. Right?

149
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.000
Never ain't run for hurricane to come down here. So I ain't running for nobody.

150
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.880
If my wants this real contact Roy Jones and we gonna make it happen.

151
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.120
Yeah. See, you got my number. He can contact you and get my number.

152
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.200
So there's no question about how can I find, you know, how to.

153
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.633
<v 7>I be.</v>

154
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.190
<v 6>Apologize. Get no from T lets make happen.</v>

155
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.190
<v 7>Right now. He said in the video, he said,</v>

156
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.630
I think he would probably have killed me back in his prime.

157
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.030
<v 6>That's true. &lt;laugh&gt; how.</v>

158
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.550
<v 7>About now though? Do you actually him, any chance beat you now?</v>

159
00:07:53.551 --> 00:07:54.870
Even though you are 49, Roy.

160
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.590
<v 6>I don't. I know he can't beat me still because I mean,</v>

161
00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:01.140
I know he's probably even better conditioning cause he's younger and he though

162
00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:03.940
he can probably think he can go longer and probably thinks he may be able to

163
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.660
even out working now. But I'm a vet. I'm an old school that that's right.

164
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.380
Old school vet. Ain't going out like that to have the, to come the ring with me.

165
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.460
I love it. You understand me? So I to understand what boxing is.

166
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.580
So I'm not out there to just taking out right away.

167
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:19.060
Cause then you don't get the experience of the boxing.

168
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.730
I'm a professional like I am and I know he's big and strong.

169
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:26.050
Cause he got stronger for the movie. Then I should be able to board all that.

170
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.370
Take him in a deep water. So he understands where the boxing me really eat. Oh,

171
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.850
he, he comes out. He don't want water say, oh I got knock the first round.

172
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.490
He wouldn't give his hold. No, no, no, no, no. I see my knee off that ease.

173
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.650
I'm gonna knee five, six rounds at you.

174
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.440
So I want you to see how it really feels mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so the that's why

175
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.800
I'm talking like that. Not cause I think he can really match my skills.

176
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.640
I really don't. Even at 49.

177
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.160
<v 7>How long would you need Roy to get right to where you could step in there?</v>

178
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.240
Like what's the soon as we could make this fight happen.

179
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.160
<v 6>Uh, I probably need for him about four or five weeks.</v>

180
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:02.120
<v 2>It's on Switzer. It's on Michael. Please listen to me. Don't do this.</v>

181
00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:04.520
Someone called StubHub. Just don't do this. This,

182
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.240
this is not gonna work out well. Especially if they're,

183
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.640
I would assume both of 'em are not gonna be drug tested.

184
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.040
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; quite a guess.

185
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.310
I don't think either one of them wants a pee in a bucket. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, if they,

186
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.750
if they just let Roy,

187
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.150
they let Roy go to Dr. Feel good and pump him up with hormones.

188
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.470
This is gonna be a route. This would be terrifying. Imagine.

189
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.710
<v 0>This is new. Getting that call from his agent. Hey, uh,</v>

190
00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:29.070
we have an offer for you to do this like new superhero movie.

191
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:33.110
It's gonna be amazing. And Michael's like, ah, I'm booked that whole five weeks.

192
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.500
<v 2>Yeah. I gotta for five weeks would train for Roy Jones Jr. Like don't do it.</v>

193
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.650
<v 1>This is a new,</v>

194
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.660
this is a new genre of TV show of the real guy versus the guy who played it in

195
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:46.780
the movie. &lt;laugh&gt; well, I wanna see doctors against guys who played a doctor.

196
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.140
I wanna see astronauts against guys who would think they're an astronaut.

197
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.053
I wanna see it all.

198
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.060
<v 2>Navy seal from a movie versus real Navy.</v>

199
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.930
<v 1>Dinosaur versus chicken. I wanna see it. Isn't that? What mark.</v>

200
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.010
<v 0>Walbrook said. If he was on the plane, wouldn't.</v>

201
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.050
<v 2>Gone down five versus did he, did he really say that though? Yeah.</v>

202
00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:03.650
That's what everybody says. Oh, I dunno. I never heard.
