00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What is the speculation in terms of bully,</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.380
OCS connection? Was he given a narrative? Was D did, did you,

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:12.540
do you think that they saw.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.150
<v 1>Yeah. So th this is all right, I'll start without the speculative part,</v>

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.380
something I can prove. Okay.

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.150
He was compromised when he was given this case in 1969.

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.950
It's in the book. He, ah, gosh, I, I mean,

8
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:30.050
he has family out there, but they know about this.

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.900
He was involved in a couple cases.

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.890
The first one before the trial that are crazy. I mean,

11
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.950
when you see the stuff that happened between him and I, you know,

12
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:41.120
all those years later,

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.380
it makes sense when you see what he was like before he became famous.

14
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:49.910
So in 1965, he had his first child,

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.440
Vincent Bugliosi Jr.

16
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.430
He decided that he wasn't the father,

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.360
that the milkman was a father. And back in those days,

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.300
you're too young to know people used to deliver milk to homes.

19
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.980
I remember hearing about it. Yeah. So he believed that the milkman was a father.

20
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.760
He was a up and coming this deputy district attorney in Los Angeles.

21
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.900
And for about, I think, 12 or 16 months,

22
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.880
he stocked his milkman, trying to get him to take a blood test,

23
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.340
uh, to prove that he fathered his wife's child,

24
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.450
Jesus Christ. It got so bad that they had to,

25
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.440
uh, they stopped letting their kids take the bus home from school.

26
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:36.350
They had two young kids. They didn't know who he was.

27
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.300
He wouldn't tell them who he was. All he would say was I was on the milkman,

28
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.640
had left the job, uh,

29
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.170
a month after his wife found out she was pregnant. Vince's wife,

30
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.990
Benson. His delirium decided that he was fired because

31
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.510
he had gotten, um, you know,

32
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.440
clients or people who delivered milk to pregnant. So, um,

33
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.450
he was writing them anonymous letters, uh, following the kids. I actually,

34
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:07.280
this was one thing I did hear. I heard from the,

35
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:11.300
the little girl who's now a grown woman read about this in my book.

36
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:15.170
And she sent me a letter and she goes, you only got half of it. He said,

37
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:18.320
he terrorized us. He said, my father, she said,

38
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.080
my father in the middle and had a nervous breakdown. She said,

39
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:23.390
he came to my school and picked me up.

40
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.100
And he took me to a toy store, bought all these toys for me,

41
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.860
whatever I wanted brought me to the house.

42
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.370
And he had a driver and he left me at the end of the driveway.

43
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:38.300
My mom came out and I was like, so happy. I was like five or six years old.

44
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.020
I had all these gifts and she goes, get into the house, get into the house.

45
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.110
So what happened was Vince got caught. I mean,

46
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:47.750
he eventually was stalking them.

47
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.490
He sent his wife to the house to beg the milkman's

48
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:55.100
wife, to get her husband to do a paternity test.

49
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.490
And I've got all this from all these civil depositions when it came,

50
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.310
when the milkman sued him later. Um, so, uh,

51
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.280
Vince, the,

52
00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:09.220
the milkman eventually got his brother-in-law to follow vents from one of his

53
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.860
stakeout splints, which put the car outside the house.

54
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.040
He sent them letters like they changed their phone number. He goes, oh,

55
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:19.210
I noticed you changed your phone number. That wasn't nice. I mean, nuts.

56
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.770
So the milkman followed vents, his brother-in-law,

57
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.270
they had got the plate number,

58
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.130
found out who he was and that he was at the DA's office called his personal

59
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:32.500
attorney and the personal attorney called Vance.

60
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.400
And they had a meeting between Vince, the milkman, the milkman's wife,

61
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.690
and this is bully OSI.

62
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.190
And then admitted that he had been stalking them because he thought it was his

63
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.500
wife. He had used DA's investigators,

64
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.270
calling this guy a material witness in a murder case to follow him,

65
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.810
get information, private information on, uh, um,

66
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.910
so Vince said he would pay them a hundred dollars and never do it again.

67
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:01.540
And the milkman said, we don't want your money. Just never bother us again.

68
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:06.220
So that was all about the end of 68, early 69.

69
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.380
The DA's office knew about this. He should have been fired immediately. Instead,

70
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:15.640
he gets the biggest case at that point in the history of Los Angeles,

71
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.960
the Tate LaBianca trial. This is where we got speculative.

72
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.470
You have a guy like Vince, who's compromised.

73
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.450
He'll do what the highers up, tell him to do. And if you read in the book,

74
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:30.940
Evel younger was a district attorney. At the time,

75
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.670
he was a shady guy who'd been in the OSS,

76
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:38.110
which was the predecessor to the CIA is trained in espionage.

77
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.450
Um, I won't say too much. It's in the book. That's where we get speculative. Um,

78
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.150
if fence was answering for something,

79
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.980
the explanation is because he didn't go into this case clean,

80
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.610
he had to do what he was told. Um.

81
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.920
<v 0>That makes all the sense in the world.</v>

82
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.050
<v 1>Yeah. After the Tate LaBianca convictions and 74 helter-skelter came</v>

83
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:06.670
out the book and to this day, it's the best-selling true crime book of all time.

84
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.070
And it's a wonderfully written book. I mean,

85
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:13.240
I could take you page by page and show you stuff that's completely fabricated

86
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.650
and made up. And that contradicts the real record, but you know,

87
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:18.484
bestseller.

88
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.320
And that same year Vince was going to run for, um,

89
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.270
district attorney and the milkman. And, uh,

90
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.480
his wife had never told anyone, I guess, outside of their family,

91
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:33.490
what had happened four or five years before.

92
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.090
But when they saw that Vince was trying to be the most powerful law enforcement

93
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.560
person in the city of Los Angeles, they went to his opponent and said,

94
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:44.320
you need to know this, this man cannot get this job.

95
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.830
So they told the opponent and they had a press conference.

96
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.710
So the milkman and his wife, um,

97
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.390
when public Vince responded by, uh,

98
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.990
having his own press conference and the reporters here's, here's what happened.

99
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.580
The milkman,

100
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.890
we believe stole $300 in cash from our kitchen table when he was on the route.

101
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.270
So I was just doing a personal investigation and through reporters that will,

102
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:14.660
did you hire, I mean, did you contact the Pasadena police? He goes, no, no, no.

103
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:19.550
I just wanted to do it on my own. And then as other people pointed out later,

104
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.680
he was doing this, this was 65. He was doing through the end of 68.

105
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.920
The statute of limitations on theft,

106
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.110
burglary robbery is three year. It would,

107
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.530
even if he found out that he had stolen the $3, uh,

108
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.920
they wouldn't have been able to prosecute it. So the whole thing, he was alive,

109
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.520
Vince lied to the media, uh, and he lost.

110
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.600
So then he lost that election. Then he ran again, after healthcare scheme,

111
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.220
it Skelter came out for attorney general of California. At that point,

112
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:53.270
the milkman and the wife were going to go public again and say, Hey,

113
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.010
we have way more to tell about this,

114
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.260
which I think is what the daughter wants to tell me. She actually,

115
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.230
hasn't gotten in touch with me after the first email. I said,

116
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:03.890
I want to hear what you have. And she said, she has all these documents, but,

117
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.200
um, then a woman named Virginia Cardwell said she was going to go public to,

118
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.610
um, she came out and said, uh, excuse.

119
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.630
After Vince told the world that the milkman had stolen

120
00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:20.830
$300 for him,

121
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.870
the milkman and his wife filed a civil suit against Vince and Gail, his wife,

122
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:29.590
because Gail also publicly said, uh, with fence in an interview,

123
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.740
that that's a truth. That was all about this petty theft.

124
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.150
They sued them for defamation and they settled and Vince paid them.

125
00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:42.100
I think it was $12,000 in cash and a hundred dollars bills. And you know,

126
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.620
part of the agreement was they weren't allowed to talk about it.

127
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.040
They couldn't say they'd gotten any money and he would only give it in cash.

128
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:51.430
So they couldn't trace it to him. I ended up getting all the documents.

129
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.190
It took a long time, but I got them. Um,

130
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.570
then when they went public again, when he was running for attorney general,

131
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:01.390
they were subject to, you know, being in violation of that.

132
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:04.990
But they said he can't, you know, then we'll tell everything.

133
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:07.630
He doesn't want to tell. He lied under oath in deposition.

134
00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:12.310
So did his wife about the stalking? So in 73,

135
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:15.310
Vince had an affair with a woman named Virginia Cardwell,

136
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.560
Virginia Cardwell was Catholic. She got pregnant. She told Vince, uh,

137
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.620
that she was pregnant with his child and then said she had to get an abortion.

138
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:26.530
And she said, I can't get an abortion on the Catholic. She was a single mother.

139
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.750
Um, he said he would set it up. He had a doctor, uh,

140
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.270
it was still illegal then. And, uh, he,

141
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.210
he gave her the money to pay the doctor.

142
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.860
And then he called her and she said she had gotten the abortion.

143
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:45.880
Everything was fine. Then he called the doctor violating HIPAA rules.

144
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:48.640
The doctor said, actually, I've never heard from this woman.

145
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:50.410
I didn't give her the procedure.

146
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.830
So events went to her house and beat the hell out of her. And, uh,

147
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.940
I've got all those depositions to, uh, he, he just,

148
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.440
according to her story to the police, cause she, she reported it.

149
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.800
He dragged her across the hair, the floor by the hair,

150
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.860
sat in her and punched her and punched her again in the face,

151
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.140
told her she had to get an abortion. Uh, she miscarried, after that episode,

152
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:16.590
she went,

153
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.130
she went to the Santa Monica police as soon as he left and reported it.

154
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.760
And nobody would have known about it, but a reporter saw it on the, you know,

155
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:25.560
the police wire service or whatever.

156
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.640
So the next day it was on the front page of all the LA papers that Vince bully

157
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.050
OSI had been accused of a battery of a woman who said that, uh,

158
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.850
he wanted her to have an abortion and she wouldn't. So Vince went to the police,

159
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.850
told them she was lying. She was, uh,

160
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.150
a client that he had had one phone consultation with,

161
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.890
never met her face to face.

162
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.200
And she was trying to embarrass him because he wanted her to pay

163
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:57.180
him two or $300. He defamed her like he did the milkman. He,

164
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.960
he made up a story and worse this time,

165
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:05.640
he told that to the police. This was in, in their investigation of the battery.

166
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:10.140
He lied to the police, um, that it had not happened,

167
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:12.990
but here's what happened the next day

168
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.000
after the newspapers reported it. And Vince said it was a lie.

169
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.740
And he told the police that Vince went back to her apartment with his secretary

170
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:27.600
and a typewriter and he held her hostage. I know that sounds crazy.

171
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:30.780
It's in the book at the end, held her hostage for,

172
00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:35.760
I think three or four hours bagging her and then bullying

173
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.110
her. And he might've hit her then too.

174
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:41.220
I can't remember to go to the police and say that she had made the whole story

175
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:44.010
up. His secretary was there.

176
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:49.050
Cause once he got her to agree to do it, she wrote up backdated bill,

177
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.610
the bill for the money, uh, and had Virginia sign it. Oh my God.

178
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.030
So Virginia finally agreed to go to the police. He said, look,

179
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:00.350
you're going to be charged with filing a false report, which is a felony. It,

180
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.640
well, it's a misdemeanor, but it could go to a felony and you,

181
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.200
but I can take care of all that.

182
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:07.950
I've got the connections to the DA's office in Santa Monica, which he did.

183
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:09.930
And he did take care of it. Um,

184
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.910
so she called up the Santa Monica police department to

185
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:17.760
say she was coming in to report that, uh,

186
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.470
she had made the story up because she was angry about this money. And uh,

187
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.810
the cop said right away,

188
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:28.770
he knew that something was wrong and the tremor of her voice. And he said,

189
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.050
we'll come get you. And Vince was on the other line and she's going, no, no,

190
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.010
no he's saying no, no, no, they can't come here. So she said, no, no, no,

191
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.910
I'm coming. And they said, okay, we'll see you when you get here.

192
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.210
And then they dispatch two cops to her apartment.

193
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.460
Now this had never been pilot before I found it.

194
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.830
It did become public about what happened.

195
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.480
Vince got away with denying it. The cop that went to,

196
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.940
to see what was going on and to get her guy named Michael Landis.

197
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:58.450
He was retired in Santa Monica. I got his name from the reports. He said,

198
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.640
oh yeah, Vince was at the house. He wouldn't let us in.

199
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.650
He said he and his partner,

200
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:05.980
Robert Steinberg were there and she's cowering behind them crying.

201
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.830
And we got her out of the house barter to the station. And she told the, the,

202
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.160
the story that it was fake that, and he said, but we saw him there. She goes,

203
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:19.060
you have no idea how dangerous he is. Uh, I didn't,

204
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.230
I made it up please. It was a false report. So she got charged.

205
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.250
The next day's papers reported that this woman had come out and admitted that

206
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:28.330
the whole thing was made up.

207
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.840
Nobody said anything because the cops didn't talk to the reporters about Ben's

208
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:36.790
being at the house. Oh my God. And then, you know, he, he prevailed.

209
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:41.140
He won. Then when he ran for attorney general of California in 76,

210
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:43.900
Virginia Cardwell went public, uh,

211
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.920
and then then said, told the same lie about her.

212
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.720
He had never seen her face to face.

213
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.250
She was trying to get two or $300 from him for a phone call or not pay the money

214
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:55.780
for a phone consultation.

215
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.740
He lost the attorney General's race when she went public. And again,

216
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:03.460
with the milkman and mistress, then she sued Vince, same thing.

217
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.560
He lied in the depositions.

218
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:09.220
And then when he got caught with the CA the other people who could show that

219
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.840
they'd been together and there was a history of,

220
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.610
they had had an affair for like six months,

221
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.500
he resolved it and paid her a substantial amount of money to go away.

222
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.370
So this was the kind of person who, when I told Vince,

223
00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:25.030
I was writing about this in my book, he's like, well, number one,

224
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:29.080
I can't talk about either of those cases because they were resolved. Uh,

225
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:31.780
and there's non-disclosures and I go the vent, you know,

226
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:36.160
that's not true because I mean, number one, Virginia is dead. She had died. Uh,

227
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.900
so she can't see you. And she went public. And so did, uh, the wise ELLs,

228
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.620
the milkman and the mistress. Uh, and I wouldn't, you know,

229
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:47.590
I'm not interested in your sorted, you know, personal life,

230
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.750
but it's relevant because I'm arguing that you committed crimes and the

231
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:56.980
prosecution of the Manson family, suborned perjury, uh,

232
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.020
hid evidence, you know, manipulated the defense by planning an attorney. So, uh,

233
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.750
if I'm gonna, you know, try to make this case,

234
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:07.750
and everyone's not going to believe it because you're a Vince bully, OSI,

235
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:11.020
you know, this prominent prosecutor author, well,

236
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:13.660
I have to show that there's a pattern in this behavior.

237
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.440
Not only that you're lying under oath and the depositions in these two cases

238
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:21.250
before you settle, but you also lied to the police in the,

239
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:24.280
in the Cardwell case and you lied to the papers. And both,

240
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.920
if I have that in my book,

241
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.660
then people will be more prone to believe that you do the same thing in,

242
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:35.140
in the Tate LaBianca trial, that you would break rules to when your,

243
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:35.974
your conviction.

244
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.790
<v 0>So did he have a ghost writer for Helter Skelter?</v>

245
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.840
<v 1>No. He had a collaborator Curt. Gentry. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that makes sense.</v>

246
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.160
So, and I sound like.

247
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.020
<v 0>An insane person and sane person would probably not be able to make</v>

248
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.260
such a coherent book.

249
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.330
<v 1>I know he had every book he wrote, he had collaborators. He, so,</v>

250
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.370
um, uh,

251
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:03.200
the milkman's wife in her deposition said that when Gail

252
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.590
Vince, his wife came to her house and knocked on her door and said,

253
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.850
please do this. My husband's making me crazy. We know that he's,

254
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.330
uh, you're the milkman, isn't the father of my boy,

255
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.920
but just do it to make him stop. And the milkman's wife said, we're not,

256
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.420
we don't want to have anything to do with you.

257
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.600
People just leave us alone and go away. And she goes, you don't understand.

258
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:27.170
My husband is mentally ill. He goes, he'll never stop this.

259
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:31.820
I there's nothing I can do to get him to stop at the end of our six

260
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:34.910
hours. I don't remember if I put it in the book. I might not have.

261
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.040
He said to me, you know,

262
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.760
Gail thinks I have some psychiatric issues and she's been trying to get me to go

263
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:44.240
to a doctor forever. So, you know, I'm not saying that this is a reason,

264
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:47.060
some of this stuff might have happened, but I, I do, you know,

265
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.450
I don't even know why he would tell me that. But yeah.

266
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:53.870
So I think that he was able to be manipulated because of these.

267
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.850
<v 0>Volumes, because it was so compromised. Yeah, yeah. Do completely makes sense.</v>

268
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.200
Yeah, totally makes sense. Holy.

269
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:00.830
<v 1>He had a family,</v>

270
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.130
a whole other secret family daughter and a mistress for the next 30 years.

271
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.820
I interviewed the mistress. I didn't put it in the book. You know,

272
00:16:09.821 --> 00:16:12.400
I didn't think it was necessary. I guess now I'm telling it,

273
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:16.630
but it actually got reported after he died because the mistress had told a few

274
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:18.790
other people I'd known about her for years.

275
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:22.090
And I knew he had a daughter who was, you know, at the time of Vince's death,

276
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.380
she was in her thirties. I think.
