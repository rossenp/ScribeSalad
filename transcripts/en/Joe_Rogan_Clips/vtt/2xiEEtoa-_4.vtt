1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>Hmm. So back to gauge theory. Yeah. Gauge symmetry.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.303
What the hell was that?

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.480
<v 1>All right. Well, here's the, here's the craziest thing. Okay.</v>

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.360
There is a very confusing visual image of the fundamental unit that

5
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:18.740
you need to appreciate what gauge symmetry is all about. And, uh,

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.320
I had Jamie loaded up, um,

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.870
under the tab called planet hop.

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.290
And this is going to be Joe P F a H O P F.

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.840
What the am I looking at?

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.460
You were looking the most important object in the universe. Why is that?

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.480
That.

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.370
<v 0>Looks like some, uh, trippy screensaver on your laptop. Another puff.</v>

13
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.680
<v 1>My friend, because it's worth it. Uh,</v>

14
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.450
this is what you're looking at is a principal fiber bundle.

15
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.270
And it's a, and it is the earth.

16
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.090
<v 0>Those are the continents. That's the cool.</v>

17
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.470
<v 1>Part about it, which is,</v>

18
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.390
this is very confusing to figure out what you're looking at, but it's finite.

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.290
In other words, if we stay at for an hour or two on this,

20
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.940
and we actually answer all your questions,

21
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:07.460
you will actually know what a principle bundle is.

22
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:10.460
And you will know the arena in which gage theory exists.

23
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.360
<v 0>For folks at home that are just listening and they were,</v>

24
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:16.520
what the are these guys talking about? What is the name of this video? Jamie,

25
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.853
it's not a video.

26
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.740
<v 2>Small file on a page.</v>

27
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.350
I typed in planet hops and it was the first thing that showed up on

28
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.530
mass.toronto.edu. Okay. So extended.

29
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.363
<v 0>Thing, planet,</v>

30
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.690
H O P F for anybody wants to look at this,

31
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.440
if you're just listening and you have no idea why I'm freaking out. So.

32
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.430
<v 1>This, this was done by a friend of mine named drawer, Barna, Aton.</v>

33
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.000
I actually coded the same thing up. Um, strangely enough,

34
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.230
didn't do a brilliant job of coloring it. This looks amazing by the way.

35
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.530
So, okay. What's,

36
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.210
you're looking at is a two dimensional sphere.

37
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.040
That is the surface of the earth,

38
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.920
where an extra circle is included at

39
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.620
every point on the surface of that sphere,

40
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.010
which you're now visualizing and

41
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.500
that extra circle, which would be called the fiber.

42
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.600
Um, when you take the totality of all of those circles together,

43
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:22.640
one for each point on the surface of the sphere,

44
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.210
they create something called a three spheres.

45
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.860
That is all the points that are one unit of distance away from the origin in

46
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:32.210
four dimensional space.

47
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.740
So that three-dimensional sphere is the analog of a two dimensional sphere

48
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.340
sitting in three dimensional space. So think about a caramel apple.

49
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.260
If you've ever made caramel apples,

50
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.520
you get a disc of caramel and you wrap it around the sphere.

51
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.140
That is the apple surface, right?

52
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.630
So this is the three-dimensional version of Carmel wrapped

53
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.890
around the three-dimensional, uh,

54
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.610
sphere in four dimensional space.

55
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.710
<v 0>Now, do you understand any of this, Jamie? I'm trying well, look, dude, it's.</v>

56
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.960
<v 1>Totally trippy, right? Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.160
And so we're not going to get it completely during this session. However,

58
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.810
I think I lacked the tools. I don't think so if we lack the time.

59
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.160
So the first thing is you are finding out that one of your friends thinks this

60
00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:22.320
is the most important object in the universe,

61
00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:24.990
and you've never even heard of it right. Much less.

62
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.860
Know that there's one visual example. What's the, how's this happening?

63
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:32.070
I know exactly it does.

64
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.953
<v 0>Crazy.</v>

65
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.970
<v 1>Well, okay.</v>

66
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.770
This is what was discovered in the mid 1970s as the

67
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:45.210
connection between mathematics and different,

68
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.070
what we call differential geometry and the discipline of particle theory.

69
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.580
So two guys, uh, Jim Simons,

70
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.600
the world's now the world's most successful hedge fund manager and CN yang,

71
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.980
a person who might arguably be the world's first or second greatest living

72
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.770
theoretical physicist had a lunch seminar. And they said,

73
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:06.660
why don't we figure out how do we talk to each other?

74
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.120
And what they found out is they both had developed a version of this picture and

75
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.860
w independently, independently.

76
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.120
So it was the Rosetta stone that unleashed a revolution.

77
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.710
So when Lawrence Krauss was talking to you about gage theory, he,

78
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.320
he was saying things about chess boards and you color it white,

79
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:28.110
and you color it black. It's super confusing to me.

80
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.180
I would rather your people be confused about an actual

81
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:37.290
example of the object on which we do gauge theory that you can visually see

82
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.510
right now, if I started to tell you what gauge theory is,

83
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.980
it's pretty simple. So here's an, here's a description.

84
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:51.180
I never hear anyone say when you're doing differential calculus,

85
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.280
I don't know if you remember different calculus,

86
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.480
you try to figure out the slopes of lines, instantaneous rise over the run.

87
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.290
So that always makes sense to people. Okay?

88
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:04.110
I figured out how fast it's going up versus how fast it's going across,

89
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.380
but a question arises, which is where do you measure the rise from?

90
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.550
So for example, if I say, what is the height of Mount Everest?

91
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.673
Jamie will say.

92
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.610
<v 0>30 Was 35,000. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.800
<v 2>Something like that, something crazy like that, right?</v>

94
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.740
To say base internet connection.

95
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.370
<v 0>Let's take a guess. What do you think it is? I don't know if I can't remember.</v>

96
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.910
I want to say it's 35,000. What do you think that it was 29?

97
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.060
<v 2>29 0 2 9. Oh, okay.</v>

98
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.800
<v 0>What's the highest was the highest one. Was it two right?</v>

99
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.920
K2. The second, right? Is it has ever at the highest? Yeah.

100
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.170
<v 1>But, okay. So Everest 29, would you say 29? 29 0 2,</v>

101
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.100
9 0 2 9 above what? C-level. Okay.

102
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.810
Where is Mount Everest located? The Himalayas. What Tibet? What? See, uh,

103
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:02.170
there's no ocean there. Sorry. Right. So right.

104
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.170
Like we snuck in it's above sea level and there's no ocean.

105
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.240
<v 0>So we start from the center of the earth. We.</v>

106
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.250
<v 1>Have this structure called the joyed,</v>

107
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.360
which is the interpolation of sea level as if sea level is,

108
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:15.610
if the earth was only ocean and there was no tide.

109
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.830
<v 0>And as if there's some sort of a.</v>

110
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.040
<v 1>So we snuck in the reference level. That's my point is,</v>

111
00:06:20.041 --> 00:06:24.700
is that we teach these kids to repeat why it's 29,000 and change above sea

112
00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:26.290
level. And there's no sea, right?

113
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.790
So that reference level is the magic of gauge theory, right?

114
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.650
Which is that we measure the rise over the run based on a custom

115
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.203
level.

116
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.380
<v 0>So, uh, a level that we all agree upon.</v>

117
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.201
<v 1>Well,</v>

118
00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:43.720
let's imagine that you and I are in some country experiencing hyperinflation,

119
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.850
right? And I'm your boss. And you say, dude, I need a raise.

120
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.180
I said, w well, look, I've told you,

121
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:55.960
I would hire you for 10,000 DNRs a month.

122
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.210
And you say, yeah. I said, well, your salary is constant.

123
00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:05.410
I took the derivative of it. I've paid you 10,000 last month, 10,000 this month.

124
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.770
So you're getting the same amount. Derivative equals zero it's constant salary.

125
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.780
Now you have to come back at me in calculus. And you say, no,

126
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:15.250
I don't like your notion of the derivative,

127
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.630
because what you're doing is you're measuring the absolute number of DNRs that

128
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.553
you're paying me.

129
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.830
But what I want to do is I want to measure it in purchasing power,

130
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.310
because I'm losing money every month that you don't increase my salary.

131
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.560
So I now come up with a version of the calculus in which Mike,

132
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.390
his salary is not constant because it's being measured relative to purchasing

133
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.220
power rather than absolute units.

134
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.260
That's gauge there is that you're bringing in a reference level

135
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.630
that does the differentiation. So you're measuring rise over,

136
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:52.240
run by customizing the problem.

137
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.030
So these were two different applications of the calculus.

138
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.690
The cheating employer says, I want to go with constant DNRs.

139
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.730
The gifted employee says not so fast. I know gauge theory.

140
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:08.080
I want to use a custom reference level, which has purchasing power, right?

141
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:12.070
So it's like sneaking the joyed into Tibet to measure Everest.

142
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.050
I've got my custom level. Does.

143
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.100
<v 0>This make sense to you? Yes. It makes sense. Right. But now explain it,</v>

144
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.113
say what he said.

145
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.010
<v 2>Uh, I mean, we would need a new reference of what w what do you want to measure?</v>

146
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:28.000
What would I like a new conversation to have like a flat level. Right, right.

147
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:28.630
I guess.

148
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.110
<v 0>Yeah. It would be really difficult for me to recall a day from now.</v>

149
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.920
Maybe we'd know something.

150
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.530
<v 2>We eat now we'd might help.</v>

151
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.940
<v 0>Pop a mushroom cap. See what's up. It's um,</v>

152
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.690
it's still in reference to quantum physics,

153
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:50.710
like how you would use gauge symmetry. Well, but let's say you let's.

154
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.900
<v 1>Look at some more cool stuff. Okay. The visual cortex,</v>

155
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:56.400
because everything that we can do visually should inform what we can do

156
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:57.210
linguistically.

157
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.320
So you should push everything into the visual realm that you can. Uh,

158
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.560
what do you mean by that? Like, well, I just showed you the hop vibration,

159
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.680
which is the only, in some sense,

160
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:12.480
the only mature picture I can show you of a principle vibration in

161
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.950
geometry or physics that is honest and has the full

162
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:20.400
complexity. It's got a certain kind of nodded newness to it.

163
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.050
It's got something that we would call curvature and it is visualized.

164
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.360
And so it would be better that we spent, you know,

165
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:33.360
a day or two on this most important object,

166
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:37.950
which we think reality is based around and that you visually got comfortable

167
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:42.690
with it. And then you said, okay, now tell me again, what gauge symmetry is.

168
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.320
And then instead of Lawrence talking about this chess board and the colors and

169
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:50.850
all this stuff by analogy, you'd actually be seeing gauge theory visually,

170
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.610
like I could program a computer and have done.

171
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:57.180
So to show you visually what a gauged theory is,

172
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.510
and it takes some time to sort of understand what the trippy pictures are,

173
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.190
but let's bring up the Escher staircase.

174
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.940
And Jamie has a nice wrinkle on this, that instead of using MCs or staircase,

175
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.680
he's got this animated guy who just keeps going down, all right.

176
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.570
Now what's going on with the stairs.

177
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.160
Now the stairs are sort of an optical illusion because obviously it can't just

178
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.490
keep going down. But then you build these system systems like rock, paper,

179
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.610
scissors. What's the best thing to throw in rock paper scissors.

180
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.310
<v 0>Well, it depends on what you throw. Wow.</v>

181
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.910
<v 1>But we should be able to agree that rock is better than scissors. Rock.</v>

182
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.980
<v 0>Is better than says paper's better than rock.</v>

183
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.730
<v 1>Right? So you go around that thing. And now the point is that you get to like,</v>

184
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:42.240
rock is much better than rock, right? And that seems crazy.

185
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.390
Now that in concept would be what we would call Holland on me.

186
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.110
The weird sentence rock is better than rock because of that going around.

187
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.990
<v 0>Why rock is better than rock? I don't get it like rock rock.</v>

188
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.990
<v 1>So theirs is better than paper. Paper is better than rock.</v>

189
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.940
So by transitivity rock,

190
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:02.240
is there for better than rock because you went around the loop and came back to

191
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:06.650
rock. It's like MMA, math. Yeah. Yeah. Or if like, if you're,

192
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.670
if you're changing a currencies and you don't spend any of it,

193
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:14.420
because you keep losing using your credit card, by the time you come home,

194
00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:18.470
you have more money than when you left because the exchange rates did some

195
00:11:18.471 --> 00:11:22.730
things. So that when you changed into each currency, you somehow got richer.

196
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.000
But.

197
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.391
<v 0>By saying,</v>

198
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:26.540
Brock is better than Brock you're denying the fact they're exactly the same.

199
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.880
Well, no, they're not, you're not addressing it.

200
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:30.380
You just want to get to the linguistic.

201
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.390
<v 1>Linguistic fallacy. Right. So the idea that this system here,</v>

202
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:40.250
so those stairs in engage theory would be these reference levels for the

203
00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:41.084
derivative.

204
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.500
And you can have situations where the reference levels don't knit flatly

205
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:47.450
together. Right?

206
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.670
And so by virtue of that, we would say that the system has curvature.

207
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.930
Curvature is the extremeness of,

208
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.440
of these better than transitive statements.

209
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.400
<v 0>Yeah. Folks for people who are just listening, we're looking at,</v>

210
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.000
if you've never seen those Escher, uh, etches those sketches,

211
00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:07.530
they're very strange because what there are,

212
00:12:07.531 --> 00:12:11.730
is a bunch of staircases that appear to always be going

213
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.570
downhill. Even if one of them is above the other one, it's very strange,

214
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.230
very strange.

215
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.950
And this one we're watching an animated guy rolled down this staircase

216
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.070
constantly, even though it really looks like somehow or another,

217
00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:26.190
it must go up somewhere, but you don't ever see it going up,

218
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.290
but it's also a factor of the illusion of perspective and how it's drawn and,

219
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.750
and, you know, playing games with lines.

220
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.850
<v 1>Exactly. But if you do this very weird experiment,</v>

221
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:42.240
which we didn't know about until the late fifties called the Aronoff Boehm

222
00:12:42.241 --> 00:12:46.590
experiment, um, if you run, um,

223
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.400
a, uh, uh, electric, uh,

224
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.930
current through a wire that's insulated, um, it's,

225
00:12:54.931 --> 00:12:59.280
it appears not to have any electromagnetic field outside of the installation.

226
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.250
However, if you do some sort of quantum interference experiment,

227
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.650
you can tell that there's current going through,

228
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.050
because it affects the phage phase shift.

229
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.670
Let's say of an electron orbiting that insulated

230
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.960
electromagnetic system.

231
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.610
So nobody thought that that was going to happen because they thought, well,

232
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.750
it insulator would keep the,

233
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.460
we thought the electromagnetic field is what determines the shift in the

234
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.661
electron, but it's insulated.

235
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:26.730
So there is no electromagnetic field to worry about.

236
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.610
It turned out that it wasn't the electromagnetic field alone.

237
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.120
It was some previous geometric concept,

238
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.870
which is called the electromagnetic potential that determined something about

239
00:13:36.871 --> 00:13:41.490
the phase shift. So this is your staircase in the case of electromagnetism,

240
00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:44.430
it's like the photons are the analog of those steps.

241
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.420
They're partially would determine the derivative operators.

242
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.680
This is reference levels. And again, in our discussion of the, uh,

243
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.560
am I paying you the right amount and a hyperinflationary economy?

244
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.010
So all of these things you're trying to figure out, well,

245
00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:03.180
that's an optical illusion, but that effect actually occurs in some systems,

246
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.070
not as an optical illusion. Yes. Right? So this weirdness,

247
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.253
um,

248
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.180
requires a fair amount in terms of either study of math

249
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.080
or learning visualizations, but there's no way to achieve it.

250
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:22.830
In my experience with linguistic communications,

251
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.660
like all the stuff that gets said about, you know, the universe is expanding,

252
00:14:27.661 --> 00:14:30.720
or let me tell you what it gates theory is and,

253
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:33.000
and why there's a reason it's confusing.

254
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:35.070
It's because it doesn't make any effing sense. Right.

255
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.360
<v 0>I see what you're saying sort of, but so this is,</v>

256
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.920
this is like what Fineman said. If you think, you know, quantum physics,

257
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.060
you don't know quantum physics.

258
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.550
<v 1>Some of that, like there's, you know,</v>

259
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.010
one of the most important things in the world is this called a spinner,

260
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.540
like the electrons and the protons correspond to things called spinners.

261
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:59.630
And the average person has no idea that spinners exist.

262
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.370
What's more spinners have a property that when I tell it to you,

263
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:08.930
linguistically won't make any sense. All right, let's do this with coffee,

264
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:14.060
hit me with it. Okay. So yeah. Thank you, sir.

265
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.290
Perfect. Okay. All right. And here's the problem. Okay. Hold your cup. Nope.

266
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.150
Sorry from the bottom. All right.

267
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.040
And here's the first challenge without spilling it. Okay. I want you,

268
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:27.350
and without readjusting your grip on the bottom of your cup,

269
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.060
I want you to turn your cup 360 degrees. No, no, no. Uh, sorry.

270
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.950
Turn your, your fingers should not change on the cup. Okay.

271
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.150
Turn the cup. 360 degrees without spilling it and try to take a sip.

272
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.050
Okay. That didn't work. No. Now, without coming back, how would you take a sip.

273
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.150
<v 0>If I got it all the way around that way? Yeah.</v>

274
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.980
<v 1>Mr. Jiu-jitsu man. I don't know what happened. Two.</v>

275
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.430
Yeah, no, no. You're going to do it. All right. You ready? Yeah. Okay.

276
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:08.780
Here we go. Okay. You're going to go around the circle. 360. Okay.

277
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.330
Right.

278
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.530
<v 3>Now I'm screwed. If I don't bring it back underneath. Oh, I see.</v>

279
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.960
<v 1>So that system required 720 degrees of rotation unexpectedly.</v>

280
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.450
Oh, you just keep going. Right. Okay.

281
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.890
Now the idea that there are objects that don't come back to themselves

282
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.860
under 360 degrees of rotation,

283
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:33.950
but require seven 20 is probably something you've never thought about before in

284
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.260
your life. Right. But without that,

285
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:38.180
you wouldn't have the poly exclusion principle.

286
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:40.040
You wouldn't have the stability of matter.

287
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.490
And this thing is called the Philippine wind dance. Jamie, do you want to.

288
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.050
<v 0>That's not very seductive job.</v>

289
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.070
It seems like some very odd ethnic dance.

290
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.160
<v 1>Yeah. But like, maybe you could do 11th planet jujitsu. Here we go.</v>

291
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.040
So this spinner is one of the coolest,

292
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.290
most important objects anywhere.

293
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.860
And it was discovered to be important in physics, by a guy named Paul Dirac

294
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.520
right. It's fun. Okay. So this 720 theory

295
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.470
is entirely responsible for the world that we live in.

296
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.190
<v 0>This is so bizarre to watch an animation and he knows about.</v>

297
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.670
<v 1>It, right? Like, unless you're hanging out with physicists,</v>

298
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.720
they don't tell you that electromagnetism has to do with the fact that there's a

299
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:36.230
secret circle at every point in space and time that's invisible to you.

300
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:40.490
They don't tell you that there's stuff that requires 720 degrees of rotation.

301
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:42.170
They just say mind blowing stuff about.

302
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.243
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

303
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.440
So what is happening in the 720 degrees of rotation in the quantum

304
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:49.274
world?

305
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.420
<v 1>There's an object that is requiring this just the way the cup arm system</v>

306
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:58.260
requires 720 degrees of rotation. It's called a spinner.

307
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:04.140
And that spinner is how we model the electron neutrino,

308
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.500
corks, all that is spinoff aerial matter.

309
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.190
<v 0>Sir. That's a good, long pause. I like it. Yeah. And what,</v>

310
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.430
where does this fit in, in our model of the universe? Like,

311
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.820
what is the function of this? Why is it there? What is it?

312
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.170
How do we know it's there?

313
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.480
<v 1>Well, we know it's there. Um, because, uh,</v>

314
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.650
when Dereck, so there was this problem with like the Schrodinger equation,

315
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.390
Schrodinger equation takes one derivative in terms of the direction of time

316
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.110
and takes two derivatives in the direction of all the spatial directions.

317
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.730
But because Einstein told us that space and time are woven together for the

318
00:18:46.731 --> 00:18:48.170
theory to be relativistic,

319
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.560
you need the same number of derivatives of time as of space,

320
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.940
because space time is sort of one kind of semi unified object. All right.

321
00:18:55.941 --> 00:18:59.960
That means you either have to boost the number of derivatives of time up to two

322
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.740
to match the two derivatives in the directions of space,

323
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.510
or you have to knock the two direct derivatives in the spatial directions down

324
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:11.330
to one derivative to get it to be equal. Now,

325
00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:13.880
one direction gets you to something called the client coordinate equation.

326
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.100
What Dirac did is he took a square root of the client Gordon equation

327
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.430
to get these spinners. So he had these numbers.

328
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.030
He didn't understand at first that he was going to get kicked into this world of

329
00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:29.150
spinners. He came up with a square root equation,

330
00:19:29.151 --> 00:19:33.500
in which eight times be thought to be numbers was not equal to B times a was

331
00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:36.290
like equal to the negative of B times day. So it was like,

332
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:37.200
what two numbers when,

333
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.000
when you multiply them matter in which order there wasn't numbers,

334
00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:44.570
it was matrices. So this was one of the great insights, you know,

335
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.710
rival to Einstein in terms of the depth of what it told us about the universe.

336
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.440
Most of us haven't really heard of Paul to rock.

337
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.620
We don't realize that he has one of the three most important equations in

338
00:19:54.621 --> 00:19:55.430
physics.

339
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.190
<v 0>Now, when you say three most important,</v>

340
00:19:58.191 --> 00:20:02.990
important in how it's applicable to everyday life or

341
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:07.970
important in how it's given us an understanding in quantum physics or

342
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:11.090
important, how it's understand it, it's it's understanding is,

343
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.610
is significant to quantum physics.

344
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.360
<v 1>We're talking about bedrock reality, like you and I are having a conversation.</v>

345
00:20:17.361 --> 00:20:20.690
And if you're a matrix fan and what we might call the construct, okay,

346
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.180
what is the construct made of mate?

347
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.990
So the way I do it is I think of it as a newspaper story. There's where,

348
00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:30.680
and when did it happen? There was who and what was involved.

349
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.110
And there's how and why. Okay. So where, and when is space and time clearly

350
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.440
the who and the what to me, let's say the, who is the spin Noriel stuff.

351
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.120
It's like electrons, protons, neutrons, corks, the stuff that we're made.

352
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.220
And then you and I are only able to see each other because we're passing photons

353
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:55.390
back and forth, which are forced particles. They're not spin Oriel.

354
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.160
They, they come back to themselves after 360 degrees,

355
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:04.690
they don't require seven 20. So this is sort of the, you know,

356
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:06.460
if you going to go to a play, you'd have the,

357
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.910
the dramatic personnel of the play given to you at the beginning.

358
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.850
So this is what this universe is.

359
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:15.640
It's a story about space and time.

360
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.690
Where wherein when about what is in that, you know,

361
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:21.670
like who are the players and what equipment are they using?

362
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.160
That's like bolt-ons and Fermi informations.

363
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.490
And then there's the how and the why, which is the equations and the LaGrand.
