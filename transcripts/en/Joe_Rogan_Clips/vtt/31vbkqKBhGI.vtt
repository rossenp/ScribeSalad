00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.893
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 2>Now, obviously the next course of progression for a guy like you would be MMA.</v>

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.240
Yeah. Now I know that you had talked about doing MMA in the past,

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.200
but now it seems like it's actually gonna happen.

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.503
<v 1>Yeah. Um,</v>

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.000
so John doesn't want me to compete in MMA because he feels like jujitsu is just

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.230
about to break into that next level of professional sports. Uh,

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.750
so for me, at least right now,

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.670
I feel like I need at least someone from my team to be able to do the things

10
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:34.190
that I'm doing before I can kinda move away from jujitsu into MMA.

11
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:36.430
Because right now we have Gary MMA, he's carrying our flag,

12
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.630
our team's flag in MMA. And we have me at the top of the heap in jujitsu.

13
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.580
So like if Craig or Gira and my brother, um,

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.140
can start doing the things that I'm doing and they win in, ATCC absolute maybe,

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.901
or, you know,

16
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.420
they go out and they start beating and submitting all the high level guys.

17
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.820
Then I feel like maybe I can leave, uh, jujitsu. Cause if I start fighting MMA,

18
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:55.660
I'm gonna focus on MMA. Um,

19
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.060
so I feel like if one of my teammates can kind of take my place,

20
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.810
then I can start moving into MMA and then go from there.

21
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.730
<v 0>So you look at it as a, you really do genuinely look at it as a team effort.</v>

22
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.890
You're not looking at just as your, as an individual.

23
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.530
<v 1>Most athletes are very selfish and they just take, take, take. Whereas we have,</v>

24
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.010
we have a, we have a very great, a very good team cohesion and, uh, you know,

25
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:18.450
we're always looking out for one another and, you know,

26
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.480
I find that that's the way that people operate best. Um,

27
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.600
if you look at most teams,

28
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.960
it's basically just a bunch of tough guys in a room would train together who

29
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:30.080
have no loyalty. And if someone offers them a better deal,

30
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.440
they're gonna go somewhere else and, and train there. Um, whereas without like,

31
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.400
uh, whereas with us, we're very loyal to John and, uh, you know,

32
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:40.000
everything that everything that we do is the same.

33
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.910
Like my game is very similar to, John's very similar, what to,

34
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:46.390
Gary's very similar to Craig's we all are taught by John and we all follow the

35
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:48.550
same ideas and the same philosophy of jujitsu.

36
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.790
So the loyalty within the team is, uh, is very strong. And, uh, you know,

37
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.990
I, I feel that it's, it's always gonna be a team effort. Um, you know, without,

38
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.350
without John, I wouldn't be as good as I am without Gary.

39
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.950
I wouldn't be as good as am without Nikki.

40
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.980
It's the collaborative of minds in the gym that, that really pushes you forward.

41
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.380
Um, so, you know, I feel like we're different in that,

42
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.620
in that sense that we're not a team that recruits people,

43
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.820
we're a team that builds that builds athletes from almost the ground up.

44
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.180
Like you see like, uh, you know, a lot of the big MMA teams, uh,

45
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.780
or even the big jujitsu teams like Altos, for example, they recruit guys,

46
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.930
guys who are already successful. They recruit him,

47
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:28.570
they give him a place to live. They give him a training program and they,

48
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.170
they just recruit tough guys.

49
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.330
But if you look at a guy like Andre and you look at his black belts,

50
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.730
they all have vastly different games.

51
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.370
NY end's game is different than Andre's hanger's game is different than Andre's

52
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:41.050
Keenan's game is different than, than Andre's.

53
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.040
And it's basically just a team of recruited guys who are a bunch of tough guys

54
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.040
training in the same room. Whereas John,

55
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.040
we have a team of homegrown guys who all do the same thing.

56
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:56.800
Like they all have the discernible games that all mimic what John teaches, uh,

57
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.920
and they just have, you know,

58
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.280
slight changes and variations due to our physical attributes and, and, uh, and,

59
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.433
and, uh, personalities.

60
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.440
<v 0>Now, when you say you think of it as a team,</v>

61
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.400
you mean this is taken it to a completely different level,

62
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.480
cuz you're not willing to progress your career outside the realm of jujitsu

63
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.800
until someone else can carry the crown. Yes.

64
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.000
That's that's next level commitment to the team philosophy.

65
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.230
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, like I said, you have a guy like John,</v>

66
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.470
who's like the most selfless person in the world.

67
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.750
Like he shows up every day and he gives you everything. Like, you know, I want,

68
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.990
I want what's best for the team. Uh, even if it's not what's best for me,

69
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.870
you know, I wanna, I want what's what's best for, for, for John's team. Uh,

70
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.230
you know,

71
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.060
I want him to go down in history as being the guy who has the absolute best

72
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.980
team in the world. And, um, you know,

73
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.460
right now you can make the argument that sure. You know,

74
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:45.420
Gordon's the best in the world,

75
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.380
but the rest of the guys don't win as much as him. So I, I want to get those,

76
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.500
the rest of the guys on my team to,

77
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.180
to my level so that you don't have the argument anymore. Of sure. Gordon's good.

78
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:59.460
But he's the only one who really wins when it counts. Um, you know, I want,

79
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.090
I want to go into ADCC with my team and I wanna win every single division.

80
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.970
<v 0>So that would be insane that, you know,</v>

81
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.690
that's not outside the realm of possibility either. That's.

82
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.090
<v 1>What's crazy. Yeah. I mean, next year we have, Gary might cut to 66 kilos.</v>

83
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.850
So if Gary's at 66, my brother will be at 77. Craig will be at 88,

84
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.920
I'll be at 99. They let me do division. And then Nick rot will be at 99. Plus.

85
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.800
<v 0>What do you mean if they let you do the division?</v>

86
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.120
<v 1>So for ADCC, when you win the absolute, you go to the super fight.</v>

87
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.120
So the, the, the, the,

88
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.640
the super fight champion fights the winner of the absolute.

89
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.840
Now I won the absolute last year, so I'm only supposed to have one fight,

90
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.670
but I've requested do the weight division as well.

91
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.270
Cuz you normally would just do the super fight, but I wanna do the super fight.

92
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.510
And I also wanna do my weight division. So I have, instead of having one match,

93
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.310
I'd had five matches. No one's ever asked to do that.

94
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.270
People have asked to do the absolute before,

95
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.310
but the problem is if I win the absolute and then I win the

96
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.910
super fight, the super fight winner's supposed to fight the absolute.

97
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.060
So you can't fight yourself, right? So you,

98
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.180
it doesn't make sense to do the super fight and the absolute,

99
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.500
but it does make sense to do the weight division and the absolute. So if I,

100
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.100
if I, if they let me do the weight division,

101
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.420
I'll be the first person in history to ever, to ever do the weight division,

102
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.380
plus the super fight at the same time.

103
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.460
<v 0>Wow. Now how is Gary juggling training for MMA and, and jus.</v>

104
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.250
<v 1>That guy's a machine. He basically just, he didn't,</v>

105
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.570
he didn't do less jujitsu to do MMA.

106
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.250
He just added MMA on top of the jujitsu sessions.

107
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.450
So he trains MMA seven days a week and he spars lightly seven days a week.

108
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.090
And then he finishes that.

109
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.170
And right now we don't have a gym set up in Puerto Rico.

110
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.840
So we're working around the schedule, the class schedule of the gym owner.

111
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.280
So we have, mm.

112
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.040
He does MMA at nine and then he trains for like an hour spars.

113
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.360
Then he has like a 30 minute break and then he does, uh,

114
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.360
and then he does jujitsu at 11 and he just adds the session on.

115
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.520
So he does MMA to seven days a week.

116
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.280
And like within like two hours of each other.

117
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.760
<v 0>And when he's training MMA, he's also grappling. Yeah. So he's grappling twice.</v>

118
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.230
Yeah.

119
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.480
<v 1>Most, most of the MMA training is, is shoot.</v>

120
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.640
Boxing is standing to take downs because he is already so good on the ground.

121
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.760
He needs to get, he needs to work and fence wrestling and, and shoot boxing.

122
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.350
Uh, but he definitely, he definitely is some grappling when he does MMA.

123
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.110
So he grapples and, and spars,

124
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.070
and then he pretty much goes right to jujitsu and has to do that. So, I mean,

125
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.990
that's definitely not an easy thing to do.

126
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.310
And seven days a week is definitely not an easy thing to do. And.

127
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.710
<v 0>How is he doing it in terms of striking coaching? Like, is he,</v>

128
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.790
did he bring someone with him to Puerto Rico?

129
00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:38.180
Was he using a different in New York? What's.

130
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.780
<v 1>He doing? He, he uses John. John is our striking coach. Really? I'm telling you,</v>

131
00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:46.660
John knows just as much about every martial artist as he does jujitsu.

132
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:49.340
Like John is our wrestling coach. John's our jujitsu coach.

133
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.700
John's our striking coach. John's our MMA coach. Like John coaches, Gary,

134
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.260
for every aspect of MMA wall wrestling, everything. Holy. Yeah.

135
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.810
<v 0>So he coaches him for kicking and everything. Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.130
<v 1>Dude, people know this about John John's first martial art was Moai.</v>

137
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.050
John did Moai for over a decade when he was growing up and he studied all the

138
00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:14.130
best Mo Thai guys. I mean, John knows a lot about striking. I mean, he,

139
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.010
he coach, like I said, like, people know this about John.

140
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:19.280
They think he's just a leg lot guy or just the grad or like he coaches Gary.

141
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.440
And like, Gary's like, he's progressing fast. As far as the striking he's going,

142
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.280
um, he's only been striking for a year and a half now. And he's, uh, you know,

143
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.520
he looks, he looks comfortable out there. He does. Um.

144
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.720
<v 0>And, uh, that's shocking that he is only been doing it a year and a half. Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 1>A year and a half, two years maybe. Uh, but yeah, John's his coach, John, John,</v>

146
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.710
John coaches, everything &lt;laugh&gt;.
