00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 1>Experience. So let's talk about China. Um, yeah,</v>

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.160
so I just mentioned that one, that story that just came out,

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:12.150
which is that they actually prevented PPE from being delivered outside of China

5
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:14.730
so that, you know, we are our companies 3m, they produce it.

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:16.230
There should have been exported out.

7
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:19.350
They prevented that there was a study that showed that if they had,

8
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.280
if they had actually been honest and given us, given the world three weeks,

9
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:27.510
extra notice, 95% of the spread could have been contained.

10
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.020
Okay. 5 million people left [inaudible]. Um,

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.020
 they allowed travel out of Wu Han 5 million people, right

12
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.020
? Traveling all over China, all over the world. The reason this

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.020
, this became so bad in Italy and Iran is because of the belt and road initiative. These are major hotspots for China's economic development and

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.020
, um,

15
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.853
 the belt and road initiative. So then let's get into the world health organization.

16
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.700
Uh, there has gotta be a come to Jesus moment on the world health organization.

17
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:58.440
Again, mid January world health organization says that it says that, uh,

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.790
or they repeat the claims made by China that, that, um,

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.130
that it can't even be transmitted human to human contact. Uh, on January 30th,

20
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.560
world health organization says something along the lines of,

21
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.490
there's no reason to be shutting down travel or limiting travel.

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.630
So they are directly controlled by the Chinese government and world health

23
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.630
organization. It should also be worth noting. I forget the guy's name,

24
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:25.110
who runs it, the director of the who, but, um, he's, um,

25
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.210
the latest from Ethiopia and Ethiopia is one of these countries that is a

26
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:33.810
huge, has a huge investments from the belt and road initiative.

27
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.620
And so, I mean, we need to be calling for a complete,

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.530
a complete change out in leadership of the WHL.

29
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.350
<v 0>I mean, we've seen that video where they refuse to acknowledge,</v>

30
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:47.070
he refuses to acknowledge the existence of Taiwan. He wouldn't even say it,

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.360
the one that keeps questioning him and he shuts his, his, his camera off.

32
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.130
It was like when you asked me about marijuana use and I pretended I couldn't

34
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:56.964
hear you.

35
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.750
<v 0>You were joking though. We were right in front of each other, joking.</v>

36
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.560
That's different. I mean, that guy, yeah. He shut his connection off.

37
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:09.120
And then he said, China's doing a great job. Let's move on. And you know,

38
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.250
like what very well.

39
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.650
<v 1>So deeply corrupt as so deeply corrupt. And I mean,</v>

40
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.560
you know, I don't,

41
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:21.350
I don't think that who will ever have the standing that it did before,

42
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.510
not without an immediate and serious leadership change, um,

43
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.510
because they've lost all credibility and then move on, you know,

44
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:30.080
fast forward the Chinese were perpetuating. It.

45
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:32.480
It's unclear whether they started this room, this,

46
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:35.610
this talking point or whether it was the progressive left and the Chinese just

47
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.530
repeated it and latched onto it.

48
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.340
But this whole notion that it's racist to call the virus, the Chinese virus was,

49
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.420
it was such an utterly absurd thing that we were focused on as a country when

50
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.370
that just doesn't matter. It just didn't no matter,

51
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.430
no matter what your opinion on whether it's actually racist or not. I mean,

52
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.000
I personally don't think it is. There's a G there's,

53
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.760
there's a history of calling a virus, some kind of geographic name,

54
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.520
but based on where it's from, that's fine. The point is,

55
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.560
is that Chinese authorities were tweeted.

56
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.070
We're spreading that quite a bit in February. Um,

57
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.570
so they're doing things like that.

58
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:11.740
Then they claim that perhaps it was the U S army that had started the virus.

59
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.750
And, um,

60
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.630
they haven't let international inspectors go in and investigate the,

61
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.460
the origins of this virus so that we can better understand it. They've, I mean,

62
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.291
it's there,

63
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:27.280
there's going to be there already is quite a few things that we're looking at is

64
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.820
what we can do to one rebalance our supply chains as a country.

65
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:35.020
We need a better industrial policy on bringing a lot of important manufacturing

66
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.020
back home and, and being more competitive in that sense. Um.

67
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.390
<v 0>Can I ask you this? Is there any evidence that this was a man-made virus?</v>

68
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.991
You know,

69
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:48.490
this is the big conspiracy theory that there was some sort of a level four bio

70
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.960
weapons lab and Wu Han.

71
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.590
<v 1>Yeah. And I just don't know. I mean, I, I could pontificate.</v>

72
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.220
<v 0>But it is true that there was a bio weapons lab and anyone. Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.220
<v 1>I don't know. I don't know if it's meant for a weapons,</v>

74
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.010
but there's certainly a lab there that, that would have housed, um,

75
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.760
viruses like this. And yeah, we just, we just don't know the answers. Um,

76
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.780
and I don't, you know, especially in my position, I don't want to, of course,

77
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.190
I don't want to, I don't want to assume.

78
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.420
<v 0>This because of the consequences of this virus and all this,</v>

79
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.520
that this awakens people to the need to manufacture things in

80
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:24.340
America, particularly particularly medical supplies.

81
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.380
So many things that we rely on China for.

82
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.010
<v 1>100%. And, um, this is, this is something Trump has been talking about forever.</v>

83
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.150
And I think both,

84
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.930
I think he's received skepticism from both the left and the right on that, um,

85
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.390
for different reasons, uh, mostly from the right, because, you know, we,

86
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.370
we, we have an,

87
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.260
a Republicans need to come to terms with this is we have really adhered very

88
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:54.160
closely to a more libertarian mindset of free trade, where,

89
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.360
where the more free trade, the better, um, where,

90
00:04:57.361 --> 00:04:59.590
where somebody else can make it cheaper than,

91
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.660
than we should just have them make it all right.

92
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.280
This comparative advantage theory. And that's true in theory, it is true, but,

93
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.000
but we, we, we can't ignore it, the consequences. And I,

94
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.570
I think we have ignored those consequences for a little too long.

95
00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:17.470
Like what happens when you, when you close down that factory? Yeah. Like your,

96
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:20.440
your, your t-shirts are 3 cents cheaper per unit,

97
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:23.140
which is a really big deal for the margins of your company. And yeah.

98
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:26.260
That company can hire more people and you get a cheaper t-shirt, but,

99
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.930
but we kind of miss those manufacturing jobs. Like there, if you're, there's,

100
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.060
there's also, um, there's like a moral or not a moral,

101
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:37.330
but like a psychological benefit to these manufacturing jobs as well.

102
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.850
You're creating something, people like that.

103
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:43.390
People like to feel like they're producing something and that they have

104
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:47.440
meaningful work that pays pretty decent. And, um,

105
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.730
so there's consequences and there's consequences to the efficiency that that has

106
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:54.280
occurred. And then there's national security consequences.

107
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.170
And we're learning about those right now.

108
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:59.480
And it's not just medical supplies that we need to take a look at. Uh,

109
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.950
I'm from Houston. So our oil and gas industry is, and isn't a big,

110
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.920
big dire straits right now. We risk,

111
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.230
we risk the possibility that we lose energy into

112
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.700
between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Now,

113
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.220
hopefully I think the administration has been able to use some diplomatic

114
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.540
pressure and figure that out to it to an extent, but there's,

115
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.470
we have to come to,

116
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.730
we have to decide whether we think there's value in doing things ourselves.

117
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.240
That's the ultimate question. And I would answer that yes, there is now,

118
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.040
do we take it to an extreme? No, but are we out of balance right now?

119
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.110
Maybe yes. And maybe we do need to look at, uh, changing our supply chains.

120
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.480
Maybe that means some things are just slightly more expensive.

121
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.250
Maybe that's what it means. Um, but th but for a lot of element,

122
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.240
for a lot of items,

123
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.400
we have to be looking at it that way to be thinking that way.

124
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.211
<v 0>Well,</v>

125
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.980
I th I think also when you look at what are the consequences of allowing us

126
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.110
to have things manufactured over there,

127
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.340
what kind of karma do we take on for when you look at Foxconn,

128
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.830
those buildings, where they manufacture iPhones,

129
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:06.230
they have nets around them to keep people from jumping off,

130
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.050
like how many people have to jump before you put nets up and like, what, what,

131
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.600
what has to happen there where you, your,

132
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.990
your life sucks so hard to make an iPhone? I mean,

133
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:22.640
how much would it cost to make those here? Is it worth it for us? And, you know,

134
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.650
is there some real value in that th th the label

135
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:30.520
that we used to love to look for made in America? That's,

136
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:32.510
that's not really discussed that much anymore,

137
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.610
but I think it would be wise for all of us to invest in that idea again.

138
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.150
<v 1>Yeah. And the problem is, is like, we,</v>

139
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.020
we hold ourselves to those standards of good labor conditions and good

140
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:46.610
environmental standards. And we,

141
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.090
but we punish ourselves almost out of business completely.

142
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.310
And so we punish ourselves out of business,

143
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:56.450
usually through these specific regulations, whether it's labor or environmental,

144
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.820
but then we also engage in free trade.

145
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:02.630
So it almost guarantees that we lose out our own manufacturing base,

146
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.520
or sometimes the energy sector, whatever it is, because we, we, we,

147
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:11.330
we simultaneously make ourselves less competitive while also forcing our

148
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:14.240
people to compete against people who are,

149
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.650
who work their employees so hard that they have to build nets around the office

150
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.880
as they throw themselves off of it. That's such a good question, by the way,

151
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:26.720
like how, how many, how many people actually jumped before they put the nets?

152
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.340
<v 0>Yeah. That is just a crazy reality.</v>

153
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.710
And it's also one that we just accept because we want an iPhone. And I mean,

154
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.710
apple is one of the most profitable countries. I mean, companies,

155
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:41.630
rather than the world's ever known, I mean,

156
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:45.170
this is a spectacularly profitable company. And like.

157
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.540
<v 1>And there's, there's a whole of government policy and a whole of society.</v>

158
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.480
I'm not going to say government it's really society that we all have to kind of

159
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:58.350
collectively look at this and it's going to take the private sector as well. Um,

160
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.110
because apple would tell you, okay, I love to do,

161
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.380
I'd love to open up a plant here and they do,

162
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.570
but they'd like to do more.

163
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.200
The reason they don't is because when they put out that job application,

164
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.890
nobody will show up or at least not enough people. And so,

165
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.510
and so what does that tell you?

166
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:19.230
It tells you that we w we're not educating people in the skills that are

167
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:21.540
necessary to engage in these jobs.

168
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.400
There's a lot of technical skills that we are not teaching because so this gets

169
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.720
to education policy. Why aren't we promoting more stem?

170
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.010
Why aren't we promoting via the, you know, the federal loan program,

171
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.000
student loans,

172
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.190
why aren't we promoting things and majors that actually get us to a

173
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.890
higher paying job? Why, you know, why,

174
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.600
why should the taxpayer be on the hook for a major that is guaranteed not to pay

175
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:50.190
anything once you graduate? Like,

176
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:54.390
what are you going to do with that degree and whatever, who knows? I,

177
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.150
you can name it. You know what I'm talking, but you can name a bunch, right?

178
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.780
And gender studies, whatever it's, these are not high paying things,

179
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:03.300
and they're not useful for the economy that we want.

180
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:07.020
And so what kind of incentives need to shift as my, as my point

181
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.590
to encourage more of that. So that apple,

182
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.550
when they do look at a place to build a new factory, they can be,

183
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.880
they can be confident that people will actually show up to work there.
