00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Right? How did we get here? It's 2020.</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.850
We are facing a global pandemic,

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:11.880
which incidentally I do want to talk to you about. Okay. Um,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.800
we are facing a global pandemic.

5
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.920
We are facing rioting in the streets,

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.780
a movement that's showing signs of a Maoist

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.030
challenge to the most fundamental aspects of the west. Right?

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.890
And we are going to have to choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.560
What I,

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.880
neither one of these people is capable of or

11
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:42.720
inclined towards the kind of leadership that you have just described.

12
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:47.520
We would need a grade. So that means at a very, at the very least,

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.210
if we do not divert our course, right?

14
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:55.110
If November comes and we are choosing between those two,

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.430
then that means we're putting off any solution at least four years,

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.350
because the president, the president would be essential to changing our course,

17
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.480
right? And this is just built into these parties now, right? Obama,

18
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.670
I can't figure out why it's the case. I really like Obama personally.

19
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.540
He seems like the right guy to me, but his,

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.180
his administration at an, at a,

21
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.200
at a policy level was indistinguishable from Bush. In some ways it was worse.

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.840
So what we've got is parties that decide what we get to choose from.

23
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.100
And the game is to prevent us from having any choice that could possibly solve

24
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:39.720
the problem. So we have to fix that. We have to address that problem,

25
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.740
and we have to break their stranglehold. And, you know, in fairness,

26
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.940
Trump was a challenge to that. Two-party do opoly.

27
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.530
He's not really a Republican, right? But he's also not really an alternative.

28
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:56.610
It's like a third crime family, right? You've got the Republicans,

29
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.430
the Democrats, and now he's sort of.

30
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.400
<v 1>Co-opted their ideology to fit his needs.</v>

31
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.100
<v 0>Um, but it's not a solution, right? So we have to get that solution,</v>

32
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:10.100
which means we have to get by the parties. Trump proved that was possible.

33
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.710
<v 1>Right? I think if there's any ever,</v>

34
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.700
there was ever a time where an independent party has a chance. Now's the time.

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.330
If someone steps in and has a, a real solution.

36
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.860
And also in terms of the distribution of that information, now's the time,

37
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.020
because you could just post something on YouTube where you're demonstrating,

38
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.780
like there a step-by-step process, you could take hours to do it.

39
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.030
Like this is what I want to do. And this is how I'm going to do it.

40
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.280
You break those down to clips, almost like a podcast.

41
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.440
And if someone was a person of substance that we really believed in,

42
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.280
and we said, uh, that person can really do this. This actually could happen.

43
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.100
Let's vote independent. What could happen?

44
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.270
They don't have a monopoly on the distribution of information anymore.

45
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.570
And that's terrifying to them because they used to be able to count on the

46
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.130
shills on the left and the right to the word out for them.

47
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.870
But they don't have that anymore.

48
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.490
You have so many people that really don't have an ideological

49
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.320
foundation in either one of them that are talking and they're reaching millions

50
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.790
of people. That's a rare moment in time. And this is in my opinion,

51
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.910
the very best time for someone to step in. That's not,

52
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.410
they're not compliant. They're not, they don't have to give it. They don't,

53
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.150
they don't need that policy machine behind them or the political machine

54
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.480
behind.

55
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.580
<v 0>Them. Well, I've got plan. Okay. But we would have to find a really big podcast,</v>

56
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.830
I think, to get enough momentum to none of those out there,

57
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:38.850
you haven't encountered a big podcast. They don't exist. Um, all right.

58
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.960
Do you wanna hear the plan? Sure. Okay. The rock and Jocko, Willink, um,

59
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.140
get them together. Well, you know, let's put that, uh, okay.

60
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.200
Put that to the side. It's not part of the plan, but it actually could fit.

61
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.360
Okay. So here's the plan. Um, this plan needs a better name,

62
00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:57.990
but the working title is the dark horse duo plan. Um,

63
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.120
and the plan looks like this.

64
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.760
We draft two individuals, we find two people.

65
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:09.030
One of them is center left, and one of them is center, right?

66
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.920
And these people have to have certain characteristics, a minimum set.

67
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.170
They have to be patriotic.

68
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.360
They have to be courageous and they have to be highly capable. Right.

69
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.640
But that's it. Okay. Center, left and center. Right.

70
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.410
And we pair them together and we draft them, uh,

71
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.210
with the following plan that they will govern as a team.

72
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.160
That is to say every important decision will be, uh, discussed.

73
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.130
And they will decide what to do as a team.

74
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.600
And only in cases where they cannot reach agreement or whether something has to

75
00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:49.050
be whenever something has to be decided on a very short timescale,

76
00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:50.970
like a military decision. Um,

77
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.530
does the person who inhabits the role of the president, uh, govern alone.

78
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.903
Okay.

79
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.100
We draft these folks and then four years down the road they switch.

80
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.600
And the one who had run for president now runs for the vice-presidential spot.

81
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:09.540
And the one who, uh, was vice-president now runs for president.

82
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.120
And they continued this way until one of two things happens,

83
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.640
either we vote someone else in,

84
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.150
or one of them has inhabited the office of president twice and is no longer

85
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.550
eligible. And then that person has to be replaced.

86
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.890
So we have a patriotic team governing together from center,

87
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:26.850
left and center. Right.

88
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.520
<v 1>When you say drafted, that's the problem.</v>

89
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:33.000
Like someone has to be motivated to ruin their lives,

90
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.400
to try to run this country because that's what happens to everybody.

91
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.860
<v 0>That does it. I agree. But then that's an obstacle.</v>

92
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:41.310
You're spelling out an obstacle that I would argue is solvable that we know

93
00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:45.540
these people. Ooh. Okay. So let's just say, that's the plan so far,

94
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.020
I'm going to talk about what problems it solves as much as you want.

95
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.910
I feel like I should have a drink and listen to this.

96
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.590
You're welcome to have a drink. And it's probably a good idea. Um, but, uh,

97
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.760
okay. So here's my, so the plan could be right.

98
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.710
And my proposal for who we draft could be wrong and I'm happy to see

99
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:07.820
other people swapped in. Okay. But my proposal would be, uh,

100
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.800
Admiral William McRaven on the right. You know who that is. Okay.

101
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:16.880
He is a Navy seal, former Navy seal. Um,

102
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.020
he was until 2018, the chancellor of the university of Texas.

103
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.060
He is a, um, very cogent,

104
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.680
uh, center, right. Republican. Um,

105
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.540
he was the lead on the bin Laden raid. And he is, uh,

106
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.450
I think universally respected by people who know him.

107
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:42.740
I've never heard anybody say negative things about him, um,

108
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.890
on the center left. Let me say.

109
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.620
<v 1>This gentlemen, I want you to look at his face. Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.330
You're you're going to know. Oh yeah. I have seen that guy before. I like,

111
00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:53.950
it was like your president to me. Yeah.

112
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.630
<v 0>It looks like a president to me too. You know,</v>

113
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:59.680
who else looks like a president to me, Andrew Yang. I'm I'm down with that.

114
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.720
Okay. So like what you're saying now. Good. So here's my point.

115
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.780
Uh, those two guys together, those two is that camera on. Yes.

116
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.150
Admiral your country needs you.

117
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.410
It really does never more than now. Um,

118
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.440
and I know that the job of president is a sucky one.

119
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.890
I'm sure the job of vice president's even worse. Um,

120
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.430
but please consider this plan because, uh,

121
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.950
the Republic is in jeopardy.

122
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.770
Now we already know that Andrew Yang is up for the job because he ran for office

123
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.660
and, you know, faced appallingly, stupid obstacles that are,

124
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.040
in my opinion, may be the reason that he's not the nominee. Um,

125
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:49.390
so here we got two people. One of them I think will do so out of duty.

126
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:52.870
The other is crazy enough to want the job in the first place. Um,

127
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.920
and what are they? Well, they're both Patriots.

128
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.890
They're both courageous and they're both highly capable.

129
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.590
This is the road out.

130
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.780
<v 1>No, the, um, the Navy seal gentlemen,</v>

131
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.850
but Raven, Raven,

132
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.720
but Andrew Yang has some really good ideas.

133
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.040
You know what I mean? And reasonable ideas across the board. And when,

134
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:21.700
in terms of many things, not just universal basic income,

135
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.770
which was the thing that he was most popular for it, but,

136
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.630
but even law enforcement,

137
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:28.390
he's got some great ideas about a lot of things he thinks outside the box. It.

138
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.890
<v 0>Brilliant guy open to anything. Yes, sir. Reasonable. So I would suggest one,</v>

139
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.950
uh, last part of the plan, right?

140
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.900
Which is that we Americans have to get over the idea that when somebody runs for

141
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:43.390
office, especially the office of the president,

142
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:48.880
that the right reaction is to ask them a million questions about

143
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:53.320
what they will do in office, what policies they advocate. This was absurd.

144
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.030
Presidents don't make policy. They certainly influence what policy is made.

145
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.110
But the important thing about a president is that they listen to the right sorts

146
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.620
of people and that they have a mind capable of processing what they hear so that

147
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:08.460
they can, uh, integrate the information necessary.

148
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:09.660
And in the case of this plan,

149
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.850
we're talking about two people who would do that as a team.

150
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.200
So what I would really be interested in as they are running against Trump and

151
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:20.520
Biden is hearing who it is that they would bring into an

152
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.211
administration.

153
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:25.410
How would they make decisions about the things that matter to us and figuring

154
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.670
out who they would bring in,

155
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.940
I think is bound to be far more informative than dogging them about, you know,

156
00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:34.860
what they're going to do about healthcare and how they're going to pay for it.

157
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.480
<v 1>The thing about asking someone, what they're going to do though,</v>

158
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.410
is it does influence people whether or not they're willing to vote for that

159
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:43.880
person. They want to see a plan.

160
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.270
I know what you're saying is a reasonable person who understands the system,

161
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.310
but for the average American,

162
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.510
they do want to see a plan to how to get out of a lot of the messages that we

163
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.380
see.

164
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.010
<v 0>You know,</v>

165
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.330
the funny thing is we think a lot of things are true about what people want.

166
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.410
For one thing we've been told that people are stupid and that, you know,

167
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.800
they're hopeless. And if, you know, I mean,

168
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:11.060
you're really one of the earliest innovators here,

169
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:14.870
you have found that people that we've been told have an attention span so short,

170
00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:18.110
that they can only deal with a sitcom are interested in a three-hour

171
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:22.370
conversation about complex topics with people from all over the map, right?

172
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.830
People are ready to listen to what I'm trying to say is we have a wrong idea,

173
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.420
right? In our, in our sense of what elections are and really that wrong idea.

174
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.810
Isn't even about the fact that we think we want to hear the plan.

175
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.340
It's about the fact that we know that our power in the system is so limited.

176
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.450
That the only way we could possibly exert any influence on the policy that gets

177
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:48.320
made is if we can get somebody to promise us something into a camera enough that

178
00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:50.090
they're embarrassed not to do it when they get an office.

179
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.490
And we also know that doesn't right. So.

180
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.680
<v 1>Again, the office, they just do whatever they're going to do.</v>

181
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.890
<v 0>In the classroom. So my point would be, look, I will,</v>

182
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.750
I will literally vote for any competent courageous Patriot.

183
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.410
I actually don't care in what direction they're ruling. Yes.

184
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:10.070
I would prefer that they were progressive because I believe we need to make

185
00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:11.390
progress or we will perish,

186
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.370
but any courageous capable Patriot is good enough because a

187
00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:20.360
courageous capable Patriot will do way better than we are doing with the current

188
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.320
method. Okay.
