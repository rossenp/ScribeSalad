00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.890
<v 2>I am nervous. Why brew? Yeah. Why? Uh, it's a,</v>

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.630
no, it's a good thing. I haven't left my house in a year. You've been extended,

4
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:16.320
locked up. Well, I mean, I go to the grocery store. Uh how'd you,

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.800
how did you avoid getting it? You didn't get it at all right now. The cooties?

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.950
No, no, because everyone I know is a shut into and I loved it.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
It's like I left a day after my year anniversary.

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.820
I packed a week before coming here. So all you've done is go to the food store.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.450
Yup. Wow. Uh, well, I, I went up, uh,

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.360
to Phoenix for new year's to see, uh,

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.010
it's a long story to see a dog that I almost kept. Uh,

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.400
but I gave away anyway. So yes, basically, no,

13
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.310
I have not left Bisbee Arizona in a year.

14
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.170
<v 0>Wow. And I didn't think it affected me until I left. It's like,</v>

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.670
if you stayed in bed for a year going, I don't need to walk.

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.960
I know how to walk. And then after a year you're like, my legs.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.740
I'm actually need what feels the weirdest?

18
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.580
Just figuring out how to pack for the road.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.090
I packed everything I drove and, uh,

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.320
I left Sunday to be here Wednesday. It's a 13 hour drive.

21
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.520
I could have done it in one shot, but I was so excited.

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.930
I'm going to leave on Sunday and just take the back roads. And uh,

23
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.300
like I practiced talking on the phone before I came here an hour

24
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.770
and a half before. I'm just calling people. I don't talk to anyone on the phone.

25
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.870
The only time I use the phone is to figure out where to meet you,

26
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.540
to talk. I don't like socialize on the phone.

27
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.310
You and I talk maybe twice a year tops. And when I see it's you,

28
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.730
I go, do I have an hour? Okay.

29
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.720
I'll make an hour because we don't. But otherwise, so I was like,

30
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.820
I haven't talked to people other than,

31
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.740
do you have a room available for three days? Right? They have days.

32
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.030
So I was calling, you know, bingo and Brian Hennigan, go ahead.

33
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.110
Just talk to me like

34
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.260
you don't I packed what I thought was a car load of.

35
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.750
I forgot vodka, which is my go-to drink and a shirt.

36
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.610
I only had the t-shirt that I was wearing that after three days started to stink

37
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:33.300
and I went, I didn't pack another shirt. Did you go shirt shopping?

38
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:37.980
Then I went into the thrift store. Oh, thrift store. Yeah, of course. Yes.

39
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.920
You notice I'm, I did, like, I brought two different suits, like goofy suits,

40
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.770
right? I'm like I've been wearing pajamas for a year.

41
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.310
I w I think I would be even more awkward if I was wearing a suit,

42
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.360
especially with stupid hair. When did the goofy suits become a thing with you?

43
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.160
Like what year? 1989. It started in telemarketing.

44
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.530
Cause my mother would send me goofy suits like that.

45
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.600
Cause they had just gone out of style, like in that earlier that decade.

46
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.070
So they're, you know, it's like buying acid wash jeans now, you know,

47
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.050
they're a nickel apparently through thrift store.

48
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.800
<v 1>I think Jamie has a few pairs. Acid wash, sweat pants,</v>

49
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.740
sweat pants. Yeah. But that's your signature now?

50
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.570
The, the goofy suit. Okay.

51
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.200
<v 0>Yeah. And I go, I don't think I'm ready to put on a goofy suit.</v>

52
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.170
I don't know if it would clash with the goofy hair.

53
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.380
Cause people will show up at my shows in goofy suits,

54
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.940
but they'll have like plaid on plaid and you go, no, that doesn't work. Like I,

55
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.070
I accessorize perfectly in a goofy suit, but I go live with the goofy hair now.

56
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:48.910
Is that like polka dots on plaid? I don't know. Right? If you've gone too far.

57
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.410
Yeah. I want to be comfortable here.

58
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:52.930
So I'm wearing pajamas like I have for the last year.

59
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.970
<v 1>Why don't just wear pajamas.</v>

60
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.280
<v 0>That's what I'm wearing. Pajama pants. Are those pajama crowns?</v>

61
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.143
<v 1>Yeah. Okay.</v>

62
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.870
<v 0>There you go. And this is a, this was my old travel shirt.</v>

63
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.110
I wore this anytime I traveled, but yeah, I want to be comfortable.

64
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:09.730
I don't want to. Yeah.

65
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.100
<v 1>You've stayed within your means very well.</v>

66
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.940
Like you've never had to worry about finances.

67
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.020
Like you've you dialed that in early. Yeah. Uh,

68
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.340
you never fell into the trap.

69
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:25.510
A lot of people do where they like buy a bigger house or buy a bigger.

70
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.910
<v 0>My paid for</v>

71
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.010
after a year of not working. I go, Ooh,

72
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.700
I always bragged about how much I don't need to work.

73
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.570
And then I go got right now, I'm starting to worry.

74
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.180
Should I buy this dumb plastic from Amazon or not?

75
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.780
<v 1>When do you think you're going to start working here are going to get the</v>

76
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:47.500
vaccine.

77
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.150
<v 0>I got, I got my first shot.</v>

78
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.140
<v 1>Which one? The Pfizer.</v>

79
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.040
<v 0>Or the [inaudible]</v>

80
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.040
. I got my first shot about two weeks ago, two weeks ago tomorrow. Wasn't

81
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 funny. Cause I just realized I still have the bandaid when I took that

82
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.040
. I'm such a slothful pig when it comes to bathing areas

83
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.873
 and it's still there. I didn't wash that hard that it came off last night.

84
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.540
<v 1>They're resilient those bad days. They'll they'll stick around for a while for.</v>

85
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.630
<v 0>Got my followup shot two weeks from now from the same lady,</v>

86
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.880
I wanted to see the same dirty bandage and make her get off.

87
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.180
I know that's rude, but I think it's funny.
