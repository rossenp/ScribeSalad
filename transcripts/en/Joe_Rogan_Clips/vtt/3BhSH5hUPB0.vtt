00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.090
<v 3>So the Derek Brunson fight, which is coming up soon, what is your,</v>

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.620
what are your thoughts on Derek once? And I mean,

4
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:09.870
we talked about it a little bit earlier, but you know,

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.130
he's obviously a veteran he's obviously guy's been around his fought style

6
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.890
bender. He's the, the shahbazim fight, his last fight.

7
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:21.240
I thought he looked fantastic. And shahbazim. That was an interesting situation.

8
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.900
Right? You've got this kid who's 21 years old, super dangerous,

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.120
real fast hands looked great,

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.080
but never really been tested against like a veteran.

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.720
And then you saw wasn't really ready for that yet.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.470
<v 0>Brett's is good. You know, his wrestling is good. Uh,</v>

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.890
his standup's a little wild. He hits hard. Uh, you know, it's like,

14
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.520
it's going to be a fun fight, but it's like, you know, but yeah, the problem is,

15
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:48.260
is it's like when he gets to there, there with the top level guys, you know,

16
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.310
he hasn't had a lot of success and we'll just going to find out if Kevin's is

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.930
his top level, as I think he is, you know, it's like, it's like.

18
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.130
<v 2>Yeah, yes. You know that part where he goes, you know,</v>

19
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.150
rude boy is only one out of 10,000. And you'd had one out of 10,000.

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.680
I'm that one on 10,000. We're going to find out.

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.730
<v 0>It's closer to like one in a million different.</v>

22
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.150
<v 1>Do you feel like this is a, like a pivotal moment?</v>

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.590
<v 2>Clearly it can be very much can be. I but me and Derek Brunson,</v>

24
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:21.300
we have a lot of words back and forth. Yeah.

25
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.830
<v 0>Oh, with Derek Bronson constantly. It's like,</v>

26
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.090
Kevin does this to everybody. Everybody's like, he's, he's in,

27
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.140
he's in style benders in the inbox. He's in everybody's inbox and he's

28
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.120
[inaudible].

29
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.670
<v 1>All the time. Do they go back and forth? Some of them all.</v>

30
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.503
<v 0>The time.</v>

31
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.580
<v 2>It goes back and forth with you.</v>

32
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.640
Mike Perry is nice enough to go back and forth with me. I like that guy.

33
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.474
He does.

34
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.010
<v 0>He's fun. He.</v>

35
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.430
<v 2>With him. And then, you know, Brunson, Brunson started it though.</v>

36
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.570
He told me he's slammed me on my head. So him. And then, uh, you know,

37
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.960
it's just, there's.

38
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.460
<v 1>A few of them, what he opened with.</v>

39
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.730
<v 2>I'm going to slam you on your head. It doesn't go back and forth with me.</v>

40
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:02.910
So that, that hurts my feelings. I don't know. He says he's about that life.

41
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.590
That kid ain't about that life. Um, I seen him at a pie and I walked in.

42
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.020
I was like, that's my best friend. He was like, you want to be friends? Now?

43
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.890
I was like, no, never. I was like, my best friends were all being friends.

44
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.900
They were like, Kevin, there's a lot of them. They're going to jump you.

45
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.560
And I was like, no, I drove out here. I got in the car. I was ready to them.

46
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.710
You know? So that boy's not dropped that life.

47
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.070
<v 1>Do you? Don't you think that, I mean, it's, it's,</v>

48
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:28.080
it's very unfortunate that he's suffering from COVID that he's got this

49
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.990
long-term situation where apparently when you,

50
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:34.830
when I I've talked to doctors about this, I'm like, what is going on with that?

51
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.620
And they said, when you're training really hard,

52
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.380
and then you're breaking down your immune system and then you get COVID,

53
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.310
you can get it real bad.

54
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.640
And when you get it really bad and then you don't take care of yourself in terms

55
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:47.070
of like, don't give yourself adequate time to recover.

56
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.860
You go back in before you're really fully recovered.

57
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.760
And also you're not taking care of all the inflammation issues that you have

58
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:57.210
with your diet, with your supplements. Yeah. You hit a situation like cam,

59
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.520
where he had to pull out the Leon Edwards fight. Imagine being Leon Edwards.

60
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.000
One of the best fighters in the world. Can't get a fight. Can't get a fight.

61
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.280
Finally. Finally, Blough steps up right after winning the last.

62
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.150
<v 2>Time. It, again.</v>

63
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.770
<v 0>Kevin was, Kevin was in their inboxes again, like, Hey, I'll find him.</v>

64
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.020
<v 2>There's some bugs, Leon. Plenty of times he doesn't respond.</v>

65
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.630
And then the thing about it is a lot of these guys can say before that I didn't

66
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.210
have the followers. They didn't see the message. Now I have the followers.

67
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.460
So you're seeing the message. You're just choosing not to respond.

68
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.150
You know what I mean? It's like, like if we're being real here, these guys,

69
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.060
half these guys who claim that they're fighters they're fighters because it pays

70
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.240
a bill and it looks good online. It looks good on TV.

71
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.190
<v 1>Is that the case? Or are they being calculated about what risks they take?</v>

72
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.010
<v 2>You're not a fighter. If you're calculating risk, really though.</v>

73
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.650
<v 1>Do you think that's true? I mean, if you're a first year fighter.</v>

74
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.010
<v 0>He's talking about other kinds of vitamins,</v>

75
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.590
he's talking about life and it's like, you know, he's,

76
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.560
he's not talking about his career right now. He's talking about,

77
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.170
he's talking about Kevin warrior,

78
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.740
moms and stuff kind of melts together a little bit. You know? It's like,

79
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.330
he he's, you know, it's like, he's not necessarily, you know, saying that yeah,

80
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.900
these guys are for sure fighters, but they're not real fighters in Kevin's mind.

81
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.063
I understand. We say.

82
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.920
<v 2>Yeah, they won't, you know, and it's like,</v>

83
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.530
I get happy when I see these guys step up last second for a fight.

84
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.170
I see him blouse step up for that fight. I'm like, okay, there you go.

85
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.590
Don't complain about how you're not getting upper fights when you don't really

86
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.200
put yourself in that situation and get into fights. You know.

87
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.770
<v 1>When, when I have knocked out mere shart, I was like, holy,</v>

88
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.290
knocked him out with one punch. I'm like, okay,

89
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.620
now I want to see if he can do that. I want to say like,

90
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:33.910
how does he fair against galaxy?

91
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.020
How's he fair against other like elite one 70 or 180 fibers, which, which,

92
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.220
which is weird too, right?

93
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:41.440
That he's just bouncing back and forth between those two way clock.

94
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.290
<v 2>He's bouncing back and forth to the, to the fights that make the most sense.</v>

95
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.510
So he'll go to 70 for a fight. That makes sense.

96
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.120
He'll come back up to 85 for a fight that makes sense. You know,

97
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:52.780
nothing wrong with it. Good management fighters who fight like that.

98
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.140
It's very smart fighters. I tip my hat off to them, you know,

99
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.950
them and their management and their coaches. That's great. That's not me.

100
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:03.760
I'd never be that. So props to those guys, you know, but it's like, if you know,

101
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.400
you go to 70, cause that's why it makes sense for you. Smart move.

102
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.770
You go back to 85 because it's five makes sense to you. Smart move.

103
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.380
I was impressed by the way, he knocked out mere sharp just because he,

104
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.870
he took the smartest route, which was keeping it standing.

105
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:16.030
And I thought that guy who liked to grapple was going to take it to the ground,

106
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.810
you know,

107
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.070
but knocking out mirror chart after mirror starts coming off of losses.

108
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.220
You know what I mean? And I know I smacked him a couple of times.

109
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.890
I know Darren wind smack them a couple of times. You know what I mean?

110
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:30.850
And I know Ian Ridge ultimately landed the last smacking. And if you,

111
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.730
I think if you add up those three people who have decent power and have been

112
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.060
smacking him at 85, the head's just not the same as it used to be.

113
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.400
He's even fought Thiago Santos, right? Yeah. You know, it's like,

114
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:41.800
you can't fight all these killers and take these type of headshots and think

115
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.551
that you're going to be okay.

116
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.950
If somebody has a little bit of pop and of course it's going to look good.

117
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.420
I mean, smart props to him for taking the smart program.

118
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.580
Every time you go out there and fight a guy, you know, it's like,

119
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:54.060
we both fought John Phillips. I went out there and stood.

120
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.550
It stood in band with John Phillips. Coach told me in the second round, go out,

121
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.060
okay. You already look good in the first round,

122
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.300
go out there in the second round, take this guy down, choke them out.

123
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.160
He's obviously not trying to go away from punches. Jeremiah went out there,

124
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:07.820
took him down, punched on him, punched on a punch on him, sub dog smart,

125
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:09.740
smart fighter props to him.

126
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.980
But what happens when you can't go out there and take an easy smart route?

127
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.090
I'm just gonna fight. I was really good. That's why I wanted to do,

128
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.300
like you said, I wanted to see the Leon fight. You know, I want to see.

129
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.630
<v 1>You know, I was fascinated by that fight.</v>

130
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.390
<v 2>I would've took the new magnet to find him versus new magnet. Would've been,</v>

131
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.480
I would've been happy with that. You can slowly work your way up. I think he,

132
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.081
you know,

133
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.330
it's like accuracy and Neil magnet being done the way he got done against,

134
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.420
you know, Michael Cuesta. I think that Chimayo, could've got the job done,

135
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:36.560
especially being a big one seven year, but it's like, it's like, you know, it's,

136
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.630
I don't know. And then you sit up here and you say, it's sad.

137
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.240
Cause he has COVID and like that. But they said I had COVID, you know,

138
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:43.040
and if we're supposed to be athletes, you know, and it's like, get.

139
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.780
<v 1>We had a very mild, oh, you know, I mean, he's, he's had it for my girl.</v>

140
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:48.614
Had it pretty much.

141
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.440
<v 2>Now my girl had a pretty good and I'll her the whole time. You know?</v>

142
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.790
And then it's like, so it's like, we all take a different, you know,

143
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.700
different fighters, different heart, you know, don't claim to have the heart.

144
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.623
If you ain't got it.

145
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.940
<v 1>Don't see it it's just like a disease though.</v>

146
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.803
<v 2>I mean, I mean.</v>

147
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.940
<v 1>The disease.</v>

148
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.750
<v 2>The flu sucks, you know, Michael Jordan still went out there and one, well,</v>

149
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.943
you know.

150
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.060
<v 1>You know, understand what you're saying? Yeah. It's a bummer.</v>

151
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.750
It's a bummer that we don't get. Cause it was so exciting. You watching him,

152
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.800
him he's fighting back to back is trying to fight.

153
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.920
He's scheduling two fights at the same time. He's you know.

154
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.770
<v 2>I'm just sad. Cause I really wanted to see the guy fight again. Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.930
<v 1>Also you wanted to fight him. No.</v>

156
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.130
<v 2>Not me. I don't want to fight that guy. He's a monster real he's undefeated.</v>

157
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.310
Smashing everybody as many could be, but I don't want no problems with that guy.

158
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.310
<v 0>You know? That's not true. He was with him the whole time.</v>

159
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.160
<v 1>Yeah. You were asking for it when I interviewed you.</v>

160
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.310
<v 0>Well, he may have Kevin had words with him too. You know,</v>

161
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.360
it's like Kevin Edwards with him and then he's he said something to Kevin,

162
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.790
Kevin off and Kevin's angry.

163
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.600
<v 2>But the boss,</v>

164
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.870
the boss has said on an interview that we're in two different weight classes and

165
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:57.980
that we'd probably never meet up.

166
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.510
So I'm assuming that he's staying at eight 70 and I'm staying at 85 and you

167
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:05.900
know, it's like, you know, maybe one day when he, you know,

168
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.610
gets over being a little tired,

169
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.860
he can get back in there and get some fights in and we'll be okay.
