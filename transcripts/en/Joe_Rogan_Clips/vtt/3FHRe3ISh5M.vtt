00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 2>This is the greatest time in human history where there's</v>

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.030
absolutely zero thinking when I say zero thinking and,

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.740
or you're put in fear of thinking, I'll give you a loo example. Okay.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.310
I had, I came in,

6
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.680
I had to have a COVID test for our walked in here. Right.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.790
So let's talk to your nurse. And, and, um, I said I had it,

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.670
I hadn't December. And I didn't tell anyone, cause I didn't,

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.870
I'm put on social media and I put everywhere because I didn't want people like,

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.540
oh, we gotta cancel shows and other blah, blah, blah.

11
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.730
It is the hysteria that caused that was it.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.990
It was like a very mild sinus infection. Basically. It's what Jamie had.

13
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:47.190
Basically it started, it started in my nose.

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.930
All right. And then it had a little, like I had one of those, but I immediately,

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.830
from the past, anytime I get sick, I'm traveling.

16
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.730
<v 0>So I know I've had, I've been sick on the road.</v>

17
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.930
I immediately put a nose spray, constant cleaning. And I have a, um,

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.340
inhaler like a steroid to get my lungs gone.

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.380
So I started that the next day body

20
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.640
felt like I was getting something and which I've had in the past.

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.090
If I don't get the chills, my skin gets really sensitive.

22
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.350
And then after that, a low tired,

23
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.120
but I ha I can breathe.

24
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
But clearly I had a sinus infection.

25
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.950
That's the best way to describe it. Now here's the thing.

26
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.290
Now I gave it to my wife and my youngest daughter and the other two,

27
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.260
but my older two daughters were like, we're out of here. We're getting tested.

28
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:44.670
They both negative shoes.

29
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.140
They left the house at a hair and it got bubbles around the head and wearing

30
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.840
their space outfits. So they're gone.

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.330
My youngest one comes home from school and she has to take a test and they say

32
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:02.280
you're positive. And she was, she clearly got sick. My wife's sick. I'm sick.

33
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.400
Now none of us,

34
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.890
I have an infectious disease doctor in New Jersey.

35
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.360
His specialty is infectious disease. As a doc,

36
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.440
my daughter is positive. I clearly gave it to her. He goes,

37
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:24.090
you need to get tested before I see you. I said, okay, well it's a two,

38
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:27.690
three day wait in the meantime, do you have every, anything goes,

39
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.800
take vitamin C, vitamin D. And sink goes,

40
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.720
do you have a high fever? I want know,

41
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.830
because you have trial a trouble breathing. I went, no, he goes,

42
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.850
then don't worry about it.

43
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.500
So part of me started getting infuriated.

44
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.340
So you telling me the world is shutting down and you're telling me to take

45
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.000
vitamin C vitamin D and zinc. He goes,

46
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.600
I need you to get the test. Okay,

47
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.650
I'll get the test. Now I'm a little aggravated.

48
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.450
I just want something to get rid of this. Right? Okay. That's all I want. Right?

49
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.400
So now it's going on the second week. And it's this things that knowing,

50
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:10.960
because I'm taking 2000 DS and 3000

51
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.500
CS and zinc and a, and whatever he's telling me do,

52
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.280
my daughter is getting better.

53
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.940
My wife still can't D can't smell or taste.

54
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.430
Um, and she's got stage four cancer. So she's like super high.

55
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.880
She's doing great and all that and have to be, but still great show on trial,

56
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.370
crushing it. So Fay, anything,

57
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.280
she's the most danger because of her immune system,

58
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.680
week two, I get a test,

59
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.980
the same test I just took here,

60
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.110
which is a very reliable test. And I told my doctor,

61
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.910
Hey man, it's a Fisher test deposit, which tested you take as I took the rapid,

62
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.970
because that I can't, I don't accept that one.

63
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.860
You don't accept that infectious disease doctor.

64
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.390
And you don't accept that test. What did he want?

65
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:10.330
The PCR test he wanted? Yeah, whatever. It's got to go to lab.

66
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.880
Now we're going on day 12.

67
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.230
And you still take telling me to take vitamins and stuff.

68
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.380
So finally I said, I'm not,

69
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.830
I'm not doing that test because then I got to go in the state and the system

70
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:28.540
and, and they called looking for my daughter. Can we speak to your daughter? No,

71
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.560
you may not. Well, is she doing the appropriate things?

72
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.160
I have it as her father. Well, what is she doing?

73
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.740
Go yourself. That's what she's stolen.

74
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.080
You don't call my house government. You just overstepped your boundaries.

75
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.510
You're just here to protect me,

76
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.700
not to come knocking on my door to ask me what I'm doing and how I'm treating my

77
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:55.780
16 year old.

78
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.820
It's a very frightening place to be now with that said,

79
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.740
I then ask, Hey man, what can we do? He goes,

80
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:08.140
I need that other test. And I want, I'm not getting the other tests.

81
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.500
So I called a friend said,

82
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.260
I'll get you something by tomorrow.

83
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.900
I got stuffed by the next day. And in two days, that stuff was clear.

84
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.380
So I started asking her why don't people.

85
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.390
And, and I just left the town of Chester, New Jersey. And it was a, um,

86
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.300
there's a couple there's about 15 of us,

87
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.660
a group that formed this community during the whole COVID.

88
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.090
And this one woman just got it and she's got hospitalized.

89
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.420
No, what? Whoa, what happened? And she said,

90
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.250
I waited 12 days. And then it had a problem. I started freaking out,

91
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:52.084
breathing,

92
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.650
went to the hospital that gave me steroids and antibiotics and he cleared right

93
00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:58.460
up. So my question is,

94
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.560
why do you have to test positive to wait,

95
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.900
to get antibiotics or steroids?

96
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.660
If neither one of them hurt you or kill you

97
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.040
while you're still waiting to see what this does.

98
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.810
And she didn't have an answer. And she's like, that's a great question.

99
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.510
I go to simple. It's just a question.

100
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.980
So if I'm a doctor and Joe Rogan comes to me and says, Hey man,

101
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:28.250
my daughter's positive. I've sinus. I am no. Well,

102
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.450
I can give you this cause I know it's not going to kill you.

103
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.850
And I know I'm gonna give you antibiotics. And hopefully two,

104
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:39.710
three days it will clear up, but it's not going to. And if it gets worse,

105
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.790
then we'll take care of it then,

106
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.880
because clearly this is not going to make you worse. Right.

107
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.500
So why isn't that being done? And then my other question was,

108
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.270
if that doctor an infectious disease doctor

109
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.910
doesn't allow that test, how many people take that test?

110
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.760
And it counts as a number, but yet it doesn't count.

111
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.780
So what is really going on is my question.

112
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.950
<v 1>There's a lot of confusion, a massive amount of people.</v>

113
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.500
There's a disease that kills some folks.

114
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.870
And there's a disease that we in the beginning stages of

115
00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:20.770
this pandemic thought was going to be far more severe than it turned out to be.

116
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.540
And they never adjusted. That's the problem. The problem is it's still not good.

117
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.010
You know, you don't want to catch COVID,

118
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.910
but the vast majority of people who get it will be fine.

119
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.090
78% of the people that are hospitalized are beasts.

120
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.940
The very obese people have a real hard time with it.

121
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.130
There's 6% of the people who died from COVID only had

122
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:44.230
COVID the other nine.

123
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.790
<v 0>That number 6%.</v>

124
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.990
<v 1>One more, 6% of the people who died from COVID only had COVID the other</v>

125
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:54.100
94% had an average of 2.6

126
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.630
comorbidities.

127
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.710
So almost three more than two and a half comorbidities speeding like

128
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.310
obesity. You know,

129
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.930
there's a bunch of different things that people have. Diabetes is a big one. Um,

130
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.510
you know, uh, Alzheimer's, there's a lot of,

131
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.800
there's a lot of co-morbidities that are, that are very dangerous. If you get.

132
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.370
<v 0>I'll tell you another one. So another one of our friends,</v>

133
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.600
his name is Rob he's had, he's a mess brown gout three times a year.

134
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:27.520
He's a mess. He's totally heavy, dude. Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, July.

135
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.500
He says, don't come near me. I have a sinus infection and we all went,

136
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.100
whoa, Rob's off limits. You know?

137
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.840
Woo Rob's diet. We're laughing. Rod died. He's got, he's done. We say,

138
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.700
you should really go check that out. Rob. We know here from Rob,

139
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.430
next time, next thing,

140
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:52.960
me and me and my wife went to Maine where I went on a mountain. We were on a,

141
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.970
we were on a lake, was one of, I felt like I was in. If I die,

142
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.140
that is where heaven's going to be. As that trip, my wife, a comeback

143
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.560
geo is going on, Rob he's in a hospital. What? He's done that he's on the, uh,

144
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.660
the ventilator, the ventilator one. What not? He was a crazy Trump guy.

145
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.190
He was like, oh, drop job, full blown. I would go there and like, oh my God,

146
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:18.600
these guys are talking politics.

147
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.340
I please get off every morning.

148
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.690
[inaudible] nonstop. Like, oh God, I just want to have a muffin and relaxed.

149
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.990
So with that, and I did, I got caught up to, I,

150
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.010
I would be a liar if I said I wasn't caught up in some stuff for a while.

151
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:45.270
I was on the internet, like dude, to JFK's coming back.

152
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.920
I was home with court mix on such a wall. I was, I,

153
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.810
I was Han. Right. But this guy was like,

154
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:59.310
if I ever get I'm kicking hydro core Quinn, all right, that was that's.

155
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.820
So now, and this is all still calling by the way,

156
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.890
he gets admitted to the hospital. And then here comes my next question.

157
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.480
And there is an ending to this story. Um, he gets admitted.

158
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.760
They say, he's got brain damage from COVID is brain damage.

159
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.060
Well, this is the information we're getting like, wow. I've never heard.

160
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:23.880
What do you mean brain dad? Yeah. He's he's not gonna,

161
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:28.020
he's not gonna be able to walk what he's he has brain damage and it turned out

162
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.810
he had strokes. The COVID caused strokes.

163
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.170
Then it turned out. No,

164
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.130
he asked for a specific drug. They said,

165
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:40.830
we can't give it to you in the state of Jersey.

166
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.260
And we're going to have to do testing before it could do stuff.

167
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:50.520
Next thing you know, the guy's on high blood pressure pills and all that.

168
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.920
They didn't give him his meds. He stroked out,

169
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.840
cut to he's brain dead. His wife,

170
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.390
can't his wife and 11 year old,

171
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:04.770
13 year old half have to say goodbye to him before they pull the plug.

172
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.180
They're not allowed to be with him. They have to FaceTime.

173
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.110
So here's a question for you. Now. This is going somewhere, bro. Right?

174
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.600
Thank God. One of our crew said,

175
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.560
please send this person there. Just took one.

176
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:26.640
Last one last look, the specialist shows up, said,

177
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:30.750
he's not brain dead. He's dehydrated.

178
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.830
Who's been taking care of this patient. And who said he was COVID.

179
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.240
I won everything gets everything said,

180
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.330
I need the wife and children in here.

181
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.760
Oh well it's against DARPA. Which again, what's keeping you safe.

182
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.300
What's keeping you safe. Bring his family in here.

183
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.920
His family to him,

184
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.760
his heart rate starts going up in a week.

185
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:01.090
He opens his eyes and communicates for the first time.

186
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.310
It's six weeks later. He now stands up for the first time.

187
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.090
It was a lo it was October.

188
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.890
He finally got out and he's still taking physical rehab.

189
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.300
I got pictures of him, videos of him and all that jazz, but he's recovering.

190
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:21.400
So the point of my story is two things.

191
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.140
<v 1>They were ready to let them die. They were.</v>

192
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.120
<v 0>Willing. They already said he's dead and you can't visit him. Jesus Christ.</v>

193
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.180
<v 1>So what, where on a hospital is this? It's in.</v>

194
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.170
<v 0>New Jersey. That's crazy. So I'll te so, but my question is this.</v>

195
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.260
When it comes to not being able to see elderly in elderly homes,

196
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.710
so you've got a quarantine and all that. What keeps the workers safe?

197
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.800
What keeps the quote heroes safe?

198
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.040
And what, why can't you allow someone with a human touch?

199
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.730
Because when you're, when you're at your weakest moment in time,

200
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.570
you need a human, you need pure love.

201
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.100
You need that child. You need your mother to come visit you.

202
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.380
They're the ones,

203
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.500
even if you're in your house and the fact that they are stopping,

204
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.890
that is pure evil in my mind,

205
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:15.730
I know it has nothing to do with safety. And if it is safety,

206
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:20.470
then stupidity. And if at the end of the day, it's evil,

207
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.700
there is no protocol. Stupid.

208
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.400
<v 1>I understand what you're saying. I think there, I think in the general sense,</v>

209
00:13:25.401 --> 00:13:27.350
they're trying to protect people from getting infected.

210
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.230
<v 0>But works. They're infected nothing.</v>

211
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:35.150
<v 1>Well then what can the tightest masks that you can, but there's other.</v>

212
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.070
<v 0>Things you can give it to the child and the mom and dad.</v>

213
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.770
<v 1>Exactly. No I'm with you. I'm with you a hundred percent.</v>

214
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.730
<v 0>Your kid was dying, Joe. Yeah. You're gonna allow them to keep you from.</v>

215
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.600
<v 1>No, no. I'm going to do my best. Right? You're gonna smell.</v>

216
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.060
<v 0>That door down, bro. I'll tell you that right now.</v>

217
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.590
You're going to have to arrest me. Yeah. You're going to have to rest me. So.

218
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.420
<v 1>I feel the same way. I know what you're saying.</v>

219
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.790
<v 0>You got to question everything.</v>

220
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.020
<v 1>But you write about the touch about love and about having hope.</v>

221
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.670
And having someone come visit you, despair is terrible for the immune system.

222
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.240
All that stuff is to do you know what a no CBO is? You know what that means? No,

223
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.860
it's the opposite of placebo.

224
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.250
A placebo effect is they give you a sugar pill and it makes you think that

225
00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:18.500
you're doing well. And you're like, oh,

226
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.030
and then all of a sudden your symptoms improve.

227
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:24.680
And you actually get better because your body is on a positive

228
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.480
trip, right? Your body's like, oh, Jim got the medicine. Oh,

229
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.030
we're healing up. And it literally has a, uh,

230
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.960
an actual physical measurable effect. And it's called the placebo effect. Well,

231
00:14:35.961 --> 00:14:39.980
there's also something that they believe is more powerful than the placebo

232
00:14:39.981 --> 00:14:42.140
effect. And that's the no CBO effect.

233
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:47.180
The no CBO effect is telling someone that they have a disease telling

234
00:14:47.181 --> 00:14:50.930
someone that there's an incurable disease or that they're sick.

235
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.790
And then they panic. And here's a perfect example. In 2007,

236
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.530
there was a guy that was a part of a trial that they were doing a double blind

237
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:04.070
placebo controlled trial on antidepressants.

238
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.910
So they're trying to find the efficacy of antidepressants and they give this

239
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:12.710
guy, um, these pills and he shows up at the hospital,

240
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.740
he's got an empty bottle of pills. And he goes, help me, help me.

241
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.150
I took all the pills. I took all the pills and this guy collapses, right?

242
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.560
They bring them into the emergency room.

243
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.730
His blood pressure is dangerously low.

244
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.440
His heart rate is jacked up. He's pale, he's sick. They're like, oh no.

245
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.340
And so they, they find the guys, uh, he, the guy has a pill bottle.

246
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:37.040
They brought him with him. They find the guy's physician.

247
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.630
That's a part of the clinical trial.

248
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.610
They bring the physician in the physician tells him, you got the placebo.

249
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.710
There's no medication here. This is, these are pills. There's nothing in them.

250
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.000
All of a sudden the guy gets better like that. His,

251
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.170
his heart rate balances, his blood pressure balances.

252
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.670
15 minutes later, he's fine.

253
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.890
<v 0>The power of your mind. He.</v>

254
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.480
<v 1>Was convinced that he was.</v>

255
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.830
If you have someone in a hospital bed and you're telling them they're going to

256
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:07.400
die,

257
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.210
and you're not going to see your family and the amount of stress and the pain,

258
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.350
your symptoms will crash. Everything will get more up.

259
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.170
Your body will go into a total state of shock.

260
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.910
There's been people that have died because they were incorrectly

261
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:27.260
diagnosed with cancer. And they went into this,

262
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.800
this shock where they can't believe that they they're not going to.

263
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.890
And then their, their immune system crashes, their body crashes.

264
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.740
And then they've done autopsies. And they found out that it was benign.

265
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.870
<v 0>And this is what drives me nuts, where nobody questioned you just go, oh,</v>

266
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.250
that's what those signs. That's what they said. So that's what we're doing.

267
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.113
That's what.

268
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.500
<v 1>You know, like, we'll think that voodoo is. But voodoo is,</v>

269
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.350
as you tell someone, if you're a charismatic person,

270
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:58.640
you have white paint on your face and feathers and skulls on sticks.

271
00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.653
And you tell them.

272
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.420
<v 0>Put a curse on you.</v>

273
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.270
<v 1>And you believe that, you will be in a full terror, be in a full terror.</v>

274
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.520
And then your life will fall apart.

275
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.140
<v 0>My hand to God, when I start my show, I say,</v>

276
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:16.340
and I've been saying,

277
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.470
this is the greatest voodoo trick I've seen in humanity in my entire

278
00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:23.660
life, because that's what it is.

279
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.730
It's the greatest voodoo trick in history. I it's,

280
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.710
mind-boggling. Now I'm able to, I'm able to sit and watch it and,

281
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.830
and Dodge from it. But at the same time,

282
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.840
I I'm I'm baffled how many people

283
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.190
just don't question anything.

284
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.660
It's mind boggling.
