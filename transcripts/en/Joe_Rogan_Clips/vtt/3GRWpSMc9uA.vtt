00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you know magic? The gathering is now racist.</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 1>I don't even know what magic the gathering.</v>

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.520
<v 2>Is, where the game that the nerds play. Oh.</v>

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.920
<v 1>Sorry. How was it? How was it racist? Um, I dunno.</v>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.550
<v 2>It was just re I only saw the title of the article that they're trying to cancel</v>

6
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:21.370
magic. The gathering. I'm like, oh, Christ. I thought that's what you got.

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.400
I just liked, I thought they liked magic. The gathering. I have no,

8
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.950
everything's, everything's, everything's problematic.

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.580
Everyone's getting canceled. It's amazing how many people did blackface.

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.380
<v 1>Yeah. It's very strange. It's very strange.</v>

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.870
It's very strange. I mean, I was on, it was on prime time TV, right? Yeah.

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.830
A bunch of times. Yeah. I mean like in the modern world, prime time, T V.

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.040
<v 2>Jimmy Fallon was doing well, he's doing a Chris rock impression,</v>

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.760
which by the way, you used to be able to do, when I was in high school,

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.140
my friends were Mr. T for Halloween, nobody gave a. Nobody was like, Jimmy,

16
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.680
what's wrong with you? Everybody's like, oh, you're Mr. T for Halloween.

17
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.240
It was never like a problem. It's very, it's a very strange thing.

18
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.590
You know, like you can do white face. No problem. Here it is.

19
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.600
What does this magic, the gathering invoke.

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.430
<v 3>Prejudice card. So that's.</v>

21
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.530
<v 2>Uh, it's an enchantment card,</v>

22
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:19.430
which restricts the casters opponents only using summons that matched the skin

23
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:21.140
color of their opposing creatures.

24
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.690
<v 1>Huh? This is you. If you brought me on to talk about this,</v>

25
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:31.670
I should leave now about, about magic, the gathering. And this is why I'm here,

26
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:36.110
man. We're in a bad way. Shows how up everything is. Uh,

27
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.270
there's a lot of thin skin out there. I know.

28
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.900
<v 2>I just don't. I mean, it seems like a perfect storm.</v>

29
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.380
Like if you wanted to engineer the downfall of society,

30
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.240
you would do it in several steps.

31
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.020
You would have a reality show president where everybody's mad at him.

32
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.520
And then all the liberals get their feathers in a ruffle and everybody gets

33
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:56.810
real, super uptight.

34
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:00.560
And then there's this big divide between the left and the right that's kind of,

35
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.070
you know,

36
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.840
manufactured and then you'd have this disease just lock everyone inside.

37
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.760
Yeah. Unprecedented lock, shut down. The economy force people to not work.

38
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.200
So if your business falls apart, you could be the most hardworking diligent,

39
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.500
disciplined person. Who's always at work hour early,

40
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.360
always has your eyes dotted.

41
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:22.970
Your T's crossed and you still go broke and you're still.

42
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.640
And then you have this George Floyd thing and then boom,

43
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.770
it just ignites the power cake. The.

44
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.670
<v 1>Other thing that you have to wrap around all this is this social media,</v>

45
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.860
which is, you know,

46
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.730
I'm only going to post things that are just going to completely make everyone

47
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:44.840
that sees whatever I'm posting emotional and, and filled with rage.

48
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.670
Whether you're on the left or you're on the right. My goal is to enrage people.

49
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.040
That's the goal. And then that just gets spun up over and over.

50
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:55.610
So you're taking all these little incidents and you're multiplying times

51
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.430
thousands and thousands of views. Now.

52
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.400
<v 2>Like when he was Tony soprano.</v>

53
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.120
<v 4>And he's, and he wasn't like that, that's the other thing.</v>

54
00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:06.780
He was more like a hippie, you know, he was very laid back. You know,

55
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:11.040
he wore like Birkenstocks and like a bandana on his head, big music guy.

56
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.450
Didn't really talk like that. He was a, yeah. I wipe my with your face.

57
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.720
A big music guy. You know, he never.

58
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.110
<v 5>Wanted to do a talk show. You know, Joe, I would say, why don't you,</v>

59
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:25.170
everyone thinks she had Tony soprano, right? Why don't you pick,

60
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:30.000
whether it be letting them in or, or whatever and show them the real Jim,

61
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:34.650
you're very intelligent guy. I mean, he's not that guy at all. Matter of fact,

62
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:38.040
he would say to me, like before the season, uh,

63
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.470
let's go down and have dinner at [inaudible]

64
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.470
, which I ran into you. That one time let's go down to Maury street. I'd want to

65
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.470
 start getting back into the swing of things. Cause

66
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.470
 he wasn't, he didn't hang around with those guys. He wasn't that guy at all, but he didn't want, he never did a talk show. He did 60 minutes. He wouldn't do

67
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.470
, uh,

68
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.303
 any of the talk shows. He said, I'm not interesting. He wasn't doing, I grew.

69
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.870
<v 4>Up around that. He grew up in Jersey, went to Rutgers university. He was,</v>

70
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.720
you know, an actor theater. God, it's.

71
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.330
<v 5>Funny. Uh, you know, I,</v>

72
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.930
I wrote a kid's book called Nikki deuce and it turned it into a movie and

73
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.210
Michael's in it and Paulie walnuts and Johnny sack and I was in

74
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:22.740
Jim's trailer. And uh, he had dusted the movie with Brad Pitt a mob movie.

75
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.420
And uh, he said, Harvey wants to call. He wants me to do a, let him in. I said,

76
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:31.860
I don't do talk shows. And uh, and he kept calling and he says,

77
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.160
he got nasty with Jim. And she said,

78
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.020
I will beat the out of Harvey Weinstein. He calls me again.

79
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.730
I will beat the out of him for the money he paid me. I'm not doing it.

80
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.880
Swear to God. This was all before the Harvey Weinstein.

81
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.500
When he was still the king, this is 2012. You know, when you.

82
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.010
<v 2>See that academy award speech, thank you,</v>

83
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:58.170
compilation where all the people go up,

84
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.310
all the various people that eventually talk about them, go up and praise,

85
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:07.110
Harvey Weinstein. I never saw it. Oh my God. It's so bizarre. It's so strange.

86
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.190
<v 4>Cause they were intimidated that he had that much power over people's careers</v>

87
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:14.010
and they didn't feel like their voice would be heard or that people would,

88
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.990
you know, take them serious. Find a way to, to you basically, you know what,

89
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.090
you up. No me. He.

90
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.480
<v 5>Would know me, uh, every three or four times.</v>

91
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:28.410
Like I run into him at Madison square garden and there's a restaurant Tribeca

92
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:28.771
grill,

93
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:33.600
which he had owned a piece of at one point and give you a half-ass

94
00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:36.510
hello? Maybe he was way above. I was beneath him.

95
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.960
He never got punched in the face. Is that what it is?

96
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.680
I heard Jason priestly punched him in the face stuff at a party.

97
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.750
<v 4>Yeah. Yeah. I heard that he got out.</v>

98
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.880
<v 5>Of line and Jason Priestley punched him in the face.</v>

99
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.750
I think nobody beat the out of Harvey Weinstein and it wouldn't be that

100
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.150
difficult. He could hardly breathe.

101
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.760
He smoke and chain smoke and he wasn't a tough guy.

102
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.330
He was tough with assistance. You know.

103
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.170
<v 2>Where do you think this escalates to? Do you have a,</v>

104
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.350
a map in your mind of where the territory is?

105
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.980
<v 6>Yeah, I mean, I would say there are several ways it could go,</v>

106
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.540
but unfortunately the dynamics look

107
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.310
almost unresolvable.

108
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:23.230
If somebody does not speak for the movement and with it being unresolvable,

109
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.120
you've got a conflict between rural people and urban

110
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:31.720
people. You have a conflict between, um,

111
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.450
blacks and those who are self-declared allies and ally doesn't

112
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:39.700
really mean ally, but uh,

113
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.650
foot soldiers on behalf of this movement and people who won't go along with it.

114
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.690
And what I'm trying to raise people's awareness of right now

115
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.510
is that there's something in us being raised in the U S there's

116
00:06:55.511 --> 00:07:00.340
something in us that thinks that the great leap forward

117
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.530
in China cannot happen here. That would happen in Cambodia, cannot happen here.

118
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.060
That Nazi Germany cannot happen here. Um, and you know,

119
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:11.710
the Soviet union couldn't happen here.

120
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.210
I don't know what characteristic it is that people think makes it impossible.

121
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.560
I don't think it's impossible.

122
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.090
I think if there is a characteristic that makes it unlikely,

123
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.080
it is the structure. It is the constitution,

124
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.470
which I would argue is showing its age. But nonetheless,

125
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:34.450
the values that America aspires to the reason that the world does pay attention

126
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:38.800
to us and still even with all of our brokenness allows us to lead it.

127
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.500
That reason is that the values that were described were honorable even

128
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:49.390
if, even if we didn't meet them, but what we aspired to be was great.

129
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.340
And, uh, I, you know, I resent Trump's make America great again,

130
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.550
because there are populations for whom it has simply never been great, right?

131
00:07:57.551 --> 00:07:59.140
So I, I think that last a,

132
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.770
in manga is just a finger in the eye for people and it was designed to be,

133
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.870
but the structure,

134
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.860
what it aspires to be as great and heading in the direction in which it could be

135
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:12.100
great for everybody is obviously the right thing to do.

136
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.050
But what we are now doing,

137
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:18.250
and the thing that troubles me most about this movement is that if you listen to

138
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:21.250
it closely and I have listened to it very closely,

139
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.610
it is explicitly about disassembling.

140
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:28.510
The very things that make the west marvelous, right?

141
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:30.370
It is anti science.

142
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.510
<v 7>I feel bad for any listener. We want to make a public apology already.</v>

143
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:35.440
We this thing up.

144
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.180
We're both having trouble thinking to 2021 year of all we're going to

145
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:40.750
make.

146
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.810
<v 2>This is what do they call it? A Mulligan, those dudes who played golf. Oh,</v>

147
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:45.520
do you get another one? What's a Mulligan mean?

148
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.243
<v 0>You gotta do over.</v>

149
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.720
<v 2>Let's just scratch this whole year.</v>

150
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.140
<v 7>That'd be great. I like to toast to things. People don't agree with.</v>

151
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:55.710
Like at the last minute they've already committed just like nine 11.

152
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.650
And they got already clinked. How rude I know.

153
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.320
I think there's going to be a lot of good that comes out of this year.

154
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.710
I really do. Oh, this I like talking about positive stuff. Like,

155
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.580
what are you thinking is.

156
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.411
<v 2>Well,</v>

157
00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:11.360
I think people are realizing that society and civilization hangs on by a

158
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:15.890
thread in some cases, and you know, in a series of events can happen.

159
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.560
It can derail our life radically.

160
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.680
And I don't think people were really aware that that was possible before.

161
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.260
I think there's a lot of things going on.

162
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.150
There's a lot of competing mindsets and competing ideologies and there's a lot

163
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.610
of anger going on in the world right now.

164
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.000
And then there's this fear that comes with a pandemic.

165
00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:38.700
Everything like pandemics ramp up everything like this is,

166
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:41.420
I have to think about it. We're thinking about it as just a pandemic,

167
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.860
but it's also a F there's a mind disease, like a fear disease.

168
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.060
That's sweeping through the land too. Right. And I feel like it's like, you're,

169
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.050
you're,

170
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.300
you're resources are being used up in so many different directions that it's

171
00:09:56.301 --> 00:09:57.470
like, you're a little overrun.

172
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.340
It's one of the reasons why people are reacting so violently to things lately

173
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.410
there's everything is just ramped up. And I feel like there's,

174
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.660
there's like a certain level of other things that you can tolerate in

175
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:16.640
your life when you have so many things compounding and piling on top of each

176
00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:17.090
other.

177
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.540
It's like the reason why they say that people get road rage is because it's not

178
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.390
just, you're in a car and someone does something stupid, but you're sick.

179
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.140
Your senses are heightened because you know, you're going 60 miles an hour.

180
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.230
So you're very aware. It's a very different feeling, right?

181
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:32.840
I didn't even consider that one thought when I first heard about,

182
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.320
I thought road rage is just people being a like you're being mean while you're

183
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:38.870
locked in this little box. Cause you know, you can't,

184
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.250
nobody can say anything to you. Yeah. But it's not just that it's fear. Like,

185
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.300
because you're driving fast. And it's like, if everybody up, someone's texting,

186
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.020
you put into your lane, you could die. So because of that, we,

187
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.100
because we have this in our head, it causes us to be like extra ramped up.

188
00:10:55.101 --> 00:10:58.700
And I think that's how we are right now with everything because of COVID even if

189
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:00.800
you don't have COVID, even if you're not worried about COVID,

190
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.680
what it's done is it's made everybody ramp up.

191
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.300
So everybody's almost got road rage.

192
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.750
So everybody is like a little bit more stressed out than they've ever been

193
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:09.051
before.

194
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:12.050
A little bit more ramped up and everything gets exaggerated and everything gets

195
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:12.860
blown out.

196
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.810
And there's so many more instances of scary things that you're being seen in

197
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:22.700
the news. And so few instances of really nice things and it's like,

198
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.990
what a weird combination of things to try to manage. Okay.
