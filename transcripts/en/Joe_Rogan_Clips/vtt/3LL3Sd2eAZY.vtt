00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.060
<v 2>What made you want to write about testosterone?</v>

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.380
What was the motivation behind those?

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.800
<v 1>So I'll give you the short story first,</v>

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.470
and then later I can give you the longer story.

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.080
The longer story involves chimpanzees. So that's.

7
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.123
<v 0>Kind of fun, favorite.</v>

8
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.180
<v 1>Subjects. Um,</v>

9
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
but the short story is that T I teach at Harvard about

10
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.710
hormones. I teach a course, um, behavioral,

11
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.070
well it's on behavioral endocrinology, it's called hormones and behavior.

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
And I've taught that for a long time now. And I got,

13
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.380
I got my PhD at Harvard, studying testosterone and behavior,

14
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.650
studying sex differences in the way we think and process information.

15
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.270
And I love I've just love the topic.

16
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:49.560
I love how much understanding testosterone helps me understand the world,

17
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:54.360
understand men. I'm not a man. I don't really understand men, uh,

18
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.100
or how they work, but understanding this hormone really has helped me a lot.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.020
And then in teaching about endocrinology and specifically testosterone,

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.670
I get so much feedback from students about how it changes their lives,

21
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.580
changes, how they understand themselves personally,

22
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.280
how they understand their relationships, how they understand the world,

23
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.460
and it's empowering for them. And it's been empowering for me.

24
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.440
And so I just always had this

25
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:26.700
natural intellectual enthusiasm for this topic.

26
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.770
And, um, but I'd say in the last five years,

27
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:35.520
I felt like the science was coming under attack and there's been

28
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.520
kind of a program to dismantle the science of

29
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.770
testosterone and how it shapes behavior,

30
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:47.340
particularly the evolutionary basis of behavior, um,

31
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.830
has kind of come under attack. The idea that there,

32
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.200
that sex differences are grounded in biology.

33
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:56.610
And I know that testosterone is a really important part of that. And, uh,

34
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.530
there's a movement to kind of discredit that science or downplay the

35
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.910
importance of biology and specifically testosterone in our lives and especially

36
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:06.840
in sex differences.

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.160
And I'm fascinated by sex differences and I'm fascinated by how evolution shaped

38
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:15.090
sex differences across different species and how it works. And, uh,

39
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.550
so that's ultimately why I wrote the book,

40
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.750
cause I kind of want to get all the science out there and kind of push back

41
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.140
against what I see as an attack on really good science.

42
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:30.030
There's nothing wrong with understanding who we are from a biological point of

43
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.751
view. Uh,

44
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.690
and I think we should all be open to that and learn as much as we can about who

45
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:35.280
we are and how we were.

46
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.590
<v 0>Yeah, I agree with you on it.</v>

47
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:42.480
But I also think it's fascinating why I watch the attack on the science of

48
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:45.990
biology, the science of how if, like,

49
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:49.320
I think that if we were an objective observer,

50
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.980
like something other than human and we're watching human beings,

51
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.830
we would be really interested in the,

52
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.100
the sex differences between the male and the females. And what's why are there,

53
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.210
there's like this real clear pattern of behavior on both sides?

54
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.970
Obviously there's a spectrum in that pattern,

55
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.470
but depending upon the levels of hormones and the genetic variance,

56
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.250
there's a lot of like consistency and what is causing this and what is,

57
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.701
you know,

58
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.330
what is it about male behavior that leads to this and female behavior that lives

59
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.164
to lead to that.

60
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.300
But then you get into this weird thing where ideology

61
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.820
has somehow or another overtaken science with a lot of human

62
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:31.654
beings today.

63
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.850
So they're willing to abandon science if it's inconvenient for

64
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:37.810
their ideology.

65
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.620
And it's very strange because you see really intelligent people doing this,

66
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.790
which is where it's really spooky because they're scared of being chastised and

67
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.220
attacked on Twitter. They're scared of being canceled.

68
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.250
So they're scared of going against the mainstream,

69
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.510
which is ideologically based instead of scientifically based.

70
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.400
<v 1>That's right.</v>

71
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.320
And I think the fear is that the science is getting in the way

72
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:05.170
of the ideology. So we,

73
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.090
I agree with most of the goals of the people

74
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.630
who are ideologically motivated, we want to reduce human suffering.

75
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.290
We want to have, make sure that we have, uh,

76
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.320
equal human rights for people who have all kinds of differences.

77
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.110
And so I agree with all that,

78
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.060
but I don't think that if science tells us that some

79
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:32.080
of these differences are grounded in biology, that means that a,

80
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:35.740
these traits that maybe, uh, like extreme male aggression,

81
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.110
that doesn't mean that that's immutable. I mean,

82
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.590
we have tons of evidence that it's not immutable humans have control over their

83
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.930
behavior. It depends heavily on the culture.

84
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.790
So denying the importance of say testosterone in male aggression,

85
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.680
isn't going to change the way that sort of differences in our natures

86
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.060
or the impetus for males to feel, um,

87
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.480
more than females that they, uh,

88
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.530
want to be physically aggressive or to respond aggressively uncertain

89
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.390
situations. Um,

90
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.890
and I like that you said that you implied that there's lots of overlap in

91
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:15.640
behavior between males and females and the degree to which that is grounded in

92
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:17.680
biology. So the point isn't,

93
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:19.900
and I just want to make it really clear at the beginning.

94
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.060
It's not that females are like this and males are like that in human and humans

95
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:27.070
or in other species. And especially, you know,

96
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:31.930
culture plays such a huge role in how we develop and how we express ourselves.

97
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.120
But even apart from culture, there are differences on average.

98
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.910
So there are some females who are highly physically aggressive,

99
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:44.170
and there are many males who are really emotional and sensitive and totally

100
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.700
peaceful. Can I say that? You just said you'd tear up sometimes. Okay.

101
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.320
<v 0>So you're for happy things.</v>

102
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.030
<v 1>Okay. So yeah, no, and I, I just cry when I'm moved or passionate. I cry a lot.</v>

103
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:57.980
And I actually talk about that in the book because there's a relationship with

104
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:01.220
testosterone there that we can talk about later, which is really interesting.

105
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.320
But the point is that, you know,

106
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.180
my book tea is not about not trying to

107
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.560
explain why males are one way and females are another way,

108
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.390
but why we're different on average,

109
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:18.260
why we have somewhat different natures and testosterone is to me the most

110
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:22.400
powerful way to understand those differences in our natures, you know,

111
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:27.080
from an evolutionary point of view and looking at how we as animals as

112
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:28.550
mammals, um,

113
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.650
try to maximize our reproductive success, right?

114
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.041
And that's,

115
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:38.870
so that's what testosterone does is it helps males maximize basically the number

116
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.600
of offspring they have through increasing mating opportunities.

117
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.640
It doesn't mean that males are only interested in having tons of sex and tons of

118
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.563
sex partners,

119
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.560
but they're definitely more interested in that than females in humans.

120
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.860
And in many other species where increasing the number of mates, you know,

121
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:57.560
yields reproductive benefits for males, but not females.

122
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.720
And that's what sex hormones do.

123
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:03.290
And estrogen and progesterone do similar things in women,

124
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.650
but it doesn't motivate us to fight aggressively for mates.

125
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.700
<v 0>Right? Clearly, if we were looking at this again, as an objective observer,</v>

126
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:14.150
we would see all this that would be without there wouldn't be any debate.

127
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.290
It'd be like, this is fascinating. Well,

128
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:18.500
this is why they've only been around for a couple of hundred thousand years.

129
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.720
And for a long time, they were eaten by Jaguars.

130
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.380
And so they had to make as many babies as possible in order to ensure survival

131
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.420
of the species. All this makes sense,
