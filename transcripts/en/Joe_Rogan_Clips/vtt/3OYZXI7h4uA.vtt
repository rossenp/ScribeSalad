00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.573
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.690
And then I was listening to these dudes quite a bit and then led into the next

4
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:11.460
deployment. I was there a month. Boom, almost died, pretty hard. Um,

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
teammates saved me and, uh, we had blood on the ground. Like I got blood on,

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.940
on target. And then they made a hellacious movement to get me to the medivac,

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.300
long story short, I'm eating dinner in the hospital.

8
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:27.630
One of the first meals jamming out to these dudes. And I was like, mom, I wanna,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.530
I wanna meet Sturgill Simpson. And then she tried to get ahold of them.

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.550
So calm eventually did. And, uh, he came, hung out for like two hours.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.740
Uh, I made, uh, my friend now general Baudette wait,

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.040
like 15 minutes so that we could finish talking about what we were talking

13
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.440
about, which when you're, when you're an enlisted dude,

14
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.710
you don't make generals wait, but I was on a lot of ketamine. So it was,

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.490
it was sweet. But, uh, then, uh, circle headed.

16
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.300
I was headed on his own accord to like donate to the foundation.

17
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:01.860
So this little tour going on that coincides with the actual album release is

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.220
donating to the special forces foundation. So, um,

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.690
that helps gold star families,

20
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.980
which are the families that remained of the remainder of the friends that got

21
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.900
killed on this trip. Uh,

22
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.890
so there were four green Berets into EOD techs and, uh,

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.170
so that money's going to them and that's, that's what I care about.

24
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:25.140
I don't like I'm alive. I don't have, uh,

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.000
any legs below my knees for those that can't, well,

26
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.700
I can't see my legs on the video anyway, but,

27
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.720
and I don't have my testicles either. So that's a different set of challenges,

28
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:37.800
but I don't care about getting taken care of other than the normal army

29
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.530
processes, but I want them to get taken care of from the foundation.

30
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.640
So I'm grateful to have these guys as friends now. They're awesome.

31
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.290
They're amazing musicians,

32
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:50.880
but amazing people and then grateful to be here and just to push that out.

33
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.190
So people that are coming to the shows,

34
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:57.540
all that money goes to the foundation and then people can go on the foundation's

35
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:02.520
website, which is special forces, foundation.org. And, uh,

36
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.560
yeah, I appreciate it.

37
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.810
<v 0>I did DMT three times in a day. Wow. The,</v>

38
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:13.140
the third time it was a really strong one. And, um,

39
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.520
it, it me up for a while. I don't remember how long afterwards,

40
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:18.990
but this was during the fear factor days,

41
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.450
but I remember reality the way I described it. The reality was very slippery,

42
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.771
very slippery.

43
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:30.000
Like I kept thinking that cars were going to fly over the incoming lane and

44
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.600
crashed into my car and kill me a real sleep. I kept thinking like,

45
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.430
be really careful. But then I realized that what that is, is like my ego,

46
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.100
trying to protect me by making me aware of imminent threats

47
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.610
and trying to reestablish its position as a,

48
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.770
in the chain of command.

49
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.480
Because like one of the things about really extreme psychedelic experiences that

50
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.510
they dissolve the ego to the point where you realize like you don't really

51
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.010
matter, like you're a part of some crazy system.

52
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.480
And the only reason why you think you really matters,

53
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.960
cause your biology wants to stay alive because there's these inherent

54
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.950
existential threats to your existence that have always existed throughout time.

55
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.820
And you know, ultimately though it doesn't matter,

56
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.840
cause you're just going to live and die and probably live again. And I, again,

57
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.600
and this is like this never ending cycle. Yeah. And you're.

58
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.650
<v 2>One of those guys said, anytime you're like fighting it, like you're stuck. It,</v>

59
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.060
it just means you haven't taken her enough.

60
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.750
I think there was like Terence McKenna or one of those guys was like,

61
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.600
you just have to take more in than you can't fight it. Right when you're gone,

62
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.703
you know?

63
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.020
<v 0>Um, yeah, but I was up for a while, but I was functional. I was,</v>

64
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.940
but I was real nervous and weirded out by Harold on weeks, maybe months. Why.

65
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.250
<v 2>Did you do it three times in a day where you're trying to do that on purpose?</v>

66
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.450
<v 0>The first time was light. I went in, but I didn't go in too deep,</v>

67
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.600
but I saw the visuals and I laid there and I, I was like,

68
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:55.630
I got to the door and I could see through the windows of the house,

69
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.000
but I didn't go inside this second time.

70
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.350
It just like opened up a vortex and socked me through to the center of the

71
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:06.430
universe. And then it was really, really, really intense.

72
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:09.490
And then I did it again after that because I loved it because it was so awesome.

73
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.570
I wanted to do it one more time.

74
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.550
<v 2>I got to do it more.</v>

75
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.330
<v 3>Let's start with Al with Ari slipping me, Molly. Let's start there.</v>

76
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.880
<v 0>You slipped them on. Yeah. What are you doing? What are you doing?</v>

77
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.920
I'm much Interested. How did you do it? Where was this.

78
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.510
<v 3>Putting my children? Oh.</v>

79
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.290
<v 2>We had a shot. We had a shot before we started.</v>

80
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.770
I had to empty out a capsule and put it into a shot. You out of your mind?

81
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.410
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It was, it was great. It was great.

82
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:44.020
It was not there making me go on this stupid.

83
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.280
<v 3>Yeah. Joe, what kind of sociopath are we friends with? He did it to punish me.</v>

84
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.640
<v 2>I have to be sober. You don't give up Molly. You're only giving up alcohol.</v>

85
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.660
<v 3>I don't do Molly. Cause I just got back from the doctor and he said, Hey,</v>

86
00:04:55.661 --> 00:05:00.040
it's time to get healthy. I agree. So yeah. I agree. You don't think it's crazy.

87
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.330
<v 0>That you would do that a bit.</v>

88
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.240
You're not doing it to like your college roommate. You get the Molly tested.

89
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.290
Like where are you buying this month?

90
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.580
<v 2>No, I've done it from my favorite Molly dealer. Molly?</v>

91
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.260
Yeah. Yeah. High pressure, high cholesterol guys. Y'all

92
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.920
One. It killed for about 10 minutes.

93
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.140
I want to do the kicked in on that even was fine.

94
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.310
<v 3>Aye. Aye. Molly, are you it's, I was only, I was ready to fly that night.</v>

95
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.490
I was on a plane going like, when's this going to stop?

96
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.800
Cause I didn't know that orange juice kicks it back up.

97
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.170
So I'm drinking orange juice. Kicks it back.

98
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.003
<v 0>Vitamins fussy.</v>

99
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.330
<v 3>It's just generally on the plane. I'm drinking. Trying to get hydrated.</v>

100
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.360
Cause I'm on Molly. And so I'm drinking Tino's and orange juice.

101
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.740
<v 0>I may be drinking Tito's while you're on Molly.</v>

102
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.400
<v 3>Hey Joe, Joe didn't pick the.</v>

103
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.840
<v 0>Molly, but you already knew you were on it.</v>

104
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.500
<v 3>Yeah. And I was having.</v>

105
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 2>Severe panic attacks cause I'm like, I don't do Molly.</v>

106
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:05.510
And I'm thinking that kid died from Molly and Mexico. That comedy writer.

107
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.841
Oh yeah.

108
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.230
I don't think it was that he died from Molly and I'm sitting there going at 46.

109
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.350
I got high blood pressure, high cholesterol. I'm on pain. I'm on meds.

110
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.110
It was great. He noticed how great his wife looked and he was like,

111
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:18.680
she's awesome. I've got a great wife. I was dead Molly window.

112
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.740
<v 3>I do this a lot. Do.</v>

113
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.280
<v 2>You like drinks? I've never done it before. Yeah. The first time.</v>

114
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.360
And what made you want it? Cause I don't really want to do the sobriety things.

115
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.040
You mean for the money? For the Mars team to do a job. So he's doing it for fun,

116
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080
hard party drug. We had.

117
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.990
<v 0>A great time. Tom, what would you only use that to Bert? He said he'd.</v>

118
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.870
<v 2>Do it to you. If this pockets was yesterday then yeah.</v>

119
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:42.740
You would've all been dosed.

120
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.910
<v 3>Seriously. Yeah. I said to him, you would not do this to Joe when he goes 100%.</v>

121
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:48.860
I would. Yeah. It's just like yesterday.

122
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.500
<v 2>Wouldn't have broken up sobriety. But once I got the idea to do.</v>

123
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.820
<v 0>That, when you just offer it to us.</v>

124
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.140
<v 2>Yeah. Why? Why the wouldn't take it? No way he take it. You,</v>

125
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:58.970
I could offer it to you're a grownup.

126
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.670
<v 3>This is child. You're not a grown-up. How mad, how mad would you be?</v>

127
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:09.140
If you got spiked, I'd be very mad at your house. It was your last thing to do.

128
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.660
<v 0>The problem is if you have something to do, that's good. That's out the way.</v>

129
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.650
<v 3>You were good. Thank.</v>

130
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.350
<v 2>You. We were playing a drunk at the podcast. I was.</v>

131
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.650
<v 3>Having a couple drinks with you and then having Lee,</v>

132
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.860
getting you out of my house, having dinner with my children, relaxing,

133
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:24.980
getting on a plane and going on tour. Instead that scrapped.

134
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.120
<v 2>You had so much fun. I don't believe your fake anger.</v>

135
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.590
<v 3>There's no fake anger in this. Here's what I did. It was.</v>

136
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.230
<v 2>Thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. End of story. Thank you.</v>

137
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.510
You said that's not what he said, how much he likes being on my side.

138
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.170
<v 3>Look, I would like to be on your side too, but I would be.</v>

139
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.870
<v 2>Enraged if he said, he said, I'm going to call Tom.</v>

140
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.340
He's gonna be really mad at you. I'm like there's no,

141
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.740
Tom is going to die laughing instantly. And he goes, no,

142
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:55.574
he's going to be mad at you.

143
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.690
<v 4>I really need to tell people what's going on. And they don't even know.</v>

144
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.550
But I know because I did the reading for them. And I mean,

145
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:12.080
this is all just a social experiment to see how far they can push us

146
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.200
each other out or away from any kind of possible power

147
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:20.900
we could have to coalesce and go, wait a minute.

148
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:25.790
You guys are not gonna take any more of our money for your travels. Hey.

149
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.130
You know what I'm saying?

150
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.750
No, you can't. No, you,

151
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.450
it was not in the public sphere.

152
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.960
When she said it was in the public sphere. Who's.

153
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.720
<v 0>She? Nancy? Nancy Pelosi. It was.</v>

154
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.200
<v 4>Not in the public's fear. God Nancy. Oh, Nancy.</v>

155
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:53.210
Nancy is on my last nerve. I've been saying it for 10 years to Nancy.

156
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.170
You're on my last nerve.

157
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.340
You've got a lot to answer for in San Francisco.

158
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.620
What you have allowed on the streets there to the homeless people.

159
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:06.030
It's disgusting. I go up there and I, I am disgusted.

160
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.990
<v 0>Crazy right now. I don't think most people know how bad it is.</v>

161
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.580
<v 4>Or living in and felt their children around drug addicts,</v>

162
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:19.440
dying in the streets of the richest financial district on the west

163
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:23.490
coast. You know, where's that money go and do I it's like,

164
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.870
and then Laura Loomer went up there to Nancy's vineyard trying to find her.

165
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.310
It's like,

166
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.050
if you guys don't get yet that it don't matter who the president

167
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:34.884
is.

168
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.290
It's all a scam to put public money into

169
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:45.210
private pockets and nothing else you're

170
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:49.950
being robbed and nothing out. And they're both doing it.

171
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.730
Both parties, both sides, both up and down.

172
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.890
It's about the American people. We have got to go to Washington.

173
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.500
You know that movie, Mrs. Mr. Smith,

174
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.360
I think about we're all needed to be Mr. Smith and all go to Washington was

175
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:09.270
like, this is our government. That is our tax money.

176
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.780
And it will be audited as Trump has promised.

177
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.910
And as long as president Trump continues to make the moves to keep that

178
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:22.140
promise to us, I will be supportive of him because that needs to happen.

179
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.360
The federal reserve must be audited and we have to thank president Trump for

180
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:28.890
going in that direction. How much.

181
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.420
<v 0>Time do you spend thinking about this stuff?</v>

182
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.840
<v 4>18 Hours a day.</v>

183
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.420
<v 0>You went hard in the paint.</v>

184
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.840
<v 5>Oh dude. I w I was supposed to go so much harder to, yeah.</v>

185
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.310
I had to cut a lot of jokes.

186
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.550
You have to cut a lot of jokes because Caitlyn Jenner didn't want us talking

187
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:48.120
about her car crash. So Jesus Christ,

188
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.670
that was like the bulk of my material. Don't be here.

189
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.570
I know she didn't even know that it was possible that we were going to do that.

190
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.790
Oh my gosh. I was like,

191
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.860
I know comedy central told me they were like, listen,

192
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.800
we don't think Caitlin knows that those jokes are coming. And I was like,

193
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.600
will you tell her? Or will someone give her a heads up? Like, and they're like,

194
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:12.900
we don't want to alert her. Cause she might not want to do it now.

195
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.910
<v 0>So who decided to not do the jokes?</v>

196
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.810
<v 5>I was doing the jokes around town to get ready for it.</v>

197
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.400
Like I was going like Caitlyn Jenner, uh, such a beautiful woman.

198
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:26.790
You killed with your car four years ago. You know, stuff like that. Um,

199
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.300
I loved you on keeping up with the car crashing and just like different things.

200
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.570
Um, uh, I love that you, um,

201
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.760
I love that you're a woman that can't men straight yet.

202
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.740
You still managed to have blood on your hands,

203
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.150
like great jokes and you can't mend straight

204
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.040
menstruate menstruate yet. You still manage it. Yeah. You can't get your period,

205
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:50.760
but you still managed to have blood on your hands. And um, and I was talking to,

206
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.470
and they were like my favorite jokes of my set. They like did this,

207
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.940
like worked the best I was working to set up for like a month before. And um,

208
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.020
who told you to not do them? Well, comedy central strongly advised me not to.

209
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.480
They never said you can't. They've never said that to me,

210
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:09.070
which is not true because Caitlin Jenner heard the

211
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:12.910
morning of they had a call with her the morning of the roast that she had heard.

212
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.590
Apparently someone's doing jokes about me and my car crash.

213
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.610
And if, if they do, if I hear the single,

214
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.440
that was a very devastating thing that happened to that family and a woman lost

215
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:30.700
her life. And if there's a joke about it, I will walk.

216
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.440
And that's what I told gummy central. That would've been awesome.

217
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.590
Before I heard this, I was like, if she gets upset, cause they were like,

218
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:43.150
if she gets upset, there might be a moment where, you know, she,

219
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.230
the cameras go to her and the problem is I was going first and I was doing all

220
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:50.080
the jokes about the car crash. Now, if I would have upset her first off,

221
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.170
then the whole show is thrown off and it's weird in the room. I said,

222
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.500
bad press is good press. It's going to get written up so much more.

223
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.640
You guys come on.

224
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.810
<v 6>So I start driving around and it's still doing its Ford back left, right?</v>

225
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.920
It's still pointing north south. We get to about the 12 o'clock position.

226
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:09.070
I'm just in a nice, easy descent and a reason. Cause I'm going to ask her,

227
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.370
can you go more aggressive? You can. But when you're out over water,

228
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.260
the water looks the same at 20,000 feet.

229
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.380
Is it does it 2000 feet eat don't you know,

230
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.680
so you can easily put yourself in a nonrecoverable position if you're not paying

231
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:23.950
attention and you go into the water. So I got this nice, easy to send.

232
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:26.620
I get to about 12 o'clock. And as I'm coming down, you know, I,

233
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.800
I could guess probably about, you know, 18,000 feet now,

234
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.420
a couple thousand feet below the other airplane,

235
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.880
the tic-tac just kind of rapidly goes and turns. So now it's kind of point east,

236
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:40.600
west and out Mears us. So it's above the surface, we're up high,

237
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:43.870
we're coming down and it starts coming up. I'm like,

238
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:44.920
well this is getting interesting.

239
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.150
So we kind of drive all the way around a circle. I'm descendant, it's coming up.

240
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.630
And I get over to about the eight o'clock position to the nine o'clock and it's

241
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:56.110
over at about the two o'clock position. Well, the quickest way, as we know,

242
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.370
as kids to get someone, you know,

243
00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.290
you can keep going around the circle and nothing's going to happen.

244
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:02.410
And you cut across the circle. Some about, I dunno,

245
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.540
probably two to 3000 feet above it.

246
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.380
And I just kind of dropped my nose aggressively and I cut across the circle and

247
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:11.860
it's coming this way. It's because I'm trying to fly to where it's going to be.

248
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.290
Cause I want to join on it. I want to see how close I can get to it. Right.

249
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:15.940
And as I'm pulling up,

250
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.360
it's kind of starting to cross my nose and it starts to accelerate.

251
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:23.590
And within about less than a second as I start to pull nose onto it and it

252
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:26.110
crosses right in front of me, it just goes, and it's gone.

253
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.960
So I called the other airplane. I said, Hey, you guys, you guys see that thing.

254
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:36.280
And they're like, sir, it's gone. We don't, we don't see it at all. So I'm like,

255
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:41.080
okay, that's kinda weird. So we, we don't see it. We're looking at same time.

256
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:44.710
I say, Hey, let's turn around and let's go back to see what was in the water.

257
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.510
You know, there's was there something there?

258
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.450
So he turned around we're right there. We haven't gone anywhere. It's gone.

259
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:54.560
Water's perfectly, there's no whitewater, nothing. It's just blue or like, okay.

260
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.950
So we turned back around now we're heading back out towards the east.

261
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.010
And I tell the controller. I said, well, I said, uh, you know,

262
00:15:02.011 --> 00:15:05.990
I first said that I'm kind of weirded out. And I told my, my backseat or that.

263
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.590
And we start heading back and the controller on the Princeton,

264
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:11.300
he comes at me says, sir, you're not going to believe this.

265
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.950
But that thing is back at your cap point.

266
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:15.380
That was our original point where we were going to hold 40 miles south of the

267
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:15.950
ship.

268
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.420
So this thing has went from wherever we were at to about 60

269
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:25.370
miles in, you know, maybe 30, 40 seconds it's already over there.

270
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.190
And it just, and they didn't track it. It just appeared.

271
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.110
He just shows back up on their radar and they go it's here. So we're like, okay,
