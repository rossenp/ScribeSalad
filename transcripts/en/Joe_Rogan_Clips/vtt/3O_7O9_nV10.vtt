<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.200
<v 2>Well, well, well, if it is an old horse worm RO &lt;laugh&gt;,</v>

5
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:15.760
They keep saying I'm taking horsey worm.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.680
I literally got it from a doctor it's American company.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.950
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's uh, it,

they won the Nobel prize in 2015 for use and human beings. Yeah.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.270
And CNN is saying I'm taking horsey. Wormer. Yeah. What?

10
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.270
So they must know that that's a lie.

11
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.510
There's a lot of people saying it &lt;laugh&gt; right. But a lot of people can say it.

12
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.390
Okay. Like the internet says it, who cares? Sure.

13
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.260
But CNN is saying it like Jim Acosta IM a like, like USA today,

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.213
a few other like.

15
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.780
<v 0>People and they're talking about ivermectin. Right? So what, cause I don't know.</v>

16
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.820
I just saw so much news yeah. About you. I mean,

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:53.020
I've talked to you and check on you and see if you're all right.

18
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.180
And you're like, you, you, you threw the kitchen sink at it. You said,

19
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.940
which was stuff that, you know, you took IV drips and was it mono?

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.730
What?

21
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.490
<v 1>Mono monoclonal.</v>

22
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.890
<v 0>Antibodies and that, what is monoclonal antibodies on? It's the.</v>

23
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.803
<v 1>They gave Trump.</v>

24
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.650
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. And then what, so who said, or did you already want.</v>

25
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.810
<v 1>IEC? Like, well, I had this guy on Dr. Pierre Corey, and he is, uh,</v>

26
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:18.530
what is the organization? He's from frontline CRI COVID critical care workers.

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.600
Yeah. There's a lot C he's uh, well,

28
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.480
established doctors treated thousands of people with COVID and they've, uh,

29
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.880
early on in the pandemic, they found some good,

30
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.680
uh, efficacy with, uh, with, with, um, ivermectin,

31
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.270
frontline, 19 critical care Alliance. Okay. Yeah.

32
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.470
Um, so I had him on and you know, he had talked to me about, it's not,

33
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.430
he's not the only doctor that told me to take it.

34
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.670
Multiple doctors told me to take it. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's uh,

35
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.870
it's supposed to have, uh,

36
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.470
what is the exact thing it's supposed to do?

37
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.260
There's there's something that I highlighted. Um, &lt;affirmative&gt;

38
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.500
and this is obviously, I'm not a doctor.

39
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.060
It says I ivermectin was found to be a blocker of

40
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.420
viral, uh, replica replica case,

41
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.580
R E P L I C a S a pro Ts.

42
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.340
And I don't know what this word is.

43
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.730
Human T M P R S S two. I don't know.

44
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.650
But what they didn't highlight. Yeah. Is that I got better. Yeah.

45
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:31.730
You got better quickly. They try,

46
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.810
try to make it seem as if like I'm doing some wacky that's completely

47
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:37.730
ineffective. And right.

48
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.330
CNN was saying that I'm a distributor of misinformation also.

49
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.280
That was the other thing that happened. The, um, in Tokyo, in Japan,

50
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.400
which is apparently, uh,

51
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:52.560
they're very conservative about the medication that they,

52
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.240
they use and the medications that they, uh, endorse.

53
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.400
But the Tokyo medical association,

54
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.400
chairman held a live press conference recommending ivermectin to all doctors

55
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.560
for all COVID patients.

56
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.000
<v 0>So what's going on with the, like the, you know, it's kind of hard to,</v>

57
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.440
to figure out what's the truth in, in a lot of things. But with,

58
00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:15.920
with regard to this, people go, it's insane to take ivermectin.

59
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.510
Like you see it everywhere. Everyone's like, wow, don't take this.

60
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.870
And then you have the head of the Tokyo,

61
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.310
whatever medical commission saying, take IEC.

62
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.030
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know what's going on, man. You know, there's a lot of speculation.</v>

63
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.350
One of the speculations involves the, um,

64
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.030
emergency use authorization for the vaccines that

65
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.900
in order for there to be an emergency use authorization,

66
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.020
there has to be no treatment. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; for a disease. Right.

67
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.980
So because there is this treatment in,

68
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.060
in IM actin and there's other treatments too, right. Um, because of this,

69
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.860
there's a lot of pushback against potential treatments and

70
00:03:57.861 --> 00:04:01.050
pretending that they don't really work or that they're conspiracy theories.

71
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:03.850
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; this is the, this is the grand conspiracy, right?

72
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.210
The grand conspiracy is the pharmaceutical companies are all on cahoots to try

73
00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:10.090
to make anybody who takes this stuff look crazy,

74
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.290
but what's crazy is look how better I got, yeah, I got better. Pretty quick.

75
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.530
<v 0>Let's go to like your, your whole experience. Yeah. So you get back from a trip.</v>

76
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:21.360
Right. And is it that night,

77
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.920
do you arrive home and know, or like on your way home? And you're like,

78
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:25.754
I don't feel so great.

79
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.280
<v 1>Um, well Saturday here's what happened Friday night,</v>

80
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.400
we went out and gun hammered.

81
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.960
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; went out and played pool till three 30 in the morning,

82
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.400
had a bunch of drinks.

83
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:38.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; had a bunch of drinks at the show at the show.

84
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.790
I think I had two drinks and then I had like four afterwards.

85
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.350
So we're pretty lit. Yeah. And it was three 30 in the morning,

86
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.150
exhausted playing travel, you know, flew that day. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; from,

87
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.510
um, I guess so Fort Lauderdale was the first show then that was Tampa.

88
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.270
And then last show was Orlando. Um, that night I just,

89
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.380
I was worn out Friday night, you know, three 30 in the morning. And I was like,

90
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.373
oh, I gotta crash.

91
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.740
And then I woke up in the morning and I was definitely hungover,

92
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.420
but I was also just feeling a little out of it.

93
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.980
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just a little, just a little, just not good.

94
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.540
It's a hard to describe if I had COVID it was just like beginning stages,

95
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.740
but I thought it was a hangover, right.

96
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.610
<v 0>It was kind of confuses the way how you can read it. So drank a lot.</v>

97
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.890
<v 1>Of water. Um, ate, took a bunch of vitamins, went to sleep, got up for the show,</v>

98
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:32.170
felt good. Um, no drinks that night. Um,

99
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.890
and then that night we flew back.

100
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.210
And so just feeling worn out, you know, pretty normal,

101
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.760
but worn out mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And then when I got home, I was like, man,

102
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:47.560
something just feels off. So I told my wife, you know, you should probably, um,

103
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.000
keep away from me. Let me isolate lucky.

104
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.520
We have a big house isolated and in the middle of the night I was sweating,

105
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.640
you know, or get fevers. And I just, I wasn't feeling good. And you knew it.

106
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.240
Then I woke up in the morning. I knew it when the morning, by the time,

107
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:05.240
the morning I was like, something's going on? Let's see what it is. It was 90,

108
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.280
whatever percent sure it was. COVID so morning I got tested,

109
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.960
turned out positive. And then, so this is Sunday mm-hmm.

110
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.310
<v 0>&lt;Affirmative&gt; Sunday. So Sunday, Sunday, you're you find out you're positive.</v>

111
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.550
And then that day you be, you feel sick, right? You're just in bed. Relax.

112
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.110
<v 1>Yeah. That day headache sick. And do you.</v>

113
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.990
<v 0>Do you immediately, this is what I, I didn't hadn't asked you yet. Had you,</v>

114
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.190
did you have a plan in place in your head for like,

115
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.350
if I get COVID I would do these. So you, yes.

116
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:36.470
So when you find out you're positive,

117
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.940
you start reaching out for these treatments. Yeah.

118
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.820
<v 1>I already had the, I already had it in place. You did?</v>

119
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.540
<v 0>Yeah. I was already ready to go. So, and then you start taking them that day.</v>

120
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.580
Yeah, I.

121
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.860
<v 1>Got it. I got all the stuff that I needed. Took it that day.</v>

122
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.460
And then Monday I felt pretty good. And I was taking vitamin IV drips every day.

123
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.970
High dose of vitamin C mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, vitamin D uh,

124
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.170
and N a D as well. My concern.

125
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.250
<v 0>When I spoke to you was just, will you please rest?</v>

126
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.010
&lt;laugh&gt; that's what I texted you. I was like, no hill runs,

127
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.810
no kettle bells and don't wrestle any cattle today. Just rest.

128
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.330
I did like, I'm going to rest. I'm going to rest. I.

129
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.200
<v 1>Rested. I know I did. I rested. I did, I did do, but watch TV.</v>

130
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.240
I actually enjoyed the first couple days. Cause I was like, this is a nice,

131
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.440
like a legit solid excuse where I don't have to do anything. Yes.

132
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.640
Which never comes up.

133
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.721
<v 0>Right. That was like,</v>

134
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:33.840
when the pandemic started back in March last year where it was like, no,

135
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.400
you have to cancel your dates. And I was like, all right,

136
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.240
it'll be like a nice week off. Like.

137
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.350
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; sure. Two weeks to slow the spread. Yeah. That's chill out. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.630
Um, so, but you know, after I did this and I,

139
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.950
I hit it with the N a D and the, uh, high dose vitamin C,

140
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.070
I think it was 10,000, 10,000 milligrams of vitamin C in the IV drip,

141
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:58.910
which is like very, it it's very effective. It goes right in your bloodstream,

142
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.500
right? Yeah. Um,

143
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.900
after that and the monoclonal antibodies and all the other stuff,

144
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.900
literally on Monday, I felt pretty good.

145
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.860
<v 0>That's yeah. So that's pretty, pretty fast, man. Pretty fast. Yeah. Yeah. Mine.</v>

146
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:19.020
When I got COVID I was in like the hospital recovering

147
00:08:19.021 --> 00:08:22.970
from surgery. Right. And I thought it was,

148
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.210
uh, the opioid withdrawals. Mm. Of which they told me, they're like,

149
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:31.490
you're gonna feel like, when you get off of these, like the flu, right. Yeah.

150
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:32.371
It's exactly. They said,

151
00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:35.850
you're gonna get emotional and you're gonna feel terrible. And I was like, okay.

152
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.970
And I, I got off of them, like on a Saturday I stopped taking them after,

153
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.880
or like two weeks. And then on Monday,

154
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.360
I think it was Monday or Tuesday. I had PT and OT back to back.

155
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.800
And afterwards I was like, man, I feel terrible. What is OT?

156
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.520
Occupational therapy. What's your difference?

157
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.760
Like above the waist is kind of the way they tell you, like PTs below the waist,

158
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.440
OTs above the waist. Oh.

159
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.840
So they were treating my knee for PT and then the OT was like the arm in hand

160
00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:07.400
stuff. And I did them back to back like, and they're hour each and I'm all up.

161
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.320
So they're like, yeah, of course you're tired and. And like take a nap. And I,

162
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.110
I slept like three hours and they're like, God. And I, and it here's the thing.

163
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.030
No, it occurred to nobody that I had. COVID the next day. I'm like,

164
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.750
I had diarrhea my, my shoulders,

165
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:26.430
like my traps neck were so achy. And I was like, oh. And they're like, yeah,

166
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.310
he's just worn out from the,

167
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.350
the therapy and getting off of the opiates and everything. And, and then the,

168
00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:38.060
the next day, a little bit at her, but still. And the third day I was like,

169
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:41.100
I feel better. You know? And the fourth day I was like, I feel fine.

170
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.060
So that was kind of like my window. And it was the last,

171
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.460
the fourth day where they were like, do you wanna take a COVID test? I was like,

172
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:49.420
for what they're like, oh, for when you felt like, three days ago.

173
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.020
&lt;laugh&gt; and I go, yeah. Okay.

174
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.340
And so I took the COVID test and my favorite is that they're like,

175
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.890
do you want same day results? And I go, yeah. And they go, it's expensive.

176
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.410
And I go, this hospital stays expensive. What are you talking about? Like,

177
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.810
this is thousands of dollars a day. You think? I,

178
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.850
I don't wanna spend a hundred dollars more to find out today. So I said, yeah,

179
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:13.770
let's do same day. And then they tested at the end of the day, I go,

180
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:15.890
where's my result. And they're like, we don't know.

181
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.000
So the next day I'm going home and it's, it's,

182
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:24.200
it's a Saturday and they're taking me home. And I was like, Hey,

183
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.760
whatever happened to my COVID test. And now I feel like, totally fine.

184
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.280
And they go, uh, I don't know. I wanna call the lady that took the test.

185
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.150
And I was like, the. So crazy. So I get home,

186
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.550
I watch a movie with my kids. Oh no. And the email goes, ding.

187
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.030
And I open it and it says positive. That's how I found out.

188
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.990
<v 1>So you're, super protected because, because they showed, uh,</v>

189
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:54.470
there was a study that showed that if you've had a previous COVID infection,

190
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.860
you're six to 13 times, uh, more protected than you are with just a Pfizer.

191
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.060
<v 0>Yeah. I try, I, you know, I gave up the argument. I was arguing with my cousin.</v>

192
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.420
Who's an ID doctor. What's an ID doctor, infectious disease doctor.

193
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.220
So this is what she treats and she's in the hospitals, you know, every day. And,

194
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.620
uh, she was like, when the Delta variant came out, she was like,

195
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:19.290
this thing is no joke. She's like, is all I'm seeing, you have to get back.

196
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:22.090
Especially if you're going on tour. I was like, I was like, well,

197
00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:25.410
what about whatever? I was like, fine. I'll just go. Yeah.

198
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.370
<v 1>Just went. Well, it didn't bother you. Yeah. It didn't bother.</v>

199
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.203
<v 0>Me.</v>

200
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.930
<v 1>I'm still, um, doing that.</v>

201
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.730
Like I'll still haw up little green. Yeah.

202
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.450
<v 0>Here and there. You what? A week out?</v>

203
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.320
<v 1>I, uh, a week yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that long,</v>

204
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.680
but it doesn't feel bad. Yeah. Like you.

205
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.753
<v 0>Had a great workout.</v>

206
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.200
<v 1>Workout today. Yeah. I had a great workout today. Felt great.</v>

207
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.600
This that's my second workout. I had one workout two days, three days ago,

208
00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:56.080
three days ago. Um, then took yesterday off and then worked out again today.

209
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.200
Yeah. No problem at all. Just feel completely normal. Great.

210
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.000
<v 0>Yeah. And your breathing's fine.</v>

211
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.280
<v 1>Yeah. Except the, the hoking up little. Yeah. But it they're little ones, crazy.</v>

212
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.240
<v 0>Things. How,</v>

213
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.000
or maybe you're immune to it now from having so much public scrutiny.

214
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.670
But like having people wish you got sicker, isn't that crazy to you?

215
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.190
I didn't pay attention. It's crazy to me. I mean, I've had people, you know,

216
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.270
wish harm on me and threaten me and tell me they wish I was dead and all this

217
00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:27.510
stuff, but fun. Yeah. You're like cool, man. Uh,

218
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:32.630
thanks for watching this special. Um, but it's like when you're sick. Yeah.

219
00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:33.900
People are like, I wish you were more.

220
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.660
<v 1>Sick. Well, the good news is I was only sick for a day. That's true.</v>

221
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.380
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;, it's just, it's just wild that there's people that like,</v>

222
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.300
I wish you were more sick. I wish.

223
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.380
<v 1>You wish you were in the hospital because I wasn't scared during the entire</v>

224
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.500
pandemic, what they would like is that when I did get sick,

225
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.460
that I was really sick. You learned became really scared and learn my lung.

226
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.370
Yeah. Yeah. That's true. And instead it's the worst case scenario for them.

227
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.050
Right. I bounce back about as quick as you can. Yeah.

228
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.810
And they're haters. Yeah. But that's their life that's you gotta live like that.

229
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:10.290
Imagine spending any time whatsoever wishing that a person felt bad. Yeah.

230
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.530
That's true. It's the dumbest thing you could ever spend your energy on. Yeah.

231
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.680
Its doesn't work. You can't, it doesn't, it doesn't make people feel worse.

232
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.120
You're like.

233
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.920
<v 0>God, I wish so hard. He's okay. &lt;laugh&gt; so crazy.</v>

234
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.560
<v 1>But I, I, you know, I'd heard that that was going on,</v>

235
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.960
but I didn't pay attention to it. It's like, you know, they're weak. Yeah.

236
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.800
You stay salty. Yeah.

237
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.363
<v 0>We're doing all right.</v>

238
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.910
<v 1>Everything's fine. Yeah. Doing pretty good. But meanwhile,</v>

239
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.510
I don't have a bad message. My message is be healthy.

240
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.070
And obviously there there's some merit to that, you know,

241
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.110
and merit to being consistently healthy, you know, the end.

242
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:51.390
Here's a message. The, the thing that me is drinking. I think that really me.

243
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.230
Yeah. I bet. If I went home early,

244
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.700
went to the hotel early Friday night and got sleep. Like I normally do. I,

245
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.380
I better, would've never got me. You think so? Yeah.

246
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.260
I was hammered we're out playing pool till, like I said, three 30 in the morning

247
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.940
and you know, I love playing pool, so yeah. I'll play pool till I'm exhausted.

248
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.180
Oh.

249
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.180
<v 0>My God. I went on a trip with you once, dude,</v>

250
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.610
it was like stand up to pool &lt;laugh&gt;

251
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.170
to, to the whole next day, like you were like, I didn't go to bed.

252
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.010
&lt;laugh&gt; you got back at like 9:00 AM.

253
00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:25.330
And then we went up to breakfast and I was like, why are you talking about that?

254
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.130
&lt;laugh&gt; you're fine. I was like, no way, dude.

255
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.610
<v 1>Well, you know that, that message is not a good message. No,</v>

256
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.040
the up all night message and the drinking message is that yeah,

257
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.680
my messages don't do that and it is stupid and I haven't had a drink since then.
