<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 2>And there's no like predicting who's gonna get it.</v>

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.920
And who's not like there are people who go in and out of recovery and then one

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.280
day it clicks mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.360
my dad was like quitting stuff from my whole life and, and,

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.150
and eventually got sober in jail when I was 12 and was sober for

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.270
the rest of my life.

8
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.190
He was sober for the next 12 years until he died when I was 24.

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.190
And I don't think that anyone ever really expected him to stop drinking,

10
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.830
you know? So it's like worth having hope for people. But also

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.340
my mom didn't argue him into finally quit drinking.

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.100
I didn't beg him into finally quitting drinking.

13
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.940
Nobody convinced him except for like his own misery of

14
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:51.980
like losing his family and then being in jail, you know.

15
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.820
<v 1>You, you used to party hard. Yeah.</v>

16
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.770
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.673
<v 1>What made you.</v>

18
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.970
<v 0>Um, do.</v>

19
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.050
<v 1>You think it's a genetic thing?</v>

20
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.450
<v 0>Yeah, I do. I think it's a genetic thing.</v>

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.370
I think that they're also can be an environmental component, you know, I,

22
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.210
I know that some things that I liked about it,

23
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.130
where it made me feel comfortable talking to people,

24
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.960
I crowds have always been kind of draining for me, large crowds,

25
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.600
especially if it's like people, I don't know. Um,

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.360
and I felt like I could talk to guys for the

27
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.920
first time when I started drinking,

28
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.680
but then I couldn't stop drinking once I started drinking.

29
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.790
So I would be like laid out on a bathroom floor with the guys. I like,

30
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:46.790
like stepping over me to, to pee, you know,

31
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.550
it just got real. That's how it always went.

32
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.590
I'd feel there'd be like a moment in the night where I was like, oh yeah,

33
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.030
I'm hot &lt;laugh&gt;.

34
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.070
And then I'd have like throw up in my ear and be someone's futon.

35
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.340
So it just was always real, real often.

36
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.260
There was a period of time for like years where I woke up and started drinking

37
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.580
and drank all day and was a blackout drinker every night. Um,

38
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.700
and then I actually had a boyfriend and

39
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.300
I quit drinking for him.

40
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.890
And then I started again and it just was always like,

41
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.890
it always went back to the same place. Like I tried quitting.

42
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.490
I tried quitting every year since I started,

43
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.290
I started drinking pretty much daily when I was 17 and then got sober when I was

44
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.490
29 and haven't had, um, a drink or a drug since,

45
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.570
but my bottom wasn't when I stopped,

46
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.280
when I stopped was just when I was done.

47
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.680
&lt;laugh&gt; mm it's an interesting thing.

48
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.360
But my last drink was actually just like a couple sips of a friend's beer.

49
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.280
And then I just was like, I, I just, something clicked.

50
00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:01.720
And I knew I couldn't do it by myself. And I was willing to accept, help.

51
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.080
I was willing to do anything. I was willing to do whatever it took.

52
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.680
And so, um, I did, I got help. It was free.

53
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.840
<v 1>What year was this? Around?</v>

54
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 0>Uh, January 21st, 2014. Wow.</v>

55
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.350
<v 1>Did you know it by the day? It, yeah, that's great. I only have like a,</v>

56
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.830
a other than the birth of my children in my head like that.

57
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.190
I have like this, the day I started comedy, Dan was married. That kind of.

58
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.230
Yeah. But that's a big one.

59
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.950
<v 0>I don't know when I started comedy and I don't know when you got married,</v>

60
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.750
but that's my, that's my date.

61
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.060
<v 1>Yeah. I started comedy August 27th, 1988.</v>

62
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.180
And I think back to that day, all the time, because I almost pussied out.

63
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.660
Wow. Yeah, me too. Do you almost pus it out? Yeah. What happened with.

64
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.380
<v 0>You? I, um, called yeah, I,</v>

65
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.580
you had to call the comedy club ahead of time to ask for which common club for a

66
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.300
spot, the comedy cafe of Milwaukee. I don't think it's with us any longer.

67
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.130
I think it has passed away, but, um, yeah, you,

68
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.570
you called ahead of time to get a spot on the open mic and then you could do a

69
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:08.930
set for five to seven minutes.

70
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.930
And so I like typed my set out word for word on a computer,

71
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.090
practiced it in front of a full length mirror a million times, um,

72
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.480
and wanted to, but I would've had to like cancel to cancel and I'm not a,

73
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.680
so I did it. And.

74
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.080
<v 1>You were drinking back then? Yeah.</v>

75
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.480
<v 0>Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. They, yeah. Um,</v>

76
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.720
yeah, I used to go on stage blackout drunk it,

77
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.120
I would not have any of the success that I have right now if I hadn't stopped

78
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.110
drinking because I would black out. Um, and yeah, I,

79
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.590
I went on and I told my jokes and some of them hid and some of them didn't,

80
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.070
but I got that. I got the fix.

81
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.230
I got that feeling of like telling a joke to a room full of people and having

82
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:57.630
them laugh at it. And I've been hooked ever since.

83
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.590
<v 1>How did you remember your material if you're blackout.</v>

84
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.780
<v 0>Drunk? I wasn't blackout drunk at that moment. Oh, other times.</v>

85
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.980
I don't know. And sometimes I didn't, I mean, I up a lot, you know,

86
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:11.580
there were times where I like went on stage and I would repeat my jokes that I

87
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:15.060
had just said. &lt;laugh&gt; um, I would ask my friends, like, how'd my Seco.

88
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:20.060
And they'd be like, you are faced. You know? &lt;laugh&gt; like, you're drunk.

89
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.370
It looked like you were really drunk, you know? Yeah.

90
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.770
I knew generally if I couldn't remember it,

91
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.850
that it probably wasn't that good generally. Yeah. Generally I'm like,

92
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:35.450
well, but I mean, that's like the difference between then and now.

93
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.210
And it's like what you were talking about now, if you have an opportunity,

94
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.050
you make the most of it. Now, if I have an opportunity,

95
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.280
I make the most of I show up early,

96
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.480
I'm polite and professional and like nobody Wes their pants and I

97
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.520
maybe get another shot of the thing later. You know,

98
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.800
you get to move on to like the next level onto the next step. Back then,

99
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:55.880
I remember in Milwaukee,

100
00:05:55.881 --> 00:06:00.400
there was a headliner who thought I was funny and wanted to see if he wanted to

101
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:01.320
bring me on the road.

102
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.480
And so he got me a feature set at a show, uh, a one,

103
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.200
a one nighter. And, um,

104
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.240
I went and did it and got black out drunk and

105
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.310
don't remember anything he said to me on the ride home.

106
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.630
But I do know he never brought me on the road with him. You know? &lt;laugh&gt; like,

107
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.270
I know I'm not on tour with him right now. &lt;laugh&gt;.

108
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.083
<v 1>Is he on tour?</v>

109
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.310
<v 0>I don't know. Oh, I don't know. I don't think I,</v>

110
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.950
I don't think I've spoken to him since &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.

111
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.140
<v 1>Maybe he'll he'll see this. And maybe.</v>

112
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.780
<v 0>He will. His name was James Ivin Barry. All right. James Irvin, Barry.</v>

113
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.300
He was very nice. I was very drunk. It was not his fault.

114
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.580
<v 1>I it's a weird thing that genetic propensity for alcoholism,</v>

115
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.340
cuz I've seen it in people where their parents are drunk and they just can't

116
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.420
help it. I've seen it. And some people like to think that it's all willpower,

117
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.810
but I'm not so sure I don't have that thing.

118
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.090
I can have a drink or two and I can not drink for a month. It doesn't bother me,

119
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.730
but I've seen it where like one drink and then they get shark eyes.

120
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.010
It's like point they flip over and they like, you know,

121
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.490
dals you ever look in a Jal's eyes?

122
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.850
<v 0>Like, no, I never looked in a Jal's eyes. Look in their eyes.</v>

123
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.240
<v 1>Dead, their dead eyes. Like, uh, like some people,</v>

124
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:22.280
their eyes just G they black out.

125
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:25.160
They get glazed over and they're not there anymore. Like,

126
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:29.280
oh Charles not here anymore. Yeah. Charles is gone. Now this shark boy.

127
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.800
Like his, their eyes just glass.

128
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.200
<v 0>Over. Yeah. I mean, I was never there when it happened,</v>

129
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.160
but that's exactly how my friends describe me. They'd be like,

130
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.670
I looked at you last night and you, you weren't there.

131
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.390
That's exactly how they describe.

132
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.740
<v 1>Me.</v>

133
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.590
