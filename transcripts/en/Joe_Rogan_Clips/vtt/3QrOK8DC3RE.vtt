00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 2>The problem is it's so delicious. Well that's, you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.440
and those keto desserts are mostly. Be.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.000
<v 0>Honestly, no, it, I, I just have to roll my eyes, the,</v>

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.720
the paleo treats and the keto desserts and the, you know,

6
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:18.200
all these things are like trying to come up with a version. Yeah.

7
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.230
It's almost like, you know, beyond meat, trying to come up with piece of steak,

8
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.390
that's made out of an, you know, of vegetables. And,

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.230
and now here we are trying to create a,

10
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.270
a sugary dessert that looks like a dessert and tastes like a dessert,

11
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.350
but is made with a erythritol and AOSE and all this.

12
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.430
<v 1>Other stuff. I'm glad you brought that up,</v>

13
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.750
cuz I think there's real promise in these, uh,

14
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.900
these meats that are made in a laboratory in terms of their

15
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.500
cloning meat, you know,

16
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:47.300
they're taking meat and reproducing it and I've seen some of these really

17
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.700
strange looking 3d printed steaks, but it's actual animal tissue.

18
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.520
Um,

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.300
but these meat substitutes that are made with seed

20
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.690
oils. Yeah. Uh, just horrible, just horrible knowing that,

21
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.570
and there was a study and we've talked about it on the podcast where they fed

22
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.050
rats, these, these things, and they had horrible rats eat each other.

23
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:14.250
They eat everything. Yeah. They eat garbage. Yeah, they're fine. Yep. They,

24
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.970
those, they eat those fake burgers and they were sick as.

25
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.250
I know they started getting liver problems. Yep.

26
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.320
<v 0>Yeah. I, I, I can't explain it. Um, it's.</v>

27
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.240
<v 1>Amazing how many people think that those things are.</v>

28
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.520
<v 0>Good for you beyond oh, beyond amazing. Um, yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; it's impossible.</v>

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.320
Oh wait. No, &lt;laugh&gt; it's uh, it's just, it's just nuts.

30
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.880
It's just nuts that, that the, again,

31
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.720
that the collective conscience of the country would rally around something.

32
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.230
So in AE some, so,

33
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.350
so antithetical to health and in the name of saving

34
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.670
the climate or saving the animals or whatever, uh, there's never gonna be any,

35
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:56.390
well, not in our lifetime, even the cell, you know, the,

36
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.830
the matrix lab grown meat, the cell cell based stuff,

37
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.310
still lacks a lot of the nutrients. You know,

38
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.820
you have to have the infusion of the capital areas and all of the stuff,

39
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:08.380
you have to have a, a real animal to get the full impact of all.

40
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.900
<v 1>This. They needed clone, headless animals with no souls. Yeah, exactly.</v>

41
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.540
<v 0>That's what they needed to do. Yeah. I mean.</v>

42
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.980
<v 1>Yeah. But then they would have to exercise in order to be like really delicious.</v>

43
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.420
That's the thing, like the difference between a wild game animal. Yeah.

44
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.220
And an animal that's stuck in a pen like veal. Yeah.

45
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:28.090
Which disgusting wild game animal, rich and red and dark. And it's,

46
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.410
it's denser. It's more chewy, right. Because it's a, it's a denser healthy. And.

47
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.210
<v 0>You think you're gonna get that from a lab grown? No. No. So, you know, we're.</v>

48
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.930
<v 1>Back to you get a headless elk, I mean,</v>

49
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:40.930
steroids and you have running on a treadmill.

50
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.800
<v 0>That's pat that Jamie make a note. Um, yeah. It's I think,</v>

51
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:48.480
you know, regenerative agriculture is,

52
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.480
is the way we need to go to feed the world, uh,

53
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.400
not through ceasing growing animals and trying to do it all in the lab.

54
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.120
<v 1>I think is, well, Rob Wolf has a new book out and he was supposed to be on, um,</v>

55
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.520
right around April, but a bunch of went down and we're,

56
00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:09.240
we're gonna have him on again. Uh, but his Bo his book is about that. Yeah.

57
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:13.320
His book is all about the benefits of regenerative agriculture. Yeah.

58
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.160
The people that are skeptical though,

59
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.400
don't think that we could do it at a scale that's necessary to provide as many P

60
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.310
people with meat as eat meat in this country because of fast food production,

61
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.990
fast food production, the way they believe the, the way I've,

62
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:28.790
I've heard it argued. And it makes a lot of sense.

63
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.150
Is that the scale in which we're consuming meat in this country because of

64
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.630
fast food requires factory farming to keep up with it.

65
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.060
<v 0>Well, for now it does. But you know, there's a,</v>

66
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:42.220
there's gotta be a tipping point.

67
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.700
There's gotta be a point at which we have to recognize that by,

68
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.460
by concentrating everything in our world, not just food,

69
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.300
but all of these different concentrations,

70
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.460
that there's a point at which we can't satisfy people's needs. And, and, and,

71
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.770
uh, and so I see us sort of going back to the cottage industry, farm,

72
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.930
the local grown, you know, the local farmers. I mean,

73
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.370
I would love to see if there's gonna be any subsidies in agriculture.

74
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:09.810
It should be for, for local,

75
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.970
for local small farms that are trying to do regenerative agriculture and,

76
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.090
and reclaim the top soil and, and, you know,

77
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:19.330
build back instead of continuously depleting.

78
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.000
<v 1>It. Yeah, I think so too.</v>

79
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:25.160
And I think one of the interesting things is that one of the big arguments

80
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.720
against everyone eating vegetables is mono crop agriculture,

81
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:33.480
which is essentially what you would need. This is the real problem.

82
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.840
It becomes a conundrum because everyone, I think everyone with a moral,

83
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.870
with a heart and a soul that factory farming in terms of

84
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:44.990
animals is disgusting. It's horrible. Yep.

85
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.670
But I don't think they understand the horrors of mono crop agriculture and

86
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:54.190
how bad it is. Yeah. It's so bad for the environment.

87
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.550
It's so bad for the soil. It's bad for the animals. It's,

88
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.060
it's terrible for all the wildlife that gets moved and,

89
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.740
and displaced because of the fact that you have, you know,

90
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.900
4,000 acres of corn or some crazy like that. Yeah.

91
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:12.140
And when they churn that corn up with a combine,

92
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.940
a lot of dies.

93
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.020
There is no way you're gonna go out there and hand pick 4,000 acres of corn.

94
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.730
You're not going to do it. Right. You use machinery during that machinery.

95
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:24.850
It's indiscriminate. It chews up everything. Yeah.

96
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.130
Not only that you have to use some sort of pesticides.

97
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.130
You have to use something that discourages predation.

98
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.650
You have to use all these different methods to keep animals. Look,

99
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.650
if you have 4,000 acres of corn, you're gonna have a,

100
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.880
a food source where animals are gonna swarm in and all of your crops,

101
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.240
that's what they would do. If that was a,

102
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.200
it was a normal thing that occurred in the wild. If in the wild,

103
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.040
all of a sudden, outta nowhere, there was 4,000 acres of naturally grow,

104
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.640
growing vegetables. That would be one of the most wildlife rich areas.

105
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.040
A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Yeah.

106
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.000
So how do they keep that from happening? Well, they do with poison. They,

107
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.600
they discourage it with, with pesticides, with, uh,

108
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.840
all sorts of different methods of eliminating insects.

109
00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:12.000
If you care about insects, they destroy insect populations, insects,

110
00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:15.520
which are also critical to the growth of the soil. It's like,

111
00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:16.830
there's this natural cycle.

112
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.070
So then they have to add a bunch of nitrogen and to the soil.

113
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.710
And they estimate that, that we have, like, I think the latest estimation,

114
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:27.590
Jamie looked this up, the United States farmlands have,

115
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.470
I believe 60 more seasons in, I heard 50,

116
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.230
but yeah, it's.

117
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.870
<v 0>A, it's that number. Yeah. It's a, which is, it's a dwindling number.</v>

118
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.700
It's a diminishing number until all of the.

119
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.940
<v 1>Nutrients are depleted. You and me might be dead,</v>

120
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:44.420
but Jamie's gonna ride this out. Jamie's gonna be here at the end of crops.

121
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.860
He's.

122
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.740
<v 0>Gonna be in this bunker with his cell lab grown meat. Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.060
<v 1>I'll be, uh, 113 hooked up to an IV N a D machine. And,</v>

124
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.220
and Jamie will be, uh, he'll be out there trucking, eaten lab grown carrots.

125
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.970
I just don't understand why people don't recognize that both these things are

126
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.370
terrible. Yep. Factory farming is terrible. And this mono crop agriculture,

127
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.050
and this is the argument they always use.

128
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.970
We need these mono crop agriculture things to feed animals. Well, no we don't.

129
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.650
No, no. What you need is natural grasslands, which is what these,

130
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.760
when you saw you, when the,

131
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.280
the settlers saw millions of bison running across the, the planes,

132
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.880
what were they eating? Were they eating mono crop, GMO, soy? No, they weren't.

133
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.480
They were eating grass. That's what they're supposed to eat. Yeah.

134
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.840
And when they do that, they on the ground,

135
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.400
that fertilizes the grasses and fertilizes all the other plants.

136
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.110
And then you have this whole ecosystem of animals that exist within these,

137
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.190
within these fields. And it's supposed to be that way.

138
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:48.270
They're supposed to coexist together and they work together symbiotically to

139
00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:51.110
make sure that, and you can do that. At least we've,

140
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.270
we've demonstrated on small scale. And this is what Rob's book is about.

141
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.790
And a lot of other people have talked about this as well, that when it's done,

142
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.660
it actually produces a carbon neutral effect. Yeah. Nature.
