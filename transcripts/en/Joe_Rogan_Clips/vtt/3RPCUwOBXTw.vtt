00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now what about fat? Like, yeah,</v>

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.410
I would think that you would need fat.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.740
<v 1>Well, yeah, you do. And that's, that's why you eat the whole animal, you know,</v>

4
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:14.310
suck the brain out of the rabbit. Try to get every bit of fat you can get.

5
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:19.230
And I, I learned a lot about that out there because, uh, I mean,

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:21.930
I caught a lot of rabbits and squirrels early on,

7
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.740
but I still just lost the weight as fast as if I wasn't eating. It felt like,

8
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.000
Yeah, I was, when I went out there, I was like,

9
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.000
I wonder how long that takes is that like a year, but basically it's,

10
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.230
as soon as you start eating, right. But there's no fat, not much on him.

11
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:40.260
It was like maybe enough to make up for the energy.

12
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:42.270
I was expending by running around. Like,

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.250
I don't think I lost fat weight faster than someone that was just sitting there.

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.790
It was probably about the same, but I was able to run around and have fun,

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.970
you know, shoot my bow and like learn my land,

16
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.340
see how animals were moving and stuff.

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.050
<v 0>So you didn't have any supplies that you initially set out with in terms of.</v>

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.540
<v 1>No food, no food. Yeah. It's,</v>

19
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:07.540
it's a fascinating experience when the helicopter drops you off flies away and

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.100
you're,

21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.430
you've never scouted this place before you didn't get to choose where you're at

22
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.360
and it's flies away. And you're just like, wow. Somehow I have to delays here.

23
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.630
<v 0>Yeah, they did. There was wild animals.</v>

24
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.051
<v 1>There. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:23.760
They scout out and basically try to find 10 spots that have some form of

26
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.900
potential sustainability on them. And then you got to try to unlock the key,

27
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:28.020
you.

28
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.050
<v 0>Know, did you have any filtration system for water? No.</v>

29
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.020
<v 1>I started by boiling all my water,</v>

30
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:39.000
but then I just slowly drink bits of raw water until I could

31
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.880
pretty much just drink while raw water, because it's, I was,

32
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.020
it was a big old lake up in the far north. It's like, there's pretty clean, so,

33
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.210
and I didn't get sick, but I drank.

34
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.160
<v 0>He got out of a lake once off of, uh, in, um, uh, prince of Wales,</v>

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.840
Alaska, apparently it's high enough altitude. So there's no beavers. Yeah. Yeah.

36
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.590
It was still weird. Just dipping weight drinking.

37
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.380
<v 1>Yeah. That's what we had done in Siberia too.</v>

38
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:07.680
And it's always could even in like, Mosse puddles, it's like this yellow water,

39
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.330
but they'll just dip right in and out.

40
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.870
<v 0>Now, when you said you drank a little bit, that was to test to see that.</v>

41
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.990
<v 1>But get mildly sick rather than chugging it to begin with. Right.</v>

42
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.030
<v 0>So you boiled it at first and then started sipping it a little bit and then</v>

43
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:22.650
eventually just were drinking it. Yeah.

44
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.780
<v 1>Although another thing in the FA in the cold,</v>

45
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.360
when you're trying to conserve calories like that, you uh,

46
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.350
don't want to drink a lot of cold water side heat anyway. So that makes.

47
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.080
<v 0>Sense. Yeah. And what did you do for shelter?</v>

48
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.770
<v 1>Uh, the tarp was one of the things we took.</v>

49
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:42.570
So I built a little like a frame shelter just out of

50
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:46.800
logs, covered it. Like chinked it with Moss, but the frame of it,

51
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.300
I spent less time on shelter, more time, like procuring food and hunting.

52
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:54.330
So it was a quick shelter, threw it up. I knew, I mean,

53
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:56.010
I've lived in a teepee in that weather,

54
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.110
so I like knew I was going to be fine on the cold,

55
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:02.080
as long as I could provide enough calories to keep my body warm.

56
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.770
<v 0>So how many days did it take you before you got an animal?</v>

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.790
<v 1>Uh, well, I got him rabbit on day one, so that was nice.</v>

58
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.620
And then I continued to get rabbits,

59
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:14.860
but it was 23 days when I got a moose.

60
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.920
So that was good. And then you're good. Kind.

61
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.970
<v 0>Of it's like, yeah.</v>

62
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.980
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, again, I was amazed how much fat you eat, you know, like, yeah.</v>

63
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.550
So I was, I was counting my moose and being like, Hmm,

64
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.290
this isn't like an infinite supply of food here. You know.

65
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.503
<v 0>Not enough fat.</v>

66
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.430
<v 1>Cause you're definitely eating more fat than you are protein.</v>

67
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.040
But plus I had a Wolverine come and pillage my stores of fat and

68
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:42.874
stuff. So.

69
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.490
<v 0>Yeah, I heard about that. So how did that happen? What,</v>

70
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.580
where did you store everything? Well.

71
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.460
<v 1>Initially I didn't, to be honest, I didn't expect to see a Wolverine.</v>

72
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:54.520
I never have, and I just wasn't something on my consciousness.

73
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.720
And so when I got the moose, I put all the meat up on this shelf.

74
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.180
I built and thought, man, if a bear comes, it'll be great.

75
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.530
I'll have a chance at a bear. You know,

76
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:06.820
I'll wake up at night and kind of be like a bait pile basically. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.940
And so I was maybe expecting a bear to come,

78
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:14.260
but I went to sleep the first night I got the moose and woke up and I came out

79
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:17.170
and there were just tracks everywhere. Somehow I hadn't woken up,

80
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.630
but Wolverine's a lot slyer animal.

81
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:23.050
And he had come and pulled out all the kidney fat, you know,

82
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.090
I had like a jug kidney found that I.

83
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.850
<v 0>Was just like, no. And all your family hauled.</v>

84
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.930
<v 1>Off a full gallon jug packed with kidney fat.</v>

85
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.430
I had other fat, but that was like, you know, weeks of fat there, I was find it.

86
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.110
No, it was, it was rough. And so then he was pretty excited.

87
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:45.670
I'm sure that Wolverine just kept coming back every day. I figured,

88
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.510
I don't know if they're like, I figured they were nocturnal,

89
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.600
but they sure enough I'd be like out there scraping my moose hide in the middle

90
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:55.810
of the day. He'd come running up and like try to grab some meat and run off.

91
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.730
And I was like, holy smokes, this thing's bold.

92
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.710
<v 0>Is this a photo of him? Yeah. That's the.</v>

93
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.000
<v 1>One that's at my shelter. There are that's up in the show.</v>

94
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:07.510
There he is sneaking around the, uh,

95
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.050
but yeah, so he stole 35,000 calories, which is gold.

96
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.860
<v 0>Oh, so you got some series gear on you're wearing KU you. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.660
<v 1>So yeah. Real, real gear. Yeah. You're not naked and afraid. Fortunately. No.</v>

98
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.610
<v 0>That's a serious, uh, hunting gear. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's, you're,</v>

99
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.290
you're a pillar. Is that when you off the moose fat yeah.

100
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.170
Gala moose, moose fat contains roughly 35,000 calories. Wow. Gone God,

101
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.530
a little Marine. You should get that in the little tent with you.

102
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.310
<v 1>Yeah, I really should have. I thought I would hear a bear coming,</v>

103
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:49.270
but didn't think Wolverine then the, uh, anyway,

104
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.100
he kept coming every day and I knew,

105
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.890
I knew it was going to be me or him kind of on that island.

106
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.260
<v 0>There's a scary little Fox.</v>

107
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.050
<v 1>I heard I, maybe you Jamie could find it, but that at one killed a.</v>

108
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.370
<v 0>Polar bear in the zoo a while ago. Yeah. I'm not shocked.</v>

109
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.630
<v 1>Or OSHA's little things.</v>

110
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.820
<v 0>Oh. They will always have them chasing bears off of kills wolves.</v>

111
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.210
All that was like, what the? [inaudible]. Yeah. And they're so durable. Like

112
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.043
 they get bit by bears and wolves and they just shake.

113
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.820
<v 1>It off. Cool animals for real. Yeah, man.</v>

114
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.160
<v 0>It's just a weird animal, right? It is so ferocious and.</v>

115
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.340
<v 1>Small. Yeah. Just making it on attitude out.</v>

116
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.020
<v 0>There. Anger liking.</v>

117
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.880
<v 1>A little muscle ball. Like when I eat him. Yeah. Of course. If you shoot a,</v>

118
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.080
well, I was actually killed it with my ax, but when you do that,

119
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.900
you've got to eat the heart out of it's like cut it open in the heart.

120
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.100
Then I ate a drumstick of course, but it tasted like skunk. So I was like,

121
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.420
I'll save the rest for a rainy.

122
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.800
<v 0>Day. Tastes like.</v>

123
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.140
<v 1>Just smelled of that was assuming now they have a musky flavor.</v>

124
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.560
<v 0>Oh, I'm sure gross animal. But imagine how much testosterone those little.</v>

125
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.620
<v 1>Course and the survey.</v>

126
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.680
<v 0>So you, uh, you ate his drumstick and that's.</v>

127
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.620
<v 1>Yeah. And the Oregon's for the vitamins. Did.</v>

128
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.320
<v 0>You try to use the rest of them for bait for something?</v>

129
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.380
<v 1>No, I was just saving it for eating later. You know,</v>

130
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.590
like I put it up on my store cash. Yeah. When it dark day I'll eat that.

131
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.920
<v 0>And you run out of moose and it does go a.</v>

132
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.000
<v 1>Year. Yeah, exactly.</v>

133
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.860
<v 0>So when you didn't have the fat, like what was it like just eating.</v>

134
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.250
Did you have some fat? Oh.

135
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.520
<v 1>I mean, to be fair, there's still a lot of fat on a moose, like was, uh,</v>

136
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.410
all the ribs, you know, the, but the rump has a big, old thick layer of fat.

137
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.350
You got the, it's a weird, the ma the bone marrow is, yeah.

138
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.770
That's all straight fat. The brain, you know, there's like,

139
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.840
there's a lot of fat still, but that was kind of the easiest fat,

140
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.310
you know, anyway. Yeah. It was, it was sad, but not the end of the world.

141
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.263
It was only,

142
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.780
it was mostly depressing and that I figured somebody else got something big.

143
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.630
And once I lose that, now I'm at a disadvantage again.

144
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:08.090
So then it put the fire under me to keep getting more.

145
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.930
<v 0>So you killed them with an ax, but you shot him on the boat first, right?</v>

146
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.970
<v 1>Yeah. The Wolverine yet. So what did.</v>

147
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.850
<v 0>You like pinned him to the ground with the boat? Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.050
<v 1>Yeah, it was, he had come the night before and I had seen him behind a Bush.</v>

149
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.861
And as you know,

150
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:25.400
I had my flashlight and I could see his eyes and I've thought about firing an

151
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:26.450
arrow in there, but I was like, oh,

152
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.540
surely he's going to come out and they'll get a better shot, but he must,

153
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.210
he like closed his eyes, snuck away.

154
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.000
And I never saw him leave from behind the Bush. I was like, dang it.

155
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:36.080
I missed my opportunity.

156
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.580
The next day I saw him again the next night coming down through some shrubs.

157
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.350
And, uh, I had like set up some warning systems around like cans on strings.

158
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:47.780
So I'd hear him coming. And I heard like blank, blank, blank. I was like,

159
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.110
oh gosh, I got my bow went outside. Sure enough. You'd like scurried down.

160
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:52.520
This hill went behind a Bush.

161
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.730
And I just sent my arrow in there this time and the Bush through the Bush.

162
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.560
And so I don't know what it did going through there,

163
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:02.280
but it deflected deflected branches. Yeah. Pinned his leg,

164
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.300
his back leg to the ground. Like top of the era was in the branches.

165
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.110
And it just gave me enough time to grab my ax run over there. He was just like,

166
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.630
you know, Zack video one, those little guys,

167
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.520
dude, you must've been so terrified so fast.

168
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.840
Yeah. It wasn't a cool, like you picture me like killing it, like really blah.

169
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.670
But it was like, no, it was,

170
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.600
it was to film all that too. Yeah. But it was at night.

171
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:34.830
So it's kind of grainy.
