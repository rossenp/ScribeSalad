<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 1>People that shouldn't be allowed to make eye contact with me that I'm,</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm having discourse with and online. Shouldn't be allowed to no, like, I mean,

4
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.600
just the cause you get in your head the way people, dude, I,

5
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:18.560
people like threatening, CRA, whatever the you hear, some, uh, uh, uh,

6
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.670
college speaker complain about 10 times over. I had coming at me from,

7
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:24.710
from I'm gonna rape and murder.

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.510
<v 2>Your niece. Well, let's, let's explain for most people that don't.</v>

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.790
<v 1>Know story. I did a terrible thing where I said, Hey, uh, if you get raps, uh,</v>

10
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.510
maybe go to the cops on the way to posting it on Facebook,

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.230
that UCB has determined guilt in a rape CA I nearly suggested hit.

12
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.900
<v 2>The brakes, hit the brakes. No one knows what the you're talking about.</v>

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.420
So let's just explain the story, dude. This car is so strong. It's very strong.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.780
I drink he's off the charts. No, I.

15
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.580
<v 1>Only had one and a quarter and it is strong. It's crank.</v>

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.340
I'm trying to counteract it with his indica.

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.980
<v 2>I just want, I want people to understand the story.</v>

18
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.380
There was a guy that was accused of rape and you had decided like they shouldn't

19
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:02.650
be tried in the court of public opinion on social media. Right.

20
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.450
And what you said is why, and you said.

21
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.490
<v 1>My friend, first of all, nots, always my friend, not somebody now,</v>

22
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.850
not even defending him, I'm I'm defending any, but like,

23
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.650
how is this cool that this is gonna be tried on Facebook?

24
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.730
Someone's sending around a message that so, and so has been found, uh, UCB,

25
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.120
the noted clown college has done an internal investigation, determined. So,

26
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:27.160
and so is guilty of rape. So if you have any information, come in,

27
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:27.994
that's on Facebook.

28
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.680
<v 2>Now, did they really say it that way?</v>

29
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.760
<v 1>It was first in an online woman group. Then it got leaked onto.</v>

30
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.720
<v 2>Regular Facebook, but is it,</v>

31
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:37.480
but is a representative of the UCB that said that they.

32
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.800
<v 1>Nob didn't it was some girl on her own.</v>

33
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.990
<v 2>I found out, well, that's a big friends, right?</v>

34
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.070
<v 1>Didn't under the umbrella of.</v>

35
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.230
<v 2>UCB. Did she do it under the UCB Twitter page or Facebook page? Rather? I.</v>

36
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.230
<v 1>Have no idea it was from Twitter or, or something. Well.</v>

37
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.030
<v 2>Whatever it is, I mean, she.</v>

38
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.550
<v 1>Could've just been from Mike. I, I saw it on Mike Chase's page.</v>

39
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.910
It wasn't even the thing I found.

40
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.870
<v 2>The problem is if you're saying the UCB did it and they didn't it's that's no,</v>

41
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.704
no, they did not. They.

42
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.630
<v 1>Did. They did not. But you.</v>

43
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.500
<v 2>Said, okay.</v>

44
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.520
<v 1>She said that.</v>

45
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.300
<v 2>She said that, but you said that UCB determined, right? That it was rape.</v>

46
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.140
<v 1>I saw a post that said that. Right. And this is from this from.</v>

47
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.020
<v 2>A person, but she said it, the UCB didn't say it.</v>

48
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.180
<v 1>No, it's not their official word.</v>

49
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.940
<v 2>At all. Right. Okay. So it's just a person. No.</v>

50
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.340
<v 1>Be very clear about that. Okay. Never claimed that. Right.</v>

51
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.890
It was a person who I think was like a rape counselor or something buddy,

52
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:25.650
to deal with. Like this there's a bunch of people. It was like.

53
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.730
<v 2>A rapy job. So something happened between improv, I guess, performers.</v>

54
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.170
Something happened between performers and this one guy was being accused and he

55
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:37.890
said, he just real simple without knowing who's guilty or not. Well,

56
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.090
you said he shouldn't be tried the.

57
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.410
<v 1>Public. He called here's what happened?</v>

58
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.010
A guy that opened for me somewhere was friends with him and go, Hey, can you,

59
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.000
he call you now first question, why call me? Right. Uh,

60
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.240
what am I a noted rape investigator on Facebook?

61
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.680
I think just because I was somebody that yelled and this is me not being aware

62
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:54.514
of what's building up.

63
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.080
I just yelled out on Facebook about stuff and I had a following.

64
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.240
So it's almost like a, oh, like, uh, uh,

65
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.560
can you talk to you and then throw your weight behind, you know,

66
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.640
I think it was like, but I'm, you know,

67
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.240
I didn't look at it as at Facebook like that. Like, it was like, not,

68
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.840
I didn't understand. &lt;laugh&gt; like how people were looking at my Facebook.

69
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.080
It's ridiculous. But anyway, I talked to the guy on the phone, uh, uh,

70
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.150
and he told me something my, I think was a lie. I mean, you know,

71
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:21.950
obviously I can't say one or the other, but looking back,

72
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.950
I think what he told me was a lie that, uh,

73
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.110
people were accusing him because he didn't book them on his show,

74
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.350
which just doesn't really make a lot of sense. That's.

75
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.390
<v 2>Comedy comedy.</v>

76
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.430
You imagine women with that quick to pull the trigger on a rape back.

77
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.870
He how evil they would have to be. Oh, he won't book me. He it. Right?

78
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.060
I mean like, do you crazy that.

79
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.860
<v 1>Accusation is I can believe they would be involved in comedy,</v>

80
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.740
but that many at once together it's like me light.

81
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.820
<v 2>Me at eight minutes. Uh, make it 10 or else we got a rape on our hands. Well,</v>

82
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.660
yeah, this is so crazy.

83
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.500
<v 1>But my point was, if this is guilty,</v>

84
00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:54.420
this is worse because what you've done is handed somebody, a lawsuit.

85
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.020
You can't defame someone like that. And it's like, like,

86
00:03:57.021 --> 00:03:59.220
you just get sued for that. And also this.

87
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.890
<v 2>Is, you have to be convicted before. You're allowed to say that like.</v>

88
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.810
<v 1>Legally, but to me, it's not. I mean,</v>

89
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.490
it's like they're taking the campus thing of like where we're gonna have a

90
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:11.130
college campus say kick you outta school for that rape you committed, dude.

91
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:11.940
What you said is.

92
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.690
<v 2>Undeniably talk over each other. I'm it's okay. But it's hard to, that's.</v>

93
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.171
<v 1>Not a punishment.</v>

94
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:19.330
That's not a punishment for rape is you get kicked outta school.

95
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.960
This is gender studies, trickling down into real life. Okay.

96
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.080
So the colleges, I assume, let, let that,

97
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.880
let that go on because they don't wanna be known as a school where your daughter

98
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.700
can get raped.

99
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.200
So they let these little groups pretend to have power and do a little tribunal

100
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.560
and then everybody's happy. But meanwhile, what a rape has got expelled,

101
00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:38.080
that's their punishment. Great job.

102
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.880
It sounds like the Catholic church transfer in people.

103
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.230
It doesn't sound any different. So this is someone to, so to me,

104
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.470
there was just like a garbage. If this guy's dangerous, go to the cops. Right?

105
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.710
So, so, uh, then I'm getting all this people coming to me about like,

106
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:55.710
don't you dare tell a victim to go. I don't know. You're a victim yet though.

107
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.030
That's the thing like when a victim says, you're a victim,

108
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.230
if you don't believe them, you're calling them a liar.

109
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.580
We have make sure you are a victim before we say eat one way or the other.

110
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.140
So we're getting ahead of ourselves. But, but this is just basic due process.

111
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.180
I guess the argument is because historically this is like the argument on coming

112
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:16.060
against me from &lt;inaudible&gt;, uh, historically women are not believed, uh,

113
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.660
which by the way, by who other women,

114
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.490
because what my experience is is any woman close to me that said she got raped.

115
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:25.930
I probably believe her. And every man, I know, in fact,

116
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.970
I know women that have get dudes into fights over like that.

117
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:31.650
Especially if you're in like white trash town where I grew up around,

118
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.530
like women are the ones that don't believe other women,

119
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.890
men are the only people stupid enough to believe women most of the time. Okay.

120
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.970
So that's already a thing that women aren't believed there's

121
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.120
Rosewood. Remember that that was cause a woman, a white woman was just believed.

122
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.760
And then there's a bunch of lynchings.

123
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.040
<v 2>Of black people. Well, I think there's gotta be instances.</v>

124
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:51.600
We should be very measured about this.

125
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.120
Cause there's gotta be instances in which women weren't believed,

126
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.360
of course like, but it doesn't.

127
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.280
<v 1>Matter a full spectrum. It.</v>

128
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.600
<v 2>Has nothing to do. The, the idea,</v>

129
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.520
the idea is that you can't believe him every time. Well, the larger point.

130
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.360
<v 1>Is you have to look at it as an individual case.</v>

131
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.960
Every case is individual and you look at it on it because that's fair.

132
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.800
It doesn't matter. Let's say no woman in history has ever lied about rape once.

133
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.400
Well, you still have to have due pros in case it happens once I'm not getting

134
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.870
sacrifice to the state for the good of the, you know what I mean?

135
00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:20.670
If that happens.

136
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.270
<v 2>To me and it does happen, it ha.</v>

137
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.830
<v 1>It's easier than you think it happens when you, uh, uh, have something to lose.</v>

138
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:27.470
Like you're famous. Well, how about.

139
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.350
<v 2>Custody case? A rape case? Yeah. And how many.</v>

140
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.270
<v 1>News stories of this going uncritically believed when, when, by the way,</v>

141
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:38.020
was someone not believed in the media and, and it turned out. I,

142
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.980
I see a lot of people getting believed who lied. None of it matters though,

143
00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:44.100
because like I said, that has no bearing on my individual.

144
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.660
Anything like if IM victim.

145
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.860
<v 2>We've, we have cleared double standards as like,</v>

146
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.460
when will just believe you and when will be.

147
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.980
<v 1>Super skeptical, you know, Barry, Barry Crimins like, cuz he, you know, he,</v>

148
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.700
if you haven't seen that documentary, anybody listened, uh, uh, uh,

149
00:06:56.701 --> 00:06:59.370
call me lucky. He's real. It's great. So I, cuz he,

150
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.490
cause that guy's kind of hero what he did with uh, uh, AOL. They, he basically,

151
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:07.050
he was raping, he was four, which, uh, uh, uh, I mean,

152
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:09.050
that's crazy what that would do to somebody. And he,

153
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.650
I think he told us talking about it on stage first or something.

154
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.210
And he ended up when, when the internet was first becoming, uh, uh, you know,

155
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:19.360
nationwide thing, he was, there was child pornography everywhere.

156
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:22.040
Like pedophiles would buy AOL by the hour,

157
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.160
if you were rich and you could just freely trade child pornography.

158
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.560
So he had to testify before, uh, Congress,

159
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.200
the Senate and AOL had a lawyer there cuz they didn't wanna change their policy,

160
00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:35.840
which was three strikes in you're out for child pornography. That's in the,

161
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.040
they actually with the straight phase,

162
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:39.590
like we have a firm three strike your out policy. Isn't.

163
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.310
<v 2>That crazy? That that was only like 1995 or 96 or something like that.</v>

164
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.111
<v 1>Wasn't it's dude,</v>

165
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:46.430
it's one of the best parts of the documentary because Barry's like,

166
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.830
well he told me, he is like, the guy says three strike. He goes, yeah, listen,

167
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.790
I love baseball too. But uh, &lt;laugh&gt; like, I love baseball more than anybody,

168
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.830
but, but they, they, uh,

169
00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.020
the senators Congressman were tripping over themselves in a manly display of

170
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.580
being ignorant of technology or something very like really is like a quotable

171
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:05.460
dude. Like the, she says, but they go, well,

172
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.460
I don't know what all this internet is. I just know the pornography is bad.

173
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.420
Like some of 'em didn't know where the they were.

174
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:16.300
Robert Bird is just like the Sage of pornography where here for the SCO

175
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.860
of pornography. And at one.

176
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.460
<v 3>Point in the doc he was talking about,</v>

177
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.490
it was almost like the other lawyer against him.

178
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:25.090
And it was who had better stage presence. &lt;laugh&gt; that's hilarious. Yeah.

179
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:27.170
Where he was just clearly a better speaker, like,

180
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.810
like this really expensive lawyer was just like a opener.

181
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.130
<v 1>And Barry's just such.</v>

182
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.130
<v 2>A, he performer and Barry got to talk. Yeah. And.</v>

183
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.770
<v 1>It was just over just test, you know,</v>

184
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.040
he went over his time or he went over his time. Barry did, they had to change.

185
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.000
But anyway, I, uh, I wrote to him, after that I saw the document. I was like,

186
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:47.240
wow, that guy is made.

187
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.360
<v 3>Man. I was like crying from that documentary.</v>

188
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.920
<v 1>Um, uh, well, anyway, so I don't know why that's okay. When the thanks, man.</v>

189
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.000
The, all that came down on me.

190
00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:58.400
People were going to Barry to get him to like denounce me.

191
00:08:58.401 --> 00:09:02.880
Like I hardly knew him. Yeah. So he called me up and uh, you know,

192
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.360
you have to realize a lot of this cuz he did real work, helping people,

193
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.440
rape victims, kids were building like Batman. Okay. And,

194
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.200
and basically he, this turf.

195
00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:16.630
If you're a feminist or whatever political thing, he goes,

196
00:09:16.631 --> 00:09:20.430
you understand this is turf to them. They don't give a about an actual victim.

197
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.270
So like it's, you know, you'll try to do something good or help someone.

198
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.430
And if you go to one of these groups,

199
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.270
they grab it and they use it as their little symbol or whatever.

200
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.390
It's never about an individual person.

201
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.630
I talked to this woman at some woman when the height of things coming down to me

202
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.700
for saying, go over to the cops and on Facebook. And always people like no,

203
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:39.900
like the system has failed. Well, you, I, I,

204
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.340
I don't know that you didn't go to the system.

205
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:43.460
So how do you know also you're a white woman. I,

206
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.980
I think it'll it'll but does this woman call me to, to, to be fair?

207
00:09:47.981 --> 00:09:50.460
This woman called me who, who wanted to, she wanted get in touch with me.

208
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.340
Some other creep inserted herself like some blogger check who initially

209
00:09:54.341 --> 00:09:57.570
basically they baited with these nonsense arguments. That's what I'm saying.

210
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.330
Watch on there because there nobody's talking to you on there,

211
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:02.170
like having a chat or there's what I learned.

212
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.370
They're they're baiting you to get you to say something that they can,

213
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:09.890
they can say, oh, I took down such. And so, and there's no,

214
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.930
I'm I'm I'm from this dumb cult. So I'm,

215
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:14.810
I'm sincerely interested in being a chatty. Cathy, me too,

216
00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:17.200
like a little and people, boy not sincere. They,

217
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.840
they wanna make a name for themselves, baiting you into doing something,

218
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.000
get you in trouble and they will with you as.

219
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.760
You can't believe you be in trouble for saying such as go to the police and not

220
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.120
Facebook if you're raped. So, so this woman called me in the thick of it.

221
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.440
I don't know her name still. Okay. Cuz she didn't really anything about me.

222
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:38.070
They're telling her I'm I'm a rape apologi with thank you for putting that next

223
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:42.150
to my name online for all time. I have now crazy. Just come pop up around.

224
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.670
It's just, it's just to put by.
