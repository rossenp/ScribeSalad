00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 2>But the diagnosis of addiction is really based on behaviors and can be briefly</v>

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.700
summarized as the four CS control, compulsion,

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.580
craving and consequences,

5
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.850
especially continued use despite consequences.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.860
<v 0>So like, what if you're a D like,</v>

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.070
I have friends that are addicted to golf and they just can't wait to go play

8
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:24.570
golf. What's the consequences.

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.960
<v 1>Well, it might be that their spouse says, gee whiz,</v>

10
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
why are you playing golf all the time? Maybe they just need a new spouse.

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.340
<v 0>Well.</v>

12
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
<v 1>Okay. Okay. So, so th this actually comes up a lot in clinical care.</v>

13
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.170
Like, to what extent is it? My problem.

14
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.820
And to what extent do I have to change my life? And I always say to patients,

15
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:49.290
you know, that is a great question and not one that I can answer for you,

16
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:50.430
but maybe together,

17
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:55.110
we can find the answer because the truth is sometimes it is a question of

18
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:59.880
needing to change your life. Right. And I wouldn't presume to necessarily know,

19
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.010
especially with cases on the border. Now,

20
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.910
there are certainly the border on the border of like, um, consequence,

21
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.150
pathological. Yeah. I mean, there are some cases where like, okay,

22
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.570
you don't need to be a psychiatrist to diagnose that this person has addiction,

23
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.840
right.

24
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.650
<v 0>It seems open to interpretation in the world of what you would call extreme</v>

25
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.690
winners, like the Michael Jordans of the world,

26
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.780
the people that are just absolutely completely obsessed with winning,

27
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.430
that seems like you could kind of call that an addiction,

28
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.930
but then they are the most celebrated people in all of the world. Right?

29
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.530
<v 1>So you're T you're tapping into something that is really important to talk</v>

30
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:34.801
about,

31
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:39.780
which is that our society rewards certain types of addictions and not

32
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:43.110
others. We, we, we certainly reward, uh,

33
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.120
professional athletes who have become obsessively focused on their sport.

34
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.460
Um, we certainly reward workaholics of all types. And again,

35
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.020
it's not to say that we,

36
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.850
we should pathologize all types of intensity

37
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.070
or all types of commitment to a behavior that that's not what it's

38
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:05.491
about.

39
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:09.780
But what I think is important is to recognize that the same mental machinery,

40
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.030
that approach and avoid behavior mediated by dopamine that is

41
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:17.490
at play when we become addicted to something,

42
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.530
can be at play really in all different aspects of our lives,

43
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:23.760
not just drugs and alcohol.

44
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.030
<v 0>So you're essentially looking at this very objectively.</v>

45
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.560
You're not making a judgment call.

46
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:31.260
You're just saying the same mechanism is in place,

47
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.340
whether it is extremely beneficial, like you are a Michael Jordan,

48
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.200
or whether extremely detrimental, like you're a person who's addicted to crack,

49
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.190
or you're a gambling addict who keeps blowing all their family's money.

50
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.420
It's kind of,

51
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.380
you're on the same human neurological pathway.

52
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.510
<v 1>That's exactly right. It's this,</v>

53
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.010
it's the same mental machinery that's being applied.

54
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.870
And again,

55
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:01.330
there are certain types of addictive behaviors that our society rewards,

56
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.430
but even in those cases,

57
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.930
I think it's important for people to really closely evaluate

58
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.700
potential, hidden consequences. And I feel like that's happening. I mean,

59
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:14.980
just using the example again, of, of athletes,

60
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.320
I feel like there are more and more and more,

61
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:22.180
there are athletes who are in different ways kind of questioning their

62
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:27.070
lifestyle or the things that they have to do. Um, you know,

63
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.851
which I think is good.

64
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.300
I think it's always good to look at the pros and cons basically. There's no,

65
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.630
there, there's never the light without the dark. You know, it's,

66
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:39.400
it's really that dialectic that comes into play really in all aspects of our

67
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.150
lives, which I think we need to talk about and, and think about.

68
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.920
<v 0>We ex we celebrate the people that are extreme winners. We,</v>

69
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:52.630
we celebrate the people that are absolutely completely obsessed with

70
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:57.460
performance, and they have everything dialed in, including their calories,

71
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.400
their macronutrients, the amount of sleep. They have,

72
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:04.600
the amount of recovery that they seek out, how they do it. Um,

73
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.130
but, but they have a massive reward for that. Right.

74
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:13.390
The massive reward is the glory of being a Michael Jordan or being a

75
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:18.310
Mike Tyson or being a sugar Ray Leonard or whoever it is at the peak of

76
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.620
their performance when they're on top of the world. Yeah.

77
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.110
There's a great deal of benefit to having

78
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.920
what many would just call extreme discipline? Yes.

79
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.570
So what's wrong with that?

80
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.423
<v 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.470
what we hear very little about is when that road comes to an end and

82
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.480
that escalating glory and reward dries up and what those people's

83
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:45.130
lives are like after that.

84
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.380
And my sense is that unless they've worked very hard to cultivate other

85
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:54.340
aspects of their personality, when that dopamine trail dries up,

86
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.300
because they get injured or they just age, um,

87
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.340
then they have to contend with, you know, the come down, um, you know, the,

88
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:07.540
the dopamine deficit state, not to mention all of the other aspects related to,

89
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.570
um, you know, loss of identity, you know, who am I,

90
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.960
if I'm not this person who's winning. And of course that's an old trope. I mean,

91
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.480
we know that, but we don't, we don't hear about those,

92
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.130
those athletes after that. The other thing I would say that, that, you know,

93
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.650
that you point out in that description,

94
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:27.910
which I think is also key to the process of becoming addicted is the ways in

95
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:32.680
which addiction is also about controlling and

96
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.900
changing the way we feel in the moment,

97
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.150
rather than tolerating the feelings or the uncertainty of what's next

98
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:43.450
and list, letting it wash over us. So a really key,

99
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.510
important aspect of what you call discipline,

100
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.640
but which I think in some contexts might be addiction is wanting to

101
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:55.360
control what we're feeling, you know, when we feel it.

102
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.420
And I think this is also deeply into modern life and modern culture.

103
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.560
<v 0>We explained that w wanting to control what we're feeling and when we feel it.</v>

104
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.290
And that's what separates discipline from addiction.

105
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.160
<v 1>No, I think, I think those are there's overlap there. So let me, let me go back.</v>

106
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.080
So part of,

107
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.210
part of what drives the phenomenon of addiction is that

108
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.490
people control what they feel when, when they feel it. So,

109
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:26.570
for example, you know, um, in this moment,

110
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:29.300
let's say I'm struggling, right?

111
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.900
But I feel like I can get through this because when this is over,

112
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.870
I'm not saying I'm struggling, but I mean, if I were, yeah,

113
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.890
but cause when this is over, I'm gonna reward myself with X, Y, and Z.

114
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.830
<v 0>If you go running and then afterwards you can have a slice of pizza.</v>

115
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.300
<v 1>That's right, exactly.</v>

116
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.220
So it's the way that we bracket our endeavors with rewards.

117
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.370
And this is just like deeply embedded into our culture.

118
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.000
And the control aspect is, is,

119
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.270
is a big part of the addictive aspect because I'm now going to control the way I

120
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:03.890
feel when I feel it, which is a very different way of living.

121
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:08.600
If you were to eliminate rewards as a way to

122
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:09.500
shape time,

123
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.000
if you were to think I'm not going to do anything to reward

124
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:18.740
myself today, I'm just going to get through the day.

125
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:23.090
It totally changes the arc of, of our experience in the moment.

126
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.090
Watch.
