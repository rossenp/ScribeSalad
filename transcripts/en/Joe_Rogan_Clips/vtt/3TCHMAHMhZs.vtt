00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 1>Experience, this, this, uh, Congressman, is that who it is? Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.600
The Jamie pointed this out that there's a Congressman and he released a series

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.720
of tweets. And the first letter of all these tweets,

5
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:14.481
if you put 'em all together,

6
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.760
it says Epstein didn't kill himself or did not kill himself. Is that what it is?

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.320
Didn't.

8
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.320
<v 0>Yeah, I think it's didn't he did. Uh, oh.</v>

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.390
<v 2>Yeah. How do you do the apostrophe?</v>

10
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.750
<v 1>Yeah. So he should have gone, did not starting here.</v>

11
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 0>With that evidence of a link in there.</v>

12
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.430
<v 1>Rep Paul Gosser. What are the odds that this guy did this accidentally really.</v>

13
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.313
<v 2>Small, right?</v>

14
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.510
That's kind of like one of those monkeys typing Shakespeare things. Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.030
I don't think it could, uh, it could work.

16
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.910
<v 1>I, and the thing is he did it backwards. Right?</v>

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.380
So you didn't see what the puzzle was until the last tweet,

18
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.820
because the last tweet is an E I got.

19
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.340
<v 0>A tweet from someone about 35 minutes ago that I don't know if there's a bunch</v>

20
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.620
of people online paying attention to it or what, but someone alerted me and.

21
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.380
<v 1>A few other people of it. What is he, does he have an image of that,</v>

22
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.170
that crazy mask? Is that in his too? Okay. He's a, might be.

23
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.210
<v 0>The H of the, he's got the, until that was November 1st.</v>

24
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.343
<v 2>The V mask.</v>

25
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.290
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. What is that mask again? What is that for? Vanetta?</v>

26
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:09.690
What was your representative of.

27
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 2>Something? It's the guy Fox mask.</v>

28
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.250
<v 1>Yes, that's right. That's right. Yeah. So this guy is, uh, he's,</v>

29
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.650
he's thinking along alternative lines of thought, but that is really, uh,

30
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:21.730
an interesting way of saying it. Ry that's called. Yeah.

31
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.880
Just making a bunch of tweets don't ever address it. Just leave it there.

32
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:27.160
Walk away it there. Yeah. Louis.

33
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.960
<v 2>Carol was famous for that. Was he? Yeah, that was one of, um, he,</v>

34
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.200
he did a lot of sort of tricks with words. Um, did you read the book go leach?

35
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.960
No. Yeah, there's, there's a whole,

36
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.600
whole bunch of stuff in there about people who used, um,

37
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.150
who put puzzles in text. Mm. You know, it's kind of a thing that,

38
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:47.470
that people did, I guess, back more in the 18th century and before, well.

39
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.910
<v 1>This Epstein case is probably the most blatant example</v>

40
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.590
of a public murder of,

41
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.150
of a crucial witness I've ever seen in my entire life or anybody's ever seen.

42
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.030
And the, the, the minimal amount of outrage about this,

43
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.620
the amount of cover it's fascinating. I.

44
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.300
<v 2>I mean, I, what's amazing to me just as a, you know,</v>

45
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.540
somebody works in the media is that this was shaping up to be the biggest,

46
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.620
like news story in history. Yes. And the instant, he, you know,

47
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.540
he died, uh, or was died or however you wanna call it. Yeah. Um,

48
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.970
it, the story just fell off the face of the earth.

49
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.970
It it's like nobody's doing anything about it. And I, I,

50
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:31.050
don't a hundred percent understand that. I mean, I get it. Why,

51
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.170
why that's happening, but it's, uh, it's just amazing.

52
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850
<v 1>Well, when the woman from ABC, what was her name? Amy.</v>

53
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.103
<v 2>Amy.</v>

54
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.930
<v 1>That lady, the, the one who yeah.</v>

55
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.160
Had the frustrated moment that she called it a frustrating private moment.

56
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.641
Right.

57
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:53.560
When she was talking about having the scoop and having that story and them

58
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.000
squashing it, right? Like this,

59
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.240
this is all stuff that everybody used to think was conspiracy.

60
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.880
Every everybody's think this was stoner talk. This was, you know, &lt;laugh&gt;,

61
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.480
you know what I mean? Like this is this stuff where people just delusional,

62
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.040
they believe all kinds of wacky conspiracies. Sure.

63
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.320
But the reality is much less complicated. Well, this is not possible.

64
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.000
This is one of those things. That's so obvious. It's so in everyone's face,

65
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.460
well.

66
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.390
<v 2>There's a couple things going on. Cuz there,</v>

67
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.070
there are many different ways than this can play out. I mean,

68
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.350
you could have a news director who just sort of instinctively decides, well,

69
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:31.150
we can't do that story because I might want to have will and CA on later,

70
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.110
or I might want to have this politician on later and it's,

71
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.150
it's not like anybody tells them necessarily that we can't do this,

72
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.080
but it decide.

73
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.060
<v 1>Too hot. You, if.</v>

74
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.420
<v 2>You grow up in this system and you've been in the, the business for a long time,</v>

75
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.353
you, you just,

76
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.060
you have all these things that are drilled into you at almost like the cellular

77
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.580
level about what you can and cannot get into. And um, I think there,

78
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:56.420
but there were some exp explicit things that happened with Epstein too. I mean,

79
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:56.901
they, there,

80
00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:00.330
there were a lot of news agencies that killed stories about him that, you know,

81
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:03.370
and we're hearing what some of them vanity fair of this thing, you know?

82
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.850
So yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's bad. It's.

83
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.730
<v 1>Terrible. Yeah. Yeah. When,</v>

84
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.410
when I found out that Clinton flew no less than 26 times

85
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.810
on a plane with Epstein, I was like, dude,

86
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.800
I haven't flown that many times with my mom &lt;laugh&gt; and right long did he know

87
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.510
Epstein?

88
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.760
<v 2>Yeah. I, I don't know,</v>

89
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.440
but I mean to have that many flights to have the secret service, uh,

90
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:29.960
people involved, I mean, that's incredibly bold. Uh, but what.

91
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.480
<v 1>Was he doing with just girls was, is, is,</v>

92
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.840
is Clinton that much of a hound that he would go that deep into the,

93
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.280
well that many times, 26 times? Well.

94
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.350
<v 2>That's the thing about the Epstein story that makes no sense to me. Like I,</v>

95
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.670
I thought that the percentage of people who were out and out like perverts who

96
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.150
had a, a serious problem, like with Pehi or whatever it was, was pretty small,

97
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.670
you know? Yeah. But you're,

98
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:58.790
but they had a lot of people coming in and out of this compound and,

99
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.740
and it just seems like it's a, it's a very strange story.

100
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.380
What were they really up to? I, I have no idea. And was,

101
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:08.380
was it all a black male scheme? It's just, it's just so strange. Well, it.

102
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.740
<v 1>Seems like the pedophilia aspect of it might be directly connected to Epstein</v>

103
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.820
himself.

104
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.460
Like he might be the one that has a problem with girls that are like 16 and he

105
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.380
likes them very young or he did like them, but with the other,

106
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.130
it could just be girls. It could be. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

107
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:29.370
that's why it's so crazy. Like how could it be that these, but maybe it's not.

108
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.330
<v 2>But they must, but they knew who he was. Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.170
<v 1>But they probably didn't know the extent of it.</v>

110
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.050
<v 2>Probably not. Yeah. Up until a point.</v>

111
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.970
<v 1>Up until he was arrested. Right. And then they're like, oh, well then,</v>

112
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:42.280
then that's when everybody backed off of him. Right, right.

113
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.480
<v 2>Yes. Yeah. I mean, I'm not a hundred percent. Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.440
I haven't covered this story in depth. I've only,

115
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.120
I only really got into it a little bit when we need you &lt;laugh&gt; we need you on

116
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:51.800
this one. You're.

117
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.633
<v 1>The guy.</v>

118
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.400
<v 2>This is a tough one. I mean, you know, cuz it mixes a lot of things that are,</v>

119
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.720
are very tough to cover. Yes. You know,

120
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.920
the intelligence world is very tough to cover mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, you know,

121
00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:04.800
it's, it's hard to get stories out of there that they don't want you to have.

122
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.160
Yeah. And this is, this is like the mother of all stories and you know,

123
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.520
in terms of that, and they're just little, little breadcrumbs here and there.

124
00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:16.400
That whole thing about Acosta, you know, the vanity, um, vanity fair,

125
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.790
a quote from him is that when he said that,

126
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.390
when he looked at the case that he didn't do it because I was told he belonged

127
00:06:24.391 --> 00:06:28.070
to intelligence. Yes. What does that mean? Right. You know, who's intelligence,

128
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:31.670
you know what I mean? Like what agency? Well, what for, you know, and then you,

129
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.670
you pair that with things like, you know, I,

130
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.950
I have friends on wall street who tell me, I've never heard, uh,

131
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.340
a single instance of this guy actually having a trade. Right. You know?

132
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.580
So what was his hedge fund doing? You know? I mean, if you think about it hedge,

133
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:45.660
fund's a perfect way to do blackmail, you know?

134
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.660
Cause you can just have people putting money in and out all the time and it

135
00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:54.140
would look like investment. Yeah. You know, so very strange story.

136
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.940
<v 1>Well, Eric Weinstein had a conversation with him, you know,</v>

137
00:06:56.941 --> 00:07:00.170
Eric Weinstein he's with Peter te capital, right? Yeah.

138
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.010
He's like this guy doesn't know what the he's talking about.

139
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.930
<v 2>Oh yeah. Like he's financially. Yeah. He's like, he's an actor.</v>

140
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.930
<v 1>Right. This is nonsense. Right, right.</v>

141
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.410
That his initial almost instantaneous response.

142
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.570
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and what real clients did he ever have? What did he,</v>

143
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:14.490
what did he trade in? What.

144
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.130
<v 1>What how's he got a billion dollars or whatever he had. Yeah. No.</v>

145
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.240
<v 2>It's a billion under management. Yeah. It's ridiculous. Why did the guy.</v>

146
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.480
<v 1>Who owns Victoria's secrets? Give him a $70 million home right.</v>

147
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.720
In New York city. Like what.

148
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.680
<v 2>I mean, these are all things that would've been really interesting to get into.</v>

149
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.120
You know, if he didn't, if he didn't, uh, try to kill himself twice,

150
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.480
the suicide didn't happen to him. Like in the wire fell. Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.270
<v 1>Unfortunate &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah. So unfortunately the cameras died,</v>

152
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.470
so unfortunately sustained an injury that's uh,

153
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.990
that you usually only get through strangulation. Right? Someone murders, you.

154
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.990
<v 2>He fell on the ground and accidentally broke his hyoid bone. Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:57.670
Happens all the time. Whatever. No big deal. I mean, it's so bizarre. I, I,

156
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.540
I can't stand cons spirit theories. I'm one of these people who,

157
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.420
who doesn't like reading it, but I can't,

158
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.620
I can't make this story work in a way that isn't, you know,

159
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.380
curatorial in something. Well, that's.

160
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.500
<v 1>The thing it's like, it gets to a point where you're like, okay,</v>

161
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.860
even Michael Shermer who runs skeptic magazine mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's like,

162
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.860
wait a minute. The cameras were not working. Yeah. I.

163
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.693
<v 2>Mean it's okay.</v>

164
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.850
<v 1>Seems a conspiracy when Michael Shermer says he,</v>

165
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:25.090
that guy doesn't believe in anything. Right. Right. I mean,

166
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:29.770
he is he's down the line on virtually every single thing that's ever happened.

167
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.490
He doesn't believe in any conspiracies. Well.

168
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.530
<v 2>Well, how do you, what's the innocent explanation for any of this? Cause none,</v>

169
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:36.970
it doesn't make any sense. You can't,

170
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.560
you can't spin it in any way to make it not a re a, a crazy conspiracy,

171
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.320
especially.

172
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.680
<v 1>When the, the brother hires a doctor to do an autopsy and oh yeah.</v>

173
00:08:46.681 --> 00:08:49.560
Doctor says like this, this guy was murdered, right? Yeah. Michael,

174
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.480
Baen the famous guy from the HBO autopsy show.

175
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.200
<v 2>Right? Yep. Absolutely. And craziness, complete craziness.</v>

176
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.040
And you know, it's, it's an example of, of, um, you know,

177
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.120
the Epstein.

178
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.040
Story's interesting because it's because it's about villains on both sides of

179
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:08.400
the aisle, right? Yeah. This is the classic.

180
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:11.920
This is something I've written about before that the press does not like to do

181
00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:16.430
stories where the problem is bipartisan. Yes. Right.

182
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.110
So when you have an institutional problem,

183
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.230
when Democrats and Republicans both share responsibility for it,

184
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.750
when you know, or, or if it's an institution that kind of exists in perpetuity,

185
00:09:26.751 --> 00:09:29.670
no matter what the administration is, we don't really like to do those stories.

186
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.390
We like, if Fox likes to do stories about Democrats,

187
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.940
MSNBC likes to do stories about Republican LIS, but the,

188
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.540
the thing that's kind of, you know, all over the place,

189
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:41.180
they don't like to do that story Epstein is, you know, he's,

190
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:43.820
he's friends with Trump and, and with Clinton, I mean,

191
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.700
it looks like he has more friends on the Clinton side, but still,

192
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.901
and I think that's,

193
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:51.940
this is one of the reasons why this story doesn't have a lot of traction in the

194
00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:56.410
media because neither side really likes the idea of going too deeply on.

195
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.210
It feels like.

196
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.850
<v 1>To me well it's, but the, the, the blatant aspect of it,</v>

197
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.130
the only, I mean, the closest that we have to that is absolute murder.

198
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.330
The Jamal Khashoggi murder. That's the closest thing we have to,

199
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:12.130
or it's absolute murder, right. This one, but,

200
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.290
but it's also so insanely blatant,

201
00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:17.240
but now you have foreign actors that are involved it and they all disperse,

202
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:21.160
and then there's left with this confusion of, to who's responsible for it.

203
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.480
<v 2>Well, Saudi Arabia, that's another example where you can't really say it's,</v>

204
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.960
you know, one side of the,

205
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.080
both parties have been incredibly complicit in their cooperation with yeah.

206
00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:35.680
The Saudi regime and in, you know, in the massacres that are going on in Yemen,

207
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.430
uh, it's a classic example of what no Chomsky used to talk about with worthy and

208
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:44.830
unworthy victims, right? Like if the Soviet communist did it, they were,

209
00:10:44.831 --> 00:10:45.664
that was bad.

210
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.070
But if death squads and El Salvador killed a priest or a Catholic priest,

211
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.790
you know, then that, that was something we didn't write about.

212
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.070
Cuz they were our client date.

213
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.900
Yemen is a story we don't write about Syria is a story we do write about,

214
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.740
but they're really equivalent stories. And um, you know, the,

215
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.980
but you're absolutely right. The Khashoggi thing, I,

216
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.740
I don't think either party and or either sides,

217
00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:10.020
media really wants to get into that. All that deeply.
