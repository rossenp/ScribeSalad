00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:07.260
I'm the one that would break into Joe Rogan's house and steal one shoe to

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:09.770
somebody. You take an ounce of cocaine.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.990
<v 1>You steal one shoe, horrible. Oh, that's horrible. And then,</v>

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.310
then you steal that.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.310
<v 0>One favorite pair of shoe. You take one shoe and you throw it away.</v>

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.730
That destroys people psychologically for years.

8
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.260
They'll keep looking for that one shoe. What happened?

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.630
And then every time you see him, you'll find that shoe. No, I search them.

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.370
I'm the dirtiest bastard. I know how to flip flop.

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.680
<v 2>Yet. So these guys get you in inner interrogate.</v>

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.080
<v 0>Me into the interview room and they asked me what's going on?</v>

13
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.150
And I'm talking to them like, well, I don't know what happened.

14
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.950
The guy showed up, the guy pulled the gun. Next thing you know, I was home.

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.380
And they're like, so what happened to the guy with the machine gun?

16
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.730
I don't know. Did you know him? I don't know. You know?

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.110
So how did you get there? I had a bike. Well, you just said you drove. Yeah.

18
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.440
I drove to get the bike to, I was just with them.

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.620
Cause I wanted to get out because Don Johnson was married.

20
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.030
Sheila Easton on Miami vice that night I had to be home by nine that's.

21
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:09.570
All I cared about was his wedding. So I'm with the cops. I'm like,

22
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.870
I'm just going to go in there and talk to them. Tell them the truth that, yeah,

23
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
I went over there. They was selling drugs and my left. I had nothing to do.

24
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.860
What kidnapped, what are you talking about?

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
So we went back and forth like six hours and I still remember them sitting

26
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.710
there, like with their hands down and me talking about like, you know,

27
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:33.450
my uncle came from Cuba in 1952 and he worked for this guy.

28
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.560
And they're like, what's this got to do with what we're talking about dog.

29
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.423
I told him,

30
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.490
and then I agreed to give the guy information and I would just give him

31
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:46.020
like red bands, drivers.

32
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.900
<v 1>Pre, and I would give.</v>

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.810
<v 0>Him Jamie's license. Like Jamie's not a drug dealer,</v>

34
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.100
but I would tell him that Jamie was running kilos internationally from Europe.

35
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.580
They would, they would go through Jamie's life.

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.580
Imagine if Jamie was doing that and then they wouldn't find nothing.

37
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.080
So they would figure out the Jamie. I was playing them.

38
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.510
I was just giving them fake license plates. How long did you do this?

39
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:13.240
For six months. They thought they would leave the real, this,

40
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:16.110
this guy telling me he runs a big Coke from Colombia.

41
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.020
He knows the Choa brothers know? Yeah.

42
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.400
<v 2>So you were just making up this crazy narrative of yokels.</v>

43
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.750
<v 0>It was tormenting these two cops, but the one cop wasn't going for it.</v>

44
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:30.100
He didn't like me personally. I don't let him know that.

45
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:33.020
I didn't like him personally. It's a movie. It was a fire.

46
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.900
<v 1>Let him know. I hate him more than what he.</v>

47
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.400
<v 0>Hated me. That's what I did. I let him know that I hate him more.</v>

48
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.490
And every time we went to court, he would sit there across from me.

49
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.310
But I had to go to attorney and it was burning him up.

50
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.430
Cause he wanted me for kidnapping. But I'm like, not dog.

51
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.290
You didn't find no fingerprints on nothing. Sorry, Charlie, not this time.

52
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.513
You are.

53
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.280
<v 2>A man who has done one of the most difficult things a person could do.</v>

54
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.230
He lost a of.

55
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.880
<v 3>Weight. Yeah. And then maintain. Keep, yeah. That's harder.</v>

56
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.740
<v 2>Right? That's the hard part. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:07.650
The momentum of losing the weight is good, but most people,

58
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.620
they get to a point and they want to take a break and then once they take a

59
00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:13.020
break, then it all slides. Yeah.

60
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.030
<v 3>It's a bit of both. Sometimes I want to take a break,</v>

61
00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:19.470
but then I want to get to that next level. So then next get back on it. We're.

62
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.840
<v 2>Talking about Gucci mane before we start a podcast.</v>

63
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.010
Gucci is the guy who's done that. Yes. He's maintained and looks amazing.

64
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.510
He was a big fella at one point in time when he had bird tattooed on his face.

65
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.003
<v 3>And ice cream cone.</v>

66
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.930
<v 2>And now he's shredded. Yeah. Ice cream.</v>

67
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.450
<v 3>Well you were saying it was lean, right? Yeah. For sure. Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.070
Coding will play a lot of weight on.

69
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.500
<v 2>It. The difference, man. That is crazy. Well, he wasn't.</v>

70
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.810
<v 3>Too fat. Yeah. That's like, yeah.</v>

71
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.240
That's kind of like him mid losing weight and that one,

72
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.910
you can find some real chunky picture of him.

73
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.240
<v 4>Yeah. He got sick. Yeah, yeah.</v>

74
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.630
<v 3>Yeah. Me and my wife all the time, we look at him and his wife, the pictures,</v>

75
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:06.930
they take what they do and I'm like, I want to hit in that direction.

76
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.120
<v 5>What do you do for working out? I.</v>

77
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.360
<v 3>Had my trainer about three days a week, sometimes two days a week.</v>

78
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:14.550
And then on top of that and we'll do, you know,

79
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.080
just different circuits back chest, you know, whatever, whatever legs.

80
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.090
And then, um, I didn't the other days,

81
00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:24.300
I'm always just trying to make sure I hit the treadmill twice a day for two

82
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:27.750
miles on an incline. Yeah. Really? You do it twice a day. Yeah.

83
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.960
In the morning and night I don't do much otherwise. So you know, all,

84
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.890
especially now a lot of my stuff is sitting in front of a computer,

85
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.660
podcasting playing games on Twitch and stuff like that. So I feel like, oh,

86
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.610
I'm going to spend that long. I got to start today. Treadmill end the day.

87
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.790
Treadmill. That's discipline. I like that. It is. I hate it. So.

88
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.350
<v 1>Definitely. But you liked the results. Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.630
<v 3>I like how it feels like the compliments, you know,</v>

90
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:57.180
I was just doing this thing the other day and um, uh,

91
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.660
Jake Johnson and the guy from new girl, I'm in a cartoon with him and like,

92
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.540
that's like, you know, he's like a leading man dream Bodhi guy.

93
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.450
And he's looking at me. He's like, man, he's like, you're looking good, man.

94
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.150
You just got your together. You're going to get about, to lead your own show.

95
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:10.980
And I hear like that. And I'm like, okay,

96
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.480
I better go get on that treadmill again. Yeah. Yeah. That helps. Right.

97
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.980
It really does. Yeah. The.

98
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.350
<v 2>Positive feedback and positive energy.</v>

99
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.890
That's one thing that I like about what you do. You are very positive.

100
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:27.330
Like you're, you're very warm and friendly. Like all the that you do online,

101
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.860
you're all smiling, positive and friendly. It's cool. It's got,

102
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.090
it gives off a good vibe.

103
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.660
Like when I look at your Instagram posts or read something that you post it's

104
00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:39.210
like Ron is on the good path.

105
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.630
<v 1>People have a very poor judge of character. She doesn't seem nice.</v>

106
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:47.040
It seems forced people that are like that all the time. It doesn't seem nice.

107
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.890
It's very forced and whatever. You're allowed to be a, right.

108
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:50.610
You're allowed to be a.

109
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.070
You're allowed to be nasty to people you're accomplished or comedian.

110
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.700
You did the whole thing. What you're not allowed to do, um,

111
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.760
is Guantanamo bay situation in the backstage of your

112
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.610
show where everybody's walking around afraid for their life.

113
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.570
And it's like Abu Ghraib where they're hooked up to wires and they have like,

114
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.470
yeah, she's got dogs and birds. If an intern's late, they have a hood on.

115
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.760
I don't support that.

116
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.340
<v 2>That's just me. Yeah. Yeah. I'm with you. Yeah. I mean, you know,</v>

117
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.270
I wish you the best.

118
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.680
<v 1>Around for too long course. All these people walk away.</v>

119
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:25.330
You've been famous forever. Walk away.

120
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.510
Like eventually everybody they're just going to figure it out.

121
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.350
Now Fallon's on an apology door, apology tour because of the black face. Like,

122
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.910
is he, well, he was like,

123
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:36.160
he had to go around and apologize a million times for like,

124
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.420
they're going to find the thing. If you don't go away, you gotta,

125
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.430
you gotta have a good run. And then we have a good run.

126
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:45.700
You step back and you go, okay, I'm still gonna do my thing. But like, I'm not.

127
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.210
I mean, there's only a few jobs in entertainment. Right? Right.

128
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.380
So I think a lot of the cancel culture is probably these want those jobs. Ooh.

129
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.170
They're like, how long has this pitch going to be dancing?

130
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.760
I can dance with Hillary Clinton.

131
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.030
I could do the Charleston with Henry Kissinger or whatever the she does out

132
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.960
there. The Charleston, she goes out there to the Charleston, has got war,

133
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:08.680
criminals, her and push her jumping around. I mean, she was buddies with Bush.

134
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.970
Oh, Steven in paddock. And do not ask me for sources, but at the Stephen,

135
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.830
Stephen paddock who's that he was the guy that shot up the Vegas

136
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.130
concert. That was a very tragic thing. Listen to this.

137
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.710
The only guy that saw Stephen paddock alive, his name is Hayes.

138
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.020
Hazy was compost. He was a guard at Mandalay bay.

139
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.180
He got interviewed nowhere else.

140
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:35.020
You know where he got interviewed in the beginning, Ellen, Ellen, really weird.

141
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.270
And then they went on. If you could find that clip,

142
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.800
they went on with a weird like diagram of how it happened in Ellen's like

143
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:44.860
showing the people. I would not like an emotional, like, how are you feeling?

144
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:47.350
How are you holding up? It was a weird diagram of like,

145
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.090
and then he went to the left and to the right.

146
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.980
It was very strange to look what the hell's going on. This is a daytime show,

147
00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:54.280
which.

148
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.290
<v 2>Is the paddock guy. And there's two guys.</v>

149
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.490
<v 1>In the chubby. Your guy is the hazy sky. And now Ellen is doing a doc thing of,</v>

150
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.870
of how the shooting happened.

151
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.200
<v 2>Yeah. Like an antenna from someone's Buick that she's passed out,</v>

152
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:07.600
which is usually as a pointer. Why the hell.

153
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.630
<v 1>Is this happening on like a daytime show where she did, this is weird.</v>

154
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.090
Where'd she get that pointer? She stole it off.

155
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.800
She stole it off an intern's car.

156
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.440
<v 2>You just use your finger. Like if that was you,</v>

157
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.330
if it was your show at the time Dylan show, when you just point. Yeah.

158
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.410
<v 6>This is also a giant screen behind her.</v>

159
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.810
So they could just put it on that screen. But she's.

160
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.600
<v 1>Using it. This, I find it very strange. I don't know.</v>

161
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.030
<v 2>Why I'm in it. Those aren't real Palm trees. No. Yeah.</v>

162
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.790
<v 1>I know that street though. I know that block.</v>

163
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.700
<v 2>Beverly Hills, that she is fired up the vape.</v>

164
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.860
Is that the vape cigarettes to Juul.

165
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.500
<v 7>And camels coffee and a smoothie. I wasn't sure what to expect.</v>

166
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.750
<v 2>What would you, what, what was your worst case scenario?</v>

167
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.050
<v 7>Oh my God. Worst case scenario. I pooped my pants right off the bat.</v>

168
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.410
Have you done that before? Like when you get nervous? Not when I get nervous,

169
00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:57.780
but I used to well want in college, you poop your pants. Yeah, I was,

170
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.790
yeah. I was hung over. I Chipola, I enjoy poli pretty much every day in college.

171
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.350
That's not good for, it was not good at all. Yeah.

172
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.170
<v 2>Actually Chipotle like those bowls, they are pretty good.</v>

173
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.470
Like if you get like one of those steak bowls with rice,

174
00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:13.760
like that's about as clean.

175
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.080
<v 7>As you can eat. Yeah.</v>

176
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.430
And in college it was nice because you could eat like half of a bowl and be like

177
00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:21.770
super full and then eat the other half later.

178
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.180
And you can do the tricks of getting half steak, half chicken or something.

179
00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:29.090
That way they give you more. Oh, is that a trick? I don't think it is a trick.

180
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:31.490
I think they have like a scooper. They have a scooper,

181
00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:34.460
but if you say you want half this and half that,

182
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.290
they're not going to put half in the scooper.

183
00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:37.880
They're putting a full scooper in there.

184
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.630
And then you're getting a full pooper on the couch and college. Yeah.

185
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.080
<v 4>Sorry to hear about the poop and the pants. All right. People.</v>

186
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.570
<v 2>Are very embarrassed about that, but it does happen if you take chances.</v>

187
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.290
<v 7>I feel like it happens to every, everyone has a poop story. I hope if.</v>

188
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.110
<v 2>You don't, I feel like you just not taking enough chances with your.</v>

189
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.380
<v 7>Diet. And it's like, I think everyone's poop.</v>

190
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:00.200
Story starts out with them being like, oh, I thought I was going to fart.

191
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.540
And then it was not. Yeah, that's in the car. That's when it happens, honestly,

192
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:09.170
on the drive up here, I, I had a little bit of gas and I was like,

193
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.000
just wait until you're there.

194
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:15.560
Hold it because you don't want to take any risks right now. So I,

195
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.140
you know, it actually worked out. I, I let it out.

196
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.380
<v 2>There was a podcast once where I legitimately thought,</v>

197
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:23.870
do you remember who it was a religion. He thought I was going to. My pants.

198
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:29.210
I was like pinching my, my abs down. I was crunching myself. Like,

199
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.130
listen, if I don't get out of here right now,

200
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.680
I don't know if I'm going to make it. I don't remember who it was,

201
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.780
but I might even set it on the air.

202
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.050
<v 6>I remember it happening, but I don't remember who was in the room.</v>

203
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.980
I barely got out.

204
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.670
<v 7>It's kind of a nice feeling though. I liked that. Like adrenaline rush of like,</v>

205
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.780
I need to hold, like, it really tests my skills.

206
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.550
<v 2>Cramming for a test. Like, oh my God, there's not much.</v>

207
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.160
<v 7>Time left. Yeah. I dropped out of college. So like,</v>

208
00:10:52.161 --> 00:10:56.780
I feel like me trying to hold in a poop is the most cramming for a test.

209
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:57.800
I feel like I did. Why.

210
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.320
<v 2>Did that is a psychological thing. The cramming thing.</v>

211
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.160
They say that some people like procrastinate until they know they just,

212
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:07.880
they have to like, okay, I'm going to stay up all night. I'm a procrastinator.

213
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.280
Yeah.
