00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.520
And so this strength and conditioning coach that you've been working with from

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:09.960
the beginning, give us, like, what is a regular routine for you?

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.210
Like what kind of does he have? Uh, Dr. Peak. Okay. So we just, um.

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.100
<v 1>We started getting back in there, um, literally last week.</v>

6
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.550
So.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.680
<v 0>He took a little time off. How's it? How's your hand?</v>

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.150
<v 1>That's the thing I free. I went and now the doctor's going, gonna hate me for.</v>

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.430
<v 2>That. So I had a cast.</v>

10
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.570
<v 1>On, so then I go to Vegas and, um, and I talked to the doctors,</v>

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.820
you know, the UC doc and those guys in Vegas and you know, it's not broken,

12
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.340
you know, it's just, uh, an issue with the ligaments.

13
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.190
You can see it seeing this right hand right here at the bottom of thumb.

14
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:45.800
You could clearly see the ligaments and all working there,

15
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.590
but then here there's that bump in between.

16
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.910
So they don't come out as much and that's causing me. I don't have,

17
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.360
I didn't have, I don't have the strength, like, you know, being able to pull.

18
00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.740
And this is a big part of my game is if I get around you, I get a body lock.

19
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:02.870
I don't care what you're doing. You're just not getting me off.

20
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.070
I just I've spent years just working on that grip to where you just not,

21
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.590
are you not letting me off until I let off?

22
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.820
And so now not being able to do that, but it's, it's healing fast.

23
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.880
And I was in Vegas and the doctor's like,

24
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.890
we can just cut the cast off and make you a hard removable one that I can take

25
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:24.020
off on and off. So I can shower,

26
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.170
because that was the thing you stuck in this cast for four weeks,

27
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.930
you can't really shower with it. You got to shower with your arm up in.

28
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.430
<v 0>The air, on your handstand.</v>

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.340
<v 1>Itches. And you got just stick stuff in there. And psychologically,</v>

30
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.950
I started getting a little anxiety with it too, cause it's like,

31
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.420
can't get this thing off my hand.

32
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.870
<v 2>So sometimes I'm laying there.</v>

33
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.330
I'm just like one it off of my hand and I can't get it off.

34
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.280
<v 0>So is it a ligament tear?</v>

35
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.830
<v 1>Is that what? It's not a tear. They, they, um,</v>

36
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.880
they thought it was a tear at the bottom, but no strength is coming back.

37
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.130
So it was a slowly, yeah,

38
00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:01.310
it was like a really bad strain in that that bumper is still there for some

39
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.610
reason. So we're, we're working on it, I'm doing everything right.

40
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:07.310
And no fracture, which is good news. So I don't have to be out for.

41
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.800
<v 0>Too long. Yeah. Yeah. Because you sent me the tape of like,</v>

42
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.690
when you hurt in training, see it like, so it was one of those things where you,

43
00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:16.490
you hit with the thumb. I, yeah, I hit it with my phone. Cause.

44
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.470
<v 1>You know, when you got those big gloves on, you know,</v>

45
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:22.280
you can't really make a full fist. Right. Especially when you have wraps,

46
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:25.460
so your hands kind of in there like this, so you throw a punch the wrong way,

47
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.220
or somebody comes into your own way. It's like, boom, you heard it. Yeah.

48
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.660
So I heard it at one of my gosh, what am I going to do now? You know?

49
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:35.720
So now everything's going through my head. I got this guy that's been talking.

50
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.210
<v 2>For years. And everybody in the world is telling me, you have to kill this guy.</v>

51
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.900
You can't be the, you can't lose to him. So now I'm.

52
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.970
<v 1>Going through all this in my mind though, I can't be that guy.</v>

53
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.690
I can't lose to that guy. I can't lose to that guy. And then it's like,

54
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.630
then I'm like, okay, no, it feels a little better. I'm going,

55
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.020
I'm going to spar hard. So I start sparring, boom, right away, hurt it again.

56
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.320
And I, a couple of times almost cry.

57
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 0>And you're getting a taped up part time. So getting a taped up even.</v>

58
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.180
<v 1>So it's still hurting. But then it gets to a point where I'm just like,</v>

59
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.270
you got to block it out. You know, fights to fight. I got to block it out.

60
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:14.790
So I'm going to dress your room and train and everything's okay. I block it out.

61
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.780
Not even thinking about it and thinking about going to work.

62
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.850
And then I get in there and first round, I don't even remember.

63
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.230
I just remember throwing it. Boom. Something's wrong. Oh. And I'm just like,

64
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.470
okay, play it off, play it off. And then prostate Colby, like, you know,

65
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:28.900
he comes on and he's, you know.

66
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.710
<v 2>He's doing his job. He's fighting me. He's in there landed strikes.</v>

67
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.544
And I'm like.

68
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.120
<v 1>Okay. You know, but at,</v>

69
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.500
at some point I never thought I'm going to lose this fight because I never think

70
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.660
like that. It's like, oh, I'm not going to lose this fight.

71
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.320
Even if something's not going my way, I just I'm going to adapt.

72
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.500
<v 0>Wasn't it like on the,</v>

73
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.430
the score cards at the end of the fight were very close. Yeah.

74
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.583
I, I.

75
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.360
<v 1>I knew it was close. Uh, I would, uh, cause it, for the first time ever,</v>

76
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.140
I asked my coaches, did I win that round?

77
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.740
I've never in my career done that. I'm the type of guy.

78
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.910
Even when I was wrestling album,

79
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:11.670
the red type of wrestler who I like to run up the scoreboard.

80
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.780
I don't like the live and leave any doubt that I won that round.

81
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.630
I'm going to dominate that round. I'm going to make sure I won. So in my head,

82
00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:21.960
I know I want, I don't need to ask for the first time in my career,

83
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:26.580
I went back to my, I went around that went around. But I,

84
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.600
even by me asking that I never thought, oh, I'm not going to finish this fight.

85
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.800
I always knew I was going to finish the fight. But I just was like, I was,

86
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.340
did I win that, that I win that, you know, I don't know why.

87
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:40.560
I don't know how or what, what was going on in my head.

88
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:44.490
But for some reason I asked, I was asking, so I knew the fight was close.

89
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.910
It wasn't.

90
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.920
<v 0>Good fight, man. It was a good fight.</v>

91
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.550
The thing about Colby is he tricks you into thinking.

92
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:55.410
He sucks because he's got a goofy suit on and he talks crazy.

93
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:58.860
And you know, he wears the maggot hat and all that stuff. But,

94
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.050
but then if you didn't see any of that,

95
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.190
if you just watched him fight you like that puts up pace on people. What?

96
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:07.830
He did a Robbie Lawler. I was like, good Lord.

97
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:11.760
Like nobody does that to Robbie Lawler. Like he put a pace on him.

98
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.360
He just stayed on him. Like guys have wrestled him before Robbie, you know,

99
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:18.660
like got a hold of them, dragged him down and tried to make it a, you know,

100
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:22.530
a stick, you know, try to stall them out. That's not what Colby did.

101
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:25.290
Colby just stuck on them like glue and just put that pace on him.

102
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.160
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, he really, he really, he really showed, you know,</v>

103
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.880
like how good he is. And I mean, I'm, I, I give respect to respect to you.

104
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:35.670
I'm not, I'm no hater. You know, I know this kid could fight.

105
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.460
I know he was good. I knew he was tough. And I knew he was a competitor as well.

106
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:39.810
He's always been a competitor.

107
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.780
I knew guys that weren't wrestling teams with this guy, you know,

108
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:45.090
besides John Jones, I knew other guys, you know,

109
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:47.370
that I'm good friends with that wrestled with him.

110
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.090
So I've always known that he was a competitor that he was going to come out and

111
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:54.750
try to compete, you know, but I, like I said, I, I just mentally,

112
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.220
I think I'm just on a different than these guys.

113
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:01.850
Just because everything that I've been through that I've done in my life has

114
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.880
shaped me into the man that I am so mentally I'm,

115
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.970
I'm just on a different level than him. Well, you have to have that attitude.

116
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.970
Right? Yeah. And I just, I felt it.

117
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.320
I knew it and I felt it even, and now so more so than ever,

118
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.490
because now you've.

119
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.230
<v 2>Got all the fans, but you know, on what he's got his fans,</v>

120
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.860
you've got, everyone has fans that are going to talk.

121
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.670
<v 0>Well, there was the first time that you had a close fight in the UFC,</v>

122
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.210
which is kind of crazy. I mean, you think about your career. It's pretty nuts.

123
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.780
I mean,

124
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.930
you win the title over one of the best welterweights of all time at Tyron

125
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:41.110
Woodley and you just dominate him. Right. You think about all the other guys,

126
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.320
Dosantos all those guys you smashed and wa I mean, that's,

127
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.180
you had a crazy run up to the title and then a crazy title winning

128
00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:53.680
effort. And then this was the first time we saw you in like a very close fight.

129
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.100
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, uh, a test to him too,</v>

130
00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:00.490
like he's a tough guy at the end of the day, you know,

131
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.170
to make fantastic fights.

132
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:06.280
You gotta have the right dance partner and Frazier needed Ali.

133
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.550
We need each other. And he was the right dance partner.

134
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.050
And to be honest with you, you know,

135
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.980
if I didn't take too much out of him because each fight takes something from

136
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:18.820
you, you know, internally. So if I didn't take too much from him,

137
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.060
I think I might see him again, to be honest, because like,

138
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.680
it's clear that we are the two best guys in the division. And so, yeah. I mean,

139
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.230
I look forward to seeing them again. I think.

140
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.940
<v 0>You guys will see each other again. Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.330
And some guys get really wrapped up in the fear.

142
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.360
<v 1>Of looking bad. Yes. The looking.</v>

143
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.390
<v 0>Bad is just like hanging over their head. I'm about to get knocked out.</v>

144
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:44.050
Everyone's going to laugh. Um, that's very fun of me. They're going to with me.

145
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.630
<v 2>That's very rude. Can you imagine me losing a Colby come attention? Ooh.</v>

146
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.860
<v 0>That would have been the biggest one, right? It was so much. Oh my God.</v>

147
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:54.550
It was so.

148
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.900
<v 1>Bad. Ma I'm telling you I'm in different cars and I mean, Abu Dhabi.</v>

149
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:01.870
People run them to me in the mall, man. I can't wait for you to kill this car.

150
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.710
I go, I'm in Brazil. Oh my God. I can't wait for you to kill this guy.

151
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.180
I'm in Dominican Republic. They can't even speak English, but they're like,

152
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.920
I can't wait for you to chill bro everywhere.

153
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:19.420
So I can imagine me going out there and what I was feeling

154
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.120
I had to really, I took advice from Rashad.

155
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.100
I had to really make friends with that, feeling it and accept it. Well, man,

156
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.280
at the weigh-ins when Susie painted the Nigerian.

157
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.060
<v 0>Flag on your face and you're staring them down and you just had this big smile</v>

158
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:37.690
on your face, you look so calm. And I was like that, guy's ready.

159
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.520
But you were so composed at the way. And I was like, there's no.

160
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.060
There was no you. There was no, no emotions.

161
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:47.800
You just had a big smile on your face.

162
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.640
<v 1>Yeah. Um, I mean, it's, uh, at some point you get to the word,</v>

163
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.130
it's no longer the talk and like, nah, I get it.

164
00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:56.550
You got to sell a fight and there, you know, this and that,

165
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.250
but I try to stay as true to myself as possible.

166
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.280
Like obviously I understand people want to be entertaining and I'm going to do

167
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:06.750
the best that I can now of selling a fight without going too far out of

168
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.730
myself. But when that,

169
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.780
when that contract is signed and I know that I have to go in there and take care

170
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:15.270
of business, there's no more of that. Like I have to be myself.

171
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.630
I have to be real. And this guy said a lot of things that were very,

172
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:23.520
very personal. You know, a lot of things about my previous manager, you know,

173
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:27.240
a lot of things about my team, my current manager, you know,

174
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:31.020
and a lot of things about my money, my family and my situation, as well as,

175
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.390
as far as my, my father, all of that,

176
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:38.340
to where it really hit home to where it's the best way for me to teach you a

177
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:40.200
lesson. It's not, by going in there fighting angry.

178
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.750
I have to go in there being calculated, like my normal self,

179
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.000
and really teach you a lesson because anything you say can and will be

180
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:51.050
used against you inside that article. What was.

181
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.590
<v 0>He saying to you? He was talking to you. I couldn't hear it.</v>

182
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.510
Cause it was so loud in that or the arena when you were weighing in,

183
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.770
what was he saying to you?

184
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.280
<v 1>Ah, thank you. Saying I'll be ready. Oh, should hope you're ready tomorrow.</v>

185
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.330
Junior hope you're ready. Hope you're ready. I'm I'm I'm coming.

186
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.830
Hope you're ready tomorrow. I'm coming. He.

187
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.490
<v 0>Seems so calm too. He had a big smile on his face, but.</v>

188
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.530
<v 1>Uh, but you know, when I look at these guys,</v>

189
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.590
I'm looking for more than just that, like I'm reading his body,

190
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:18.890
I'm reading everything and he's looking at me the whole time and he did the

191
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:22.220
best. Cause I know he's a competitor. He did the best he could to hide his fear.

192
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.240
You know? And, and I, I was afraid to, I'm afraid. I'm afraid.

193
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.870
Every one of these fights you, you gotta be afraid, but I make friends with it.

194
00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:33.320
I'm okay with being afraid. I'm not, I'm not worried about it.

195
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:36.320
I am okay with that. So I'm watching him and there's,

196
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.220
there's a moment if you see that way in video, we, the stair now, when you're,

197
00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:43.310
you know, after we stare down, we stare down and I'm watching them.

198
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:44.410
I'm watching them the whole time,

199
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.210
just watching him and he's doing this good job. He's trying to stay on me,

200
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:48.710
stay on me, stay on me, stay on me.

201
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.270
And then he looks away and I just read his body. I'm just like, okay,

202
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.650
I know how worried he is. I know how worried he is. Isn't it weird? Like,

203
00:10:57.651 --> 00:10:58.550
you know.

204
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.390
<v 0>That your opponent is worried, you know, everyone's worried, right.</v>

205
00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:05.000
Everyone's nervous, but you've got to kind of see it.

206
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.870
Cause you could yourself in your mind that this guy's not even scared.

207
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.320
I'm scared and he's not. Yes. You can mind yourself. Even though, you know,

208
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:16.760
it's not even like everyone before a cage fight has to be.

209
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.983
Absolutely.

210
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.030
<v 1>And, and um, and yeah, it it's weird,</v>

211
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:24.350
but cause I'm looking at him and I'm studying him and I'm seeing the level of

212
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.530
fear that he has. And you know,

213
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.920
I'm ex I'm trying to assess the level of fear, whether it's,

214
00:11:29.921 --> 00:11:33.190
it's something I can deal with or something that I'm just gonna think,

215
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.220
going to have no choice.

216
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.980
<v 0>You know, he looked pretty confident, confident.</v>

217
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.160
<v 1>But you know, I can see where,</v>

218
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.450
how superior I was in there to him, my level of fear and his level of fear.

219
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:46.570
I can see where they were at because, and,

220
00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:49.220
and you gotta be mindful of his level of fear as well because you,

221
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.440
occasionally animal is very dangerous animal, you know? And so I can,

222
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.800
I'm seeing them. And that's kinda how, the way he, that was that went.

223
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.240
<v 0>I watched that fight again the other day. Um,</v>

224
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.150
I was playing it in the gym while I was working. I was like, that is.

225
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.550
<v 1>A crazy pace. Like.</v>

226
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.160
<v 0>You came out, guns blazing. I mean, it,</v>

227
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.350
in my opinion is one of the very best welterweight title fights ever.

228
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.890
I mean, it was, it was apple. I'm watching.

229
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.760
<v 1>The paints. Yeah. They're watching, I'm watching, I'm watching, I'm watching,</v>

230
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.370
I'm watching, I'm watching it, keep it on him and keep it on him. I'm watching,

231
00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:25.350
I'm watching, I'm watching him. Boom. It looks away.

232
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.070
<v 0>Well, he had to, I was talking to him. He's got it in your head, man.</v>

233
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.310
He let down. I I'm.

234
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.660
<v 1>I'm I'm like, I'm like, oh, there was that just a little moment.</v>

235
00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:37.920
Just to read his spirit. I felt his spirit at that moment. And I'm just like,

236
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.030
uh, it's not the same. It's not the same. Like I'm going to hurt this kid.

237
00:12:42.031 --> 00:12:44.910
It's not the same, but he's going to come out. He's going to fight,

238
00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:48.280
but I'm going to hurt him. You know, at no point in that fight,

239
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.620
did I think I wasn't gonna hurt. Yeah.

240
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.950
<v 0>When you dropped him in, in the final round, when you stopped the fight,</v>

241
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.200
when you, when you dropped him, you saw him go down.

242
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.430
What was going through your head?

243
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.050
<v 1>I was like, oh, I'm hitting now. I'm hitting. Cause I, you know, when you,</v>

244
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.440
when you landed, you landed punch good. You don't really feel it.

245
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.840
And so at that moment I was kind of clipping him.

246
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:11.190
I was connecting everything I clipped him with was he was feeling the power at

247
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:14.580
that point. You know, I I'd heard him a few times before,

248
00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:18.420
but everyone kept talking about his pace, his pace and this and that.

249
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.280
And I carry power all the way throughout. That's how I train I,

250
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.670
the power is going to be the same, the way I hit mitts with my coaches,

251
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:31.560
Henry Hooft and all these it's all the same. It's not all tap,

252
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.620
tap, tap, tap, tap here. And then a little bit of power here. Tap, tap, tap.

253
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.110
Tell you a little bit. Yes. I know how to do that. I know how to mix it up.

254
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.630
Like boxers. Do they know how to put a little bit into this,

255
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.960
distract you with this, then touch you with that. I know how to do that too,

256
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.380
but I carry the power all the way throughout. So by the fifth round,

257
00:13:46.381 --> 00:13:48.120
when I hit him with the, I think, um,

258
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.290
I hit him with a body and I hit him a punch. I hit him with the, uh,

259
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:56.460
right hand that stunned him and he stumbled back. And at that point I was in,

260
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.220
I wasn't just in the driver's seat. I'm like, okay, I'm feeling him.

261
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.480
And then I hit him with a left foot. Boom. That hurt him. I could feel everyone.

262
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.000
They heard them because I'm not barely feeling the punches here.

263
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.450
And then when I put that Canon on his face, boom, and he went down and was like,

264
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.880
oh, stay relaxed, stay relaxed. We got time. You know,

265
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:14.490
the goal is to get him out of here. I'm not going to jump on him.

266
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.160
Cause I've made that mistake before I've dropped the guy down, jumped on him,

267
00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:19.860
going crazy. Trying to get him out of there. Let me stay on him,

268
00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:21.750
just stay relaxed and I'm going to get him none.

269
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.490
And at that point I was just in,

270
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.480
you get to a certain zone to where you see him coming and he's just like punches

271
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.470
to going by. And then I land the other one that he drives and I'm just like,

272
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:34.990
okay, it's time to get on him and finish him here. I recognize.

273
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.020
<v 0>That something was wrong with his jaw. Boom. There.</v>

274
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.340
<v 1>It is. No, I, I, and I, I watched the fight over in my coat and my, uh,</v>

275
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.600
coroner told me that his jaw was broken. I didn't even hear them. Boom,

276
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.030
that second right-hand I didn't even hear them.

277
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.220
Were you surprised the way they stopped the fight? No. No, but you know, and I,

278
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:55.010
and this is, this is what I'm saying is, um, I got to say,

279
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:57.860
I was a little surprised when I looked at this. Yeah. I mean, you,

280
00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:01.160
you think about it like that. And it's like, Aw, man, he got up right,

281
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.730
right away. You know, like it was, might've been an early stoppage.

282
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.190
But then if you, if you watch the last,

283
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:11.570
like that 30 seconds before that you see the shots that he was taken,

284
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.930
like, I hit him with that right hand. Boom. He stumbled back, almost fell down.

285
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.370
<v 0>I was wondering if they knew that his jaw was broken.</v>

286
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.720
<v 1>I mean, that's a referee. The referee might, you know, you know, I,</v>

287
00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.250
but I personally didn't.

288
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.540
But if you see them take shots like that and you just got dropped twice and now

289
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:31.270
you're holding onto a leg. And now this is just an ear Muff.

290
00:15:31.271 --> 00:15:35.350
You're trying to protect yourself and I'm having no sign of stopping, you know,

291
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:39.160
that's the referee's job to get in there and stop you. You know?

292
00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:40.630
And I know some guys are like, oh,

293
00:15:40.631 --> 00:15:42.460
well they should have let him go to title five.

294
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.760
That should have let him get knocked out completely or this and that. You know?

295
00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:49.470
But it's the ref. Referee's not doing his job of protecting you. If,

296
00:15:49.471 --> 00:15:51.100
if that happens. It's okay.

297
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.720
<v 0>Interesting that you said every fight takes a little bit out of you and that's,</v>

298
00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:59.770
I think that's important for people to hear because I, you know,

299
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.950
we've all seen fighters and you know,

300
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.220
like we go to boxing and perfect examples of Meldrick Taylor.

301
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.550
When he fought Julio, Cesar Chavez. Did you ever see that fight? No, no.

302
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.130
Tremendous fight. Meldrick Taylor was winning the fight,

303
00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:14.410
but Chavez just kept the pressure on him. Kept the pressure on,

304
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.590
was beaten his body beaten his body, kept the pressure on him.

305
00:16:17.591 --> 00:16:18.820
And then finally with the like,

306
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.140
literally I think the fight was stopped with four seconds to go. Wow. Yeah.

307
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.040
Richard Steele waved it off and Meldrick Taylor stood up and he talked to him,

308
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:29.710
but you could tell him I was detail was out of it. And they stopped the fight.

309
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.010
Mel's retail was never the same again. It was never the same again.

310
00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:36.340
Terry Norris dark dream. After that, he started slurring his words.

311
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:40.600
It was real bad. It was like that one fight took everything out of him.

312
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.710
<v 1>Yeah. There's a, there's some people that don't really see is, I mean,</v>

313
00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:47.890
everyone's attracted to violence. Everybody wants to see the violence.

314
00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:49.750
They want to see you get hit. And once you hit someone,

315
00:16:49.751 --> 00:16:51.280
they want to see the blood, you know,

316
00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:56.200
but people don't see what this takes away from your spirit. Each fight,

317
00:16:56.201 --> 00:16:57.040
win or lose.

318
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.420
It takes something from you like only myself and Colby,

319
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:05.950
Covington are gonna know what that fight did to us. Now, could I do it?

320
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.290
I can do it again next week. I have no problem doing it yet,

321
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.480
but each and every fight takes something away from you, but.

322
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:18.020
<v 0>It's balanced out more. So for sure if you take a beating, right. But if,</v>

323
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:22.900
is it balanced out by hard training and recuperation to where you can

324
00:17:22.901 --> 00:17:27.670
maintain the exact same level or is every fight you're like slightly

325
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.530
less good than you were before,

326
00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:33.040
but you're so much better that you still have enough leeway.

327
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.490
<v 1>That know that as far as the preparation and the training, all of that stuff.</v>

328
00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:39.700
Yeah. That, that accounts. So yeah, that takes, it takes it away from you.

329
00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:44.500
But I'm saying the act of actually fighting the fight from your

330
00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:48.100
spirit, from your energy that takes away from you because so you.

331
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.590
<v 0>Mean like your ability to get up for it. Yes.</v>

332
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.520
<v 1>Your, your, your ability to, to fight another man,</v>

333
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.050
your ability to that provider, the fight, another person that, that spirit,

334
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.670
that killer spirit, it takes away from you and it, and it could add to it, it,

335
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:05.910
it changes that spirit in some shape, form or fashion.

336
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.920
It absolutely does it. It's there's this video. Um,

337
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.110
a while back, I forget the fighter, uh,

338
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.290
he was a wrestler turned fighter and he's like bleach blonde hair.

339
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:20.730
I forget his name. But I think the video was caught on faded glory.

340
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.680
I think USA wrestling made it,

341
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.120
but it together and it had all these wrestlers on it. Um, you know,

342
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:30.930
Brandon sleigh Trevell dialogue, Neveah was my teammate, a lot of different,

343
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.550
you know, it was on that video.

344
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.910
And I watched that while I was training for the 2012 Olympics,

345
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:39.780
trying to make the team. And that video stays with me,

346
00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:42.090
changed my mentality or how to think,

347
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.170
because it really put things in perspective because you go out there and you

348
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:51.030
battle this hard match and you lose to this guy like Joe I've won

349
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.110
hundreds of wrestling matches. I can't remember hardly any of them.

350
00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.060
The ones that I've lost though. I remember most of them.

351
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.490
Why is that? Because each one took something away from my spirit.

352
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.860
Somehow I remember the one, they took something away from me.

353
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.510
Like, I, I couldn't tell you really, um, the fights I won the MMA fights.

354
00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:19.080
I can really, you know, I don't really care that much about I win and I move on,

355
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.330
but the one that I lost, oh yeah, I know exactly why I knew what happened.

356
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:28.280
I knew I, you know, what happened in that fight, right?
