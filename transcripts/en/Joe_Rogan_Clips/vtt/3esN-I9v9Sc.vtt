00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 1>Experience. I'm,</v>

3
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.680
I'm really interested to see what happens with Tyron and Leon Edwards. You know,

4
00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:11.240
they're fighting next. That's a, a big fight, very hard fight for both guys.

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.680
<v 0>It is. It's, um, it's a hard fight for both guys, but,</v>

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.440
and it stylistically matches up well for both guys,

7
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.270
because Tyron has a lot of successes with, with south Paul guys.

8
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:24.830
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the right hand. He, yeah, he's got that,

9
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:29.630
that cannon in his right hand and, and Tyron is very,

10
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:33.550
very good. When guys don't completely dominate and control what's going on.

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.270
And Leon Evers has,

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.110
has done better at that with guys that he feels like he can keep up with,

13
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.420
but with the guy like Tyron Woodley that could wrestle like Tyron will,

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.700
that's got power. Like him. I wonder how he's going to do.

15
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.261
<v 1>Well.</v>

16
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:50.420
I feel like Leon gets the least amount of attention when it comes to like top

17
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.380
flight world class fighters. He's a top flight world class fighter. Absolutely.

18
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:57.580
But he gets the least amount of attention out of those guys for whatever weird

19
00:00:57.581 --> 00:00:58.500
reason. Yeah. It's.

20
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.130
<v 0>I mean, it's the era that we live in. I mean, this, this is a first fight.</v>

21
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:03.250
Like if you really think about it,

22
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:06.330
this is the first fight you are actually starting to hear his voice, like,

23
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.930
right. Like it's like, it's like, who is Leon? Right, right. Scott or Edward.

24
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.891
<v 1>Whatever his name. Well,</v>

25
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.970
the biggest thing with him was when he had a fist fight with MOS Vidal,

26
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:16.650
like when they, when they had that script.

27
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.330
<v 0>It wasn't a fist fight. Like modal, just crack, whatever that guy,</v>

28
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.360
whatever his name is. I mean, you know, openly said it,

29
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:29.440
you have one of the best sucker punches in the game and the best 40 yard dash.

30
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.721
So you go in there,

31
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.920
you sucker punch somebody backstage and you run out of there and they rush you

32
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:35.600
outta London before it yeah.

33
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:39.160
Then Brits can get a hold of you before the London boys came back. You know?

34
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.150
So I mean, yeah, that, that's kind of, unfortunately for Leon,

35
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.390
that's gonna put his name in it's.

36
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.150
<v 1>Kind crazy too, because when you're in a foreign country and you commit assault,</v>

37
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.150
usually they lock you the.

38
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.390
<v 0>Up. They got him out there. Let's just, they got him outta there.</v>

39
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.990
They got him out.

40
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.190
<v 1>There, but it's weird. Like no charges, no nothing. They got him out there,</v>

41
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.870
but isn't that kind of cause there's video. It's not like we don't know what.

42
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.620
<v 0>Happened. Yeah. And, and the crazy thing is that he gets praised for that. Yes.</v>

43
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.740
Him made him famous. He gets praised for that.

44
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.420
And I imagine I do that over there in, in &lt;laugh&gt; in London.

45
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.500
<v 1>Or imagine anybody.</v>

46
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.140
<v 0>Else doing anybody else doing that in, in London? It's like, how did he do.</v>

47
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.060
<v 1>It? It's weird. Like how did Mo all get away with it? It's it's it.</v>

48
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.060
<v 0>Is weird. Well, with the forces that be, UFC's very, uh, they're very good.</v>

49
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:25.810
What they, he do. And let's just say they got him outta there quick.

50
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.290
<v 1>Let's just say, let's just say yeah. Yeah. He's been talking crazy. Um, yeah,</v>

51
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.890
that might be your next fight. What do you think?

52
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.330
Do you think that's gonna be your next fight? I hope.

53
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.770
<v 0>So. Because of, um,</v>

54
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.850
because of the way that think I'm the type of guy to where anything you say can

55
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.240
and will be used against you inside that art. Oh, you're a court of law.

56
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.920
I exactly, &lt;laugh&gt; exactly.

57
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.720
I'm the judge that juror and the executioner in there. And, and that,

58
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.320
that's how I approach it. You know? Cause some guys,

59
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:57.240
you just sign the contract to go fight the guys. Right. But I, I,

60
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.920
I get obsessed with the fact that I I'm, I want them to say something I'm, I'm,

61
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm waiting for them to say something it's a little tougher than the guys that

62
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.360
don't really have to say anything else,

63
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.200
have anything negative to say it's a little tougher to go in there and you know,

64
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.760
and get angry, get angry to fight them. And I'm, I, I look at,

65
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.280
I want them to say something.

66
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.190
They do an interview that pops up my Google alerts on, you know, my someone,

67
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.830
my, from my team would tell me, boom, someone did this interview about this,

68
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:26.030
check it out. If I have time, I'll watch it. Oh, he said that. Okay.

69
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.630
You know, and, and this guy it's, you know what, it's,

70
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.870
it's funny to see the way it's shifted. Like the career,

71
00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:38.870
his career has shifted. This is guy that's been known it for a long, long time.

72
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.300
A long time. Yeah. And he was a run in the mill guy. He would win some loose,

73
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:48.060
some win, some loose some, I mean, you know, not that long ago he was losing,

74
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.420
you know, but, and the credit to his team as well, you know,

75
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.860
they've done a good job at,

76
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.700
at picking the right fights to really get him to where he is

77
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.610
now. But you know, would actually happen. You know, his story. He went,

78
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.170
he went on a south American game show. Well, yeah,

79
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.250
he was 300 pounds before he went. And did that, was he like,

80
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.650
he was really fat bruh. Look at pic, find, look at pictures really?

81
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.850
But this wasn't this like post Wonderboy, wasn't it?

82
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.530
Was it somewhere around then? Ah, I guess somewhere around there.

83
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.600
I think it post Wonderboy right after, but it got fat,

84
00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:27.720
really bad fat. When I fought was it? I fought Wonderboy.

85
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.960
No, when I fought Damien Mayer, I think that was like the tail end of the,

86
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.960
of the, uh, the huskiness on, on his part. But it was

87
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.190
at, at some point like, listen, like everyone's buying into the hype.

88
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:46.990
This is what I'm saying. That they've done a good job at creating this hype,

89
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.670
by picking the fights to where one fight was a gamble.

90
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.550
The Ben ask cream fight was a gamble. You know, you win that fight.

91
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.390
You take all that hype that this guy has,

92
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.300
which this guy didn't belong in there in the first place. But, uh,

93
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.860
previously in his career, early on his career,

94
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.540
you could make the argument that yes. But at that point in his career,

95
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.620
he didn't belong in there. But he goes out there, let's say,

96
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:12.700
Banas does take him down and does what Banas does.

97
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.780
We wouldn't be having this conversation right now. Hmm. So he goes,

98
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:17.780
and that's a gamble on their part. And the gamble paid off.

99
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.460
He went and they took all that hype from band. Then who's the next guy,

100
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.650
the guy that, you know,

101
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:26.730
another guy that win some loose some but has a ton of hype because he's just

102
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:29.330
fought. Connor goes in there and fights Nate.

103
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.650
Now that fight turns out the way he did. You get all this hype.

104
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.090
Now you got all these people thinking, oh my God, this guy's a killer.

105
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.440
Where has he been? This and that? It's this same guy. I,

106
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.720
that was 300 pounds. Not too long ago. He was not 300. Look at it.

107
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.600
He was near close. I don't think he was ever above north of 20.

108
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.840
Oh really? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Really? Oh yeah. I'm talking.

109
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.400
I never saw him fat. Yeah. You should look at pictures. Oh yeah. But you know,

110
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.200
hats off to him. He got the weight off and you know,

111
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.080
he went over and did his thing and I'm no hat.

112
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.600
I give credit what credit this dude. Yeah. But, but don't,

113
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.040
he was always that guy that said, you know what? I'm not, I'm not this cliche.

114
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.400
I'm not playing this character. I'm not doing this. You know,

115
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.280
I'm just a real fight in this. But then you showing up at press conferences,

116
00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:17.790
looking like the knock off Scarface. Yeah.

117
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.910
<v 1>But don't you think that that's wise? Like just, no, it is wise. It's.</v>

118
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.870
<v 0>Very smart. It is wise. It is. Yeah. But say it like it is,</v>

119
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.030
don't sit here and say, oh, these guys are being the gimick.

120
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:30.830
These guys are doing this. These guys are doing that.

121
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.590
You're doing the same thing. And, and then look at what he did that last fight.

122
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:37.700
Oh my God. He took the biggest L of that night. Like that was corny.

123
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.460
You wanna wear the robe? You wanna stand there?

124
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.620
You say he was holding that silver belt. Like he,

125
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:44.260
they actually think this is a real belt.

126
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.300
<v 1>The BMF belt. &lt;laugh&gt; what did you think about that BMF belt? What's a strange,</v>

127
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.620
the.

128
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.700
<v 0>Video fighter.</v>

129
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.660
<v 1>Belt. They didn't need a BMF belt for this last fight with Connor and cowboy.</v>

130
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.500
They just needed a good matchup. Yeah. Right? Absolutely. So why, what is,

131
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.170
why does the BMF belt like, is that.

132
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.490
<v 0>A one time thing? It was, yeah, it was,</v>

133
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:03.810
it was something they created to kind of hide hype that fight. They,

134
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:06.450
they needed, they, I mean, did they really need a belt though?

135
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.250
Did they need a belt? No, they didn't. But you know, if they,

136
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:13.330
they get loud enough and Dana hears them and Dana sees that Dana's a very smart

137
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:16.850
man, greatest promoter ever, ever seen, you know,

138
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.240
and to jump on that, like, you know what, like, let's make him.

139
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.200
<v 1>A, let's make food belt. Let's.</v>

140
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.240
<v 0>Make a nice little silver belt. You know, this little lever, replica, silver,</v>

141
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:28.240
silver. It's like a instead of gold. Yeah. It's like a silver, silver color.

142
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.360
Purpleish color.

143
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.680
<v 1>Pull a picture of it. I wanna see thing again.</v>

144
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.960
<v 0>It's a beautiful belt. &lt;laugh&gt; what's beautiful belt. The UFC belt is beautiful.</v>

145
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.640
That's more.

146
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.990
<v 1>Beautiful. That's more it's like saying like, you know, I mean,</v>

147
00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:42.390
you look at a new Corvette, you go, oh, that's a beautiful car. Yeah.

148
00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:44.430
And then you look at a Ferrari, you go, oh, that's a better looking car.

149
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.470
Oh yeah. That's.

150
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.670
<v 0>A better looking or Bentley. Oh.</v>

151
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.150
<v 1>Yes. I want that. It's another level.</v>

152
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.190
<v 0>But it it's. Yeah, but this one's like the Bentley and then the Honda civic.</v>

153
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.470
So I'm being honest.

154
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.580
<v 1>I'm being honest. It is. So look at that thing. Is that silver? Is that like.</v>

155
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.580
<v 0>That copper? No, that's not copper. It's like a it's Sterling.</v>

156
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.260
<v 1>Silver. It seems kind of goldish in some, I mean, it seems like the.</v>

157
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.140
<v 0>Lighting. Nah, it's it's Sterling silver. It's like the.</v>

158
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.100
<v 1>I kind of think it's gold. No, it's.</v>

159
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.580
<v 0>Not. Is it gold? No. No. It's not gold. It's not gold. Is it bronze? It's like,</v>

160
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.010
bro, is it bronze? I, is it I can'ts not even silver.

161
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:24.210
It's not even second place is bronze. Huh? &lt;laugh&gt; I mean, this is like,

162
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.690
honestly, this is like a participation medal. You know how,

163
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:29.650
when you do the field day in school and they give you the participation medals,

164
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:32.730
they're like, here you go, kid. You did a great job. And that's what this is.

165
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.370
Well, if.

166
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.130
<v 1>You beat him, do you get that belt too? I.</v>

167
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.130
<v 0>Want that. I want it because what.</v>

168
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.090
<v 1>Would you do with it? If you had it, would you wear both of them? No.</v>

169
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.000
What would you do with just put it aside? Put.

170
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
<v 0>It in my closet. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

171
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.040
I was just put it in my closet. I would just put it in my closet, but it's like,

172
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.040
there's no, there's no, what? That means nothing.

173
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.240
It was just something to hypey, but they've ran. His team has ran with it. Like,

174
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.320
yeah. We're the move. Listen man. And then.

175
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.000
<v 1>Call him this. When they called, when they showed the video of him,</v>

176
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.040
when they went to the camera, turn to him during the last paper view,

177
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.600
the pop was gigantic. Everybody went crazy when they saw him. Yeah. I mean,

178
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.060
the hype.

179
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.160
<v 0>Is real. Yeah. You.</v>

180
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:12.960
<v 1>The hype is.</v>

181
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.470
<v 0>Real. It's a lie. You know, it's a alive and kicking man. Big people.</v>

182
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.150
<v 1>Big hype, big hype. They love him.</v>

183
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.150
<v 0>You know? But that's the thing is,</v>

184
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.110
people love you until they really see what you are. You know,

185
00:09:24.111 --> 00:09:27.230
Darren till had a lot of hype and shout out to Darren till, I mean, you know,

186
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.430
he's still, you know, growing in his, in the sport,

187
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.270
but he had a lot of hype to where people were. So man,

188
00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:36.340
these guy's gonna beat Woodley. Right? Like even at some, I was like, yo,

189
00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:39.740
he might get Woodie. Really? I was like, yeah, he might get Willie.

190
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.940
And you could in.

191
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.540
<v 1>That fight, severely disrespectful,</v>

192
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.700
very disrespectful that they were making him the favor in that fight.

193
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.300
I'm like disrespectful. Crazy. You're crazy. I mean,

194
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:52.020
this guy's already fought one of the best strikers twice in,

195
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.260
in Wonderboy and beat him both times.

196
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.090
Not just that he was the only one that hurt him. Yeah.

197
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.930
Like he hurt Wonderboy bad. And both of those fights Wonderboy never hurt him.

198
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.930
So you got the guy who's arguably one of the best strikers to ever do it in the

199
00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:09.090
Walter Wood division. I mean, Wonderboy's a fantastic Kickbox oh yeah. Oh yeah.

200
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.650
Tyron smashed him.

201
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.050
<v 0>You saw what Wonderboy did to mouse with doll. Yeah.</v>

202
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.890
<v 1>Yeah. I pointed him. Yeah.</v>

203
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.880
<v 0>Good fight. I mean he dropped him like several times. Did he drop him? Yeah.</v>

204
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:20.470
A couple times.

205
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.440
<v 1>Well, Darren dropped him too. Darren till dropped, uh, MOS vial too,</v>

206
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:26.040
but Mo starched him. Yeah. And, and, and.

207
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.440
<v 0>You know, I give credit what credit is due, you know? But um, like,</v>

208
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:32.720
like I'm saying back to that, like yeah, everyone, I was almost almost like,

209
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:33.560
and you saw what? Like,

210
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:38.030
I I'm sure Willy was a little afraid in that fight because it's like,

211
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.990
do you think so? I don't think so. Yeah. You have to be, I think he,

212
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.190
with all the hype they were putting behind them.

213
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.150
You have to be because at some point as a cha and that's what makes you sane as

214
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.510
a champion is that little fear. It's like, wow. They really saying,

215
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.310
is this kid really good enough? He's the favorite?

216
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.380
<v 1>Is he good enough? That was so crazy. There's odds. And I'm like,</v>

217
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:02.380
this is just, this doesn't make any sense at all. To me. I agree. You know,

218
00:11:02.381 --> 00:11:05.500
there's certain odds where I'm like, you guys are like, who's making these odds.

219
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.540
Yeah.

220
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.660
<v 0>I I'm beats me, especially these rankings too.</v>

221
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.140
I'm like they they've got this kid at at number three.

222
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.380
He hasn't fought number four. He hasn't fought number one. Number two,

223
00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:18.730
he hasn't fought number five. He hasn't fought. Number six. How in the,

224
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.770
is he number three.

225
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.490
<v 1>MOS. Number three does have it. Well, who makes the rankings? The rankings are.</v>

226
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.490
<v 0>Weird. I don't, yeah. I don't know who makes the.</v>

227
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:26.900
<v 1>Rankings.</v>

228
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.410
Cause sometimes a guy will beat the guy and then he'll be below that guy in the

229
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:31.370
rankings. Like what
