00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.260
I once was fat actually really GF Chubb, like, uh, you know,

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.020
roles like the guys that have rolls of fat and the thing.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.310
And I was with a girl who, um, you know, a very,

5
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:17.670
very serious young and everything. And we went to her beach,

6
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.790
her beach was cutting little doom, you know, doom, beach, little doom,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.330
and she's talks to these. She goes, I have to go talk to these guys.

8
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:28.620
And they were the cool surfer dudes. And it was like 25 years ago,

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.960
30 years ago. And she's talks to these guys and they start laughing and I go,

10
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.300
what are they like, what are you guys laughing at to her?

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.490
Because she's now left these and they're back there.

12
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:42.540
And I see a chorus of them kind of laughing. They go, well,

13
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.880
I guess they're laughing because they said, uh,

14
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.960
we never thought you'd be with like a fat guy. And I thought, wow,

15
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.960
they look at me. And that's what they're, that's what they're seeing.

16
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:55.530
And they think is funny. I got to fix this. And I,

17
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.240
that was like the straight up October forever for me. Um.

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.180
<v 1>That is what's called fat shaming fat.</v>

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.900
<v 0>Shaming. Oh, I didn't even know that. There's nothing that.</v>

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.770
<v 1>Yeah, you didn't, you never heard of fat shaming. Never heard it. Well, that's,</v>

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.550
it's a very controversial thought because some people think that fat shaming is

22
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.630
terrible and that you shouldn't do it to people. And other people say that

23
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.730
it's true. It does work on certain people, but it makes people feel bad.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.480
And some people think you should protect people from feeling bad.

25
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
Whereas other people think you should tell them that they're fat.

26
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.810
So they feel bad. So they act on it.

27
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.560
<v 0>How do you see it? I.</v>

28
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.720
<v 1>Call it I'm the ladder. I think you should tell people that they're fat.</v>

29
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.370
If they want to know God, you said, I don't think you should go after people.

30
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.360
<v 0>And make them feel like they want.</v>

31
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.700
<v 1>To know. You mean like, no, I don't think you should predict.</v>

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.420
<v 0>What's a M okay. Give me the signal of, if you want to know,</v>

33
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.190
like you're with some friends,

34
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.400
let's say you're with someone you only know a little bit.

35
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.880
I wouldn't say anything then. Okay. So now you're with, uh, I said,

36
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.440
we're talking about like relatives or no, you're talking about a husband,

37
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.450
wife, or boyfriend. Girlfriend.

38
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.510
<v 1>That's tough because they can resent you forever. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.900
You gotta be real careful, especially with the ladies. Yeah. Yeah.

40
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.240
And if you're a man and you resent your wife forever,

41
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.310
cause she tells you you're fat. You're probably not really a man.

42
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.600
That's really funny. He might be a little.

43
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.630
<v 0>Oh my God. I can't believe you said that really. I mean, I like it cause it's,</v>

44
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.090
I don't know what you like it, you might be a little.

45
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.870
<v 1>It might be a little. Yeah. If your wife says you're fat and like,</v>

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.740
if my wife tells me I'm fat, I'm like, Mmm, I'm not fat. Yeah.

47
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.830
What are you talking about? It doesn't work. It only works. If you're fat.

48
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.880
It's one thing. If they're saying something about, yeah. It's one thing.

49
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.430
If they're saying something about something you can't control,

50
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:50.610
like I wish you were black. I don't like white [inaudible].

51
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.600
<v 0>So it sounds like you have no boundaries on your show. Right? Okay.</v>

52
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.300
The guys that have really little.

53
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.260
<v 1>Ooh. That's a row. That's a rough one.</v>

54
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 0>I got, I got it. I I'm hearing you. So do you think the girl,</v>

55
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.900
the let's do you think, and the girl, the girl and the guy,

56
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.960
or to get there, did the girl ever say you have.

57
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.150
<v 1>Do they ever does it? I'm sure some girls do, but here's the thing. Some girls.</v>

58
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.450
<v 0>Pretty like rough guys. We can talk about.</v>

59
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.210
<v 1>Oh, I think some girls who are some girls who are beautiful,</v>

60
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.110
beautiful girls are also lesbians. Oh yes. That's true.

61
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.550
So some girls popular to be some girls who are beautiful. Girls are bisexual.

62
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.280
So they, they like girls and guys,

63
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.950
here's the question with those girls,

64
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.980
the more likely to settle for a guy with a little Dick or a rich guy with a

65
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.950
little, they like girls to be girls and like guys,

66
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.530
no matter what to have a big Dick. Yeah.

67
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.210
<v 0>All right. The way that's I think that like probably the latter.</v>

68
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.980
<v 1>That's probably, unfortunately evolution's a really is. Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:02.170
I think that, uh, that's, you know,

70
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.680
there's not a thing a person can do about that one. You know,

71
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:09.700
you could suck fat out of your waste to stuff in your. You could get fake boobs.

72
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.240
This is a lot of you do. If you got a little Dick, that's a wrap son.

73
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.260
She can do. I mean, it's probably,

74
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.200
there's some operations that can help you out a little bit. I think that.

75
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.490
<v 0>For the most part.</v>

76
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.820
<v 1>Yeah. Cutting. And Dick, those two words, don't go together.</v>

77
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.940
<v 0>Crazy when they have, for sure.</v>

78
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.830
<v 1>Guaranteed. You must must make them suicidal it. Cause it's whenever he.</v>

79
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.740
<v 0>Started throwing Troy. Now that would mean like we had looked.</v>

80
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.680
<v 1>Maybe an effect of crazy. I think,</v>

81
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.890
I think there's certain things that, you know,

82
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.730
there's nothing you can do about it. You just have to handle that.

83
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.320
Roll the dice, whatever you got. Yeah. I would guess. Yeah. That's one of them,

84
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.363
but I mean, if,

85
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.790
if things like CRISPR and genetic manipulation and things they're working on

86
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:57.580
now. Yeah. That's probably one of the first things they're going to work on.

87
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.770
That's financial. I never thought of that.

88
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.830
<v 0>Right on the show today.</v>

89
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.600
<v 1>I think I've found about four. Okay. I'm going to be honest with you,</v>

90
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.340
but I don't, I don't think, uh, I don't think there's anything more profitable.

91
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.380
Except beauty. Beauty would be incredibly profitable for people who.

92
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.420
<v 0>Both fall in that same depart. Well, somewhat same area. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.610
Being like cousin, whatever it is. Cosmetics. Yes.

94
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.630
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Not just cosmetics, but even, you know, uh,</v>

95
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.400
people that are not.

96
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.020
<v 0>Frame, you're not.</v>

97
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.600
<v 1>Operational. No, no. You're not operational.</v>

98
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.100
I mean maybe one day there'll be able to do something to shoot a little virus

99
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:40.870
into your body and then all of a sudden perpetrator.

100
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.620
<v 0>Yeah. That'd be.</v>

101
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.430
<v 1>Something that can happen. I mean, it's not insurmountable scientifically.</v>

102
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.140
There's so many things that there are,

103
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.400
they're already doing with genetic manipulation. It's not outside of the.

104
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.410
<v 0>Well, it's not outside the room. It seems as possible.</v>

105
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.670
Let's start calling our scientists right now. Call.

106
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.990
<v 1>Them up and see what's to say.</v>

107
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.100
<v 0>So anyway, I learned about fat shaming. I got that. That's.</v>

108
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.820
<v 1>He didn't know about that. That's like in the zeitgeists right now. Is it?</v>

109
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.080
People get mad at people for fat shaming. Yeah. Yeah.

110
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.000
James Corden got mad at bill Maher. Bill Maher was mocking fat shaming.

111
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.290
He was saying maybe we should be shaming people more to him directly. No, no.

112
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.441
Oh,

113
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:25.100
just Mara was talking about on his television show that maybe we shouldn't be

114
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:29.750
shaming people. Oh, I see. I see James cordon said, I have a problem with that.

115
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:32.510
And you know, he's talking to Ben bade, a bunch of fat jokes,

116
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:33.710
which I found were kind of,

117
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.780
kind of weird making fat jokes while you're being upset that someone's

118
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.190
calling you fat.

119
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.260
<v 0>That's interesting. Yeah. He thought he could get that one by you,</v>

120
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.610
but that one didn't give by.

121
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.300
<v 1>No, but he also does have a comedy talk show.</v>

122
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:54.200
So it makes sense that he was making jokes and he's been comedic in his,

123
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.730
but.

124
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.620
<v 0>It doesn't have that. He has, he doesn't like.</v>

125
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.080
<v 1>It's, it's, it's not something that you can't fix.</v>

126
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.650
And that's one of the things that people have a problem with being sympathetic

127
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:08.470
about it. And I think that was bill Maher statement.

128
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.550
Cause bill is obviously a very slim man. Yeah.

129
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.140
But it's not something you can't fix. It's a problem to fix. It's hard to fix.

130
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.810
It's hard, probably requires discipline. And also your,

131
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.220
your gut biome is probably all screwed up from eating bad foods. And you know,

132
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.040
you probably are accustomed to certain,

133
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.020
certain behavior patterns that are unhealthy for you to the times you're eating

134
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:31.520
the kind of foods you're eating. Yeah.

135
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.440
<v 0>Oh right. I fixed it. I fixed mine with, um, but I mean,</v>

136
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:38.360
I wasn't fat in the w that.

137
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.280
<v 1>Really you fix it with shame.</v>

138
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.330
<v 0>I fixed it with shame.</v>

139
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.560
She shamed me and I started jumping rope and I started with,

140
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:49.130
I do all, everything with an achievable goal.

141
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.450
I just did a couple of minutes and I just kept going. And then pretty soon, uh,

142
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.800
you know, I did the rope with the, uh,

143
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.920
that had a counter on it with those plastic beads that gives a little weight on

144
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.910
and a nylon rope, a nylon cord, and you can really get it going.

145
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:09.470
So I could do 200 beats a minute for 30 minutes and you're holding your

146
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.920
body very tight. So it actually, I didn't think of it that way,

147
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:16.730
but it really strengthens, strengthened my core. Yeah.

148
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.590
<v 1>Jumping rope was amazing. Yeah.</v>

149
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.110
<v 0>So you obviously do. Yeah. It's great.</v>

150
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.940
<v 1>Mostly. Yeah. I just do it to kind of get going. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

151
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.910
But for boxers, that's why the boxers use it so much. I mean, it's,

152
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.200
it's a staple of boxing work.

153
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.090
<v 0>Yes it is. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.830
<v 1>I mean, you're always on your toes.</v>

155
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.290
It keeps your calves conditioned and helps your body ability to sh shift

156
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:43.530
movement. I mean, strong calves and strong feet are very, very important for,

157
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.150
for boxing and anything that requires movement football players.

158
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.560
A lot of football players use jump rope to help their ability to move side to

159
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:55.290
side. And it helped them mobility. Yeah. Great workout too,

160
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.490
which is great cardiovascular.

161
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.560
<v 0>Hmm. Yeah. I, I.</v>

162
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.420
<v 1>It's very trendy right now too. Is it?</v>

163
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.680
<v 0>Yeah. Another trend. Another trend is the antidote to fat shaming.</v>

164
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.300
<v 1>Videos online where people are doing like these YouTube workouts have a jumping</v>

165
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:11.850
rope and then they also have weighted ropes, which is.

166
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.550
<v 0>I used a weighted rope too. Yeah.</v>

167
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.470
I used to go everywhere with these ropes. So if I were in an airport,

168
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:20.251
I'd be doing it.

169
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:24.930
I remember being on a tarmac in Greece and Athens waiting and I was

170
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.380
doing it. I would do it on in the rain. Uh,

171
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.590
I would I'll I'll I always, every day I did it.

172
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.480
That idea with no fail without fail for, uh,

173
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.530
almost 12 years.
