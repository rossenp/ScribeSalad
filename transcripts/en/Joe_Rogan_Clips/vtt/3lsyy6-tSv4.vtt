00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.803
<v 2>Right now,</v>

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.600
it's slightly difficult to talk about weight loss because I've

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.560
been obese and now I'm not obese. And I'm, I celebrate not being obese.

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.680
I am much better off with the way I have structured my life because

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.270
of having law. But I can't tell anybody else to do that.

7
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.190
And I don't even really want to, if somebody wants to be overweight,

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.030
if that's a trade off, they're willing to make. Yeah, that's fine with me.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.830
But I think for the most part, most of the people I've spoken to,

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.150
they don't want that.

11
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.790
A lot of people seem to have goals that generally line up with,

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.180
and then in talking to them now there's this diet culture monster in the room

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.140
where even that is attacked because there's a whole new set of values that are

14
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.060
born. That must be enforced mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

15
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:57.060
And at some point there's gotta be the recognition that we don't all necessarily

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:59.380
have to want the exact same stuff. Yeah.

17
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.290
<v 1>There's also so much biologic variability, right? Like yeah.</v>

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.530
The things that would work on another person just don't work on you, you know,

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.690
the yeah. Including diet, you know there's.

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.010
<v 0>Oh man. Arguing about diets is another great one. And this, I, I,</v>

21
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.730
I really like talking about diets simply because there's at the end of the day,

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.370
it's so much safer than politics,

23
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.200
cuz there's no military backing up a diet system, but &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

24
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:25.800
you talk about politics and it's like,

25
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.120
we have a military mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to force you to do the we want you to

26
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.760
do. Right. Versus the other military, that's gonna force you the other way.

27
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.800
But diets it's like veganism versus carnivore.

28
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.080
If we're just talking about weight loss, the other thing,

29
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.510
some of these things get into like the mind Nutha of health.

30
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.990
If you've got a guy who's got a 200 pounds to lose,

31
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.430
why are we focusing on the minutia of health?

32
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.670
I don't know that that's the right goal. If the goal is just weight loss.

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.430
I don't think these are the same. These are the same conversations. Yeah,

34
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:00.264
I think.

35
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.940
<v 1>I mean, I think the, the variety,</v>

36
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:08.140
there's so many different things that need to happen to a person to force them

37
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:12.620
into action. What do you think is the key things? Is it,

38
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.620
is it inspiration? Is,

39
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.460
is motivation is sometimes,

40
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.340
is it that you don't want to die or you don't want to be sick any longer that

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.333
you're fed up?

42
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.170
Or is it being inspired by a guy like David Goggins or Cameron Hayes or someone

43
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:30.490
like that? For.

44
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.090
<v 0>For me, for the very first time in my life, I,</v>

45
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.330
I was thinking about the future in a way,

46
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.050
in terms of what I wanted out of life versus just like,

47
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.080
what makes me have happy right this second.

48
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.720
And I was seeing a girl who I'm now married to. We have a bunch of kids and,

49
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.240
and I couldn't have a better life like 20 years ago if I

50
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.240
described to you the life I wanted in that moment,

51
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.360
I've way surpassed that. That's awesome. Congratulations. Thank you very much.

52
00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:03.120
Yeah. I,

53
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.720
I like I have to take a step back occasionally and go check you out.

54
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.960
Look what you did. Yeah. That's amazing. That's amazing. 500 pounds.

55
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.200
I was not thinking I can be a dad. I can be a husband.

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.830
I could teach little kids how to do stuff. This was not part of my,

57
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.550
I can't. I could take my wife on a hike.

58
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.110
I could go to the beach with her and not, you know,

59
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.590
sit under a towel in the back. Cuz I'm scared of people looking at me.

60
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:29.630
These were not the thoughts I was having.

61
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.150
So that spark of motivation of like, what do I want out of life?

62
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.830
Got me just so far because

63
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.420
&lt;affirmative&gt; after an extreme diet when you've

64
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.900
crashed your metabolism and you then, and by the way,

65
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.730
the,

66
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.140
your body is fighting against your tooth and nail doing these things because

67
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.020
this is your body thinks you're starving to death. Right. You know?

68
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.220
And so it's trying to slow everything down, slowing everything down, um,

69
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.650
over long periods, you're not just consuming fat,

70
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:06.010
you're consuming fat and lean tissue. Like it's tough.

71
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.090
All your hormones are up. You're you're uh, I forget the name of the hormone,

72
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.650
but there's a hormone that makes you hungry.

73
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.250
This is skyrocketing when you're on an extreme, extremely, uh,

74
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.650
caloric deficit diet.

75
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.640
And so then go to like just eating like a normal person and you're watching

76
00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:26.240
what other people eat and you're eating this and you're putting on weight again,

77
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.240
like at a rapid pace and going like this doesn't make sense.

78
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.200
I thought I was cured. I lost all this weight. Um, I,

79
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.200
I watched a really fascinating Ted talk by a guy named Mike ISRA tell about

80
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.630
five years ago, four or five, five years ago. And in it, and I had tried,

81
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.350
I was dead convinced that I was allergic to carbohydrates. And so I was like,

82
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.790
I'll never eat a carbohydrate for the rest of my life.

83
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:53.030
You thought you were allergic to carbohydrate. I was convinced that everybody,

84
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.230
yes, that everybody was gluten intolerant.

85
00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:00.910
That the way that we made bread in America with all the ingredients was just

86
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.140
poisonous to the human body. I was totally convinced of this.

87
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.940
And I watched this Ted talk by Mike Iselle and in it it's called the, uh,

88
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.420
the dietary landscape of healthy eating. And he just goes over like,

89
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.140
just be moderate. That's it just like, try to figure out moderation.

90
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:21.180
Nothing's poisonous. Nothing's off the like salt. If you have no salt,

91
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.850
you can die. If, if you're, if sodium disappears from your diet, you can die.

92
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.930
If you have too much salt, it can kill you. Like there's a, yeah.

93
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:34.370
An amount five grams, I think at one time. And, and this was,

94
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.290
I believe this study was done on small bodies can kill. You can be fatal.

95
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.640
So is that poisonous or is it necessary? It's both.

96
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.200
This is food for me. Like, um, the way I was interacting with food,

97
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.200
the idea that I'm a machine like you, you're a car guy.

98
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:56.240
You're not gonna put diesel fuel in your gas car.

99
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.320
You're not gonna do that cuz it's gonna break it. And,

100
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.600
and I had to start really thinking about food in these terms and going, like,

101
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.160
I just have a bad relationship with food, a,

102
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.400
a relationship that is giving me an outcome. I don't want, how do I change that?

103
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.000
Like.
