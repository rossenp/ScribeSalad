WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>The show it's about like representing Asian identities and all that.</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.880
I'm like dope. And that's,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.200
I get there at like seven 30 and I walk in and I'm like, okay,

4
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.530
I know all these kids. I mean, they're like 20 or something, but like,

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:14.910
I know that I grew up with these kids, you know,

6
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.580
like Abigail's and critiques or whatever. Like I know all these guys. Right.

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.100
And immediately my comic hat turns out. I'm like, okay, the show itself,

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.850
the energy is dope, but the show like acoustically, I'm looking, okay,

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.820
this is a high ceiling, the lighting. Uh,

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.970
it's not set up for like a comedy event, but I still think, okay,

11
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:37.380
this is going to go, well, 8 30, 8, 45, I get on stage.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.430
Um, and I'm like, I do some Columbia stuff.

13
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.500
Cause I went to Columbia for like a summer program.

14
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.230
I started making fun of the kids a bit and I say,

15
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.420
do I have to give like a trigger warning? Almost like joking,

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.930
like do have to give a trigger warning. Cause I know, you know, that's a thing.

17
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.390
And I say like, be careful, some of this might be sexist.

18
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.220
Some of this might be racist. Uh, you know,

19
00:00:56.221 --> 00:01:00.320
just buckle up and one girl booze and you're booing.

20
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.090
<v 1>Already. It's like two minutes in. And I'm like, well, look, this.</v>

21
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.120
<v 0>Is, I literally said, I just listened to the set, but on the way here.</v>

22
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.180
And I said, uh, well, buckle up. You know,

23
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.980
cause this is the real world or whatever.

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.720
And then I go into material and about, and it's going, well,

25
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.560
this is one story I want to dispel. Like I,

26
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:24.170
I will fully own a bomb if I'm bombing. I know I'm bombing.

27
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:27.920
I will tell you that bombed before a billion times, I'm doing fine. 60,

28
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.750
70% of the set 17 minutes in. I tell the joke where I say,

29
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.130
um, effectively, you know, I don't think being gay is a choice, which is,

30
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.920
I don't think it is at all. Uh, but this is how you know,

31
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:43.790
because there's gay black people and no one's going to choose to be gay if

32
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.640
they're already black. Right? No, one's doubling down on hardship.

33
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.780
That's a funny joke. Thank you. No worries. No, it's a funny joke. Thank you.

34
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.930
No one like no black dude ever wakes up it's up and thanks. You know what?

35
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:55.130
This black too easy.

36
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.670
I'm going to put on a Madonna halter top and some Jordans and tell the Indian

37
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:01.400
dude how to live his life. That's not a choice. That's you born that way?

38
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.330
And that it bombs like this silence.

39
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.010
<v 1>Really complete silence.</v>

40
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.000
<v 0>And then I say, uh, you're exactly who I expected to be as a crowd.</v>

41
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.960
And then I say, uh, um, the only person that chooses,

42
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:19.490
this is also what wasn't printed is that, that the offensive part to me,

43
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:22.220
what I think is offensive is the next part where I say the only person that

44
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.940
chooses whether or not to be gay in a daily basis is Mike Pence. Right. We.

45
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.190
<v 1>Can all agree that like, I don't know if he's.</v>

46
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.770
<v 0>Getting up, but no, man, Hey, it's homosexuals that much.</v>

47
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:34.400
If he himself is not a homosexual, he chooses not to be gay every day.

48
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:38.750
And that gets some laughs and applause and I'm like, okay, cool. And then, uh,

49
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.800
I get back into it. I'm rolling for about another two or three minutes. Um,

50
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.670
I started talking to some, I do a joke about, uh, how my dad landed in Newark.

51
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:49.550
When he immigrated to America, some girls from Newark,

52
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:52.580
she interrupts as Todd talking to her for like two minutes and that goes

53
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.250
terribly. It's just like, I'm trying to, I'm going fishing with her.

54
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.340
Just trying to see if I can get back into the, she interrupting. I'd say, I say,

55
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.660
I say a joke where I say my dad landed in Newark. Uh, back when he landed,

56
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.180
it was called brick city. Because if you hit, if you looked at someone wrong,

57
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.600
they'd hit you with a brick. Right. Fine. Kind of throw away line.

58
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.280
This girl goes, that's not true.

59
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.190
<v 1>I'm like, well, yeah. I'm like, obviously I'm just kidding.</v>

60
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.400
<v 0>Uh, but like I know where she's what she's trying to do.</v>

61
00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:22.230
I'm just trying to talk to her and I'm going,

62
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.400
trying to talk about like trying to get back into material. Um,

63
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.830
and that's like probably minute 20 or something.

64
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.970
And then out of my corner of my left eye,

65
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.560
I see the three girls that invited me to do the show initially in may or June,

66
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.230
like gather. And I'm like, that's kind of strange.

67
00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:42.510
I still talk to this girl for like another 30 seconds.

68
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.910
And then as I'm concluding my talking to her,

69
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.040
cause I to realized that's not going to go anywhere.

70
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.730
They come on stage with microphones and like one trench coat.

71
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.100
And they're just like, I feel like it's time.

72
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.400
It's literally to say there's been a chain thanking.

73
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.080
The mesh has been a change in program. Um, you know,

74
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:02.850
we've received some comments from members. Um, you know, uh, we think, uh,

75
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.520
that's enough. How long have you been on stage for uh,

76
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.690
20 something minutes at this point? And it was that one joke that did it.

77
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.180
So there's so I go, I'm like, I'm first. I'm like,

78
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.270
I'm S I'm not even mad at this point. I'm just like in shock. I'm like,

79
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:18.000
this is like an episode of impractical jokers. And I'm just like, what is,

80
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.450
what are you talking about? I have still have 45 minutes left, um,

81
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.200
gum slated to do an hour. And I'm like, really what? And they say, yeah,

82
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:28.710
there's been comments. Like people are upset or offended. And I'm like,

83
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:31.440
I feel like we're having a good time. And some of the crowd cheers.

84
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.310
And then I'm like, why do I got to go? And one of the girls goes,

85
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:39.630
the tech has to leave. And I look at the tech as this is all on YouTube.

86
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.490
Like someone put the YouTube video out of this particular part and I go,

87
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.980
they better be leaving. Cause I can see,

88
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.640
I can see the tech people and I'm looking at them like you got a bounce dude.

89
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.170
And the tech.

90
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.950
<v 2>People, meaning the people that are coordinating the electronics, the tech cast,</v>

91
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.690
the show. Exactly. Whoever's.

92
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.650
<v 0>Running. Am I going? I don't need tech. I don't know, pyro.</v>

93
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.800
<v 1>Microphones on. What do you mean? The tech has to go tech people have to,</v>

94
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.753
they're coming up with lies.

95
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.750
<v 0>I mean,</v>

96
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.170
I understand why she lied because she's trying to save face and not like,

97
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.200
try not to embarrass me or whatever, but I'm like,

98
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.140
I'm not going to believe that, that all three of you came out, they'd be like,

99
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:18.810
the tech has a gun. And then I go, um,

100
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.740
is it because the tech has to leave or because I'm saying some things that made

101
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:27.480
people uncomfortable and one of the other girls goes, uh, there's a,

102
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.930
we think there's a distinction between being uncomfortable and being

103
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:31.830
disrespectful.

104
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.420
<v 1>And I'm like, don't use your big words on me.</v>

105
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.470
<v 0>But, but in my brain, I'm like, what, what, what are you talking about? Like,</v>

106
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.480
I don't think I've been disrespectful at all.

107
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.750
And there are some people who are like, what the is going on.

108
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.480
Majority of people are like, what the is going on? And, but like,

109
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:55.610
there's a pocket of the crowd where the three, uh,

110
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.060
Asian American Alliance leaders,

111
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.210
like the rest of the sort of crew was like waiting.

112
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:02.720
And I think some of them cheer when the other there's a distinction between

113
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:04.940
disrespectful and being uncomfortable. I'm like, what are you talking?

114
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.610
I haven't been disrespectful in the slightest. What are you talking about?

115
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.140
And then one girl goes,

116
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.840
we think you're not entitled to be making some of the jokes you're making.

117
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.340
<v 3>And I'm like, I'm like, my, my.</v>

118
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.040
<v 0>Trigger word is entitled. You know? Like I'm, I'm thinking.</v>

119
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.110
And at this point I'm like, I'm too, almost in shock deer in headlights,

120
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:25.600
kind of to like even processed anger. I'm just like,

121
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.420
now I'm just trying to assess what they're specifically saying,

122
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.610
like which jokes specifically. And they're like,

123
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.930
we think that gay and black joke, um, uh, is particularly offensive or whatever.

124
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.960
And I'm like, and then at this point I'm like,

125
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.460
instead of explaining that the joke is quite progressive. I'm like,

126
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.720
I literally got that joke from an audience member at standup New York in like

127
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:47.650
2011.

128
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:50.800
Like I remember the conversation distinctly because it was such like one of

129
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:53.800
these sort of, oh, that's a good bit moment. Right.

130
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.050
And I tell them that and they were like

131
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.170
talking to a guy in the crowd.

132
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:02.710
So I was on stage and I used to live in hell's kitchen, um, in New York.

133
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.330
And I'm like the, there's like a gay black constituency that would always like,

134
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:10.210
make fun of me when I was like leaving my apartment. But like, like ribbing me,

135
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:12.040
you know what I mean? Right. And so like,

136
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:15.460
I'm Tom trying to talk about that on stage at standup New York doing like a

137
00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:18.040
check spot or whatever. And I'm talking to, uh,

138
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.950
the crowd and then there was a gay black guy that like heckled me.

139
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.880
And I started talking to him and then at some point I'm like, this is how,

140
00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:27.660
you know, being gay, can't be a choice. Right. And he's, he starts dying.

141
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.740
We have like a good rapport. I'm like, oh, perfect.

142
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:33.550
This is a great bit that I just got. Right. And so I tell them that,

143
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.950
and they're like, no, you know, there's been a change for you.

144
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.700
Like you have to go. And I'm like, effectively. I'm like, like,

145
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.610
you're wrong for doing what you're doing right now? Um, I'm,

146
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.550
I'm a generation older than you guys.

147
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.870
I know comedy better than anybody in this room. That's where God shore.

148
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.230
And I no disrespect. And I I've been through a lot of. Like,

149
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.170
I know that what I'm saying right now, uh,

150
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.740
hasn't been offensive in the slightest. And I say,

151
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:04.000
you can't isolate yourself from the real world. Like, what are you going to do?

152
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:07.450
When, when some real bad happens in the world,

153
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:09.250
like if someone actually does something that's offensive,

154
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.130
like you can't handle things this way. If you silence someone that's not,

155
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.370
that's not progress or whatever. And then they ask, we have.

156
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.340
<v 1>Our closing remarks, you have closing,</v>

157
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.010
closing remarks and she'd have prepared.

158
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:23.500
So that was just hard to come up with closing remarks. I didn't know,

159
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:24.550
on the spot I tried.

160
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.320
<v 0>To save it. I tried to save it with a bit, you know, and if bonds.</v>

161
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.220
Yeah. I'm like, all right. And, uh, just,

162
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:37.450
I'm like still talking and then they cut my mic and I'm like, really?

163
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.720
I'm like, really? Really? You cut my alright. And then I'm like, all right,

164
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:44.860
thank you. Put the mic down. And I bounced. And then they try to,

165
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.230
then they won't even let me talk to them backstage. Like one, one member's like,

166
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.400
we got to escort you out. I'm like, escort me. I'm six foot, one Indian dude.

167
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:58.320
Like I need escort from you. Tiny person. Like, I'll be fine.

168
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.710
I'm not here to fight anybody. Even though I was, this is not the.

169
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.340
<v 1>Movie. So are they escorting you out because they want to kick you out?</v>

170
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.660
Or are they worried about your safety?

171
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.840
<v 0>That's called me out because they wanted to take me out. Right, right, right.</v>

172
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.450
And so I go to, um,

173
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.830
w I have a camera crew there because I'm trying to film every hour that I do.

174
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.090
And I go to them and I'm like, what the F what? Just,

175
00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:23.790
if you watch a YouTube clip, I'm like on stage. Like, I look at them,

176
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.440
I go to them. I'm like, and then some of the members from the Alliance try to,

177
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.420
uh, uh, talk to me. Um, like, we're so sorry that that happened. Like, uh,

178
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.940
you know, that's not all of us or we don't know what just happened.

179
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.231
And I'm in my head,

180
00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:39.260
I'm like thinking so much for the Alliance part of this whole thing. Right.

181
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:42.260
Like I thought we were saying, people I'm flushing, you know, like we come from.

182
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.780
<v 2>The same place. So there's no other jokes. They found offensive.</v>

183
00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:45.290
That was the only.

184
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.470
<v 0>One. That's what they said. There's, there's, there's, uh,</v>

185
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.080
like two or three things that said like, um, articles,

186
00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:53.990
which I made the mistake of just reading everything like don't ever do that

187
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.890
don't ever do that now.

188
00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.350
And I read everything and I like this two or three articles that say,

189
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:03.770
like, I was badgering, uh, two people in the crowd.

190
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.650
And there's like one girl who like maybe two or three minutes in, like,

191
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:09.410
I talked to her for Crowdwork like I asked where she's from, what she's doing,

192
00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:11.960
whatever. And she goes, she gets up, like,

193
00:10:11.961 --> 00:10:14.270
she stands and like shells herself off to the crowd.

194
00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:17.480
I make fun of her for a little bit. And then this other girl, the one,

195
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.310
the newer chick that is like, we get personal because she reveals that,

196
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:25.190
you know, her father is not in her life. The conversation just gets awkward.

197
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.220
It's not, she revealed that her father's not in her. I'm like, she was,

198
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.650
I'm talking about, I'm talking to her. Like, uh, um, I was like, what are you,

199
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:36.710
what are your parents do? Or whatever. And she's like, she's like,

200
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:39.050
I don't know what my dad does. I'm like, what do you mean? He's like, oh,

201
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:41.120
I don't know him. I'm like, oh, you, but you don't,

202
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.670
he's not in your life or whatever. He doesn't. And she was like, yeah.

203
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.620
I was like, okay, I can sense that.

204
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.590
She's uncomfortable now to the point where I asked her, I was like,

205
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.840
are you uncomfortable? And she said, no, I'm like, okay, cool.

206
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.200
Cause I can make this worse. And then I'm like, but I won't,

207
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:55.910
you seem like a nice person. That's when they came out.

208
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.710
But the people are apologizing to me and I'm like,

209
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.620
um, now I'm mad now. I'm like, once I leave the stage, I'm now live it. But I'm,

210
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.330
I know myself well enough to be like,

211
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.540
I'm not going to talk to anybody if I'm angry, because I'll just say some wild.

212
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.930
Like I don't, I felt I could have bill bird, Philadelphia to whole thing.

213
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.650
You know what I mean?

214
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.660
This just went off on all these people for like 10 minutes,

215
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.670
but what the is wrong? But I just went, I was like, I gotta go. Like, I'm out.

216
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.020
I took my crew and we just, we just walked straight out of this giant hall.

217
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.320
And, and then like,

218
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.310
I'm waiting for my car and people from the show or like, like apologizing,

219
00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:37.430
not like just audience members. Y'all we're so sorry. We know what that was up.

220
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:41.510
That shouldn't have happened. You were doing great, whatever. And then like, uh,

221
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.680
I get in my Uber to the, my next show after this,

222
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:50.420
I have to do another hour at another show. And where, where are you going next?

223
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:53.330
Did you see be east and lower east side from, from Columbia to lower.

224
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.940
So it's like a 30, 40 minute ride.

225
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.860
And we hop in the car and like, I'm like, first my texts,

226
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.740
my agent I'm like, this just happened. And he's like,

227
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:06.910
do not say until you get paid. I'm like, that's probably the right move. Uh,

228
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.030
cause I'm about to just Instagram, something like that.

229
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.300
<v 1>Yeah. He's the man tack the shackles. He.</v>

230
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.630
<v 0>Was do not say until you get paid. I'm like, you're right, man.</v>

231
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.250
And I'm just like in my head, like mad listening to like Drake,

232
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.050
just like I got a lot of enemies that I'm just like everything that I think is

233
00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:32.130
wrong that we hear as like a narrative of like, kids are soft,

234
00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:35.280
all this kind of is playing. And like, yes, that's what it is like.

235
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.430
And I'm thankful that my crew was there because I'm,

236
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.480
I'm venting to them because if they weren't there I'd be on some other.

237
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.080
And, but as I'm checking my Instagram, cause I'm like,

238
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.940
this is definitely gonna be a story on Instagram at the very least. Um,

239
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.370
like people are DM-ing me from the show like, yo,

240
00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:55.500
we're so sorry that that happened. That's so up.

241
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.320
People are emailing me the same. I'm like anybody.

242
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.960
<v 2>Saying, you, you shouldn't have been there in the first place. No, no.</v>

243
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.400
<v 0>One said that to me at a one girl who was the suite mate of, uh, uh,</v>

244
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.050
uh, one of the organizers DME and just like yelled at me basically.

245
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.110
And I just I've ever, I wrote to her, thank you for your support. Like,

246
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:17.340
you know, just like she say, she said on the phone,

247
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.550
do my DMS just blew up. Uh, this Twitter, Instagram, Instagram,

248
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.630
and she, my Instagram is not like deleted from my phone,

249
00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:29.970
but she was effected it from your phone. I delete,

250
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.640
I check it in the morning and then I delete it and then I check it at night and

251
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:36.960
I deleted it again. Real. I just hate. So when I was at SNL,

252
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:41.430
I worked on update. Um, and so like I was constantly on my phone or on Twitter,

253
00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:45.540
on Instagram, just like checking news, reading. And like, it,

254
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.080
it annoyed the out of me. I hate the news lo and behold,

255
00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:52.590
I am the news now for a bit, but like I, I hate the news. It's all.

256
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.930
And like being in this cycle has confirmed my belief that it's all

257
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.890
nonsense, but she effectively says, um, uh,

258
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.250
I hope you learned your lesson of, um, uh,

259
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.720
respecting what you were hired to do and respecting strong young women, uh,

260
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.550
check your ego. And I just say, I was, I was like,

261
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.503
I,

262
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.740
it took all of me not to just be like just the viscera rate because I'm like,

263
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.900
I'm good with, well, I'm not good, a lot of things, but I can,

264
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.100
I can eviscerate somebody in an Instagram DM. Um, and so I didn't,

265
00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:28.350
I didn't say to her besides thank you for support,

266
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.640
but all these people are messaging me like, yo, we're so sorry that happened.

267
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.050
And like, I'm like, all right, I'm not totally with all these kids.

268
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.060
And I go to this show at UCB east and like I'm taping the out an hour.

269
00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:46.320
So I can't even process what just happened because my instinct is just to talk

270
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:50.790
about this immediately. Right. But I can't because I have to tape this hour.

271
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.270
And so I get off stage and the hour goes well, and I,

272
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.260
as I'm leaving UCB,

273
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:02.210
east three kids that were at the show at Columbia had come down

274
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:05.390
from Columbia and followed me to UCB east. And they came up to me,

275
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.510
apologize in person. They're like, we're so sorry that happened. Like,

276
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.140
we loved your set. Like we didn't know what the is going on. And that took me,

277
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:17.000
that gave me like a beat to be like, all right. You know, like maybe,

278
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.470
maybe everyone isn't this way. Maybe this is a people that have the bull horn.

279
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.430
They get to just say whatever the they want and silence people that are like the

280
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:28.430
minority, but they're like the, the vocal minority.

281
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:29.870
Whereas like all these people that are like,

282
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.040
actually on my squad are not as vocal as they can be.

283
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:37.220
They're more like quiet and apologize in person.

284
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.480
And so the next day, um, I don't think anything about it,

285
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:45.200
but like the Columbia newspaper hits me up. Like I got off,

286
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.790
I leave Columbia at nine 30, the Columbia newspaper hits me up at 10:05 PM.

287
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.170
Like, Hey, do you have any comment? I'm like, comment, I'm hungry.

288
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.030
How's that for a comment? Like I don't w well,

289
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:58.190
I'm not gonna talk to you right now. Let me process.

290
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:01.670
What's going on the next day. I'm still thinking about it,

291
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:06.590
but I'm going down to open for Aziz in Atlantic city and, uh,

292
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.070
open for him. And I'm telling him this story and he's,

293
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:15.020
he immediately hits on the fact that it's crazy that these kids came up to you

294
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:16.850
and apologize. And I'm like,

295
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.770
I didn't even think about how insane that is because I'm still mad,

296
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.190
but I'm thinking I'm talking to these kids, like I'm talking to Zs.

297
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.024
And just like,

298
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.080
that is kind of crazy because it's so easy to buy into the that everyone is a

299
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.800
soft. And then I think about it some more.

300
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.460
And I think about like all the gigs I've done college wise before,

301
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.300
like in the past year, I've been lucky to know. I did like Texas.

302
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:44.690
I did a school in Alaska. They have school in Ohio to school in Maryland.

303
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.940
And I said, much more offensive. Like anti-Trump in the redness of states.

304
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.800
And it's all been fine. You know? Like I've never been kicked off stage before.

305
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.550
And so to me, like this Columbia incident,

306
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.290
even the students there seemed like the exception rather than the rule

307
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.460
of like, everyone's a soft person. You know what I mean? Does that make sense?

308
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.810
It.

309
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.060
<v 2>Does make sense. But what I think is,</v>

310
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.920
is young kids in particular that are in a position of power, right?

311
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.880
They're wanting something.

312
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:20.170
They have this idea of how people should behave that they want in their head.

313
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.870
And when you don't fit that mold,

314
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.780
then they just decide to be outraged.

315
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.870
<v 0>Yeah. That's what happened here.</v>

316
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.600
<v 2>You still get the context of what you said, first of all, you're a comedian,</v>

317
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.440
right? You're obviously a guy who jokes about. Right? So that's not a,

318
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.130
you're not saying anything negative about black people or saying anything about

319
00:17:39.131 --> 00:17:42.430
gay people, right. You're, you're essentially admitting that it's a hardship.

320
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.833
I mean,

321
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:48.340
we all agree that black people experience racism and gay people experience

322
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:52.050
homophobia. Everybody agrees that. Yeah. So that joke makes perfect sense.

323
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.870
And it's funny. Thank you. I mean, it's, it's, it's stupid.

324
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.160
What they're doing is stupid. It's like, but that's normal, man. Dude,

325
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:02.790
that's been going on forever. I stopped doing colleges a long time ago.

326
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.410
Like the early two thousands.

327
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.220
I did a college in Florida and I remember thinking these,

328
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.740
they don't know enough. Like this is not fun.

329
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.750
Like the only reason why I would do this as for money.

330
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.660
Cause college has paid a lot of money, but they don't know enough.

331
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.880
They're there. I mean, they should, if they,

332
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.690
if they're 18 year old kids and they get to a club that has an 18 year old, uh,

333
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.360
limit, we can get in at 18, they should do that.

334
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.950
And then there'll be with other 30 year olds and people with life experience.

335
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.270
I don't want to,

336
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.530
I don't want to perform at the whim of children.

337
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.700
And that's what these are.

338
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:39.720
These are children who are engaging in recreational outrage.

339
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.580
They're deciding to be outraged.

340
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.620
<v 0>Yeah. That's what it felt like with, with them particularly,</v>

341
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.240
it felt like, like I grew up fine. I grew, I didn't grow up rich,

342
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.060
but my parents had some money for a bit before things went north.

343
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:57.530
Like we're average, middle-class people. But like, to me, it's like,

344
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.790
I've been through some life.

345
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.900
And so I know when people who haven't been through life get upset about.

346
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:08.090
It's always like the thing with Texas and Ohio and Alaska is

347
00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:10.790
like, these are like the kids of blue collar people,

348
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.790
the people who have been through some and maybe not even just blue collar,

349
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:17.060
but people have been through some kind of life where a life experience where

350
00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:21.080
they know that things aren't just like words can hurt.

351
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.300
But for the most part, they're fine.

352
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.630
It's like when like your dad loses is his job.

353
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.060
<v 2>Well, it's also, it's the intent of what you're trying to do.</v>

354
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.070
Like what are you trying to do? You're trying to get laughs.

355
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.530
You're telling jokes and trying to get labs. That's what you're.
