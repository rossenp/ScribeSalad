00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>Is it better for you that you're kind of,</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:05.010
is it better to be sad about it somehow?

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.040
Is it better to be regretful or just ignore the fact altogether?

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.800
Or why is it not okay. That I'm happy about what I eat.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.590
I know the story of it really well.

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.210
Like I understand the history of wildlife in this country.

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.410
I don't want to say better than anybody, but sure. Better than most. Um,

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.000
I know where we've been.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.750
I have a good sense of where we're going in terms of American wildlife,

10
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.720
what the challenges are for American wildlife, right?

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.030
I'm involved in this stuff on a daily basis.

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.710
I can know all that and I can see my place in it. Right.

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.540
I can see what my actions are and whether my actions are

14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.420
helpful or hurtful for something that I care a great deal about.

15
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.910
And if I can know that well and get a

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.230
deer, a bear or whatever,

17
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.040
and have it be food and find that I'm like really happy to be involved in that

18
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.360
that somehow is off putting to people, but it's okay to be that it's,

19
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.620
I'm blind to it.

20
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
I have this nagging sense of guilt about it that I haven't reckoned with.

21
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.530
I don't really know about it. You know? And that's like the,

22
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:11.790
that's like an acceptable position for some people to have.

23
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.210
It's really hard for me with people that are, that,

24
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.320
that are contributing to animal death, who,

25
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:22.110
who want to condemn those who are more willing to, or for whatever reason,

26
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:25.680
willing to excited about taking part in the process themselves.

27
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.050
I got to find a way to, I got to find a way to, to, to engage with it though.

28
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:33.560
And I need to get a better understanding of it because it's the, the, the,

29
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.010
the debate isn't going away.

30
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.970
I can't keep brushing it off as so ridiculous that it doesn't warrant my time

31
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:42.510
because clearly it does warrant my time to understand that perspective.

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.910
I just haven't had anybody really give to me in a good way.

33
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.580
I have people say like, oh, but they were raised to be eaten.

34
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.010
That's a foolish perspective.

35
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.530
<v 1>That's that to me is way, way worse. It's a life condemned.</v>

36
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.400
I'd probably rather talk to Rick Google. Uh, Glenn Greenwald is a vegan,

37
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.360
probably.

38
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.340
<v 0>Rare to talk to someone like Ricky Jarvis about it. Cause I,</v>

39
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.830
I assume that he's articulate about.

40
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.760
<v 1>It. Yeah. He's articulate. I don't think his position is a nuanced. I don't,</v>

41
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.770
I don't. I think there's some willful ignorance.

42
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.420
That's a part of people that eat meat, but condemn hunting, uh, willful.

43
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.740
And the fact that, like I said,

44
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:18.500
they know that they're going to get a certain reaction out of people when they

45
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.620
tweet about it on social media. One thing,

46
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.260
if you're talking about someone who's out there shooting things and not eating

47
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:28.220
it. Okay, I get it. I'm with you. If, if some guy's shooting an elephant,

48
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.010
cause he wants his tusks, I'm on your side. I get it. But if,

49
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:36.290
if someone chooses to hunt, you know, and an animal fill in the blank,

50
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.030
that might be a goat, might be weird to you that they're eating this thing,

51
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.030
but they're shooting this. It's an invasive species.

52
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.290
It's actually very delicious. It's very edible prized for its meat.

53
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.900
By some communities. You don't make any sense.

54
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.900
You you're doing this because you know that other people are ignorant about it

55
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:54.291
as well.

56
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:57.950
And either you're ignorant because you've never bothered to look into it or

57
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.610
you've bothered to look into it. And you were ignoring the nuance.

58
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 0>Yeah. In the case of the goat thing, there's, this is a little added thing.</v>

59
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.140
There's an added element that our government on the federal level is

60
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.974
involved.

61
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.850
There's a lot of state wildlife management agencies that are involved in trying

62
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.470
to do a wild goat eradication projects

63
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.000
on islands. Yes.

64
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.960
This is something that's ongoing all the time in Hawaii and many other places

65
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.530
where we're we're, we're like out helicopter gunning. Yeah.

66
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.550
Helicopter gunning for invasive species.

67
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.420
<v 1>Explain to people how those goats got there in the first place.</v>

68
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.650
Cause this is also very weird.

69
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.590
<v 0>Um, a variety of ways, but a lot of things were a lot of island species.</v>

70
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.090
This is one way it happens where invasive on islands would be

71
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:49.320
introduced by seafarers whalers,

72
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.240
who would, uh,

73
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:56.160
want to establish food resources along transoceanic

74
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.150
routes so that you could put something there and come back and get it later.

75
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.710
Early way, like, like whalers used to come out of the, the,

76
00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:07.570
the American Northeast, like all those famous whaling villages in,

77
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:12.090
in new England, you know, they would go down and stop in and like,

78
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.460
you know, stop in and the Galapagos, whatever,

79
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:18.420
and gather up tortoises that they could flip over in the whole of a boat.

80
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:20.580
And the tourists stay alive for months on its back.

81
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.590
And you'd have like a fresh meat resource.

82
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.960
And as people came to understand scurvy and realizing that fresh meat,

83
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.100
um,

84
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.080
gives you enough vitamin C to avoid scurvy that you can

85
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.670
get from dried meat. Cause you know,

86
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:39.060
the way the vitamin C behaves through the cooking and drying process,

87
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.781
but like fresh meat,

88
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:43.110
you can keep from having scurvy meat became even more important then,

89
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.440
but people would come in and you'd like, cut some sheet blues, cut some goats,

90
00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:50.370
loose on an island and know that they're gonna breed and build up a big

91
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.600
population. And that can be like a place you stop in and get food. Um,

92
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.140
and other things get introduced in other ways. And of course, animals move,

93
00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:01.470
you know? So you have one island that has close proximity to another island.

94
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:06.360
They can swim across the bump over and then it destroys native vegetation.

95
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.920
They trample birds nest.

96
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:12.360
And so you have in many cases where introductions of

97
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.530
non-natives particularly the non-native grazing animals,

98
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.480
non-native predators will wind up causing like a lot of extinctions of endemic

99
00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:23.610
species on islands and creates all kinds of problems.

100
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.820
<v 1>That's exactly what we're talking about with this, go in that picture.</v>

101
00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:31.740
So this is an animal that must be killed if you want healthy wildlife on

102
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:36.000
that island, the native wildlife and the native fauna, the flora,

103
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.150
all this stuff that lives there, all this stuff that's supposed to be there.

104
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.100
You got to kill the goats. Otherwise they'll.

105
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.330
<v 0>Eat everything. I think people look, people look and they, they, they, they,</v>

106
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.760
they, they look and they're like, I don't buy that.

107
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.060
That was the motivation of that person.

108
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.370
What I care about is motivations of individuals. I think you're right,

109
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.490
because when California got rid of mountain lion hunting,

110
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.990
they're still killing several hundred mountain lions here a year.

111
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.820
People are comfortable with like the total lion kill. Didn't change.

112
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.600
Much people are comfortable with a state agent or someone.

113
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.120
<v 2>Being paid to.</v>

114
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.350
<v 0>Go out and kill lines.</v>

115
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.680
They're not comfortable with someone paying who wants to go do it.

116
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.530
<v 1>I don't think they realize,</v>

117
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.230
I don't think they realize that state agencies are killing as many mountain

118
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:23.500
lions in California as they are. I don't think people understand that.

119
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.970
I think people do understand if something gets put on the ballot, you know,

120
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.090
would you like to re-introduce mountain lion hunting, people would go crazy.

121
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:34.240
Like, why would you do that? Mountain lions are beautiful. They're exciting.

122
00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:37.390
I want to see them. But these are people in Santa Monica.

123
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.020
You know what I'm saying? They're not people that are living, you know,

124
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.300
an hour outside of Bakersfield.

125
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.780
And they got 16 mountain lions in their backyard and a year that's,

126
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.490
this is different kind of world. You know,

127
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:52.480
if they're in the attached P mountains out there and you see mountain lions all

128
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:56.140
the time, they have a lot of mountain lines. Yeah. And there's an issue. And.

129
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.960
<v 0>There's a problem too, that I view this is coming from,</v>

130
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.160
there's a problem. I think a lot of people have a very hard time empathizing

131
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.630
with people who might be negatively impacted

132
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.280
by wildlife as well in the, in the question of the lion issue. Right.

133
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.180
Where it's kinda like this idea, like, well, you better suck it up, right? Yeah.

134
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.750
So if you're a rancher and you're running cattle in the area where you're losing

135
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:25.270
a lot of cattle, the wolves and Grizzlies, um,

136
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.640
people will look and be like, you better suck it up, buddy. Like,

137
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:34.960
I can't really picture your problem, but your complaints are not legitimate.

138
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.120
Well, they can't, if someone were to cut a,

139
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.040
if someone were to cut a grizzly loose and golden gate, state park. Right.

140
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.840
I don't know. Um,

141
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.190
I think that people would have w would come to have a different perspective

142
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.310
on that to put it mildly. Yeah.

143
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.070
But it winds up being that you look and people are,

144
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.490
they don't really want to hear about other people's problems if it doesn't,

145
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.610
if it doesn't jive with their understanding of what problems are.

146
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.010
And that is area where the issue around grizzly bears and the delisting. So,

147
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.300
you know, they were delisted,

148
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:11.740
they were removed from endangered species act protection temporarily, um,

149
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.030
because they had met all recovery goals. So when we look,

150
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.460
what was the recovered population look like? Um,

151
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.690
they mapped out what it would look like.

152
00:08:19.691 --> 00:08:23.560
And we've exceeded that for many years now. And they were de listed, but then,

153
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.780
uh, Wyoming and Idaho moved to have a very limited hunt on them. Um,

154
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.460
and then they were a federal judge blocked the D listing and they went back and

155
00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:34.030
listing.

156
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.620
<v 1>It was the federal judges motivation.</v>

157
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.360
<v 0>Well, you want to hope that, uh,</v>

158
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.180
that they didn't have one. You wanted,

159
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.810
you want to think that they were just looking at, you know, the details of it.

160
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:51.580
But I think there's a suspicion that that person went into that knowing

161
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.150
sure what they were going to do, you know? Uh, but,

162
00:08:56.151 --> 00:08:58.410
but you don't really know. I mean,

163
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.800
th th a lot of these arguments around they come down to like technicalities,

164
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.860
right? No, one's arguing that the population's recovering.

165
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:05.811
<v 1>Well,</v>

166
00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.500
there's also the argument that the judge is probably trying to protect his own

167
00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:13.160
reputation because the amount of blow back that a judge would receive for

168
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.840
allowing a hunt to go through is vastly different than blocking a hunt,

169
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.330
blocking a hunt. You're not going to get that much, blow back.

170
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.740
You'll get a few people that are upset,

171
00:09:21.741 --> 00:09:23.570
but it hadn't been an established resource.

172
00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:25.370
It's not like you're taking something away from people,

173
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.420
but if he allowed it for the wildlife, people would go bananas.

174
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.290
<v 0>On this guy. They, they tend to like, and I don't even call them. And like,</v>

175
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:34.820
I don't call them environmentalist.

176
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.050
Like the people who Sue to block the delisting of recovered species,

177
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.380
uh, they'll masquerade is, you know, ecologically conscious environmentalist,

178
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:49.700
but they're just people who it's, it's untenable to them. You know,

179
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.490
they can't that they're never going to accept the idea that,

180
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.850
that you're going to have human exploitation of this resource, right.

181
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.670
That they masquerade as their, they have an environmental motivation,

182
00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:01.610
but it's not, it's like it's an animal rights motivation. Um,

183
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.700
there's a very, there's a,

184
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.890
they have a sensitive ear in a certain federal court, you know, a Missoula.

185
00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:13.130
And so you'll see a lot of these cases around wolves and Grizzlies they'll get

186
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:15.890
that. They'll want that done through that court.

187
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.710
They know that they're probably gonna have a friendly take on it.

188
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.641
I think it was a real,

189
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.130
it was watching that happen and that's had been happening recently.

190
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:25.940
I think it was a real, a real travesty because, um,

191
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:31.970
there's a couple of things that happen like culturally in areas where you'll,

192
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.530
you create a lot of tension with people where there's people that are,

193
00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:38.360
are living amongst these things.

194
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:43.310
And they're looking for some level of some level of relief and they want to see

195
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:46.970
it go to state management. And they might want to see the state exercise,

196
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:51.470
some control over where certain populations of large predators are spreading

197
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:55.610
into. And when it winds up being that their, like their voices are not heard,

198
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.451
you know,

199
00:10:56.451 --> 00:11:00.710
and they feel that people from far away are really heavily influencing decisions

200
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:02.120
that affect them on a daily basis.

201
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.850
It winds up creating like a lot of animosity toward the species to where like,

202
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.980
think about what happened with the spotted owl, right? The spotted owl,

203
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.700
no one can see it, no one perceives the spotted owl as owl anymore.

204
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.870
The spotted owls become like a symbol of federal overreach.

205
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.230
And you'll find that like, you know, wolves for awhile,

206
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.090
they become like a symbol of a dispute and people stop liking the

207
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.970
animals much. And it becomes like this like contentious creature.

208
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.820
And I think that we're going to head that way. If we keep,

209
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.100
if we keep stepping in,

210
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:37.280
on wildlife issues with the mentality that we've been approaching,

211
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.660
the Wolf and grizzly issue in the Northern great lakes, the Northern Rockies,

212
00:11:41.661 --> 00:11:45.230
soon to be in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. Now I think you're.

213
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.380
<v 1>Dealing with local and then you're dealing with national, right?</v>

214
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:51.080
So the local people are going to have an issue with it because they're going to

215
00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:54.400
be impacted by it. It's going to be directly impacting their life.

216
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.770
Dogs are going to be killed while, you know,

217
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.150
w they're they're going to take domestic cattle and all sorts of different

218
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:03.220
things. You're gonna have real issues with, uh,

219
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.910
the people that like to go elk hunting, the populations have diminished rapidly,

220
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.500
but the rest of the country doesn't give a, no people in San Francisco,

221
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:16.300
they don't give a about it. People in Chicago aren't impacted by it. If, if,

222
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.020
especially if they don't have anyone in their family that hunts or anyone that

223
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:22.960
has a background in hunting, and they don't have a background in it themselves,

224
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.213
they don't care.

225
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.830
<v 0>No people really don't. And I pointed out all the time, but, um,</v>

226
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.920
that I care about the availability and been an abundance

227
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.750
of deer elk, moose, caribou, right?

228
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:40.980
Like I care about the resource.

229
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:44.910
There's a lot of people who rely on the resource, use the resource,

230
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.470
their major economic drivers. Um, I'm definitely I'm anything, but I'm like,

231
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.060
I regard myself as a pro Wolf person, I regard myself as a pro grizzly person.

232
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.900
I cherish every interaction I have with those animals. I.

233
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.580
<v 1>Love to be around in them a resource.</v>

234
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.310
<v 0>I don't have a problem with calling resources to people,</v>

235
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.880
but people do have a problem with calling a resource. And, um, and, and yeah,

236
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.810
I'm, I'm like pro I'd like to in suitable habitat, I like to see them present.

237
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.700
I also like to see that I also like to see them manage in the way

238
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.700
that allows for abundant wild game resources. Yeah.

239
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.350
<v 1>What's going on house passed the bill to drop legal protections for gray Wolf.</v>

240
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.780
<v 2>As passed today. Whoa. Or, yeah, will this interesting was two hours ago.</v>

241
00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:28.140
So.

242
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.600
<v 0>Well, roll down a little bit. Okay.</v>

243
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.710
<v 1>Republican controlled house passed a bill on Friday to drop legal protections at</v>

244
00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:40.350
gray wolves across the lower 48 states reopening a lengthy battle over the

245
00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:44.670
predator species long despised by farmers and ranchers wolves were shot trap

246
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.760
poisoned out of existence in most of the U S in the mid 20th century,

247
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.530
by the mid 20th century,

248
00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:53.030
since securing protection in the 1970s wolves have bounced back. Well,

249
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.580
that's not really exactly what happened. Great lakes of Michigan, Minnesota,

250
00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:59.520
and Wisconsin as well in the Northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest.

251
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.310
That's sort of, but they're not talking about the reintroduction.

252
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.320
The reintroduction is the big issue, right? Well,

253
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.490
and that's what people have great issue with. Well.

254
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.010
<v 0>The other, the reintroduction is only in one area, the, the great lake,</v>

255
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.070
the Northern great lakes, uh, that was not a re-introduction. There was,

256
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:13.820
you know,

257
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.900
a sizeable population movements of wolves coming down from Canada and coming

258
00:14:17.901 --> 00:14:22.670
back in the Northern CA the court Northern continental divide ecosystem,

259
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.110
not a re-introduction you had a famous yellow. Yeah, well, yeah.

260
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.080
The famous case of the famous reintroduction in Yellowstone national park,

261
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.341
highly viewed.

262
00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:35.300
Now it's widely viewed now that if you wouldn't have done that you would have

263
00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:39.350
had, had you not done that re-introduction you'd have had a natural flow anyway,

264
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.280
and natural flow from Canada, you would have got it. You would have,

265
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.470
you would have, eventually you would have eventually have gotten there anyway.

266
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.650
<v 1>Interesting. But would they have gotten to the exact same levels?</v>

267
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:53.090
<v 0>No, no. At this particular point right now, and I think that'd be like,</v>

268
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:56.270
laughable the Aquacel they'd be there now, but I think, but, but people,

269
00:14:56.271 --> 00:15:00.560
there's no realization that you would have that without the reintroduction you

270
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:05.180
would have through natural movement have eventually gotten, you know, do.

271
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.510
<v 1>You to think that that's, uh, that,</v>

272
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.420
that supports the idea of the re-introduction?

273
00:15:10.421 --> 00:15:12.730
Do you think the readopt introduction was well thought out?

274
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.351
<v 0>I don't want it, you know,</v>

275
00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:17.050
I'm not going to debate the merits of the reintroduction. Like I said, um,

276
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.280
my perspective on it.

277
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.920
<v 1>It should be in a place where it supports them.</v>

278
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.800
<v 0>Yeah. My perspective on it is I, I don't, uh,</v>

279
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.660
the idea of extinction and regional extirpation sickens me.

280
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.500
I do not believe in, um,

281
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.970
I do not believe that like, as a people, as a culture,

282
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.310
we can justify or afford to remove species of

283
00:15:42.311 --> 00:15:45.970
wildlife from the landscape, um,

284
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.660
native species of wildlife from the landscape. Uh, like I said,

285
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.640
the idea is sickens me. I like to, uh, you know, I like to have, um,

286
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.890
all native wildlife present on the landscape, so

287
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.500
I don't oppose it.

288
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.840
What I oppose is the thing that's happened now is

289
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.040
getting where we have populations that we agree, like,

290
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:15.100
what will recovery look like? And at what point, when, what,

291
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.640
how will we manage all the different viewpoints that are coming in all the

292
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:18.911
different,

293
00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:22.450
like interests of all these varied stakeholders and at what point where we get

294
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:26.410
in there and manipulate the situation that we're creating, um,

295
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.820
I just would move that in a different direction where I think that w that

296
00:16:30.821 --> 00:16:33.790
recovered species, right, in this case,

297
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.230
when we're talking about wolves and Grizzlies,

298
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.610
I think that you should have that if you can do it in a sustainable way that

299
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:42.460
doesn't have long-term deleterious impacts on the population,

300
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.350
do they should be managed as a renewable resource.

301
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.000
<v 1>See, this is where people are going to have issues. Don't have anything,</v>

302
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.530
just even the term,

303
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.880
you manage them as a renewable resource. You mean,

304
00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:55.590
shoot them and kill them and use their fur.

305
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.370
<v 0>Sure. I think that, I think that recovered species,</v>

306
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.340
that I think that if you put something on the endangered species act and it goes

307
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.740
under federal protection, um,

308
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.390
and then when it re reaches recovery and the U S fish and wildlife service says

309
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.240
it's recovered, it's time to hand it back to state management.

310
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.600
If a state then decides that they're going to do some limited harvest,

311
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.070
particularly, let's say they're,

312
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.430
even if they're focusing on areas where there's like very high prevalence of

313
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.530
human animal conflict, and the state decides to do that in some like, minor way,

314
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.950
as a way to service the needs of certain segments of their population that wants

315
00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:32.784
something to happen.

316
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.680
I don't think that then some like an activist judge or,

317
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.520
or environmental groups or animal rights groups should come in and be like,

318
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.181
well, nevermind,

319
00:17:42.181 --> 00:17:44.970
we're going to pretend that they're not recovered now because we want to prevent

320
00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:47.190
the state from doing something that we think is unsavory.

321
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.361
<v 1>Well,</v>

322
00:17:48.361 --> 00:17:53.100
the thought behind the people that support blocking the hunt is that

323
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.790
if you leave these animals alone, naturally, they're going to find balance.

324
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.490
And that the wolves will kill the elk until there's not enough elk for them to

325
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:03.720
sustain their populations.

326
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.650
And the numbers of their offspring will dwindle and they'll get to some sort of

327
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:08.930
a sustainable level. Yeah.

328
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.850
<v 0>But we already, I mean, we live in a LA,</v>

329
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.560
we live in a heavily manipulated kind of land kind of manmade environment.

330
00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:18.590
Now, um, the idea that things are gonna,

331
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.460
that we would just let things run their course and watch what happens.

332
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.060
Isn't going to happen. You're still gonna have, um,

333
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.330
a lot of Grizzlies every year are still going to get in trouble.

334
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.030
They're still going to get killed. You're still going to have mortality.

335
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.940
You know, you're, you're going to have tons of grizzy mortality in tough areas.

336
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.900
Um, but they're going to kill these. Aren't acting in packs. That's all,

337
00:18:38.901 --> 00:18:41.000
but they killed them, but they kill cattle and they come up,

338
00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:43.340
they brought up against humans. It's just like, it's a Neville.

339
00:18:43.341 --> 00:18:46.610
You're going to have some that you're not going to let it run. As a,

340
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.960
as a person, as a hunter. I also don't have a problem with,

341
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.400
and actually support as a hunter that we would, you know,

342
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.600
while allowing wolves to be present on the landscape that we would mitigate

343
00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:03.080
their impact on big game. I don't mind saying,

344
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.790
I don't mind just coming out and saying that I like to have high populations of

345
00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:11.900
big game animals that are available to hunters. And also at the same time,

346
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.190
sharing some of that resource there, having the wolves on the ground, doing it,

347
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.990
um, don't want to see them gone. Not anti Wolf, not anti grizzly. It's.

348
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.880
<v 1>Just one of those where it's it's because a Wolf is so much like a dog</v>

349
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.880
and because there's not a great history of people eating.

350
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.760
I remember you telling me about one mountain man, where his favorite food was.

351
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:32.690
[inaudible].

352
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.240
<v 0>Stefansson, who's an Arctic Explorer. What.</v>

353
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.980
<v 1>A crazy. That guy must've.</v>

354
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.610
<v 0>Loved. Wolf meat. You ever tried.</v>

355
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:45.320
<v 1>It? No, no, no, but you've eaten coyote, eating Kyle. So you've eaten a species.</v>

356
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:45.710
No, I've.

357
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.190
<v 0>Never, I've never killed a Wolf. Never killed a grizzly bear. Hm.</v>

358
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.170
Just haven't haven't eaten either of them. I, at one coyote. Yeah.

359
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.310
Didn't ate it. Didn't like it haven't messed with one since.

360
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.700
Yeah. You said that was similar to diver duck too, right? That was Remy.

361
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.190
Remy felt that it tastes like bad diver duck.

362
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.630
I diver ducks and still eat diver ducks. But no, I haven't. No, I haven't. Uh,

363
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.830
haven't done that anymore. And then, um, haven't included any coyote recipes in,

364
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.680
uh, there's no coyote recipes in the wild game cookbook, either.

365
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.950
<v 1>It might be the ultimate one that people are going to have a problem with it at</v>

366
00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:25.490
the very, that might be where the rubber hits the road. Well, you know.

367
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.220
<v 0>In some places become a moot point because Idaho, Wyoming,</v>

368
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.200
Montana, um, all have state management of wolves. Yeah.

369
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.710
All of the things that were all these horrible things that were going to happen

370
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.770
when the state's resumed management of wolves didn't materialize.

371
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.280
<v 1>Right. But those places also have a rich history of hunting.</v>

372
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.290
<v 0>Yeah. But it was, it was going to be the end of the wolves. Right.</v>

373
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.510
And it hasn't been in the first few years,

374
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.880
in the first few years of the wool seasons you actually had,

375
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.630
you actually saw the populations go up. Well, it's so hard to hunt them. Right?

376
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.780
Well, they, it winds up being the, uh,

377
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.050
putting that with that little bit of hunting pressure on them really changed

378
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.420
there. It really changed their movements and changed the way they perceive human

379
00:21:12.421 --> 00:21:16.410
threats and they adjust to it pretty quickly. Um, but it hasn't led to,

380
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.130
you know,

381
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.060
I think a lot of people look in those cases where it was pretty effective,

382
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.490
you know, it was very effective to bring in,

383
00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:25.770
to bring in limited regulated hunting,

384
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.320
had the desired effect on how walls are using landscape and,

385
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.480
and ways in which they were interacting and involved and avoiding humans.

386
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.170
I have no doubt too. I have no doubt too. Like it'll,

387
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.740
the situation will probably in the Northern great lakes, they,

388
00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:42.090
they had state management, law, state management,

389
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.060
like it bounces back and forth. You're gonna, you're going to eventually,

390
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.010
let me kind of depends on how the political winds blow,

391
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.500
but you're eventually going to wind up with it there.

392
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.520
And you're not going to see wolves vantage from the landscape. You know,

393
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:58.080
you does not. If grizzly bears wind up doing it, you're still gonna see,

394
00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:01.200
you're gonna see gradually expanding populations of grizzly bears to fight.

395
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.800
Despite the fact that they're using limited harvest to achieve certain

396
00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:07.020
management objectives is not going to be the end of the world.
