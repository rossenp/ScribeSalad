00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 2>So that's gonna be this summer. They do you wanna do it with crowds?</v>

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.120
<v 1>That's a good question. I don't know yet.</v>

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.080
So the Japanese prime minister made an announcement public statement saying,

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.520
Hey, listen, we're gonna host the Olympics this summer, no matter what,

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.680
one of the interesting things about it is, although it's happening in 21,

7
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:20.320
they're still calling it Tokyo 20, 20. Oh, wow.

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.630
Think they were saving face for all the marketing material that they already

9
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:28.470
made. That cost them billions of dollars, right? To change the zero to a one,

10
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.110
is that really worth 5 billion or whatever it would cost. That's interesting,

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.150
but it's going to be interesting how they figure it out because the Olympic

12
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:41.980
village is like a town there's 10,000 coaches and athletes from every country

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.380
on the face of the planet,

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.420
all put into a one mile radius on this Olympic campus.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.060
And there's just so much interaction engagement. I'm talking the,

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.900
the cafeteria at the Olympic games is five football fields long.

17
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.460
They've got what? A McDonald's um, like a,

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.050
a full size McDonald's in the cafeteria, in the Olympic village.

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.330
They've got foods from all different parts of the country.

20
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:13.050
You've got an Italian station, a Japanese station, American station, you know,

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.810
and a Panafric station. They have, it's insane.

22
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.450
You have literally thousands of people swirling in at all times. It's 24 hours.

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.000
How go get a big Mac in a, at the McDonald's station all times, bro.

24
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.720
Like for, if you're coming from America, you can go down the street. There's a,

25
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.080
McDonald's within, you know, a mile of anybody while you're here stateside.

26
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:33.720
But if you're coming from one of these smaller country,

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.840
you coming from Guinea basal or you're coming from, I don't know, Qatar,

28
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:41.040
like you're like, McDonald's sounds pretty good. I don't get this at the crib.

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.430
Let me go ahead. Grab me a little quick, couple McChickens,

30
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.350
couple double cheeseburgers, put 'em in the room. Yeah. But you would think.

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.950
<v 0>That's always,</v>

32
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.070
but someone competing in the Olympics would want to fuel their body with the

33
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:53.070
best possible food, but available.

34
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.030
<v 1>Some of them know they can't win. Like, okay. You know,</v>

35
00:01:56.031 --> 00:02:00.150
like everyone going to the Olympics, isn't expecting to win a medal like 90.

36
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.780
I say 90%, large, very large percentage of competitors at the Olympic games.

37
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.380
It's a long shot for them to get on the podium.

38
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.100
They're going with the expectation like, Hey, listen,

39
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.580
I'm representing my home country with pride.

40
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.580
I am going to a country that I've never been before. Hopefully I can be on TV.

41
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.220
My family will be watching me back home.

42
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.820
The opening ceremonies is the best experience for them.

43
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.530
Cuz they get to be in a full packed arena around all the athletes that they've

44
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:30.610
seen on TV. But they know that realistically they're not gonna win.

45
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:35.250
So when that McDonald's is open 24 hours, they're like, let's go, bro,

46
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.250
we're going here. Do they have.

47
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.330
<v 0>To pay for it free?</v>

48
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.490
<v 1>Oh, that's good. Everything's free. That's good. So it's, it's uh,</v>

49
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:45.080
it's an interesting perspective. Being the Olympic villages. It's a cool spot.

50
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.880
It's gotta be a.

51
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.520
<v 0>Wild experience to be there. It must feel.</v>

52
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.200
<v 1>Surreal. It's wild. It's it's wild.</v>

53
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.280
So they're really strict with the way that they administer athletes

54
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.320
and, and people to get in. You have to have a guest list.

55
00:02:56.321 --> 00:03:00.440
If you wanna bring anyone in, they have to be approved seven days in advance.

56
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.720
So let's say my wife, I'm like, Hey,

57
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.480
I want my wife to come in to the Olympic village, check out our living space,

58
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.080
check out the free McDonald's.

59
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.120
Then I have to put her on a list seven days in advance.

60
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:13.920
And it has to be approved by the us O P C and then also, you know,

61
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.840
the IOC. Wow. And so it's, it's a,

62
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.910
it's a very &lt;laugh&gt; million athletes in the bro.

63
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:24.270
They're not planned dog. I'm telling you, I'm telling you Joe, like they get it.

64
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.470
They get it in after his done after. And he's like, oh.

65
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.190
<v 0>After he was done. Well, that makes sense.</v>

66
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.830
<v 1>He's he's taking that home with him. He's put,</v>

67
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.910
he's putting that all in his suitcase. He's gonna go start a &lt;laugh&gt; uh,

68
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:37.710
little McDonald's of his own when he gets back to the crib. But it's uh,

69
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.900
so when you get, you have to,

70
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.860
it's almost like going through TSA at an airport, you gotta show 'em your badge.

71
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.723
They scan it.

72
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.900
You gotta get all your bags checked and make sure that you're good to go.

73
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.820
You don't have any, you know, thing lethal in your bags. You get inside.

74
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.900
And it's literally like an apartment complex, huge apartment complex.

75
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.820
Look at line.

76
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.730
<v 0>That lot. McDonald's is the most popular restaurant. That's crazy.</v>

77
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.250
<v 1>They're listen. That's a, and they're not, they're not,</v>

78
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.370
they're not getting salads in chicken selects. No, you know,

79
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:09.450
they're getting burgers,

80
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:14.050
cheeseburgers and McChickens and single listen you saying, I,

81
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.290
I listen, Hey, whatever you need to do to be the fastest man in the world,

82
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.223
do your thing.

83
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.440
<v 0>Well, I guess also like when you're done,</v>

84
00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:23.640
you probably just wanna treat yourself. Sure.

85
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:26.160
You're probably been eating very strict for a long period of time.

86
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.520
<v 1>Yeah. Crazy. I, that was my, when I won the gold in 2012,</v>

87
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.200
my first meal afterwards was McDonald's &lt;laugh&gt; very first meal. What ya,

88
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.720
what ya have?

89
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.960
I had double cheeseburger with a high sea orange to drink and a large fry.

90
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.560
So crazy story. I'll tell you this story.

91
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.110
So I win the Olympic gold right after you win,

92
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.110
they take you back to what they have like a media house.

93
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.950
So it's got all of the publications from all over the world.

94
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:52.950
You've got AP sports illustrated, NBC, you know,

95
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.710
just pretty much everything.

96
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.030
And so you go back and you just bounce from room to room. It's like, okay,

97
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.660
we got Al Michaels here. We got Bob Costas here. We got, you know,

98
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.180
Joe Rogan here. And so you go, you show your medal.

99
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.740
You tell 'em about your experience, where you're from, who you are,

100
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.580
what you're gonna do with all this money and fame that you've just won.

101
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.220
And then so soon as you're ushered out of there,

102
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.180
you competed at eight o'clock and you don't get outta there to close to

103
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.740
midnight. So by the time it's midnight and London,

104
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.060
really the only thing open is McDonald's right?

105
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.450
So I'm still in my podium outfit. Like literally what I wore on the podium.

106
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.810
I'm still in it at midnight. And so we go down to like Piccadilly in,

107
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.850
in London and the only thing's open is at McDonald's.

108
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:34.650
And so we went to like a club for a little bit.

109
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.050
One of my sponsors at the time had like bottle service.

110
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:40.050
They wanted to celebrate me. So we leave there we go to McDonald's.

111
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.400
I get inside and packed clubs. Just let out.

112
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120
Everyone's like hungry. They're hungover.

113
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.440
They just got done for the night full of drinking. They're all in line lines.

114
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.680
Crazy. I go into the McDonald's I'm like, I've been this long day.

115
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.960
I wrestled all day long. I do not wanna stand in line.

116
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.240
I just want to see if I can work my way to the front. So I go and ask the guy.

117
00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:04.640
I'm like, yo bro, listen, I just wrestled all day. &lt;laugh&gt; at the Excel center.

118
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.280
I just won Olympic gold. Like you think I can get in front of you?

119
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.440
And he's like, you ain't win Olympic what stop? And I'm like, bro, I'm like,

120
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.280
I won the Olympics. He's like, no you didn't &lt;laugh&gt;.

121
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.030
And so I had my medal in my pocket. I have my gold medal in my pocket.

122
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.750
So I pull my gold medal out and show this guy he's like starts going nuts.

123
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.110
Oh my God, this guy. So he's yelling everyone.

124
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.550
He's pushing people out of the way in this McDonald's he's like this guy just

125
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:32.590
won Olympic gold medal. Let him to the front of the line,

126
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.710
let him to the front of the way.

127
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.860
And so he's pushing people in the out the way gets me like literally escorts me

128
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:43.860
to the front of the line to get me my quarter pounder and my large fry.

129
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.860
Wow. It was, it was wild. That's.

130
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.620
<v 0>The craziest cheeseburger fry story ever.</v>

131
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.300
<v 1>Cool. It was, it was dope. It was awesome.</v>

132
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.980
<v 0>That had to be very memorable. Yeah. It was fun. Wow. It was fun.</v>

133
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.180
Winning the gold medal. What I mean, I know you've won the world championship,

134
00:06:57.181 --> 00:06:58.014
but times.

135
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 1>Four worlds, one Olympics, the but how much difference? Nothing like it.</v>

136
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.770
Olympics are the best. It's it's rare. It only happens every four years.

137
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.810
It's a single day event. So you have to be your best on that single day.

138
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:13.650
You only get one cycle to prepare for.

139
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:16.850
So we think of our careers like cyclically, where like in a,

140
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.040
if you're an M and may fighter, you're like, okay,

141
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.200
I can get an opportunity to fight for the belt.

142
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.720
As long as I continue to compete at a high level, like keep my brand awareness,

143
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.600
um, at a, at a good place. But in wrestling,

144
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.280
the pinnacle is the Olympic game.

145
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.720
So no matter how many world championships you win, you want that Olympic gold.

146
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.150
And the crazy thing is the worlds are harder than the Olympics.

147
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:44.510
So the Olympics are a little more condensed in terms of the qualification

148
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.630
process. So at worlds it's much easier to qualify.

149
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.590
So you have 42 guys in your weight class or in your bracket at worlds.

150
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:56.190
You only have 16 at the Olympics. So in the world championships, I won in 2015,

151
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.500
I wrestled six matches the Olympics I won in 20, only 12.

152
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.540
I only had four matches. And so, and it's,

153
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.260
it's a random draw too. So you could wrestle Russia first round,

154
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.140
which would suck, or you could wrestle Puerto Rico first round,

155
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.820
which would suck less. Uh &lt;laugh&gt;. And so it's a,

156
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:19.850
it's a really interesting experience the way these brackets are drawn on.

157
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.370
And I think that the Olympic games has become so special because of everything

158
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.570
surrounding it. You get more money, more notoriety, uh,

159
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.850
more recognition moving forward, like winning the goal in 2012,

160
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.010
catapulted me to where I am right now.

161
00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:38.130
Like when I'm recognized or announcing an event,

162
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.800
it's always affiliated with that Olympic gold Olympic gold medalist,

163
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:45.160
Jordan bros. Like they always tell you, whenever you step off the podium,

164
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.080
you will forever be an Olympic gold medalist. You can't lose that.

165
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:52.800
You can lose your belt, right? You can never lose your gold. Right.

166
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.200
It always comes home with me at the end of the day,

167
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.360
no matter what I do moving forward. So that's pretty cool.

168
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.600
<v 0>That is an interesting perspective, right? Because if you're a fighter,</v>

169
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.600
you win the title and then you lose the title in your next fight.

170
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:05.520
You're a former world champion, former world champion,

171
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.000
but a Olympic gold medalist from 2012,

172
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.960
put the former gold medalist to say Olympic. Yeah. That's that's it's dope.

173
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.990
Yeah. You made it through you did it and that's it. Then there's.

174
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.230
<v 1>Another guy who it four years later. So yeah, it's uh, it's interesting.</v>
