00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 2>I watched, uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.960
Restrepo last night because of what's going on in Afghanistan. Do you,

4
00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:13.480
do you know, EPPO Sebastian Young's, uh, film on Afghanistan. Yeah.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.760
Just sort of, um, just put it in perspective,

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.590
like what's going on over there now. And, um, the it's, you know,

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.510
I mean, books are amazing for putting things into perspective,

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.990
but there's something about a documentary,

9
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:31.310
especially a boots on the ground documentary by a journalist like Sebastian

10
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:36.150
younger and in Afghanistan while Afghanistan is falling to the

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.830
Taliban. So it feels so it's so intense when you're watching it. And you see,

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.700
you know, guys in the beginning of the film that wind up dying and it's, uh,

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.380
first, first of all, I, I forgot, like, I think you,

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.100
you have a sense of what they mean when they talk about these mountainous

15
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.050
areas, this in mountainous terrain, that's impossible, really of control,

16
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.290
cuz it's very difficult to traverse, very difficult to get around.

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.810
I don't think you really understand it until you watch that film until you

18
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.650
really, you see the mountains and you look, oh God,

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.490
like how is anybody ever gonna control this area? Like,

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.090
no wonder why the Soviets failed. No wonder why we failed. No wonder why,

21
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.240
you know, the people that live there, they,

22
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.280
they just they're living in an incredibly

23
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.400
difficult environment in terms of like,

24
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:34.680
just getting around mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. I.

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.720
<v 0>Remember some statistics about like 99% of people in Afghanistan.</v>

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.710
Afghanistan. I sound like Brian Kaen I honest time &lt;laugh&gt;

27
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.710
uh, uh, I ran Iran. Yeah. I never know how to say it. Yeah. Uh,

28
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.710
I remember like 99% of them didn't know nine 11 happened.

29
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.750
So like they're completely disconnected from the world. Even.

30
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.990
<v 1>That's so crazy that.</v>

31
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.990
<v 0>Like even things that seem relevant.</v>

32
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.180
<v 1>To did you watch the videos to day of people trying to climb a board planes and</v>

33
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:08.460
falling to their deaths? The planes are taken off.

34
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.820
These guys are hanging onto the landing gear and as the landing gear pulls up,

35
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:13.340
they're falling to their death trying.

36
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.173
<v 0>To save themselves.</v>

37
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.420
<v 1>Yes. Trying to leave with the Americans. It's</v>

38
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.540
crazy. Just the chaos at the airport is CR you haven't seen any of this.

39
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.970
Haven't.

40
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.770
<v 0>Seen, I, I actually have not been paying attention.</v>

41
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.170
<v 1>What? Jamie show him some of the, the videos cuz it's it's heartbreaking.</v>

42
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.210
There's one. This is like, yeah,

43
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:38.130
these are people just literally climbing all over these ladders,

44
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:41.330
doing whatever they can trying to force himself onto these planes. And,

45
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.010
but the really one is, look, look, these guys hang,

46
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.680
hanging on the landing gear, watch this like falling through his death.

47
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.440
It's. Wow. Yeah. And look at this.

48
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.320
I mean crazy,

49
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.120
all these guys trying to stop the plane so that they can get on board.

50
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.920
I mean, this is just a tremendous failure.

51
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.160
It's so heartbreaking. Yeah.

52
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.993
<v 0>But what do you do?</v>

53
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.480
<v 1>What could be done differently? Right? That's the real question like could have,</v>

54
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.110
uh &lt;affirmative&gt; could they have designed, uh,

55
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.430
a better withdrawal plan that scaled over time

56
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.750
where they gave, uh, uh,

57
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:33.230
particularly the people that helped the American military over there

58
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.590
that they're very vulnerable right now. They're they're in a lot of trouble.

59
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.540
Could they have protected them better? Could they have something?

60
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.500
Could they have designed a plan?

61
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.900
That's what most people who are criticizing this believe the people that

62
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.020
actually understand what's going on over there.

63
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.500
They think this idea of pulling out immediately.

64
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.220
<v 0>Yeah. But half the world is living under authoritarian regimes.</v>

65
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.940
So the question is how do you help those people? How do you help? You had a,

66
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.170
a nice, sophisticated,

67
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.050
deep historical conversation with Andrew Schultz about North Korea. But are.

68
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.890
<v 1>You being sarcastic? Yeah. That's a little.</v>

69
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.370
<v 0>Bit of sarcasm there. &lt;laugh&gt; I, I love him. He's hilarious. I'm just joking.</v>

70
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.730
He is.

71
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.450
<v 1>Hilarious. But he was uh &lt;laugh&gt; he was going hard to paint. Yeah. A little bit.</v>

72
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.450
<v 0>But he's but like how do you help? He's having fun. Well, the, the, the CRI the,</v>

73
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.080
the one sort of, of, uh, sophisticated criticism, there was, well,

74
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.120
what the hell do you do about it?

75
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.040
<v 1>Right? What do you do about North Korea? Well, what.</v>

76
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.840
<v 0>And there's, there's a lot of places like that.</v>

77
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.320
North Korea is probably the worst or one of the worst,

78
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.080
but there's a lot of places where the leader,

79
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.150
the government is abusing its people. Do you do about it? The, uh,

80
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.870
the whole cryptocurrency, Bitcoin people say,

81
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.150
maybe you can change the money. You can give people power by,

82
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.590
uh, like one of the ways government controls its people is the monetary system.

83
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.230
So you can like swap out, try to give people power through the money.

84
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.190
That's one way that's interesting. Uh,

85
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.660
the obvious old school way is military, uh, and,

86
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.660
or also maybe economic pressures, but then it becomes,

87
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.020
it becomes difficult cuz you take on that project and then you get the thing

88
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:17.180
that you get in Afghanistan. And you know,

89
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:18.580
it's a project that takes 10 years.

90
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.420
It takes 20 years and then ultimately it's not successful.

91
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.290
<v 1>So what do you do? Afghanistan situation is so crazy because, uh, you know,</v>

92
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.970
Biden was on television just a little while ago,

93
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:31.890
talking about how there's 300,000 armed

94
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.410
Afghanistan, soldiers that were trained by the United States.

95
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.170
And there's only 75,000 Taliban. There's no way that they're gonna fall,

96
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.890
but they never fought. They just gave up like instantly.

97
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.960
<v 0>Yeah. Right.</v>

98
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.640
<v 1>You know, it's like the,</v>

99
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.960
the whole situation is very confusing to someone who doesn't understand it.

100
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.440
If you're, if you're a guy who fought over there too,

101
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.240
it's gotta be insanely frustrating. People, spill blood over there.

102
00:05:57.241 --> 00:05:58.760
People lost limbs over there.

103
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.120
And then they're seeing how quickly we just pulled out and then abandoned ship.

104
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.080
Like what, what was, what was that for?

105
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.400
<v 0>Well, we, we got into that war under false pretenses.</v>

106
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.840
We stayed without much transparency about why we're staying how many 20 years.

107
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.630
Yeah. Without, without a clear plan for the future.

108
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.750
And then we pulled out without a clear, transparent plan. Yeah. What,

109
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.950
but I don't know what lesson to draw from that,

110
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.190
except that we should never gone in, in the first place. That's,

111
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:33.030
that's the only sort of solid set of arguments you can have because,

112
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.590
and like why that place, you know,

113
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.950
it's the people that argue was all about oil and all those kinds of,

114
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.180
of things and minerals.

115
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.180
<v 1>And, and minerals and all sorts of natural resources. Right. And natural gas,</v>

116
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.660
like Afghanistan is a, it's a rich suppository of lithium,

117
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.580
I believe too. Right?

118
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.060
<v 0>Yeah. Natural. But then what, what about Iraq?</v>

119
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.420
Like what does that have to do with anything? And so you, you start,

120
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.650
you start questioning the whole operation,

121
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.010
the whole process of making decisions about foreign policy in the military

122
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.570
conflicts. Uh, you know,

123
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.250
what lesson do you draw from that when there's places like North Korea,

124
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.490
when there's many people in, in Africa suffering,

125
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.970
there's many regimes that are abusing its people there mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

126
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.560
then, then there's people that criticize Russia, uh, for,

127
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.080
for certain things in terms of, from an authoritarian regime perspective.

128
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.600
And then the big one is China. And then what do you do about that? And then I,

129
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.240
I mean, I do find the libertarian argument here.

130
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.200
The most sophisticated convincing is we should stay out

131
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.990
of other people's business until we have a really clear, good plan. And,

132
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.350
um, the, you know, the majority of Americans, uh,

133
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:49.630
given the transparent communication of what is going on and what we're going to

134
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:52.950
do, majority of Americans, uh, are behind this plan.

135
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.070
Otherwise stay out of it unless you have, you know, the, the,

136
00:07:58.071 --> 00:07:59.340
you know, when you have, uh,

137
00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:03.860
something like a Nazi Germany where there's obvious atrocities,

138
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.380
uh, happening, where there's an obvious war on the horizon,

139
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.140
then that's different. But.

140
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.140
<v 1>Everything else, well, if that's the case,</v>

141
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.620
then why aren't we invading North Korea?

142
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.420
If why park and all these different people that have escaped from North Korea

143
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.300
are telling the truth. That there's a Holocaust going on there right now.

144
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.570
I mean, they're, they're literally starving their people.

145
00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:24.530
They're putting their people in concentration camps.

146
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.770
They're having children born in concentration camps for the crimes,

147
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.730
their grandparents and their children will also be born these camps in

148
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:37.490
these prison camps. Um, they're starving their people. They execute them for,

149
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.640
you know, almost no reason they do whatever they want to them.

150
00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:44.040
They have full and total complete control over them.

151
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.320
<v 0>Well, the dark answer and the reason is because</v>

152
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.880
there's no way to do anything about North Korea without also doing something

153
00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:55.680
about China. Yeah. And that's,

154
00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.440
that's why we turn a blind eye to North Korea because,

155
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.320
um, I mean that's a deeply, I mean,

156
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.040
a war with North Korea or invasion of North Korea is an invasion of China.

157
