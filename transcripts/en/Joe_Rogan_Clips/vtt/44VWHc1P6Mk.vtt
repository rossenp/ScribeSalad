00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.380
What I find more interesting as what's happening now with the government study

3
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:09.510
that started here at skin Walker ranch.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.410
Also the one that was in the New York times and where the information is going.

5
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:16.980
Now, these are new times. Things are starting to drop to the public.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.530
<v 1>Starting to drop well. They, so.</v>

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.060
<v 2>The skin Walker story, lack of physical evidence that there may be.</v>

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.060
It comes to the attention of the defense intelligence agency. This guy,

9
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:32.960
the scientist who sees it, he goes to Bigelow. They go visit the property.

10
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.770
He looks around, he has an experience. He's not there 15 or 20 minutes.

11
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:40.070
And something appears inside a house that only he can see.

12
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.420
He doesn't say anything about it.

13
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.740
He goes back to Washington meets with Harry Reed in a skiff, uh, in,

14
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.200
in the Capitol and two other us senators.

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.090
He presents them as the proposal for a study of UFO's and related

16
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.070
phenomena, not just like a tip,

17
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.160
looking at flying saucers that encounter a us military,

18
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.830
but something more expensive. They put out a contract,

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.330
Bigelow bids on it creates an organization called bass. Again,

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.860
puts together a team of experts, a 50 or 60 employees,

21
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.710
and they start studying it. They go around the world,

22
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:16.520
they interact with other governments. They get their files. They send out, uh,

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.220
teams to hotspots to try to figure it out,

24
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.510
looking at whether there are connections between what we'd call flying saucers

25
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.480
possible aliens and all these other different phenomenon.

26
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.410
The program goes on for a couple of years and somebody yanks the yanks,

27
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:31.880
the funding and get this.

28
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.870
The reason that the DIA suddenly became worried about all this weirdness that

29
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:39.230
was being reported at a skin Walker and elsewhere is because they thought it was

30
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.064
demonic.

31
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.970
And they thought if this comes out that we're studying this weird phenomena,

32
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.870
a it's going to end up on the front page of the New York times, which it did.

33
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.300
And B we might be invoking Satan in here.

34
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:54.800
These were fundamentalist Christians in the Pentagon who pulled the money

35
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.850
because they thought it was the devil. I'm not making that up. That's hilarious.

36
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.930
<v 0>And the program now continues. They keep reporting that it stopped.</v>

37
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:04.010
It hasn't stopped.

38
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:08.960
The U S military has been studying UFOs since the beginning in every branch

39
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.120
of our military. They continue to do so.

40
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.460
And now every time they get caught in a lie.

41
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.740
So it is continuing tell them about it. It.

42
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.280
<v 2>Is continuing. So, uh, all SAPs money was taken away,</v>

43
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.230
but the [inaudible] program,

44
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:25.010
which is what Lou Elizondo headed up that looked just at military UFO

45
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:28.880
encounters, continued, Pentagon says it was ended. It did not. Uh,

46
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.560
it continued for a couple of years.

47
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.880
And after the New York times story comes out and creates this fewer,

48
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.180
it got funding and, and now has a structured organization.

49
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:42.530
And it is looking into cases where the U S military sees these things.

50
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:46.010
And off the coast of Virginia, they've been seeing this stuff.

51
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.600
I think Fravor talked about it when he was here,

52
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.690
these beach balls with the cubes inside of them.

53
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.420
And they were sitting there for hours off the coast,

54
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.980
right where our warplanes would go out for training exercises as if they wanted

55
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:02.320
to be seen. And it went, there were 70 or 80, uh, witnesses during, uh,

56
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.550
20 15, 20 16 pilots. Some of them were willing to talk about it. Some weren't,

57
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.840
it continues to this day. Now the program is on more solid footing.

58
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.430
Now Congress has been informed and they want to expand it and get more

59
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:19.780
information we are told the New York times is working on another followup story

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.610
to look into reports of what LaVar said, crash, retrievals, reverse engineering,

61
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.980
the existence of these metamaterials bits and pieces that grandpa had stashed in

62
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:30.910
a barn somewhere,

63
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.380
whether it's Roswell or other alleged crashes there took taking it seriously to

64
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.130
figure out if there's something about these materials that we could not have,

65
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.030
have created. Um, so the bass program,

66
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:47.980
the AllSat program created a baseline of what we know about the state of

67
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.330
our technology right now in different disciplines, uh, lift and,

68
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.780
and propulsion things of that sort. They commissioned 38 papers.

69
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.400
That would be the baseline for what the state of human knowledge was in 2009.

70
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.240
And, um, and those papers were published on a,

71
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.880
an internal department of defense, uh, website,

72
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.820
but they'd never been made public. Six of them have now leaked out.

73
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.530
And I brought along two more for you that have not been made public. Um.

74
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.010
<v 0>These are like scientific reports based on the government study of UFO's.</v>

75
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.710
Okay. So they commissioned these papers.

76
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.920
Only a handful have been released to the public.

77
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.080
George happens to have a fever. So you can,

78
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.130
you're going to be the first person outside of the program.

79
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.160
Other than me to see what is it called a dirt.

80
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.620
<v 2>This is a defense intelligence reference document.</v>

81
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.750
This paper is on meta materials.

82
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:43.230
So how you could engineer existing earth materials,

83
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.070
where you could duplicate what you're seeing up there. None of these papers,

84
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.010
two of them actually mentioned aliens, or UFO's,

85
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.990
they're strictly on what the state of our knowledge is or was as of 2009.

86
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.140
<v 1>And they referenced aliens and UFO only two of the papers.</v>

87
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.910
And how do they reference? Well, there's.

88
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.380
<v 2>One of the papers that looks at the physical effects of people that come into</v>

89
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:05.880
contact with these unknown craft.

90
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.810
And it's sort of like the effects of radiation or microwaves.

91
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.770
There are physical effects, hundreds of cases that have been investigated.

92
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.050
And that's what that paper looks at. And that's.

93
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.720
<v 0>Yeah, the harm that has done to the body,</v>

94
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:22.980
what they call close proximity to a UAP, which is a UFO.

95
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.090
There are known effects to the human body that are horrible.

96
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.210
And there was a study that focused on the witnesses.

97
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:34.530
They do know how close encounters like military people and then how it

98
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.850
negatively impacted their body. So each of these reports, as he obtains them,

99
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:42.600
or as people find them, they're very illuminating to what our government knows.

100
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.520
<v 2>There was one that looked at, uh, how you would track a hypersonic vehicle,</v>

101
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:51.330
traveling through space. How difficult would it be? Now? It doesn't say UFO's,

102
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.920
but it's looking at things that really travel fast that are coming in from space

103
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:58.070
into our atmosphere. How would you track that? Now,

104
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:01.970
when that paper was written in 2009, we didn't have hypersonic weapons. Now,

105
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:03.230
the Russians claimed they've got them,

106
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.920
and now it's very timely because we're in a rush to develop those things.

107
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.160
So that was one of the papers that I made public last year.

108
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.860
And I interviewed the engineering professor who wrote it.

109
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.020
He wasn't writing about UFO's.

110
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.380
He was writing about the state of knowledge about hypersonic weapons systems.

111
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.650
Back then, it's a similar thing for metamaterials. That's what this,

112
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.410
this paper is, is how would you engineer materials?

113
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.400
So you could travel through space that would have say you shoot it with the

114
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.350
microwaves and it could develop certain special properties. And so just.

115
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.860
<v 0>To put into context, maybe because, you know, here's the deal. Um,</v>

116
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.870
our government has now admitted.

117
00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:41.350
There are UFO's that that's the world we're living in they're unidentified

118
00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:45.220
objects or craft that seem to outpace outmaneuver,

119
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.080
actively jam our radar systems,

120
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.790
even go over our military installations of high sensitivity, their incursions,

121
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.230
all of this is now said, it's a different world we're living in. However,

122
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.640
the next thing that people are talking about now is, well,

123
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.940
we also have materials. We'll call them metamaterials materials,

124
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.700
materials associated with UFO craft.

125
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.400
They might even go as far as to say,

126
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.140
we have whole materials craft from somewhere. So.

127
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.050
<v 1>When they're saying we have materials associated from crafts,</v>

128
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.060
are they saying that they have a crash?

129
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.371
<v 2>Yes. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:26.080
I helped put off who was a physicist who worked with Bigelow on both needs and

131
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:30.580
bass made a presentation in Las Vegas in, uh, June of 2018,

132
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.860
or he says, yeah, we've got these materials.

133
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.800
And we're trying to figure out where they came from and how they were

134
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.551
engineered,

135
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:41.410
because some of them appear to be multilayered that are beyond what is known

136
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.210
engineering capabilities of humans.

137
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.140
It looks like they would've had to been made in say zero gravity of space.

138
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.690
And we don't have any manufacturing plants up there.

139
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.940
He implied that they came from crashes.

140
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.090
It doesn't mean it's a UFO from Zeta ridiculous.

141
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.910
It's crashed from somewhere and we don't know whose it is.

142
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.000
So they're trying to figure out whether we can duplicate it or not.

143
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.720
And I got a bunch of samples. And are, have you seen any of this? No,

144
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.470
I haven't seen Bigelow. And how have you.

145
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.340
<v 0>I've seen what people claim?</v>

146
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:13.420
So the army now has these metamaterials that were famously put in through the,

147
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:15.940
actually the coast to coast show, right? It was called arts parts.

148
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.040
I told you this last time I did,

149
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.960
I was able to obtain them briefly and have five scientists from

150
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:27.100
New Mexico that I knew material scientists, physicists, interrogate,

151
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.470
as they say the samples for numerous days.

152
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.400
I don't believe that I had access to the best equipment.

153
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.200
We didn't find anything extraordinary other people have. So right now the army.

154
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.110
<v 1>Has, but when you say you didn't find any, anything extraordinary,</v>

155
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.790
did you find anything ordinary? No, they weren't ordered. He said,

156
00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:46.690
these are the materials here. That's.

157
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.110
<v 0>The exact piece. One of the exact pieces that I had in my hands and,</v>

158
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.140
and worked on with my team and I filmed it all. But right now, because of, uh,

159
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.460
TCSA, they've made a deal with the army and I think the army has these parts,

160
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.340
but I feel like we're missing that. The big note here,

161
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.830
the big note is a few years ago,

162
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.600
UFO's are still laughable military. Doesn't look after that turns out,

163
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.020
we have programs that do I'm suspecting,

164
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:14.610
and maybe you can talk more about it.

165
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.690
That the next piece of information is that there are reverse engineering

166
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.524
programs,

167
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.950
which will then make everybody have to look at Lasar story a little bit

168
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.540
differently. Once again,

169
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.790
if we admit that we are trying to reverse engineer either materials

170
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.190
or actual craft from somewhere else,

171
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.040
intelligently designed metals or craft from somewhere else,

172
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:39.060
if there were a crash retrieval programs for vehicles with,

173
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:40.140
we don't know where they're from,

174
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.890
that's going to make me look at Bob story even more, even more differently. But.

175
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.580
<v 1>Isn't that a big F I mean, if, if they've, it's an interesting time, but it is,</v>

176
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:50.061
but I mean,

177
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:54.830
there's no indication that they're willing to discuss some retrieved craft,

178
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.550
right?

179
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.870
<v 2>Yeah. I think that's a heavy lift.</v>

180
00:09:56.871 --> 00:09:59.450
So supposedly the New York times they're working on that story,

181
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.840
I think it'd be pretty hard for them to, yeah, they are.

182
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.440
They've been asking people about this stuff, but I mean, to get that into print,

183
00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:10.020
to get a pastor editors, that's a hard deal ourselves. [inaudible].

184
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.630
<v 1>Material from the bottom of a wedge shaped craft in the late 1940s made of 26</v>

185
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.380
alternating layers, one to four microns, dark Biss.

186
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.780
Meuth said how you say that bismuth and a hundred to 200 microns of silver,

187
00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:25.220
magnesium zinc alloys.

188
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.480
Each of the six pieces received from the U S army source were formed with a

189
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.800
curvature that tapered.

190
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.900
<v 0>So basically they're saying for,</v>

191
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.820
there's no process that we know of that would create this alloy layered

192
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.940
in that type of layer system. I actually have a piece out about this.

193
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.670
<v 1>It's not kind of how they did samurai swords. Ooh.</v>

194
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.950
<v 2>Yeah. I, I, I'm not sure that this is alien of any kind. Uh, but it is, uh,</v>

195
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:50.930
of unknown origin and, um.

196
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.070
<v 0>Well, jock valet has like 20, as I said, last jock him valet.</v>

197
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.420
He's got like 27 samples of things associated with crash retrieval.

198
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.240
So if anybody has an archive of this stuff,

199
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.220
that's being scientifically interrogated right now.

200
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.290
And his studies do show isotopic ratios that are not from this

201
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:13.490
earth. So he's confident with his research, my big point, he's.

202
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.140
<v 1>Confident with his research of what?</v>

203
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.440
<v 0>Well, you'd have to talk. You should talk with Jacques, but he,</v>

204
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.960
but what is he confident of that you can see that he has,

205
00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:24.800
that he has alloys that came from UFO

206
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.090
crashes.

207
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.900
<v 1>Or run runoff. Has anybody independently analyze those things?</v>

208
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.920
<v 2>Yeah. He's got a presentation. He sent a whole teams of people.</v>

209
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.470
<v 1>Well, how come this isn't like public knowledge.</v>

210
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:38.240
Why isn't this the New York times you gotta.

211
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.460
<v 0>Get, you gotta get, gotta talk with Jacques.</v>

212
00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:42.620
Whether you have them as a guest or not gets you to talk,

213
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:43.910
how old is jock now it's getting,

214
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.860
it's getting up there because he's in his eighties.

215
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.340
<v 2>Yeah. I would probably have to go to him right. With a.</v>

216
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.250
<v 3>Hazmat. Where's he at? He's strong dude.</v>

217
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.670
<v 1>Where is he? San Francisco specifically? No, but.</v>

218
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.810
<v 2>Here's the thing that this program is ongoing. It doesn't have to find aliens.</v>

219
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.860
There are legitimate national security reasons to be looking at who these who's

220
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.850
flying. These craft.

221
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.170
These things are still being seen over our military installations. And our,

222
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.780
our Pentagon wants to know who's flying them.

223
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.770
And that's a perfectly legitimate inquiry, regardless, a little green men.

224
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.850
No one wants to say they're at the Pentagon that we're investigating UFOs and

225
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:25.180
aliens. Uh, they're just investigating. Where did these things come from?

226
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.240
Are they a threat? Can we duplicate that technology?

227
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.570
If the Russians or the Chinese get this stuff before we do,

228
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:35.320
if they can do what the tic-tac did, it's a game changer. Um,

229
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.910
so they want to know how whose it is and how we can duplicate it.

230
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:43.840
And that is a perfectly legitimate inquiry, whether there are aliens or not.
