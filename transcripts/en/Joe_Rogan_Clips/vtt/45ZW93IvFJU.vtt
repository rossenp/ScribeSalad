00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.060
<v 0>Your foot and your own tattoo on the app. Oh man. We're getting little kids.</v>

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.990
There's doctor nation. They're trying to get these kids to accept the numbers.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.000
When they come and collect us all for camps.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.500
<v 1>God, what was he saying the other day about robots? Was that what it was?</v>

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.830
You like said something like you, you, you tweeted him back.

6
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:20.664
Like something like.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.250
<v 0>LOL glitchy.</v>

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.480
<v 1>Yeah. What was that? That.</v>

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.730
<v 0>I love that guy, but sometimes he say that I just go, what? You need?</v>

10
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:34.500
Someone like me next to you all the time. That's what Alex Jones needs.

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.950
He just needs me to go, Hey man, what? Stop, stop, stop, stop.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.510
That might not be it. Some people need a rudder. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.510
And by the way, if I'm your rudder, you got a serious problem.

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.760
You got a serious problem.

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
<v 1>I was hoping that flat earth or was going to like the rocket ship.</v>

16
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.300
I was waiting. I was so excited for this.

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.470
<v 0>And he's done it before he shot himself, like 160 miles into space.</v>

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.340
Got really? No, he did.

19
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:05.880
I think he did shoot himself like 1.6 miles into the air,

20
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.860
something ridiculous in the past.

21
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:12.210
And he recovered took him like several days to recover from the

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.600
G-forces. I do believe that this is something that was in the article.

23
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.700
It might be something he said he might just be crazy.

24
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.450
<v 2>Trying to be like evil Knievel. He was trying to do a bunch of different things.</v>

25
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:24.600
And he jumped onto the flat thing about a year ago to gain money. He said,

26
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.890
he's trying to like jump a limo over a Gorge.

27
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.990
Sometimes like that when no one believes it for.

28
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.420
<v 0>A minute. How do you know? Oh yes, they do sort of a.</v>

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.400
<v 2>I read the article about it when it first.</v>

30
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.900
<v 0>Coming out last week. Yeah. You know what? I read one of the craziest arguments.</v>

31
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.670
Someone said one of the flat earth proponents said about it.

32
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.860
If this is going around, apparently. So forgive me,

33
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.030
forgive me if you've heard this,

34
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.370
but the idea that a ship doesn't really disappear over the

35
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:58.370
horizon, that you can always zoom in on it. If you just have enough of a,

36
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.240
of a powerful lens on your camera.

37
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.740
So they think that that in some way is proof that the earth is flat.

38
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.980
That's just proof of how far you can see. It's all it is. He likes,

39
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.930
you don't understand like the F the curve of the earth. It takes forever.

40
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.550
It's huge. Like you're I get what people are doing.

41
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.940
Like hokum. If you zoom out, you can see, well, you can't forever.

42
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.930
That's why he can't see Mount Kilimanjaro from your living room in Santa Monica.

43
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.940
Right? Dip. All right. It's like, it's a curve to it. It just takes a long time.

44
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.630
And you can't see the boat long before it goes over the curb.

45
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.890
Because unless you're talking about a giant boat and even a giant boat at 30

46
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:44.040
miles away, which is where you still be able to see some of it,

47
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.900
that's too far for your eyes.

48
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.980
So if you zoom in with some sort of a crazy spotting scope or something like

49
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:52.470
that, yeah. You'll be able to see it for a little while.

50
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.830
And then another couple of hours it'll be gone. It's going to go over the top.

51
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.110
Like, but they wanted to be real.

52
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.060
So they want it to be real,

53
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:05.860
so bad that they come up with these things that aren't true as examples,

54
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.920
why the earth is flat. And the big one was no, there's hug them.

55
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.200
Every photo of the earth from space is a composite.

56
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.010
You didn't even bother to look into it because that's not true.

57
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.170
There's a satellite that takes a high resolution photo of the earth.

58
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.310
Some like every 10 minutes, it's the hymn of warrior eight to Japanese style.

59
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.890
You could go online. You can look at the pictures.

60
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.870
It shows where every storm cloud is all over the country in real time.

61
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.740
So if there's a storm that's hit in Cuba, you go to that.

62
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.460
You look at that image from that day where the storm is, you'll see the storm.

63
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.360
Like it's all real. If you don't believe that's real,

64
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.940
do you believe that someone is so good at hiding?

65
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.950
That they've kept all the images of the flat earth from ever being published?

66
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.010
That no one has been able to treat in the history of people.

67
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.260
It's been able to travel past the ice wall,

68
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.700
into the nether region of hobbits and gnomes and picks the elves.

69
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.960
<v 1>It's just mental health. You know, we have a huge problem.</v>

70
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.200
<v 0>It's lack of education, it's lack of education.</v>

71
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:11.530
And then it's also being committed to these ideas,

72
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:15.760
to the point where they're a part of you, it's its idea,

73
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:19.270
identity politics. This is what it is when you,

74
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.570
when you believe in an idea so much that you don't,

75
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:24.910
and I've been guilty of this. And I think everybody has,

76
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:25.840
at one point in your life,

77
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.960
you've been guilty of not really looking at it for what it is,

78
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.800
but instead looking at it for what you want it to be and for what you've already

79
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:36.520
committed yourself to believing in. That's a big part of the problem.

80
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:39.940
A big part of the problem with people is you commit yourself to believing in

81
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.580
something. And then when you commit yourself to believe he has something,

82
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:46.810
anything that's contrary to that belief gets fought viciously.

83
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:51.130
You shut it down. You interrupt by all means necessary. You mock it,

84
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.030
you deride it. You don't examine it objectively. You don't look at it.

85
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.300
Objective. You just look for a way to shoot it down. Look for a way to on it.

86
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.140
Look for a way. If at any fall back on the government lies all the time.

87
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.420
I never believed them fall back on all these different positions.

88
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.530
But at the end of the day,

89
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.780
if you look at it from just like, well, okay,

90
00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:13.960
what's the most likely thing. The most likely thing is it's round.

91
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.020
They figured it out. They know it's round. You can see it from space.

92
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.040
They've taken pictures of it.

93
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.680
People have absolutely flying in the space station. There's videos of the,

94
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.620
the thing landing on the sky. People pulling people out of the water.

95
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.980
They've seen, they've gone into space. Okay? They've taken pictures.

96
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:34.030
This is all real. They're satellites. They're real. If you get satellite radio,

97
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:38.920
it's real. Okay. It's really from a satellite. When you get DirecTV, it's real.

98
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.940
It's in space.

99
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:44.500
It's orbiting the earth there's flight patterns that are

100
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.910
carefully calculated that are going around the earth.

101
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.070
Everybody would have to be lying. Do you understand how crazy it is?

102
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.950
I'm with you on a lot of conspiracies.

103
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.960
I'm with you on operation Northwoods.

104
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.040
I'm with you on the Gulf of Tonkin. You get me high enough.

105
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.270
I'll go area 51 on you. I'll go, Bob. Lasar I'll go. Uh,

106
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.960
I'll I'll I'll go deep on some like who the knows wacky.

107
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.550
You get to the earth being fat. And that's when I go,

108
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.640
you're just chasing your tail. You're chasing your tail.

109
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.720
These angry little pricks. Call me a shill.

110
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.840
They're just staring at your rounders. She'll shut off. What a perfect,

111
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:31.490
perfect advertising is. Advertising show be on jamie.com, dumb jamie.com.

112
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.040
Get yourself a round earth shield. T-shirt folks.

113
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.650
I have one all the time by Christmas, and they're very soft.

114
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.450
Cotton feels wonderful in this camp. Yeah, I think it's almost like a troll.

115
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.240
What's not man. I'm telling you. I used to think that too.

116
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.120
It started out as a troll. This is what I think happened.

117
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.680
I think it became an exercise in psychology from what I've

118
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.930
understand, one of understood and I might be wrong,

119
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.830
but from what little I've done poking around about this,

120
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.340
it seems like is might've started on four Chan.

121
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.960
And it might've started as a joke that there's always been a certain percentage

122
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:08.810
of people that believe that the world was flat.

123
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.430
There's always a certain percentage,

124
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.920
just like there's a certain percentage of Moonies.

125
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.410
There's a certain percentage of people that, you know, are Satan, worshipers,

126
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.731
resilient,

127
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:20.990
people just there's wacky beliefs and people get attached to these wacky beliefs

128
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.490
and they clean to them and this in whatever it is, whatever,

129
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.750
whatever the belief is.

130
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.360
There's a certain percentage of people that have always thought the earth was

131
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:29.990
flat.

132
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.910
But then what I read was that someone on four chance started trolling and

133
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:38.930
that by trolling and trying to post this fake evidence about the world being

134
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:42.740
flat, a bunch of people bought it and they ran with it.

135
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.030
And not only did they run with it,

136
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:46.310
they started to ramp it up and add things to it.

137
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.650
And flat earth theory became a thing.

138
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.980
And these people all decided that this was like a legitimate pursuit,

139
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.770
that there is some Illuminati, some group of Jews,

140
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.640
it's always Jews that are hiding all the information that somehow or another

141
00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:00.170
they've talked. All the mapmakers,

142
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.790
all the people that work in commercial shipping,

143
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.590
all the people that are flying airplanes,

144
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.530
all the people that are making satellites, anyone in aerospace,

145
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:09.020
all these people, all these people,

146
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.540
all these people are all together and they're all lying. Okay? And I am too.

147
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.520
I am too. Or maybe just listen to this.

148
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:21.470
Maybe you're chasing your tail and you confuse the out of some people that are

149
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:22.280
dumber than you,

150
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.050
because of your inability to look at what it is versus what you want it to

151
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:31.460
be. You heard me,

152
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.900
I'm not writing about everything. Don't get me wrong. Brogan.

153
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.520
You're I'm right about this.

154
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.240
There's no reason why someone would lie about the shape of the planet.

155
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.260
There's no benefit in it.

156
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.460
There's no reason why anybody would conceal that information.

157
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.840
There's no benefit. If someone found out the earth was flat,

158
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.830
they would be singing it from the rooftops. Any real scientist,

159
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.530
any real person has been in the space station.

160
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.620
And he real persons find the space shuttle. They're real.

161
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.520
I know you don't know them that I've met him. I had that, uh,

162
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.640
Chris Conrad guy, is that his name? Chris Hadfield, Chris Hatfield,

163
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.720
forget his name commanders. I blame the weed. Chris Hatfield.

164
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.071
He was wonderful.

165
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:16.860
He was in space for a long time is talking about the effects of it when he came

166
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:21.570
down and, uh, how, how, how bad it up his body. That was a fascinating podcast.

167
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.010
I remember how I got my finger gone like 40 minutes with him.

168
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.550
And then he had to go. It was like one of those quick little things.

169
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:27.570
And he was amazing.

170
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.040
You're talking to a guy that's been circling the planet in a metal

171
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:36.000
box. No, it's not real. It's real. No, it is real.

172
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.170
This is the reason why your phone works. I understand this. The people,

173
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.400
this is what's ironic.

174
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.900
The people that are doubting the highest minds and the most competent

175
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.170
technological innovators in the world,

176
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.200
like the most competent people are the people that are involved in like

177
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.910
aerospace, airplane, construction,

178
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.200
jet construction, cell phones,

179
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.510
computers. Those are the people that are at the top of the heap.

180
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.090
And these apes that are using these devices to say that the world is

181
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:12.924
flat.

182
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.760
You're doing just what a massive disservice you're doing to the very minds that

183
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:21.930
have created the thing that you're using to complain with this ridiculous idea

184
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:24.990
that someone's hiding the information from all the people,

185
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.370
because they don't want you to know that the world is like your phone, man.

186
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.140
I get it. I want to believe Bigfoot's real. I get it.

187
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.000
I want to believe if you show me some half-ass Bigfoot footage,

188
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:43.230
I'll watch it three, four times in a row. I'll go one day. Maybe, maybe, maybe,

189
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.320
Hey, maybe you never know. There's a lot of parts of the world. We never go to,

190
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.380
you know, somewhere deep in the Congo. I wouldn't be surprised. Right?

191
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.570
I want to believe, but I'm also objective. You gotta be both.

192
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.810
I know you want to believe the earth is flat. I'm super sorry,

193
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.280
but it appears to be round as.

194
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.880
Just like every other planet we've ever looked at. All of them.

195
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.850
Imagine how crazy you'd be if earth was flat. Well,

196
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.340
here's the problem with this idea. You dummies.

197
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.820
A lot of the people behind this idea believed that it was created by God,

198
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:14.610
like on a pizza tray like that.

199
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.440
This is part of a religious belief is that God made this flat earth in the

200
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:22.950
cosmos. And it's all about us. This is part of it. This is,

201
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.380
this is connected to your group, Joe. You're so arrogant with your,

202
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.880
I didn't know. I'm dumb. Okay.

203
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.420
But I'm smart enough to know the world's round crazy.
