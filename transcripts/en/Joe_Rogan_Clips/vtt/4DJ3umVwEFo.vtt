00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 1>I also think there's a funny thing,</v>

3
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:08.760
which is there's this history of famous actors, right? So, and, and it,

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.700
I do think it,

5
00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:13.350
it sort of begins with Brando because Brando had such an enormous effect on the

6
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:18.090
psychology of men in, in America. He really, he really liked.

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.710
And if you look at what I would call,

8
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.830
like the great generation of American actors, the,

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
the Dustin Hoffman, Robert Niro, Robert Duvall, gene Hackman,

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
um, Alf, Gino, Morgan, Freeman, Meryl Streep like this, you know,

11
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.600
the whole PO that's all like the post Brando generation, all of those people,

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.040
literally all of them wanted to become actors because of Marlon Brando. And,

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.390
and he, he,

14
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:46.200
so rewrote the idea of what it was,

15
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:49.830
what it could be that you had got a hole.

16
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.140
It was like what Bob Dylan did in, in the culture. It was like, it rewrote,

17
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.230
like it just rewrote the game or.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.000
<v 0>What Lenny did with common. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.810
<v 1>Absolutely. Lenny Bruce and go there.</v>

20
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.070
And there are these people who come and they have,

21
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.560
they have like a kind of us,

22
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.040
a permanent they're a permanent before and after in,

23
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:16.110
in a certain kind of field. You know what I mean? Hendricks with the guitar hen.

24
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.970
Yeah, yeah. Yes. I would say so. I would say so in rock guitar. Yeah. Uh,

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.350
I'll tell you, it is interesting when you go back and look at rock in that era.

26
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.560
There's that famous story of, I think of,

27
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.300
I don't remember if it's like Pete Townson,

28
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:33.690
making Eric Clapton come with him to your Hendrix and Clapton crying,

29
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.210
you know about it. Yeah. I heard that story, but you can't,

30
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.720
but you also can't discount a clap clapped in, in, in, you know,

31
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.290
there's those famous photos of the wall. Clapton has God, like, like

32
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.430
there's, it's, it's hard to like you,

33
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:52.920
you can't really underrate what Clapton did to guitar and guitar,

34
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.780
you know, in that era too.

35
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.820
<v 0>Right? No, he was phenomenal, but it was a different.</v>

36
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.660
<v 1>Thing. It was a different thing to me. Hendrix was, was a protean. He he's.</v>

37
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
<v 0>It seemed like he broke through to a new dimension. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.550
Pop through the membrane of existence into this new sound.

39
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.350
And there's guys that are like, there there's people that have a distinct set.

40
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.030
Like, are you a Gary Clark Jr.

41
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.800
<v 1>Fan? Nope. I can't.</v>

42
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.220
<v 0>Gary Clark Junior's of phenomenal blues guitarist.</v>

43
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.870
And he has a sound that's almost instantaneously

44
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:29.190
recognizable as Gary Clark. Jr. You hear him and you go, oh my God.

45
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.470
There it is like everyone that works with them, it's just like,

46
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.830
they just walk away sweating, just going Jesus Christ. Wow.

47
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.260
<v 1>I feel that way about Willie Nelson.</v>

48
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:41.730
I think Willie Nelson is legitimately and in country music like

49
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.810
there's before and after Willie Nelson. Like, and, and you can say that he,

50
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:47.880
you know, that Hank Williams Jr, or whatever that he,

51
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.190
but Willy Willy Nelson to me is the hinge around which it

52
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:56.100
goes from being something that had, you know,

53
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.340
then it had a Nashville kind of grand old Opry kind of polished to it.

54
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.260
And he basically took it.

55
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.180
He reclaimed it in as this like American roots thing

56
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.840
and put jazz in it. That's what's so crazy. Is people,

57
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.100
anyone who plays music knows like Willie Nelson is essentially a jazz guitar

58
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.700
player. Like an, and he's he, you know,

59
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.770
redheaded stranger is that to me, that's a before and after kind of a thing too,

60
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.800
like, there's that out, that whole outlaw thing.

61
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.030
And I think there's a whole lot of it.

62
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.080
It's almost like after that there's two camps.

63
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:36.040
There's still going to be like the, you know, the, um,

64
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.580
Steve Earl in his copperhead road thing is more of the Potter thing.

65
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.310
But then there's like, Steve roll roots, Steve Earl, you know what I mean?

66
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:45.160
It's like, he almost like straddled it, but,

67
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.340
but my point about Brando was just that, like, he, he,

68
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.920
he changed the,

69
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.380
he changed the idea of the type of person that male

70
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:02.350
actors wanted to be. They want suddenly it was like,

71
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.030
they wanted to have like a patina or a reputation as a

72
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.290
visceral. They wanted to be visceral, not polished. They wanted to be muscular.

73
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.500
They wanted to be masculine. They wanted to be, um,

74
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.250
you know, uh, intense.

75
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.490
Like those were not the kind of words that people,

76
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:24.520
when you think back on like Jimmy Stewart, Cary grant, like that,

77
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:26.110
that is not what that is.

78
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.530
Not what movie stars were aspiring to.

79
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:34.000
They were aspiring to Polish a kind of a Polish before Brando and

80
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.513
after.

81
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.820
<v 0>Right. So there's, so there's something to his performances where you go, oh,</v>

82
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.600
well this is more like real life than a fit, like on the waterfront.

83
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.290
Like I could have been a contender thing. Yeah. Like when he's doing that,

84
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:51.760
you're like, well, oh, this is how someone would actually behave.

85
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.810
If they felt like their life had been a disaster and it could have been avoided.

86
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.020
<v 1>Well, you just hit on something though that I, it drives me nuts. Cause when,</v>

87
00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:02.620
when people sort of talk about Brando, they're like, you know,

88
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.730
there's sort of the, like the Stanley Kowalski, um,

89
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.150
the, the brutal masculinity, et cetera.

90
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.750
The thing about Brando is he is beautiful. He's an,

91
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.530
he's kind of this enormous Roman looking guy,

92
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.080
but it's where he kills where he really kills is this kind of broken

93
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:27.160
sensitivity that he had. And I could have been a contender is not a tough guy.

94
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.640
Speech. It's the opposite. It's, it's a broken tough guy.

95
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:34.390
It's a guy practically crying saying like you were my,

96
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.090
you were my brother and you should have looked out for me.

97
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:38.920
I needed you looking out for me.

98
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.360
And my life is my life's gone down the toilet because of that. In that moment,

99
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.690
you didn't look out for me. It's, you know, it's, it's like tearful.

100
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:47.860
It's not end end.

101
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:51.730
Even even the best moment of Stanley Kowalski and streetcar

102
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.010
is, is really,

103
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.220
it's like when he falls on his knees in front of his wife and cries,

104
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.160
you know what I mean? It's like,

105
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:02.690
that's what he w he was way better in,

106
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.520
in a lot of ways. To me,

107
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.350
it's the fact that he was actually kind of in touch with his emotional life.

108
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.000
It's not that he was like, so macho at all.

109
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.940
It's that he, he looked that way, but he was,

110
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.760
but he actually had this like poetic sensitivity.

111
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.070
<v 0>Yes. And it was, it w it resonated real, like, it felt real.</v>

112
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.490
And if you watch actors before him,

113
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.890
there was a certain undeniable theatrical element to

114
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:36.710
what they were doing. That was like, oh, this guy's acting. Yeah.

115
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.810
Whereas he was, he seemed like a guy who was really living the scene.

116
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.010
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.050
And some of it it's sometimes I think it sounds silly to say the instrument of a

118
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:52.100
person, but he, he has this crazy he's he looks the way he looks,

119
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.820
but he's got this marble mouth. He does. He's not articulate.

120
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.490
He doesn't come off as like,

121
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.650
he there's a mushiness to the way he speaks and, uh, kind of, uh, um,

122
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.250
yeah, it, it, it doesn't have a style. You know, the,

123
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.850
the guys before that it was, you felt their hurt.

124
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.240
You felt that they were working on their style. And,

125
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.500
and he seemed to be sort of like scratching his ribs and,

126
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.170
and mumbling and, and, um, you know, in a t-shirt.

127
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.860
And he just was, he would kind of present in the moment.

128
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.740
<v 0>I think it was all accentuated, by the way, he ended his life,</v>

129
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.940
like the end of his life. He was enormous, gigantic fat guy. And he just,

130
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.530
it just given into all of his vices. And he was just this guy.

131
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.940
He was a beautiful man. He just didn't seem to give a about that at all.

132
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.920
<v 1>Yeah. I think he said something to me one time about how, um,</v>

133
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.680
how much he was enjoying his life when he was like 23. And, and he's like, I,

134
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:57.470
you know, even when he was doing the play streetcar that made him famous,

135
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:00.890
he was telling me like, he would get with his pal Diego and go up to Harlem,

136
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.080
go to clubs and hit on girls and all these things. And, and I said,

137
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:10.160
you weren't aware of what was going on, you know? And he goes, well, there was,

138
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.070
I was aware of a certain amount of noise rising.

139
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.080
And then one day I woke up and I was sitting on a pile of candy. That's what he,

140
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.280
and, um, and I thought, what a really wild way to say it.

141
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.990
And I do think I'm not even joking to me. It's like what you said. It was like,

142
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.740
after that, they were just, it was like, there was no boundaries.

143
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.510
He was like the gate, he was getting every, everything was he,

144
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.230
he could, he wasn't gonna be able to resist. He wasn't disciplined.

145
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.980
He wasn't a super disciplined person. He was very poetic person.

146
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.240
And I don't think he was disciplined. And I think that a lot of what happened,

147
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:51.650
you know, he had like something like 17 children. Um, and, and he got,

148
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.610
you know, he had appetites and he had these things. And I, I think that, um,

149
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.720
I, I do think that he w you know, struggled,

150
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.940
struggled to,

151
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.950
to deal with all the things that came with being that famous, you know.

152
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.210
<v 0>And being that famous when there wasn't really a lot of examples of how to do it</v>

153
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:16.560
right or wrong before you.

154
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.510
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, that's sort of the Elvis thing, right. It, yeah. It's the Elvis thing.</v>
