00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.850
It's the really up part about it is it's almost like what we were talking about

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:09.870
with football. That football be safer. If there was no helmets,

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.890
it doesn't make sense.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.590
<v 1>We'll be safer, safer.</v>

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.950
I feel that way about prostitution and I'm going to actually broach this here.

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.360
I was gonna write a joke about it. I was going to say it.

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.450
I believe a state issued.

9
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.780
If you apply for funding for support,

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.820
you're going to school like alone or the state's paying for you to go to school.

11
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.120
You get a scholarship. You should also be able to apply for a state issue.

12
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.610
Prostitute. If you are a little socially awkward,

13
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.610
maybe you haven't had sex because men get weird.

14
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.430
If they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is,

15
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:40.290
or they haven't had sex and you're going into college,

16
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.160
let's get you a prostitute. Let's get you having sex twice a week. So you,

17
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.130
you're not afraid of women. Let's get you a little less weird.

18
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.080
Let's fund a prostitute.

19
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.230
<v 0>I think if it didn't have the social stigma behind it,</v>

20
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.710
there's a lot of people that would choose it over working at Wendy's great.

21
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.320
Did a lot of people that choose it. But we, as an issue,

22
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.770
the social stigma is that there's something wrong with it, right?

23
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.700
<v 1>Because it's a woman saying I want to do this with my body. That's,</v>

24
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:06.534
what's upsetting.

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.510
<v 0>Sort of that, but it's also, well in this country,</v>

26
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.020
it's also connected to sex slavery. We think of it as like,

27
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:17.040
if someone is doing that, then maybe, maybe they're a sex slave.

28
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:18.360
Like maybe there's someone who's.

29
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.950
<v 1>I think that's less on people's radars.</v>

30
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:23.260
And it more has to do with the puritanical idea of.

31
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.840
<v 0>There's a little bit of that. But I mean,</v>

32
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.620
that was one of the things that they were accusing Robert Kraft of you remember

33
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.160
Robert Kraft is the guy who owns the craft or craft it's craft. Right.

34
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.870
He was the guy who owned the new England Patriots.

35
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.720
He went to a massage power and the game of happy ending.

36
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:37.554
And then the next thing you know,

37
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.830
that know they arrested him and told him that there's a video of it.

38
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.730
And they were, you know,

39
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.710
they're trying to get him to plead guilty and all these,

40
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.190
all this different that was going on to a guy who's like insanely insanely

41
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:49.500
wealthy, who just was going there to get jerked off.

42
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:52.710
But one of the things that they said was that it was, uh,

43
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.620
that he was participating somehow in sex trafficking.

44
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.560
And so they were accusing him of that. They were,

45
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.200
that was a big part of what the police were saying. Well,

46
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.950
it turned out that none of the girls that worked there were sex traffickers.

47
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.430
They're just prostitutes. And the woman that did it to him, she was like 40.

48
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.800
<v 1>Years old. And if it was legal, none of it.</v>

49
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.570
<v 0>Was legal, but it's also there. They were using that term too.</v>

50
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.120
They were accusing him of this thing. And using that term,

51
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.830
like to brand him this way.

52
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.040
<v 1>Shame, there was a news story where they used a buzzword.</v>

53
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.550
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. It is a buzz word. Right. But it's a buzz word. That's,</v>

54
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.140
it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you

55
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.790
would want someone to face,

56
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.030
whether they just went there to get jerked off or they participate in sex.

57
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.220
<v 1>Right. You're not a part of a ring. I mean, you are,</v>

58
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.890
cause the ring ends with you. So because there's a demand for it,

59
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.780
there is a supply. So that is by larger part of the issue. Um, and I say this,

60
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:50.340
not knowing a ton about sex slavery,

61
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:53.280
but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very

62
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:56.910
quickly, weed is a great example, right? You could do that.

63
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.860
And even we've done this with women and bodies and the way that we look at

64
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.000
people who are overweight,

65
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.610
and we look at people with different things like we are getting to a place where

66
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.000
it's less of a thing. I think you could do that with prostitution.

67
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.160
And it's fine. And look at it as like, this is her choice. And if there,

68
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.880
if there wasn't an exceptional exorbitant demand for it, wouldn't be.

69
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.830
<v 2>At this point in time,</v>

70
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.900
it has never been a better time to be alive for humans than, than today.

71
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.970
Not saying that it can't get better, but we have made tremendous progress,

72
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.830
uh, by one hand, um, imagining things that don't exist yet.

73
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.300
So inventing technologies and also inventing, uh, institutions.

74
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.610
And on the other hand, uh, our human ability to,

75
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.240
to collaborate effectively in large numbers, uh, which includes the corporation,

76
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.830
which is a very effective way for people to work together. Now,

77
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.020
all that progress has always has also had its negative side effects,

78
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.400
which are most pronounced, of course, in the area of the environment where, um,

79
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.620
we, we put things into an environment that,

80
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.400
that shouldn't belong there and we take too much out of it than nature can

81
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.700
replenish, which includes the fish. And on the other hand,

82
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.290
you have the plastic going into the environment, et cetera. So, uh,

83
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.620
so on the question is, well, how do we solve that? And of course,

84
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:21.760
one hand is to say, okay, it's kind of the, the,

85
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.350
yeah, maybe the Lou died is maybe a bit of a negative way to, to phrase it,

86
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:29.740
but the sort of reactionary approach of saying, okay,

87
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.780
we should consume less. Um, you know, corporations are bad, technology's bad.

88
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:38.590
We should all get rid of all those things. And, um,

89
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.190
I think know the environment, the modern environmental movement,

90
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:46.990
which is where kind of this romantic movement has this image of back in the day,

91
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.540
everything was great. And we lived in harmony with nature.

92
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.730
So let's get rid of all this modernity and try and return to that pure original

93
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:58.840
state. What I, however believes is that, first of all, that's,

94
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.180
I don't think it's a very realistic thing.

95
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.140
People want to keep their iPhones and their cars and, you know,

96
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.320
people want to move forward. Um, and at the same time,

97
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:10.340
I don't think it's really the most effective way to,

98
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:14.890
to solve these problems because it would be like fighting a leper

99
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:17.650
tank with bow and arrow. Um, you know,

100
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:22.540
technology is nothing more than an UN an enabler of human capabilities that it

101
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.160
enhances our power. So why not use that power to also try and solve these,

102
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.050
these, these, these problems as well.

103
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:33.730
So rather than try and reject business rejecting Anji I truly believe

104
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.810
that we should embrace those, those forces that make us human and,

105
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.610
and has created this amazing world to also try and solve

106
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.510
these, these negative side effects as well. And that's why I believe, you know,

107
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.710
the over consumption over consumption of fish is not going to end like people

108
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.780
all becoming vegan, but rather through, um, you know, fake meat.

109
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.700
Uh, I think the, uh,

110
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.890
transport emissions are not going to be solved by people not flying anymore or

111
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:07.340
not going anywhere anymore. Realistically people are going to fly more.

112
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.900
So we better invent technologies that allow people to do that without harming

113
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:16.820
the environment. And, um, yeah, the same thing I think would be the case for,

114
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.570
for, for, for plastic and, and really other energy use this as well.

115
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.680
<v 0>I just.</v>

116
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.400
<v 3>Some extent, yeah, 100%. I think you gotta have it. Everybody keep telling me,</v>

117
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.280
oh, you gotta, it's just like knockout part. Like you can build it,

118
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.010
but some people just have it. Like I was talking to my friends,

119
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.380
like I got a little, I got a little, uh,

120
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.470
Japanese fan he's with me on my corner all the time. My wrestling coach,

121
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.700
he helped me out a lot. Am I gonna go? And I tell him all the time like this,

122
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.600
this dude is a little hundred 25 pounds. You know what I mean? 115 pound guy,

123
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.500
pretty much a little girl. I tell him all the time. I was like,

124
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.200
you're a little girl, but if anything,

125
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.450
like there was just one time he was out and about,

126
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.640
and this guy was just acting crazy. This is, this is, uh, this is like a couple,

127
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.610
a couple of years back. And I was, I was at UFC,

128
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:04.280
but was at one of the UFC events. I forgot what event was that,

129
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.750
but it was doing something that's a big thing. And, um, it was at a party.

130
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.620
And then this one Asian dude is just like getting all crazy and people's faces

131
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:15.920
like that crazy drunk and blah, blah, blah, get in his face. And I told him,

132
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.150
I had this all hard. My friend punches. I tell him, I tell him guy,

133
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.560
I crack him, but I'm scared. I'm not going to put them to sleep.

134
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.550
I know if you punch him, he's going to go knock out. So you go hit him.

135
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.870
He wouldn't hit them, but he, he punches so hard.

136
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:36.500
Like he's the smallest guy in our group. Like even one time and, uh, was in,

137
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.131
was at home.

138
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:40.850
And like he walking and there's this drunk guy and there's like three there's,

139
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:43.670
four or five of us. And he's the smallest guy in the back.

140
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.330
And we're all walking in like almost a line. And this big guy, he like,

141
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.890
he slips everybody little guy. Laughs. He bumps him hard.

142
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.440
And I looked at him, I'm like, w like, what are you?

143
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.010
And then he goes to the little guy, he goes, he turns to my friend and be like,

144
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.600
what? And I go, my friend goes what? And he just, and then he's like, oh, okay,

145
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.150
nothing. He walks away. And then I told him, and then I told her,

146
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.330
we was hanging out with this new guy. This guy is just hanging out with us.

147
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:11.900
I told him that is the wrong guy to bump into because out of everyone here,

148
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.160
he probably won't punch and knock you out is the smallest guy. This is it.

149
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.360
I think it's just genetics.

150
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.150
<v 0>Punchy powers is definitely a genetic thing.</v>

151
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.460
Uber dicey didn't they do that with an African man in the Bronx zoo.

152
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:28.850
And like the turn of the century, they put an African man in the Bronx.

153
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.270
Yes they did. Yeah. They have an African man.

154
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.860
I believe it was the Bronx zoo in like the 18 hundreds or the early

155
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.150
19 hundreds. A pygmy bought a bingo. What year was it?

156
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:45.110
1906. Oh God. Wow. Yeah. They had him in the zoo.

157
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.840
It's insane. Look at that. Wow. Dudes in the zoo. Yeah.

158
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.010
Well, you know what, man, people were just figuring life out back then. Right?

159
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.470
Right.

160
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.270
This is the reality of human beings is that we have not been alive that

161
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:00.870
long.

162
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.340
And we have not been civilized in terms of how we view the world today

163
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.020
with inclusivity and objectivity and care and

164
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.070
kindness towards others. Like this compassion and altruism.

165
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.390
This is on a global scale. This is fairly recent. Yeah.

166
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.840
<v 4>Figuring things out as we go. I mean, the history is a perfect,</v>

167
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960
you can show you how we've progressed. You know,

168
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.370
it's a document documentation of how we progress.

169
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.320
<v 0>But yet still, that was still 50 years after slavery. Yeah. Right.</v>

170
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.970
That's crazy. Yeah. 40, 45 years after slavery. What the guys?

171
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.350
<v 4>So Bronx zoo, you know,</v>

172
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.860
speaking in our like weird crypted realm reminded me of something.

173
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.900
So get this Chuba Cobre has been attributed to the possibility

174
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.210
that there are thylacine in north America.

175
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.430
And here's what supports that there is documented proof that however

176
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:54.840
many years ago, I don't remember the dates.

177
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.520
There were two breeding pair of thylacine bound for the Bronx zoo.

178
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.010
And they, the boat crashed into the shore. And most of the animals escaped,

179
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.450
including the two breeding pair of thylacine fast forward, 10, 15 years,

180
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.780
you start having these Chuba Cobre sightings pop up in the Northeast.

181
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.480
And these animals were adapted to living in Tasmania,

182
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:19.680
which is a pretty similar climate to the north America and Northeast. And so,

183
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.190
uh, there's people that have kind of drawn these parallels and said, oh,

184
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.250
the Chuba Cobre that we've reported running around. You know,

185
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:31.080
the United States is actually a tiny remnant population of these thylacine that

186
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:34.170
were brought here for the Bronx zoo. That escaped what.

187
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.600
<v 0>You buy into this. No, not.</v>

188
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.370
<v 4>Personally, but it sounds, it's an amazing.</v>

189
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.150
<v 0>Well, the story had me, if you said yes, I'm ready to go on an expedition.</v>

190
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.430
<v 5>Quick question off of stuff. You've talked about.</v>

191
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.740
If someone could get one for the Bronx zoo,

192
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.250
then what a rich person had been able to buy one like a rich guy in Texas,

193
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:52.740
for instance, I've been able to purchase one.

194
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.700
<v 4>Privately. Yeah.</v>

195
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.620
<v 0>Back then. You could probably get one today.</v>

196
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.120
And we want to find a thylacine go to Baba's house.

197
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.890
<v 4>But especially back then, there were no like import export laws about wildlife.</v>

198
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.320
You know, you could just bring in whatever you liked. If you had money,

199
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:07.531
you know,

200
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:11.670
what's to say everybody was in a race to collect stuff for zoos and museums like

201
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.680
what's to say somebody didn't bring some in there.

202
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.960
<v 6>It's sort of new Nietzsche marks who said, God is dead.</v>

203
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.870
Nietzsche said, God is dead. But Mark's basically said, uh,

204
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.550
religion is the opiate of the masses.

205
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.280
Human beings are the masters of their own fate.

206
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.700
And all of these guys who basically took God out of the equation.

207
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.190
And all of them were basically saying that we are animals and God

208
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.130
isn't it. God is no longer here. We're animals.

209
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.850
And if you don't create a society, control our animalistic impulses,

210
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:46.320
we're going to slaughter and rape each other and world war one proof,

211
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.150
all of those guys. Right. Basically. But it was a time when there was,

212
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.060
everything was up in the air. Einstein comes along and says time and space,

213
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.400
not so fast. It's actually relative. And everybody went what? Huh? He goes,

214
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.000
yeah, time doesn't exist. Like a stopwatch. God didn't start a stopwatch.

215
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.120
And that's what Newton said. But actually it could look.

216
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.550
<v 0>I'm trying to work your way through that. You can't the one where you go,</v>

217
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.850
if you go fast enough into space and then come back,

218
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.760
everybody here will be old and you'll be the same age. Do you.

219
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.020
<v 6>Know how that works? Yeah.</v>

220
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.600
<v 0>I do. But it's still like what?</v>

221
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.830
<v 6>Yeah, it's really weird. Do you know? I think this is true. This is what I read.</v>

222
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.210
He was walking. He was like in, uh, where was he? CERN, Switzerland.

223
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.180
Where the it is. He gets off the, he's trying to come up with these.

224
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.280
He's thinking about the theory of relativity or whatever.

225
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.930
And he gets off the train and he's walking

226
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.390
away from the train station.

227
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.070
He turns and looks at the clock and the clock says, let's say six o'clock.

228
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.700
It turns and looks. And he turns back around and he stops. And he goes, wait,

229
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.910
hold on. I was walking away from the clock.

230
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.570
So when I saw the clock, it said six,

231
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.330
but that's how long it took the light to get to my eye.

232
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.180
By the time the light hit my eye was actually later

233
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.880
because the light has to hit my eye for me. Do you understand by a fraction.

234
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.713
<v 0>Of a second later?</v>

235
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.171
<v 6>So he said,</v>

236
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:13.150
what about was moving at the speed of light time would stand still because the

237
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.450
light would never hit my eye. It's a weird thing to say, but I was like,

238
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.313
that's a.

239
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.080
<v 0>And I wonder if that works with biological aging,</v>

240
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.160
they wonder biological aging is on a constant, right? Oh, that's interesting.

241
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.910
<v 6>Yeah. Entropy.</v>

242
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.630
<v 0>Right. Well, I know that like, time would be different. Right.</v>

243
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.490
But I wonder like when you say time stands still, but it's got to exist.

244
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.300
If you're alive, it's got exist somehow. Biologically,

245
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:40.570
your body's not going to stop heart beating and breathing. Right.

246
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.420
So like how many heartbeats do you have in you? I mean,

247
00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:45.250
that's part of what life is. Life is like,

248
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.010
you got a limited number of heartbeats. If you wanted to really break it down.

249
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.540
Right. How many of them are you going to use?

250
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.370
Why are you going through Lightspeed? Those don't count.

251
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.710
I know you're going to beat your heart's going to beat. Right.

252
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.500
So how long is it actually going to take in real time,

253
00:13:56.501 --> 00:14:00.130
down on earth while you're up there? Because I think it's going to be like,

254
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.040
well, you're moving so fast that it feels like 10 minutes.

255
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.710
Cause it is 10 minutes to you. And then you come back.

256
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:08.560
You've only aged 10 minutes, but it might be 10 years down here.
