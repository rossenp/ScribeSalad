00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, unless you're a sociopath, you know,</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
and then, you know, there's issues with that as well. They're out there.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.490
They are out there, man. I know a few, uh, they,

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.730
I went to a, I went through buds with a sociopath. The honor,

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.810
man of my buds class is still in jail for chopping people up and then disposing

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.650
of their bodies with his wife, who are they chopping up?

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.900
Uh, I don't know the people, but they would, uh, bring people back from,

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.080
I know it happened at least once it might've happened multiple times,

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.670
but they would go to bars, find a couple, continue.

10
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.280
The after party afterwards, elicit an argument,

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.770
some type of exchange they killed.

12
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:46.290
I believe it was a man and a woman chopped him up.

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.730
He used to work at a grocery store chain. So he knew that they, the S uh,

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.930
very cyclical removing of the garbage cans there. They got, you know,

15
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.910
10 sent to the landfill more often.

16
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.190
So he disposed of the body bodies in a multiple

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.100
grocery store, garbage dumpsters.

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.070
And then they eventually got caught because in the middle of the night,

19
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:12.960
they broke into a Hooters distill t-shirts and got caught by the cops.

20
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:14.370
And I believe it was in her purse.

21
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:18.960
They found a Spyderco knife with like hair and like basically

22
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.420
tissue still on the knife. And I think the woman's ID, whoa. Yeah,

23
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.150
it was high level criminal. They really thought this one through.

24
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.260
And that's the only way they got caught. That's how they got caught. I mean,

25
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.280
imagine if they didn't break into Hooters. Yeah. Oh, of course. Well, first off,

26
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:39.420
why the are you breaking into Hooters for t-shirts you dirty, but again,

27
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:40.290
so this is, you know,

28
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:43.770
sociopath's out there and this is another thing that I try to tell people often

29
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.160
the best people that I ever was around in my entire life was in the seal

30
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:50.370
community and my mortal enemies and the worst people I've ever seen on the face

31
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.440
of the earth was in the seal community as well.

32
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.450
He was the honor man in my buds class, which if I look back it's, they, he had,

33
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.800
he had passed more evolutions from a statistical perspective than anybody else

34
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:05.610
in the class. They weren't actually viewing him through the lens of,

35
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.530
is this person honorable or does he, you know,

36
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:09.330
they weren't grading him by his integrity,

37
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.720
but it just goes to show you that no selection process is perfect.

38
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:17.310
And if you can't separate an individual from an occupation or a uniform or a

39
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.390
black belt, right.

40
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.060
If you think that because you have a black belt that you're going to be an

41
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:21.661
awesome person,

42
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.910
or because somebody has a seal that you're going to be a great person,

43
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.320
stand the by. Mm. And it's not the norm, right? I'm not, I'm not,

44
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.410
I don't want him as the anomaly to paint the norm,

45
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.590
but it's important for people to remember that those people are out there.

46
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.540
And again, they can leverage from my background,

47
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.380
they can leverage the fascination, the curiosity, people wanting to give back.

48
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.740
I mean, one of the most common questions that I get from people is, you know,

49
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.980
how, how can I thank people for their service? I'm like, well, Hey, just say,

50
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:49.170
thank you. And then, uh, my answer to them is B is, you know,

51
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.560
provide them an opportunity if you feel it's necessary, but don't allow them,

52
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.290
don't do anything for them. And don't give them any special treatment,

53
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.153
make them earn it

54
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.640
because then you can get a true look at the individual,

55
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.240
as opposed to perhaps just the shiny object that you were focusing on before.

56
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.580
Interesting. So treat them as an individual, thank them, but treat them as, as,

57
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.080
as, as an individual and judge them based on the merits of their behavior,

58
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.800
there were 100% not real for merits of their background. If you have a job,

59
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.430
you know, you're like, Hey, I want to provide opportunities for veterans.

60
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.950
No problem provide the opportunities for veterans,

61
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.700
but treat them exactly like the person who is in the cubicle next to them.

62
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:29.320
If it's in that environment, obviously,

63
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:32.980
and if you hold the person that was a non veteran to a certain standard,

64
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.020
you better hold the veteran to the same standard.

65
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.490
Don't let them get away with anything because it doesn't help them either.

66
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.300
Right. You know, it, it, it helps everybody in the organization.

67
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.460
If you set the standard and make sure everybody holds it,

68
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.290
it's insidious to an organization to set a standard. And well,

69
00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:51.610
why is this guy getting special treatment? Like shot duty was a seal.

70
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.470
He gives a. It's just a job title.

71
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.500
And if that person is sociopathic or they are, you know,

72
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:03.270
there's a bell curve, there's a top 10%. And the, and the, the,

73
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.740
the top and the bottom 10%, if he's in that bottom 10%,

74
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.270
by holding them to that standard,

75
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.010
you're going to get objective viewpoint of that,

76
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:12.610
as opposed to just being blinded by whatever it may be. Okay. It's interesting.

77
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:16.810
But only you can say that or someone in your position can say that it's very

78
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.990
difficult for someone who's a non-veteran to say anything remotely close to

79
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.420
that. Well, I hope they listen then,

80
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.980
because they don't need to say that they just need to, they need to just live,

81
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.370
that they need to structure their organization with that framework.

82
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.500
So it's objective, not subjective.

83
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.130
There's this like people look at being a seal. It's not a Harry Potter. One.

84
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.920
I have a,

85
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.160
probably a familiarity and comfort with weapons and tactics more than your

86
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:46.600
average person. But if I'm being completely honest about my old job,

87
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.980
I could teach a monkey to do most of the things that I do. I'm serious.

88
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.280
I could teach a monkey to do the things that we did. It's not,

89
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:58.840
we're not out there doing nuclear physics. You're out there doing, you know,

90
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.510
we find an individual, how are we going to get there? Okay,

91
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:03.700
let's figure out how we're going to get there. We train to those standards.

92
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.900
We get on target.

93
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.880
Everything is based on tactics and standard operating procedures or TTPs

94
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:11.440
tactics, techniques, and procedures.

95
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.170
And everybody is trained to those standards.

96
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:16.060
So you know what to expect from somebody,

97
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:18.310
whether they're from an east coast team or a west coast team,

98
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:22.180
you can meet in the middle. And we all are taught to clear rooms the same way.

99
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:26.050
And it's just, it's, it's not complicated.

100
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.760
Actually,

101
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.880
the ability to make us less effective and efficient would be to make it

102
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:34.180
complicated, the simpler that you can make it the better you're going to be. Mm.

103
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.900
That makes sense. I mean, it makes,

104
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:42.750
but it's also the mind of a seal. Like the,

105
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.830
the type of person that can get through buds, that's, that's complicated,

106
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.040
that's complicated. And just being able to control your mind, you know,

107
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:52.690
one of the things that you said in one of the,

108
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.310
one of the times you talked about,

109
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:58.190
it was someone who is able to keep their world small when we're in Utah.

110
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.400
But yeah, I might toss an interesting way of looking at it.

111
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.780
Keep your world small, like people that applies to what's happening right now,

112
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.960
too. Hm. So what you're talking about, you know,

113
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:13.670
buds is a physical test. Uh you're actually,

114
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.950
I would say having gone back as an instructor,

115
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.930
which I learned much more about the process, applying the curriculum,

116
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:24.170
as opposed to going through it. Because as a student, you're just like, ah,

117
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.000
I want this day to be over as an instructor, you can kind of,

118
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.300
and you also don't really know what you're going to do with the next day.

119
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.010
As a student, as an instructor,

120
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.210
I can look at the entire curriculum and the story arc of where you start on day

121
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:38.870
one and the product you're going to get at the end. It's a physical test,

122
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.920
but we're using the body to test the mind. We're stressing the body.

123
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.910
We're going to make you tired, hungry, uh, hypothermic.

124
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.220
We're going to get you so exhausted to the point that you're going to

125
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:51.710
hallucinate. And then we're going to take a look at how you behave.

126
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:56.180
Do you value? We over me, you know, one of the first things they do in buds,

127
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.220
you're explaining the concept of a swim buddy.

128
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.280
And you don't get to go anywhere farther than six feet away from another human

129
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.900
being for that six month time period,

130
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.520
that is the opposite of most people's mentality. And you can test it early on,

131
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:08.570
you yell at them and you'll say, Hey,

132
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.480
you got 30 seconds to go run out to the ocean and get wet.

133
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.320
And in the first few days they just take off and they start running because they

134
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.360
forgot about their swim buddy they're me-centric.

135
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.120
And so you bring them back and you punish them,

136
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.990
the individual that made that choice. And then also this one, buddy, you know,

137
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.650
to reinforce that people there are consequences to other people from your

138
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.930
behaviors. And after about two weeks,

139
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.470
you really can't separate people from their swim buddies.

140
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:35.540
So it's a lesson and it's at a beginning point where you can instill this

141
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:37.610
philosophy of we is greater than me.

142
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.150
And it's one of the most beautiful things I think from the seal community.

143
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:44.300
If you talk to people, or my experience has been as,

144
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.290
as in talking to people in their most dire moments where things are getting the

145
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:48.621
worst,

146
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:51.260
they're often more concerned about the people to their left and right than they

147
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:53.450
are about themselves. My biggest fear,

148
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.730
probably I know what it was in the seal community,

149
00:07:55.731 --> 00:08:00.260
but to this day is that I am not going to be there when somebody needs me.

150
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.260
But it was my biggest fear in the seal community that I wasn't going to live up

151
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:06.320
to this standard of the people, to the left and right held at me.

152
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.610
And then they were going to suffer for it.

153
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.970
I was more concerned about letting them down than myself getting hurt or killed.

154
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.020
And that starts with that ethos from seal training.

155
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.970
But it's not a complicated course. We're stressing the body distress the mind.

156
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.680
And if you look at the people who make it through.

157
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:24.800
So when I went back as an instructor, as a student,

158
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:28.470
when you're going through training, if somebody next to you quit,

159
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.610
you'd never see them again. Like there's no, Hey dude, what the are you doing?

160
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.630
Like they're just gone.

161
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.320
And you continue on with your day because you just want to graduate the program.

162
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.520
As an instructor,

163
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.670
you can talk to those people and you can ask really important questions.

164
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:45.350
And my favorite question is why, w you said this was your lifelong goal.

165
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.060
This is all you've ever wanted to do.

166
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.670
You left a D one scholarship to come here

167
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.280
because you saw no for yourself, no value in the higher education.

168
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.110
And you wanted to come to the seal community and you quit.

169
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.570
Why time and time and time again,

170
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.970
the answer I would get from the students is they got overwhelmed.

171
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.460
So they were doing the opposite of keeping their world small,

172
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.850
because there's two ways you can look at buds. It's 180 days long, I think,

173
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:09.990
plus, or minus one or two,

174
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.760
or you could look at it as a sunrise and a sunset 180 times.

175
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.780
So you could look at a pie and go, oh my God, I have to eat this whole thing.

176
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.620
Or you can look at a slice and eat the slice and not worry about the rest of the

177
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.670
slices and keep doing that and doing that until the training process is

178
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.280
complete. Hell week is another good example.

179
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:33.330
It starts Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the afternoon.

180
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:35.280
And you get about two hours of sleep on Wednesday.

181
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.120
That's it it's horrendous to go through.

182
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.480
And it's pretty entertaining as an instructor because you can just totally with

183
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.690
the students cause they're off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon.

184
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.220
But almost all of the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday

185
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:51.330
morning and beyond that,

186
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:53.820
you're probably gonna make it through because you've invested so much.

187
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.810
But the advice that I was given when I went through was don't look at how we as

188
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:01.470
a five day pipeline, just make it to your next meal.

189
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.450
They have to feed you every six hours.

190
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.340
So if I can stack six hours on six hours on six hours and just focus

191
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:12.450
on getting to the next meal, it doesn't matter how much I'm in pain.

192
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.270
Doesn't matter how cold I am. If I can just get to the next meal,

193
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:17.610
I'll get a reprieve, a mental reset,

194
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.890
and I can continue on that's that in combination with some,

195
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.020
you know, the mental toughness is how you approach and set your goals.

196
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:31.560
And then resilience in my definition of resilience would be the ability to get

197
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:33.840
bent and come back stronger than you were before.

198
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.840
And the way you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible,

199
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:40.230
which you do all the time by running sprint surgery. You know what I mean?

200
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.870
You're doing that stuff. You're mentally tough because of that.

201
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.990
And if you can apply that resilience to approaching,

202
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.960
setting and approaching your goals from digestible perspectives,

203
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.000
you can accomplish an insane amount. So that's really what I mean.

204
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.400
It's a physical test, but we're just testing the mind.

205
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.300
Can the individual ignore the big and focus on the small,

206
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.060
can you do the step that you need to do and not get overwhelmed,

207
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:06.480
regardless if you're tired, exhausted, hungry, cold. I mean,

208
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:11.340
that's really all it is. It's not a complex training program. There's the ocean,

209
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.730
there's the beach. There's some telephone poles. There's some boats.

210
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:18.990
And then later on we introduced scuba gear and towards the tail end of it,

211
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.780
you know, some demolition and pistol and rifle.

212
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.750
How many days can you stay awake for where it becomes dangerous for your health?

213
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.110
Yeah. I don't know. It's dangerous for their health in hell week.

214
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.710
You know what the students probably don't realize is there is a huge safety

215
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.730
network for them.

216
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:38.850
You don't see it as a student because you're so just task saturated.

217
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.980
There are MDs walking around all over the place. Um, there's people constantly,

218
00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:44.161
you know,

219
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.160
we're checking the temperature of the water will take core body temperatures on

220
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:47.581
the students.

221
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.790
We're keeping a very good eye and we're buffering them because by about

222
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:53.100
Wednesday they're brain dead, um,

223
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.260
I don't know how long you could stay awake without suffering some severe

224
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.810
physical consequences. They literally get two hours of sleep.

225
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.930
And the whole week you might get a little bit of break time, but you know,

226
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:04.450
there's a, it's actually on the wall at the buds compound,

227
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:08.680
it pays to be a winner. And the inverse of that is incredibly true.

228
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:12.250
It does not pay to be a loser in the seal community and for clarity, loser,

229
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.250
as anything other than first place in the community that I came from,

230
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.840
the podium has one platform, not three. So if you win,

231
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:22.570
you might get 15 minutes off while we're hammering the out of the rest of the

232
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:26.350
class. So if you win a task, if you win a task, I can hell week you'll,

233
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.790
they'll let you sit by this such as a about book for race is a perfect one. Um,

234
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.080
uh, Jamie can probably pull up a picture. It's buds, hell week boat, crew race,

235
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.920
and there'll be students running with boats on their heads and people get bald

236
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:42.460
spots from it and we'll do races like, Hey, uh, take that boat.

237
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.850
That's supposed to be in the ocean and you're going to run with it on your head

238
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.300
as a crew of seven people, three people on each side and the leader in the back.

239
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.090
And, uh, at the end of four miles, we'll be done with this,

240
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.800
the winning boat crew. We'll uh,

241
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.660
we'll get a little break and the losing Bowker's,

242
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.110
we'll get remediated four miles with a boat on your head. Yeah. You know why?

243
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.090
Because it's fun to paddle it in the water and you can surf it. So you. Yeah.

244
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.650
There you go. Yeah. That look at that neck on that front, right guy. Just, yeah.

245
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.800
He might have some disc issues and later on in life, but they'll do short races.

246
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:14.740
They'll do long ones. And how much does that boat weigh? Oh,

247
00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:18.700
that's a good question. Um, it looks inflatable. It is,

248
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:21.280
it's an IBS inflatable boat, small,

249
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.820
but still probably 150 200 pounds.

250
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.760
And then you've got to imagine sometimes there's water sloshing around in there.

251
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.730
Sometimes I'll get sand in there cause we do let him paddle they'll do races

252
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:33.490
where they have to run, go out past the surf zone,

253
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.730
flip the boat over for no reason other than it's difficult.

254
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:41.290
And it forces them to get wet. Right. The boat come back in, continue the race.

255
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.320
But Ooh. So if you win that, you might get, you know,

256
00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:46.150
15 minutes while we're immediately in the class.

257
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.240
And we know what's going to happen in that 15 minutes. You see people sleeping,

258
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:53.980
standing up, you see people face down in a high lick track in the sand sleeping.

259
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.920
They're sitting there sleeping and it's kinda just a reward and you just leave

260
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.640
him alone, CLM sleep for 15 minutes. We'll give you a little bit. Yeah. Wake up.

261
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.830
Pretty much get right back on that ocean. Wow. Five days of that.

262
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.723
Yeah.

263
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.160
And it's earned about people in that you learn a lot and you see people push to

264
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:15.580
the point, where do you care about me over week?

265
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.660
And we get rid of the people who cannot prioritize we over me. Hm.

266
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.000
Arrogance comes out. You'll see it a lot in the, uh, the leadership as well.

267
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.640
You know, the students are largely the same,

268
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.230
like from a physiological perspective,

269
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:33.250
there's ones that are faster runners and from a contractile potential like more

270
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.790
stamina or a cardio-respiratory endurance. Uh,

271
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.800
but most of them are the same.

272
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.230
It's like probably like a 3% difference between the students,

273
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.420
but these little pods of seven people,

274
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.390
some of them can work together and they're just crushing it.

275
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:50.350
And other ones you'll see, you know, there's oars in the boat. So when they run,

276
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.150
they're stuffed on the top and you'll see, there'll be out paddling.

277
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:54.350
And then you'll just see a sword fight.

278
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:58.250
Start with people just knocking each other's heads off with oars. Oh. Yeah,

279
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.690
because look, I mean, imagine how exhausted you are. You are so exposed and raw.

280
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.030
So suppressed as a human being, like from all the physical tools that we have,

281
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.500
that the real person comes out and sometimes boat crews will just inject a

282
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:14.750
person. They will hate that person so much because they're,

283
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.470
they might be selfish or arrogant or they're not pulling their weight and they

284
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:20.870
will just harp on that person or beat the out of the person.

285
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:24.020
Eventually they'll end up quitting. Now when they do get in a sword fight,

286
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:24.854
what do you do?

287
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.610
Do you kick them out if they get in sword fights or do you let them sort it out?

288
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.590
I'm gonna let them sort it out. Wow.

289
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.210
Plus they're out on the water and I'm not going out there.

290
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.300
And a lot of the times you're watching it through, by nose.
