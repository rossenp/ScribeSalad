00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, they were talking about, uh, Hawaii,</v>

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.600
you know, and all these different invasive species that live in Hawaii. And, uh,

3
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:13.440
there was this discussion about pigs mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they were saying,

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.840
you know, like, we should really take the pigs off of Hawaii.

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.910
And a lot of the people in Hawaii, like, hang on right in here,

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:24.390
as long as the pigs. Right. So like, are we invasive? Right?

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.190
Like what's invasive now. Right? Like when does it become,

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.190
because obviously like Lu OS they're synonymous with like eating pigs

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.150
and wild pigs are a, a big part of, you know, the,

10
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:37.870
the people that hunt in Hawaii. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

11
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.910
that's they're food source. Yeah. So they they're like, well, what it,

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.460
but then you have a situation like Lanai, where I go every year,

13
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.660
the access deer. Yeah. Which is terrible. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; environmentally,

14
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.540
it's a disaster, right? Like it's, it's all wrong.

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.540
There's 30,000 deer on this one island that many 30,000.

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.420
They don't really they're, they're guessing the estimates between 20 and 30,000.

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.220
Right. And there's 3000 people. Yeah. And dude,

18
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:03.890
you ain't never seen anything like it, cuz it's a little island Uhhuh.

19
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:05.490
You drive around the whole thing in an hour. Uhhuh.

20
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.890
I mean maybe a little bit more than that, but not much. Sure.

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.530
It's a tiny island. Right. And there's so many deer. Yeah.

22
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:14.890
That's you'll see them on like you'll, you'll get your binoculars out.

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.130
You look at this huge field and you're like, oh my God, you'll see a thousand.

24
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.440
Oh, you're kidding. No, no, it's crazy. It's CRA it's so unnatural.

25
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.280
No predators. Only humans. Plenty of food. Right.

26
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.000
<v 1>Right. And they're just populations exploded everywhere. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.920
<v 0>And they're delicious. Right.</v>

28
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.400
I have heard that before before for people who live there, it's amazing.

29
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.880
You know, like if you don't have to have much money to eat really well, right.

30
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:39.920
You get a rifle, you go out there, bang,

31
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.400
you got a deer and you could shoot as many as you want.

32
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.630
You could shoot seven in a day and stockpile your freezer and have all your meat

33
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:47.290
for the year.

34
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.190
<v 1>And they're that abundant. Like if someone wanted to stock. Oh my God. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.270
<v 0>The only thing that keeps me from killing a ton of 'em is that I use a bow and</v>

36
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.990
arrow and it's really hard to do with a bone arrow. Cause they're so fast.

37
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.710
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they evolved in Asia to get away from tigers.

38
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:02.590
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they're an Indian animal. Right. So it's uh, super fast.

39
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.900
<v 1>It it's a tough argument that could, because you're right. Like Hawaiian people,</v>

40
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.380
pig is culturally significant to them. You know,

41
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.860
just like probably access Deere is to the people of NY and has been for however

42
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.260
long the deer have been there. But I guess it's like at what cost, right? Right.

43
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.860
At what cost, if, if, and I don't think this is the case, but if someone said,

44
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:23.930
look, if I know these pigs are culturally significant to who you,

45
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.050
but if we leave them here, the whole Island's ecosystem will collapse.

46
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:30.010
There'll be no birds, no fish, you know, no lizards, nothing.

47
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.250
Is it worth it to have pigs? Right? Like that's and it's delicate the.

48
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.130
<v 0>Pigs in particular. Right? Cause they eat everything. Meat, ground nesting,</v>

49
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:40.010
birds. They'll devastate everything that same, everything in front of a roots.

50
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.080
They'll up every tree, everything that's coming up. All the routes. Everything.

51
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.000
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. They're super destructive here.</v>

52
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.200
There's destructive here in California. Yeah. It's not,

53
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.560
it's not isolated to Hawaii. Everywhere that we've brought pigs. They've done a.

54
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.960
<v 0>Lot of damage, but we're actually gonna, I was,</v>

55
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.440
we were talking about this out here. We're gonna film something about, uh,

56
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.920
hunting pigs at Toone ranch cuz Toone ranch. Like the place gets devastated.

57
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.400
The agriculture gets devastated by these pigs. There's so many of them. Right.

58
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.960
And they're all over Northern California has a problem in San Jose.

59
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.880
They're in people's yards. They're destroying. And because they're, they,

60
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.160
if you don't kill them,

61
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.880
they just breed and breed and breed and breed and breed and breed.

62
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.070
And then they expand. Right. And they're, they're dealing with them now,

63
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.270
even in the Northern part of the United States, right.

64
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:24.510
They're dealing with 'em in the Northeast.

65
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:27.470
There was a New York times article about it. See if you can find that, um,

66
00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:29.030
from two days ago. Okay.

67
00:03:29.031 --> 00:03:32.710
About the expansion of wild pigs is that they're starting to make their way into

68
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.550
the Northeastern states and they're just, they can't be stopped.

69
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.220
They can survive in any weather. Yep. They breed three times a year. They can.

70
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.900
They're viable. I think from the time they're five to six months old,

71
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.700
they have their first litter Farrell, pigs roam the south.

72
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.260
Now even the Northern states, aren't safe.

73
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.860
The swine have established themselves in Canada. Oh wow.

74
00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:55.900
And they're encroaching on border states like Montana and North Dakota. man.

75
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:56.820
If they get into Montana.

76
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.140
<v 1>They'll do so much damage. And you know,</v>

77
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:03.050
what's crazy about the far pigs in the United States. They were brought here by,

78
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.970
I believe Christopher Columbus starting with six animals. Whoa.

79
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.330
So the entire 200 million or whatever it is across the us,

80
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.243
I don't know the number.

81
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.130
It was like six or eight or 10 original pigs that were brought in by Christopher

82
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.890
Columbus and dropped in Florida. That's insane.

83
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.040
That's you wanna talk about out how crazy they can reproduce and how much damage

84
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.561
they do.

85
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:26.360
Like think of the biomass of those animals stemming off of like six of them.

86
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.220
That's.

87
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.560
<v 0>Insane. And they're so tough.</v>

88
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.640
You can put 'em on a boat and they'll make it across the ocean.

89
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.640
<v 1>Oh yeah, no they're amaz and, and they are terrible for the environment.</v>

90
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:40.080
Like they do so much damage to native species to riparian habitat. I mean,

91
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:43.590
they're I, like you said, we were talking about it out there briefly and um,

92
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.030
it's, it's a good thing.

93
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:48.750
People should realize that invasive species like that should not be in an

94
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:50.070
ecosystem. Well, they.

95
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.430
<v 0>Certainly shouldn't be in an ecosystem when there's no balance. Right.</v>

96
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.310
If they're wart hogs and they're in Africa, there's a system for that. Exactly.

97
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.310
Like they're all they're supposed to be there.

98
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.620
Wart hogs are wild looking creatures. Aren't they? You seen one,

99
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:02.454
you've seen one in.

100
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.100
<v 1>Yeah, up there. I grew up in Zimbabwe. Oh, that's right. That's right. I got,</v>

101
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.580
I actually, I got a pretty funny story about a war hog. Um, my uncle, uh, my,

102
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.540
my mom's brother, we were out on safari one time and he was, he was young.

103
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.140
You know, he is, he was much younger than my mother.

104
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.580
So he was maybe a teenager or something.

105
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.170
And he grabbed this plum and started going for a walk across camp. And anyway,

106
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:25.170
this war hog decided it wanted this plum.

107
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.610
And so it came trotting after my uncle and started chasing him in circles around

108
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:33.490
this tree. But my uncle was so panicked by this thing,

109
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:37.050
chasing him around this big Baab tree that he wouldn't drop the plum. Oh.

110
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.490
So he is just in this perpetual cycle of being,

111
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.160
of being chased around this tree until he eventually threw the plum and the war

112
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:45.400
hog just veered off and went for the plum. &lt;laugh&gt;.

113
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.720
<v 0>Lucky. Didn't want him. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

114
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.160
<v 1>They're, they're very funny. Very mischievous.</v>

115
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.640
I love the way their tails stick up through the grass when they're running

116
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:53.520
around. They're.

117
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.960
<v 0>Weird looking, but they they're they're they're related to pigs right.</v>

118
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.720
In some sort of.

119
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.600
<v 1>Way. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. They're all that same family. Speaking of weird pigs,</v>

120
00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:04.080
are you familiar with the barber Russa? No, this is one we should pull up.

121
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.040
You're gonna love this animal. Yeah. You're gonna love this.

122
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.960
It it's one of my top bucket list animals to see in the wild it's great name.

123
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.010
<v 0>Yeah. Barber.</v>

124
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.843
<v 1>Russa. You gotta,</v>

125
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.920
I don't even wanna tell you what it is until you see the image.

126
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.310
Tell me you be like no way. That's real. It looks like.

127
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.670
So outta star wars really?

128
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.670
<v 0>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's a pig.</v>

129
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.710
<v 1>Where does it live? Indonesia. How.</v>

130
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.573
<v 0>Bigs it get.</v>

131
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.590
<v 1>Uh, maybe 200 pounds. I'm not positive on the size. Boom. Whoa.</v>

132
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.950
Look at that thing. Look at those tus.

133
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.830
<v 0>Growing out of it is those things that grow out of its the middle of its head.</v>

134
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.900
That's crazy. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; look at that one.

135
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.780
What the bro that does not look real, right?

136
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.940
<v 1>Doesn't that look like signing out star wars. Yes. That's.</v>

137
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.700
<v 0>A real animal that looks like an avatar creature. That's what it looks like.</v>

138
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.580
Is that fighting something mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; looks like,

139
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.940
is it fighting there? Another one? I think, oh my God.

140
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.340
Barus is going to war it's uh, pig deer.

141
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.810
&lt;laugh&gt; they call it a pig deer that says Barus or pig deer.

142
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.450
This might be somebody just making a guess, like their nickname of it.

143
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.330
I actually think they're uh, having sex there. Oh, getting it on.

144
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.410
That's not fighting. Making more Papas. That's just. Barbus jujitsu.

145
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:09.650
Yeah.

146
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.650
<v 1>That's the kind of fighting mommy and daddy do late at.</v>

147
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.650
<v 0>Night. &lt;laugh&gt; mommy and daddy were just playing. Don't worry.</v>

148
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.560
No one's getting hurt. Mommy was gagging &lt;laugh&gt; um, yeah,

149
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.280
right there. Jamie, who are you? Cursor is click on that one. What the man?

150
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.080
Isn't that a.

151
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.913
<v 1>Wild pig?</v>

152
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.400
<v 0>The things coming out of it,</v>

153
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.200
the tusks that come outta the middle of its head are so strange.

154
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.720
Like where did that come from? I, I.

155
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.200
<v 1>Don't know why you evolved that. Maybe, maybe like a peacock tail, you know,</v>

156
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.670
for a showmanship, but what's really crazy about them evolving those two,

157
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.110
two teeth or tusks out of their, their bridge of their snout is they,

158
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.470
if they're not broken in fights and rooting around,

159
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.150
they can grow long enough that they will puncture the animal in the head and

160
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:51.030
kill it. I've heard.

161
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.030
<v 0>Of that. Oh, that's these, you know why? Cause I, I put a, an image of it on my,</v>

162
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.070
my, uh, Instagram. It was one of those Jeffrey Epstein.

163
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:00.540
Didn't kill himself memes. Oh yeah. I saw.

164
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.500
<v 1>A few of those. He threw up.</v>

165
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.980
<v 0>And it was a, a Barb Russa skull.</v>

166
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.380
<v 1>Actually. Oh. Saying that it can do.</v>

167
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.740
<v 0>That, that it actually was driving into its own head growing into its own head.</v>

168
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.100
Yeah.

169
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.020
<v 1>Like that. Yeah. Insane. That's.</v>

170
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.020
<v 0>Crazy. Like maybe that's nature's way of saying all right, enough check, check,</v>

171
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.010
please. Your will, were forever. Eat everything in front of you like that one.

172
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:24.570
Look at that. Yeah. Look how there it is. Growing into its own brain.

173
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:27.610
Imagine what a like one day you have like a little bit of a headache and the

174
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:30.090
next day it just gets a little worse. You're like, what is going on?

175
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.250
&lt;laugh&gt; and what do.

176
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.850
<v 1>You do? It's like, if you go and you know, hit that against the ground,</v>

177
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.850
it's only gonna get worse.

178
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.650
<v 0>Right. It's already in your brain. Yeah. Yeah. You'd have to get it.</v>

179
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.240
You'd have to be smart enough to find a branch.

180
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.840
We could slip that over and torque your head.

181
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.920
<v 1>Yeah. I don't think I don't snap it off. I don't think that's happening.</v>

182
00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:47.620
If you're a pig.

183
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.453
<v 0>Is this awful?</v>

184
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.720
I mean often that this happens when they kill themselves by growing that tusk

185
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:54.240
into their brain. I don't know.

186
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.760
<v 1>That looks like two of them heading that direction. They're crazy. Animal.</v>

187
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.160
What a beautiful animal though.

188
00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:03.680
So there's an extinct subspecies of those called the Melo Bara,

189
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.280
which in the single island near Sulu Wei used to be.

190
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.040
And then they think people have hunted him, um, you know,

191
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:13.200
to extinction localized extinction within that island and that subspecies.

192
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.510
But uh, some people I know that worked over there ate one.

193
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.350
So they're like, yeah, no, we ate this wild pig with these crazy horns recently.

194
00:09:21.351 --> 00:09:24.190
And I was like, yeah, this was like two years ago. Um, you know,

195
00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:26.270
and they have no proof and they don't have the skull and they don't have the

196
00:09:26.271 --> 00:09:26.420
picture.

197
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.230
<v 2>They were like, they were traveling and they're like, yeah, yeah, we got back.</v>

198
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:31.350
And we ate this pig with these wild horns on this particular island.

199
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.950
And I was like, wait, is that possibly a Malo and bar Russa? I was like,

200
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.260
I don't know. And you look where they were and what they said and what they ate.

201
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:41.700
And it's like, oh, that could be an extinct, an extinct, uh,

202
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:43.460
subspecies that you guys consumed. Well,

203
00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:47.260
how many biologists are actually actively out there looking for these creatures?

204
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.260
Well, those, I would say zero currently that species,

205
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.260
but with regards to this field of presumed extinct animals,

206
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.770
it seems to be a movement that's ending.
