1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.900
<v 0>You know,</v>

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.380
the guy who does it the best today about cutting angles and being bright in

3
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:08.550
front of you. And can't him, his little Chanco, I mean,

4
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.490
Loma Chanco stands right in front of you and then he's not.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.270
And then he's over here and he's punching you in the face. TJ Dillashaw,

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.780
who's a UFC bantamweight champion said he sparred with him. And he said,

7
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.650
the first round was like, you know, Lama triangles, just feeling them up,

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.350
just figuring them out. And you know, he's like, man,

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.790
I'm kind of hanging in there with this guy.

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.520
And then his dad yelled something in Russian.

11
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.060
And then the second round Loma Chanco goes, just dancing around him,

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.080
stepping to the side.

13
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.490
<v 1>That was the only round they put on YouTube too. You know what I mean? Um, yeah,</v>

14
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:42.120
I seen that, you know, the thing with Loma Chanco is this, uh,

15
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.690
and I tell people also like Floyd Mayweather was,

16
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
is unbelievable defensive fighter, but Floyd was really good on drawing you in,

17
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.241
you know,

18
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.690
and kind of countering off that his deepest and his reflexes were amazing,

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.360
but he kind of lured you in a little bit made you miss make,

20
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:01.170
you made you make a mistake and then he would counter you Loma Chanco.

21
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.170
On the other hand is a guy you could throw a punch and Neff punch could be a

22
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.890
midair and he's spinning and he's already behind you is, uh,

23
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.600
the athleticism is astonishing. I have not seen it. Uh,

24
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.690
granted, can he lose absolutely as boxing?

25
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.930
And if you get one of them rugged guys that are just going to come in and say,

26
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.080
you know what, screw it. I'm going to, I'm just going to get hit,

27
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.650
but I'm going to hit him. That may be a type of fighter that beats Alma Chanco.

28
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.710
<v 0>Well, w who was it? That was it.</v>

29
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:31.170
The Mexican guy who beat him in one of his first fights.

30
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.110
<v 1>Oh, uh Salise.</v>

31
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.680
<v 0>Salito Salito right, right, right. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.370
That was the kind of fight that he fought. Yeah. Just dirty. Got on top of him.

33
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.590
<v 1>But you got to understand on that point too,</v>

34
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:47.880
that was a Loma Chanco second pro fight. Yeah. And I guess a real.

35
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.570
<v 0>Veteran.</v>

36
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.140
<v 1>A guy who's been there and done it and seen it. And that's the argument.</v>

37
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.890
And it's hard to explain again. And that was another argument on is, uh,

38
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.810
the ag is a little frustrated reading, second profile, and usually in boxing,

39
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.900
it goes like the first year,

40
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.860
you're up for six second year. You, maybe you start getting up to eight,

41
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.830
but you get a good amount of fights under your belt before you start getting

42
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.760
into the 10 rounds and 12 rounds. Okay. Um,

43
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.480
you're talking about a kid coming out of the amateurs fighting three

44
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.730
three-minute rounds or four, two minute rounds,

45
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.610
depending on whatever tournament or international tournament it is.

46
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.940
And he's going ready to a 12, 12 round fight.

47
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.620
I know my myself coming up and the process that top rung brought me up,

48
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:36.420
which was a great process to they've had they picked a fights and they made

49
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.710
sure that the fights that they picked for me,

50
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.250
where to correct flights and a Gruen me the right way, you know,

51
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:44.730
by rounds and everything else. And I know just jumping from six to eight,

52
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.830
the difference in that, you know,

53
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.790
let alone being a kid and you're going into your second pro fight and you're

54
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.670
fighting a 12 round fight. So if he lost that fight,

55
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:55.860
which he came back and he made it a really close fight,

56
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.560
I would have to tip my hat to him just on the fact that he was able to go 12

57
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.820
rounds. Yeah. You know, um, people take a lot away from that fighter.

58
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.290
What he accomplished is something that not many can do well.

59
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.670
<v 0>It's crazy. I mean, he had a second pro title at what, how many fights in.</v>

60
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.930
The second fight was for the rule title that he wanted the role title on his

62
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.920
dirt profile. Yeah.

63
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.450
<v 0>Yeah. That's insane. And then, but he's had more than one per world title,</v>

64
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.200
right?

65
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.380
<v 1>Yes. He's won. Think three different way classes though.</v>

66
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.500
<v 0>But the second one was something insane. Some insanely short.</v>

67
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.210
So he pull up his record. Yeah.

68
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.130
<v 1>I believe I looked at this.</v>

69
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.020
<v 0>What's that first fight was for the international featherweight title that was</v>

70
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:40.530
against Toledo Ramirez. He said, oh,

71
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.470
he lost against Lido for the vacant WBO featherweight title. Oh, okay.

72
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.370
So the other, what was the first title? International featherweight title. WBO.

73
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.690
Yeah. That's not a real, that's not an illegal world title. This,

74
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.820
they have a bunch of weird titles, right? Like international title,

75
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.110
continental title.

76
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.240
<v 1>Assaulting me. I had to do, I.</v>

77
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.860
<v 0>Had to deal with the world champion, but you had all of it. You were unified.</v>

78
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.260
<v 1>I should have been by all rights, but Taylor vacated too. Oh, that's right.</v>

79
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.120
Yeah. But he, you know, that's why I get mad.

80
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.100
And that's another big argument boxing.

81
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.990
How you break that down between the lineal, the lineal and a unanimous,

82
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.180
you know, I had to ring the WBO.

83
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.370
<v 0>Scroll, scrub, CC his homework. So what was his, uh, okay.</v>

84
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:29.050
So his second world title was when retained

85
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:33.970
retained one. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

86
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.840
6 fights in he's in his second he's um, he that's, when he, he,

87
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.980
he wins his second title, six fights in, he wins a junior lightweight title.

88
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.970
That's insane. Yeah.

89
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.630
<v 1>International. Okay. That wasn't the first one. Wasn't a real title flight.</v>

90
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:48.820
It was the what's. The second one was the WB.

91
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.870
<v 0>Title fight. 11 fights end. He wins his third world title. What in the.</v>

92
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.610
<v 1>I believe now there was at one point it was seven roll champions.</v>

93
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.670
And just that short period of fights, I believe it's around eight now,

94
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.540
eight roll champions. He's fought in just a short period, uh,

95
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.860
three different way classes.

96
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.790
<v 0>I think when he fought with Gandhi out,</v>

97
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.770
you really got a chance to see how he handles a real

98
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.260
world class, you know,

99
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.180
Cuban amateur system trained top of the food chain boxer.

100
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.820
And he just put it to that dude.

101
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.110
<v 1>That was the fight that actually really sold me on I go.</v>

102
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.890
Cause I thought for a fact that that was going to be a chess match because of

103
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:37.610
the boxing ability from Regan dollar, their styles were very similar.

104
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.500
And I thought that, you know, I was like,

105
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:42.050
it's going to be a boring fight for the first like four rounds,

106
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.110
which I still would have liked. Cause I like watching that type of fights,

107
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.010
you know? And um, I see I go in there and I'm expecting this fight, you know,

108
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.950
to the amateur background of both guys,

109
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.690
the how talented guys are in a skill level of both guys and then

110
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.540
Mexican, I know I'm two or three rounds into it and I'm going,

111
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.170
he's playing with Brigham dough, playing with them. I'm going to hell.

112
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.130
That's the fight that really sold me on Loma Jayco. That he's that good.

113
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.060
<v 0>My man, Vinny Pazienza called that, not Vinny, the ends of the boxer,</v>

114
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.420
Vinny paths, the rapper, this guy jet on mine tricks. He called it.

115
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.000
He was taking, he was taking bets on Instagram.

116
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.880
<v 1>He called it that early too.</v>

117
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.740
<v 0>Yeah. It seems taken bets on Instagram.</v>

118
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.840
And you think [inaudible] has anything for him?

119
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.280
He's like fi five minute DMS. He goes, it's bet.

120
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.430
<v 1>Yep. I, uh, I took Loma Shanko and I fight,</v>

121
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.370
but I thought it was going to be a close fight, a really close fight.

122
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.710
And I thought Loma Chanco was going to pull ahead in the later rounds, you know,

123
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.860
and when that fight. So that's why I really surprised.

124
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.930
<v 0>MI well, it was a stunning display of talent. He such a weird guy too,</v>

125
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.090
because his background, you know,

126
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:51.050
the store where his father took him out of boxing and made him do traditional

127
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:56.000
Russian dancing for several years and just made him learn that for

128
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.770
footwork. It seems like his dad was just a mastermind architect of a champion.

129
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.220
Yeah.

130
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.300
<v 1>And you applied no more on this,</v>

131
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:05.840
the Norwood didn't he also have a martial art background. I heard.

132
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.500
<v 0>Uh, he definitely can do martial arts techniques. I've seen it,</v>

133
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
but I don't know what.

134
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.660
<v 1>I may.</v>

135
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.640
<v 0>Have a martial arts background. Maybe. I don't know. That makes sense. He's a,</v>

136
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.860
his foot work though is so extraordinary.

137
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.740
And if that really is that dancing background,

138
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.810
like learning the footwork and the,

139
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.220
the way he he's so agile with the stepping of his feet, it's like,

140
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:30.710
I think a lot of people are going to learn in mere that.

141
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.940
<v 1>Yeah. His training regimen is pretty brutal. So I got a buddy, uh, Roger Romo,</v>

142
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.130
um, good friend of mine. He's actually,

143
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:39.980
he was working for a little while there up until the last fight.

144
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:42.710
He was a strength and conditioning coach with Sicilian Flores,

145
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.990
who was mine when I was an Ochsner training.

146
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.280
And they said it was just crazy that the hours that he puts in, how he trains,

147
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:52.460
how hard he trains and some of the drills that he does, you know,

148
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.790
I'm looking at them and going, I could use these, not for me,

149
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.460
but I could use them for somebody athletes that I got now.

150
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.360
<v 0>Yeah. He's um, he's definitely something special and you know,</v>

151
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:03.920
you get those guys and it's just,

152
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.550
it's kind of a shame that he's a little too small for Terence Crawford.

153
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.150
You know? I mean, I really would love to see those two fight,

154
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.900
but it seems like Crawford's just a little bit too heavy for him.

155
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.830
<v 1>I agree. But that's, uh, you know, and that's another touchy subject, uh,</v>

156
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.390
cause I kinda agree with you,

157
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:24.650
but I also go back cause I'm always trying to really break down and nitpick.

158
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.270
I look at guys like Manny Pacquiao, who was it who came from,

159
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:33.320
I believe one 12 or something like that and went up all the way to junior

160
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.040
middleweight, which is crazy. Yeah. He's small, shorter than,

161
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.660
than Loman Chanco and it,

162
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.680
other than his calves and I don't think anything else is much bigger than Loman

163
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.590
Chanco on his body and he was able to do it.

164
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.410
<v 0>And what the is going on with his calves? I don't know.</v>

165
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.370
It's like he's keeping hams in them. I don't know.

166
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.840
<v 1>He does. I, you know, I wish I knew the secret today cause I could use it. So.</v>

167
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.650
<v 0>Get that secret to Jones.</v>

168
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.830
<v 1>Article says that his mother was actually a martial art still is a martial</v>

169
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:01.980
artist. Oh interesting. Hmm. Gymnast and martial artist.

170
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.020
Well it makes sense boxer. Yeah man footwork. The way he does it is just,

171
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.010
it's something to watch, man. It's just the, the,

172
00:09:10.011 --> 00:09:15.000
the ability to do move and also to anticipate the other fighters

173
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.460
movements it's like, especially earlier in his career,

174
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.620
it's like he was fighting guys that just,

175
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.770
they seemed so crude in comparison to his approach. You know,

176
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.110
it's even more crazy about it as being the opponent because usually you go into

177
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.710
a fight and you break down film and you're going over to film and you got a good

178
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.320
idea of what he does. Right. What he does wrong and,

179
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:37.110
and what you might want to have to do long. And frankly,

180
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:40.920
it's hard to pick up where he's going to go. He different angles. So you can't,

181
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.800
you can't go well, you know what, after he throws the right hand,

182
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:47.490
he likes to move over to the left because he does it one time.

183
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:50.160
And then the next time he's totally somewhere opposite. You know what I mean?

184
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.840
And yeah, the angles, it's really almost impossible to break film down on them.

185
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.510
You know, like this last bite we'll just portray as, so everybody's going,

186
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.010
that was the blueprint. No, no, no. It wasn't, you know, uh,

187
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.580
inner and it was a closer fight than people expected. I go, why?

188
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.550
Because he finally got hit with more than 11 punches.

189
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.940
<v 0>Oh, that's him doing some, uh, Samba, I believe. Yeah.</v>

190
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.350
He's a trained at when he was a younger Greco. Roman. Yeah. Yeah.

191
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.890
He's he's slamming kids. That's right. Well, you know what, man,

192
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.180
I believe in cross-training and I think that there's certainly some skills that

193
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:27.630
would make you better at different martial arts. And uh,

194
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.610
I feel like if you have the ability to wrestle guys and,

195
00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:35.850
and move guys' bodies around like that, you would get from something like Samba.

196
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.410
I just feel like as a, an elite boxer, having that extra strength,

197
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:44.430
that extra ability to move your core that way. I think that would be beneficial.

198
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.653
Yeah. I mean,

199
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.520
the thing is no world-class boxer has the time to also be doing judo and also

200
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:52.770
be doing wrestling. You just don't have the time, no.

201
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.660
<v 1>Being in combat sports. Even I know that as far as I'm not involved in MMA,</v>

202
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.840
but I know that, you know, these guys, they have to, uh,

203
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.370
perfect three or four as much time in a short period of time. You know,

204
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:07.200
I imagine, I think Matt was telling me,

205
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.760
you will know more like sometimes it's two days of one, two days of the next,

206
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.800
um, trying to fit that in. Yeah. It's hard. You cannot, especially in boxing,

207
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.320
the sweet science where it's just hands, but you got people,

208
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:20.640
that's all they do all day long.

209
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.050
That's why I say it's so unfair when an MMA guy goes into fights and may

210
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.820
whether, because Mayweather,

211
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:30.390
he perfected that and you got to use just that style of boxing.

212
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.170
It's going to be almost impossible to beat a boxer, a rural champion.
