00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Well,</v>

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.140
we were talking about everybody that like came up in the sixties, the seventies,

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:09.420
the eighties, the nineties, everyone before social media,

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.170
the wild lives that they led. You can't do that anymore.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.250
<v 1>I can't do it. And what this comes as you came for all, y'all just tuning in.</v>

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.500
We was talking about like, you know, Chris brown,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.930
I'll see Chris brown he'll come at my house and he'll he'll,

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.870

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:28.800
you're just too talented for, for one cats. Like him and Justin Bieber,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.820

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
They can fight. They they're athletic and they sing.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
They can dance dance. The first time I met Chris brown, this is crazy.

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.390
I'm throwing a party in Miami and it's me and Collin Farrow, Eddie Murray,

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.160
you know, Eddie Murphy. If he was still in it, this year's back to 2005,

15
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:56.760
maybe I think. Yeah, 2005. And uh,

16
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.230
so I'm hosting a party where in Miami, the crowd's going crazy,

17
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:05.640
but in the down, like not in the VIP is some kids dancing. I'm like,

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.260
who the is that? And they dance and all this. And so my DJ DJ area, he goes,

19
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.340
yo man, that's a new kid, Chris brown, yo, he bout to be the next one. I said,

20
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:18.300
yeah, but he think he can dance. Cause you know, I, not that I gonna him up.

21
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.310
You know what I'm saying? This young lumber going to know who I am.

22
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:24.570
I come down and him up. And it was like Fox. Okay. So I go down now, now,

23
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.990
you know, it's sort of my time. And so everybody's following me.

24
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.800
I'm about to go battle whoever this kid is. So I said, yeah bro,

25
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.990
you think you can dance? Huh? I did like some kind of.

26
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.950
Like listen to me, we're all,

27
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.810
we're all jammed together. Right? He doesn't do a move. You know what he does?

28
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.090
He does a back flip, but the way he did the back flip and he's six,

29
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:52.440
two, he standing in the middle of the crowd. He jumped over the crowd,

30
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.370
did the back, flip up here and came straight down and said, what's up? I said,

31
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.690
I'm going to leave you the blind.

32
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.290
I don't know what the that that's some Avenger. And I just remember going,

33
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.000
I said that dude, when he get on and then, you know, he gets on,

34
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.710
but then social media catches on and then it's just hard. It's hard. It's hard.

35
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.830
It's hard to live. Uh, when you live,

36
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.430
when your social media and I tell them all the time you have to social media

37
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:20.820
sorta makes you color inside the lines or try to,

38
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.850
or try to yeah. Or, or like this,

39
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.050
it makes you tuck your artistry in sometimes a little bit.

40
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.630
Does that make sense to you? Crazy and Tucky crazy.

41
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.460
And you tuck your artistry and like, I didn't know what a mean wasn't, you know,

42
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.800
um, you know, I'm gonna, I was just catching on the mindspace and,

43
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.113
shifted.

44
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.490
So my daughter sends me a picture of Rihanna, right.

45
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.500
Going to the met ball. And by the time I got the picture, whatever happened,

46
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.170
the picture was Rihanna and in his yellow dress and I hit my daughter.

47
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.300
I said, I love the dress is amazing.

48
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.960
I don't understand the pizza that's in it. But man, you know, maybe that's,

49
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.101
uh, you know,

50
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.280
she's giving a nod to Italy and where maybe she got the dress for me.

51
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.410
She's like, no, dad, that's a meme. I said, what? That's a meme. I said,

52
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.320
what do you mean? She says, no, there's actually not a pizza in the dress.

53
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.090
Somebody crafted or fixed there.

54
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.650
<v 0>It made it look like it's pizza because oh, cause it's trailing behind her.</v>

55
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.730
<v 1>And so me I'm thinking, well, what the is it mean? This is not that,</v>

56
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.900
that's what I said.

57
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:33.670
So this girl worked her whole night to get this dress,

58
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.600
to go to the met ball, which is you're supposed to be, you know,

59
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.250
out the box and somebody puts a pizza on it. And that's all you say is a pizza.

60
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.260
I said, how do you compete with that? How,

61
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.320
how could you be Michael Jordan and kids run up to you and say,

62
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:52.120
you're the cry baby face. You cry, man.

63
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:53.410
They're going to cry, man. It doesn't matter.

64
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.510
<v 0>The best thing on the internet.</v>

65
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.240
It's one of the best things about the internet is people being able to make

66
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.074
funny.

67
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.210
<v 1>Yes thing, but watch this. So it, once it sticks, that's what I'm saying.</v>

68
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.103
Once you stick,

69
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.960
I mean Michael Jordan to somebody under the age of 18, he the cry baby face.

70
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.660
Amen. Amen. And then you know how, uh, you know how fans do it, man?

71
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.070
Cry right quick. God. Yeah.

72
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.170
Let me get you cry. It's so true.

73
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.810
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah man. It's tough. Well,</v>

74
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.650
we were talking about John Jones and how John Jones is fighting this weekend.

75
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.930
Jon Jones is a wild.

76
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.590
That's why he's the greatest light heavyweight of all time,

77
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.850
because he's so it's part of.

78
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.960
<v 1>You have to have it. We was talking about being with Mike Tyson,</v>

79
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.510
Mike Tyson, back in the day. You couldn't, that's why when people say like,

80
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.510
why does Mike Tyson? He, first of all, he's a fighter. He's not a tennis player,

81
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.160
but Mike was a wow boy. And to hang out with him,

82
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.560
you could understand like he was the biggest person on the planet

83
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.320
and he had the demons, you know what I'm saying? And, but he's fun too,

84
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.090
because cause you see him in a club and he sees, he sees some girls, hi,

85
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.560
how are you doing? He like BMW. What do you like?

86
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.170
BMW like cars like BMW and crazy.

87
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.610
He'd take the girls out and go get a BMW. I mean, he was that crazy.

88
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.350
You know what I'm saying? Just to him, come on, come on.

89
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:24.100
Let's look at the beer and we'll open up the BMW dealership, but he was wild.

90
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:26.110
But I say just like, how we saying off here,

91
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.540
you can't have that type of talent in that

92
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:35.860
area and not have that. John John Jones camp, you can't,

93
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.120
you can't drink milk and, and almost kill somebody. You know what I'm saying?

94
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:43.490
You can't let me get that homogenized about to go. No you can't. Yeah.

95
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.110
<v 0>That'd be something about you. That's out Tata control, impulsive, wild,</v>

96
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:49.210
dangerous. And that's what makes him so great.

97
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.970
<v 1>Hey buddy, you even talked about, you look at the people on your wall.</v>

98
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.890
You look at Hendricks, you look at Elvis,

99
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.290
they have to have something because that's God let us,

100
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.780
God's going to give you something incredible.

101
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.920
But he's also going to give you something to anchor that because I believe this

102
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:05.900
is what I believe in. And you tell me if you believe this,

103
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.210
I believe in the yin and the yang of everything.

104
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:10.760
Meaning like when there's absolute light,

105
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.150
that has to be absolute darkness to balance it out. And that's what,

106
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:16.340
everything that we do, it's sort of like,

107
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.360
we're not going to get away with anything,

108
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.470
like anything that happens to you in life. You have to pay for it. Like I,

109
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:28.100
I it's like the grocery store. Okay. I got the career. Boom. Gotta pay for that.

110
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.530
Okay. I got the money. Boop. Okay. I gotta pay for that.

111
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.910
Then he'll come the family. Boom. Yeah. I need that money. Yeah. You, you, you.

112
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.610
When I'm going, I'm going, I'm a real release a story about you.

113
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.160
So it's all of these different things that you got to pay for.

114
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.300
And that's why you see these guys like that. Cause you know, like I said,

115
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.310
talking to Justin Bieber, you know everything. I said,

116
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:48.410
some of this is supposed to happen to you.

117
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.281
<v 0>It has to.</v>

118
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.910
He can't otherwise the thing of the success that kids had at 20 years old,

119
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.660
it's impossible. I was just reading some about him canceling his tour.

120
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.780
Cause he just said too much work. I mean, he's just going crazy I guess.

121
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.570
But he's made $93 million this year.

122
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.510
Like Jesus Christ 20.

123
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.600
<v 1>And for us we like. Cause you know, I ain't 20.</v>

124
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.770
I'm going to take that 90 million. I'm going to go do a million,

125
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.330
but we can't be in his mind and we can see how it is. He grew up that way. He.

126
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.350
<v 0>Grew up that way. Never.</v>

127
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.760
<v 1>Had a normal life. And you don't expect like, I, I like,</v>

128
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.240
I always tell kids who want to be in this business to please wait.

129
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.850
Like even when my kids just wait, wait until you like,

130
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.990
wait till you get an understand. Like I was able to be grown and,

131
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:35.480
and have some grown happen to me and just regular life should happen.

132
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:36.620
So then when this happened,

133
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.210
I still have a point of reference to get back to because you know,

134
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.890
like I know you've interviewed everybody.

135
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.410
This business affects you in such a way where you'll see one person one day,

136
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.150
I won't say the comedian's name,

137
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:54.170
but I remember a comedian back in the day did like half of an HBO, whatever.

138
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.360
And then the next week I saw him,

139
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:00.290
he had 12 bodyguards and they were pushing me back. I was like,

140
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.990
what the man? Yo man, yo now, right now just getting crazy. He got crazy, crazy.

141
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.340
They get crazy because, and I've seen,

142
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.580
I won't say the names would have been a couple of guys.

143
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.230
I never get this one dude hit.

144
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.080
And I want him to try to say something to him.

145
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.150
And for some reason he had a white suit on, we want a club.

146
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.510
Why the does he have this white suit on? And these big shades.

147
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.250
And I went to talk to him and he said, not right now, man, I'm rich. He said,

148
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.510
that's why they got rich.

149
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.510
Let me be rich and famous right now.

150
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.780
I don't want to hear your pitch because I was going to pitch him something.

151
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:42.890
I said, man, you think you could get away. And I was like, and as he said it,

152
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:46.280
I had to sort of like, okay, get up. But that's, you know,

153
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:47.540
that's what happens when you got.

154
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.010
<v 0>Be careful that tide goes in and it goes out and people come up and they</v>

155
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:55.710
remember, they remember, they remember when you with them and we've.

156
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 1>Seen, and we've seen him. We've seen him, but, but being a comedian, we get,</v>

157
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.700
we get a chance to sit in a different seat because we sorta are,

158
00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:08.340
our jobs are, or our observational. You know what I'm saying?

159
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.020
We still all have our own demons, but it's,

160
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.940
it's just different when you see it humbled.

161
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.760
<v 0>As a comedian. Yeah. You got to get those jokes.</v>

162
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:17.730
You're performing in front of a live audience. It's all live.

163
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.620
It's got to work and it doesn't work.

164
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.660
You got to go back to the drawing board has.

165
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.560
<v 1>Got assess.</v>

166
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.860
<v 0>Actors. Don't get a lot of that.</v>

167
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.480
That's one of the reasons why they're kind of shaky more shaky. Right?

168
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.760
Don't get a lot of like that.

169
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.030
Testing it live in front of people that humility that comes with that.

170
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.440
<v 1>And, and it's, and it's tough.</v>

171
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.320
I was talking to her act another actor and it's tough. Cause see,

172
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:41.400
I'm a comic who became an actor. So I'm cheating. You know what I'm saying?

173
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:43.980
I can go do this and I can go. I'm going to be, I'm going to be in St.

174
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:46.420
Louis tomorrow, you know, some jokes so I can, you know, I gotta,

175
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.730
I can get my thing off, but just actors, it's tough.
