00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.240
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So actually there's a set of books that,</v>

2
00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.200
that let lay this out perfectly. You read,

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.280
dosyeskis wrote a book called the possessed or the devils, and it's a,

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.480
it's a description of the initial breakdown of the,

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.560
of Orthodox Christian society in, in Russia,

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.950
in the late 18 hundreds and the rise of radical soul socialist ideas. So it's,

7
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.870
it's sort of like the prodroma to the Russian revolution. It's a brilliant,

8
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.390
brilliant book, brilliant book,

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.350
and it concentrates on the personalities that are involved.

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.550
And then if you read after that, sojani and goag arch,

11
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:37.110
capelago where he details. What he did does in that book is quite remarkable.

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.550
So he says, look,

13
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:43.020
there were tens of millions of people killed from 1919 to 1959 in the Soviet

14
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:46.260
union. And as a consequence of internal repression.

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.140
And it's so dreadful, that words can't do it justice. I mean,

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.220
it's absolutely dreadful what happened in the Soviet union. I mean,

17
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.220
just for starters,

18
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.740
6 million Ukrainians died in the 1930s because of enforced starvation. In fact,

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.170
in, in, in the 1930s, here's, here's how, here's how terrible it was.

20
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.690
So all the food that the collective farmers,

21
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.130
newly collectiveized farmers had produced, which wasn't very much by the way,

22
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.930
was taken from them and brought to the cities.

23
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.850
So all the farmers starvveed to death now, here's, here's how draconian it got.

24
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.330
So let's say you were the mother of some children and all your grain had been

25
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.930
shipped off to the cities and you thought, well,

26
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:21.490
I'm not gonna have my children's starve to death.

27
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.840
I'm gonna be go out in the field and I'm gonna on my hands and knees.

28
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.320
And I'm gonna pick up the grains that are left over that the harvesters didn't

29
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.960
count get, and I'm going to feed those to my kids that was punishable by death.

30
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.440
You were supposed to hand in those extra bits of grain so that they could be

31
00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:40.440
shipped to the city as well.

32
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.390
So that was just the beginning of the fund in the Soviet union.

33
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.670
And what soldier knitson did was say, look,

34
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
this wasn't a consequence of the Marxist system gone wrong.

35
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.430
This was a consequence of the Marxist system.

36
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.670
It was inevitable consequence of the axioms of the marxis system.

37
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.700
And then he lays that out and, and, and it's, I think he got it right.

38
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.900
And what is that connection? Why the Nobel prize, but what is the connection?

39
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.120
It, the,

40
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.460
how much tyranny you have to impose in order to produce something like equality

41
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:17.300
of outcome. The, the, and Thomas soells talked about this a little bit too.

42
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:22.060
He said what the people who are agitating for equality of outcome don't

43
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:25.730
understand is that you have to need so much power to the authorities,

44
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:28.490
to the government in order to ensure equality of outcome,

45
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.850
that a tyranny is inevitable and that's right.

46
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.770
And the other prob another problem with equality of outcome.

47
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.570
This is also a big technical problem is like, well, what measure of outcome?

48
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.320
You know, there's lots of outcomes. Like how happy are you? How much pain win?

49
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.680
How healthy are you? How much money do you have?

50
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.680
How much opportunity for movement forward, do you have?

51
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.120
What's the width of your social connections?

52
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.240
Like what's the quality of your friendships?

53
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.040
Do you have exposure to art and literature? Like, you know,

54
00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:00.800
you can multiply the number of dimensions of evaluation between people

55
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.800
ennuerably right, because there's, there's all sorts of ways to classify people.

56
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.360
You're gonna get equality of outcome on every one of those measures

57
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.800
is like everyone going to have to be equally happy in their relationship.

58
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.190
And if not, why not? Why, why stop with economic E why stop up with pay.

59
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.470
There's no place to stop. So, and that's,

60
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.550
and that's a huge technical problem because there is no place to stop.

61
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.990
There will be no stopping. It's like, nobody can have anything else.

62
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.190
Nobody can have anything that everyone else doesn't have at the same time.

63
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.350
That's the ultimate outcome of equality of outcome. Well,

64
00:03:36.351 --> 00:03:40.900
you think about what that would mean. It terrible. Well instantly you think, oh,

65
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.900
well there's nothing, but a tyrannical system could impose that.

66
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.220
Have you ever debated.

67
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.100
<v 1>A Marxist supporter?</v>

68
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.420
Have you ever debated someone who is pro-equality of outcome?

69
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.700
<v 0>No, they don't debate me. Well, the only,</v>

70
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:55.940
the closest thing I think was to that was the debate I did at the university of

71
00:03:55.941 --> 00:04:00.090
Toronto about the bill C 16 issues, but they didn't actually have a debate.

72
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.010
They had a forum, which is the post-modern equivalent of a debate.

73
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.050
It's supposed to be friendlier, I suppose. Um, but no, uh,

74
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.850
I haven't because people don't do it. They don't ask me to do it. But what is.

75
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.770
<v 1>It about that idea or that ideology about Marxism?</v>

76
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.930
That's so attractive to young students and,

77
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.320
and to university.

78
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320
<v 0>Professors. Oh, that's a good question.</v>

79
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.680
I think it goes back to the issue of inequality and,

80
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.680
and this is something that has to be dead seriously addressed. It's like,

81
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.560
you might say, well, why is the left wing necessary? Let let's,

82
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:34.640
let's put it that way. And so, and then a subset of that would be, well,

83
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.200
why is the left wing attractive? Well,

84
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:40.160
the left wing is necessary because inequality does spiral out of control.

85
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.510
And so there has to be a political voice for the dispossessed. And you,

86
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.470
you don't want people to stack up at zero, you know,

87
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.710
where they can't play the game at all. It's a bad idea. Not only do you, not,

88
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.830
if people stack up at zero, they're too poor to get ahead at all.

89
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.830
Let's say they're too poor to open a bank account.

90
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:58.430
They're too poor to buy enough food.

91
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.430
Like they're stuck at zero and they can't get out of it.

92
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.980
It's a really bad scene because first of all,

93
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.420
that's a lot of suffering and that's not so good. Second of all,

94
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.300
well, at least in principle, a lot of those people might be, um,

95
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.180
what might have something to offer the world or their children might,

96
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.540
and you want to open up avenues of opportunity to them so that they can succeed,

97
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:22.970
but so that everyone else can benefit from success. So,

98
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.370
and then the next thing is, well, if the inequality gets outta hand too much,

99
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.490
then the whole society starts to destabilize.

100
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.090
Because if you get enough people stacked up at zero, especially young men,

101
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.970
you get enough young men stacked up at zero, they think, oh, to hell with it.

102
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:39.970
We'll just flip the whole board over and it'll settle in a new configuration.

103
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.880
And maybe we won't be stuck at zero in of configuration.

104
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.080
So it fo revolutionary thinking.

105
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.040
So there's lots of reasons to be concerned about inequality.

106
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.400
And so you need a voice on the left to say, look, we gotta parameterize the,

107
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.680
the tendency towards inequality so that it doesn't,

108
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:56.640
detabilize the entire society. So that it's,

109
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:01.280
everybody has an opportunity to advance. Like, yes. Right. You need that.

110
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.240
Okay. So that's the technical reason for the necessity of the left.

111
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.080
And then I think it's attractive because, well,

112
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:09.680
because young people can be resentful,

113
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.880
partly cuz they're at the bottom of the heap, so to speak.

114
00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:15.520
They're not cuz they're young. Like, look, you want to be,

115
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.070
you wanna be in 18, you wanna be rich in 80,

116
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.270
which you gonna choose most people's gonna take poor at 18. Well, yeah.

117
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.390
&lt;laugh&gt; especially if you've been rich at 80 and you understand you can get back

118
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:29.430
there. Yeah. Well that's the thing, you know,

119
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:34.110
is that most of the people who are have a million dollars or more in the

120
00:06:34.111 --> 00:06:38.180
United States are old. Well, why is that? Well, I really do.

121
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:39.260
We need an explanation for that.

122
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.700
It's like you've had a lot more time to make money. How would that be?

123
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:43.700
That's the explanation.

124
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:46.820
So that's one of the big drivers of inequequality is just simply age,

125
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.580
but it's not obvious that the old rich people have an advantage over the young

126
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.820
starting out people. So, so anyways, but any anyhow,

127
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.410
maybe you're resentful and your cuz you're young and you're still at the bottom

128
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.810
of the heap and you know, you've got other problems too.

129
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.930
It's more difficult for people of your race or ethnicity or gender,

130
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.810
at least you think it is. And so you say, well, I wanna make things fair.

131
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.770
And then that's also driven by some real compassion because nobody really likes

132
00:07:13.771 --> 00:07:16.210
that the consequences of radical inequality,

133
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.800
like nobody likes the fact that homeless people exist and have to go to the

134
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.200
emergency ward, you know,

135
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.080
to get treated and they don't have medical coverage and they have to live

136
00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:29.800
intense on the street. And so if you have some compassion, then you think, well,

137
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.440
we gotta do more for the poor and dispossessed. It's like, okay, that's,

138
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.600
that's an understandable sentiment. But the problem is is that the people,

139
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.910
but the miss is that it's, that, that,

140
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.670
that desire to help is contaminated by resentment and ideological certainty.

141
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.470
And then also by something that George Orwell pointed out so nicely in his book

142
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.750
road to wig and pier, it's like the typical middle class socialist.

143
00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:57.310
This was his diagnosis. And he was a socialist by the way,

144
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.540
his diagnosis was the typical, a gold middle class, intellectual socialist.

145
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.140
Doesn't like the poor. In fact,

146
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.740
they don't have anything to do with the poor they're contemptuous of the poor,

147
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.380
but they hate the rich.

148
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.620
And I think it's even more devious than that because I think who they hate are

149
00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:16.540
the successful, some of the successful or rich,

150
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.730
but really who they hate is the successful it's it's like key can enable it's

151
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:21.930
thetelling of cane enable.

152
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.410
And so there's some positive motivations for being engaged on the left.

153
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:27.290
And there's a lot of negative motivations as well.

154
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.730
And the people who are really driven by the radical left ideology,

155
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:34.730
the real radicals, they're almost all driven by, by resentment and hatred.

156
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.450
As far as I'm concerned. Now,

157
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.010
the let let's look at both extra.

158
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.960
So back to the idea of the,

159
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.720
of the ideological and verbal territory, I said with bill C 16,

160
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:49.880
that I wouldn't speak the language of the radical leftist,

161
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:52.360
because I don't think that that language should define the game,

162
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.880
but let's say it does. So here's the game.

163
00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.680
The world is a battleground of groups and the they're battling for power.

164
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.120
That's it that's the game.

165
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.440
And some of them win and they oppress those who don't win.

166
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.800
So that's how we're gonna view the world. Okay. Now the left is say, okay,

167
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:12.280
well here's the oppressed people, the oppressors,

168
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.950
the patriarchy P article types.

169
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.790
They should be ashamed of themselves and give up some power and the right

170
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:22.070
wingers, the radical right. Wingers, look at that. And they say, oh, I see.

171
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:26.550
So the game is ethnic identity. Is it? It's it's identity politics. Okay.

172
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.910
We're white males. We're not gonna lose.

173
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.750
That's the right wing version of identity politics. It's like, screw you.

174
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.180
If we're, we're gonna divide into groups.

175
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.140
If we're gonna divide into tribes and I'm in my tribe,

176
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.260
I'm not gonna get all guilty and lose. I'm gonna get all cruel and win.

177
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.220
And that's like, then you think, well, there's people in the middle.

178
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:50.380
They're kind of looking back and forth.

179
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.660
Which side of the identity politics spectrum. I might get a fallen.

180
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.050
Do I want to go with the, do I want to go,

181
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.050
do I wanna be driven primarily by compassion?

182
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:03.410
And am I going to accept guilt for my historical privilege?

183
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.330
So that's one possibility. And then I'm the oppressor,

184
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.170
I'm the member of the oppressor group? Or am I gonna say, oh no,

185
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:10.650
to hell with that, I'm just gonna play to win.

186
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.330
Well then I'm gonna go to the right. It's like, well,

187
00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:15.610
my sense is how about we don't play either of those games?

188
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.360
And the reason we shouldn't play them is, well,

189
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.840
the Soviets played the left wing game and like killed.

190
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.800
Who knows how many tens of millions of people. You can't even count.

191
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.000
It accurately. The estimates range from 20 to a hundred million,

192
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.120
those are pretty big error bars. And the,

193
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.160
and the Moists may be a hundred million, certainly 60 million. So, okay.

194
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.070
That didn't work out so well. And then there's the Nazis.

195
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:42.990
Like they played ethnic identity politics and racial superiority. It's like,

196
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:47.350
what do we, we wanna play that game. See what I've been trying to do. Really?

197
00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:49.990
What I've been trying to do for the last 30 years is say, look,

198
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.270
there's heavy temptations to play those sorts of games,

199
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.740
but that's not the only game in town. It's much game to play individual.

200
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.900
It's like, get your act together, stand up in the world,

201
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.540
make something of yourself, stay away from the ideological.

202
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:10.420
Oversimplifications set your house in order. That's rule six in the, in the,

203
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.180
in this book. So I have a book rule in there,

204
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:14.740
says set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

205
00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:19.610
And it's a very dark chapter about the motivations of the Columbine high

206
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:21.890
school killers. And this other guy named Carl panram,

207
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.570
who was a serial rapist and arsonist and murderer. And these,

208
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.930
he wrote an autobiography and the Columbine kids also wrote about why they did

209
00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:33.050
what they did. They're resentful to the core, bitter, bitter, resentful,

210
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.010
terrible and

211
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.800
well I'm suggesting that people will stay away from that resentment,

212
00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:43.120
resentfulness and bitterness, even though life is hard and it, and it,

213
00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:46.280
and there's malevolence in the world. It's like, yeah, you can,

214
00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:49.840
you can tell a story where everyone's a victim because we all die.

215
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.840
We all get sick, you know? And, and,

216
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.200
and things happen to us that are bitter and terrible betrayal.

217
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.560
Deceit lies. Like people heard us on purpose, you know?

218
00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:04.280
So it's not just the tragedy of life. It's malevolence as well. It's,

219
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.440
everyone's a victim. You can tell that story. The problem is,

220
00:12:07.441 --> 00:12:09.960
if you tell that story and you start to act it out, you make all of that worse.

221
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.360
That's the problem. And it's,

222
00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:16.430
so this is why partly I got attracted to Christian imagery, at least in part.

223
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.050
Um,

224
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.750
cuz there's an idea in Christianity that you should pick up your cross and like

225
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:26.590
walk up the hill and that's dramatically.

226
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:29.950
That's correct. That's the right answer. It's like,

227
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.540
you've got a heavy load of suffering to bear and a fair bit of it's gonna be

228
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.700
unjust. So what are you gonna do about it?

229
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.540
Accept it voluntarily and try to transform as a consequence.

230
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.060
That's the right answer. It's the right answer.

231
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.980
Cuz the rest of it is tribalism and we're we're too technologically powerful to

232
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:48.860
get all tribal again.

233
00:12:59.410 --> 00:12:59.530
<v 2>I.</v>
