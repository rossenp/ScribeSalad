00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, I wanted to talk to you about social media. Okay.</v>

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.520
Cause I, I love you. I love you too. I think you're a very good guy.

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.040
I really do. But you are the worst representative of yourself on social media.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.680
<v 1>I'm a bad lawyer, myself.</v>

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.320
<v 0>It's a bad form of getting out tricky ideas.</v>

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.230
It's a bad form. It's just not good. I mean, now it's what is it?

7
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:27.590
Two 80 now 280 characters. It's better than it was one 40 was very rough.

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.470
Like one 40. You'd have to, you know,

9
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.390
you have to really think about what you're saying. It's like, you're.

10
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.150
<v 1>Yelling like as you're falling into a, well, yeah, you have like one sentence,</v>

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.523
but you.

12
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.070
<v 0>You are without a doubt addicted.</v>

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.860
And I know bailed on your phone for a while and you went to a flip phone flip

14
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:47.540
phone. Yeah. But I see these manic tweets from you. And I,

15
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.580
I just want to go hang out with you and go, dude, what are you doing? Like,

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.340
why are you constantly tweeting and attacking people? And it's like.

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.780
<v 1>Sometimes the chaos helps me. You're right. I mean, you're right. &lt;laugh&gt; right.</v>

18
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.580
Like I'm not challenging that statement, but like,

19
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.050
I see it as almost like a idea sonar where you're.

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.970
<v 0>Just like, I, I get that. I get that. But I get that cuz I know you.</v>

21
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.650
And I know you're a really good dude in real life. Thanks man.

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.610
So when I see this online and I, I see these blurting outpost,

23
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.530
you just outbreak posts. They're just, they're just like, blah,

24
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.530
like you got meant to diarrhea.

25
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.920
I mean just let me see if I can throw the word in here for a goof.

26
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.400
Let me see if I can, you know,

27
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.640
say something that's gonna people off and it's just,

28
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.200
there's this weird thing you're doing like this Jess neck thing,

29
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.320
like you just decided to attack Anthony. Jman no, I'll tell you this.

30
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.720
Did he attack you? No.

31
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.640
<v 1>What happened was someone said that, uh, they had heard, I,</v>

32
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.400
he said I was AltRight, which is like the new, and.

33
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.310
<v 0>People can believe that they could believe that you were outright,</v>

34
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.310
but if someone tells them and they read one of your outrageous tweets,

35
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.190
just one or two of them, they would go, oh, this guy's an AltRight comedian.

36
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.710
And then they see you with certain people that you've had podcasts with and

37
00:01:56.711 --> 00:01:59.350
talked to that might also be lumped in you mean ridiculously.

38
00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:02.030
So like Jordan Peterson, they lump him into. Right, right, right. No, I gotcha.

39
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:05.500
Doesn't make any sense, but they do it. Yeah. Like, and look,

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.100
I've had people on that people think are AltRight. I mean, people,

41
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.980
this people are crazy. I mean,

42
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:14.420
there's people out there that think Ben Shapiro is antisemitic.

43
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.220
That's how that's how 90 people.

44
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.260
<v 1>I know there's no, there's no magic at all.</v>

45
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.740
Like right now Martin Luther king Jr.

46
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:22.980
Would be considered AltRight by certain crazy people.

47
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.610
<v 0>He would probably have adjusted his views. Don't you think? I mean,</v>

48
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.850
his views had probably changed knowing all that we know about people today.

49
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.330
And I mean, he would be a different person.

50
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.490
You gotta think that guy growing up in the 1950s and then, you know,

51
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.930
being into the sixties as a,

52
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.810
the most important civil rights activist of all time,

53
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.520
he was dealing with a completely different world, man. I mean,

54
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.840
there was no social media. There was there,

55
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:49.720
there was not much consolidated power.

56
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.640
It was probably very difficult to get people to March.

57
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:54.720
Once they started sick and dogs on people and blowing fire hoses on them.

58
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.400
I mean, you had to be, you, you had less protection then you had,

59
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.920
he'd had to be more,

60
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.720
more rigid and conservative then just because people would have to be like,

61
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:08.160
just very careful. That's a, you know, we, we talked about this recently,

62
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.080
I guess it was with, was it Daniel Belli? We were talking about,

63
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.680
about how recently slavery was. Was it him?

64
00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:18.440
Was it Daniela might have been either way. Um, it's, that's a crazy small,

65
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.790
all amount of time, crazy. 200 years ago. And it's been existed for.

66
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.670
<v 1>Like tens of thousands of years.</v>

67
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.550
<v 0>And that there's more slavery in the world today because there's more people</v>

68
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.910
alive. Yeah. It's kind of tricky,

69
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.110
but there's less percentage of people that are slaves.

70
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.230
It's kind of misleading when people say there's more slavery,

71
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.670
there's way more people.

72
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.060
<v 1>That's a good point. Yeah. There's more everything way, way, way.</v>

73
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.860
<v 0>Way, way.</v>

74
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.860
<v 1>More people. And there's way more crazy people. And now they all have internet.</v>

75
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.700
<v 0>Access. Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.820
Because I was looking at this thing where they were trying to trace, you know,

77
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:51.060
you've heard about that. Um, new species of human that they found,

78
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.220
I think around somewhere in the range of, uh, seven or eight years ago, IANS,

79
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.650
I think they called them. They, they found them in Russia and what they are is,

80
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.130
um, you know, when there was Neandertal and homo Sapian, there was another one.

81
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.570
And then this other one, um, bred there,

82
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.090
apparently they think there was many different kinds of humans. Oh yeah,

83
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.450
for sure. But what the, they think that freaked me out.

84
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:18.930
They were talking about how long ago this was like 70,000 plus years ago that

85
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.491
they were,

86
00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:22.440
they were talking about one era and then they were talking about the amount of

87
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:23.280
people that were alive then.

88
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:26.960
And they said something around the area of a hundred thousand humans, total.

89
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.000
<v 1>Amount. That's like, that's on the 4 0 5 right now. Just.</v>

90
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.400
<v 0>That on the 4 0 5 between here and like west Hills. Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.920
<v 1>Probably more. And that's why we have such a, a vicious, uh, instinct. Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.790
Because at that point it's I think it got down to like 10,000 people at one

93
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:44.540
point.

94
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.350
<v 0>Yeah. That what I was reading the article about, it was also talking about, um,</v>

95
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.110
in Sumatra and we talked about this recently, there was a gigantic,

96
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.070
super volcano that blew up. Right.

97
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.830
And it the earth up for like a thousand years. And we.

98
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.750
<v 1>Had to survive that. Yeah. And now we're trying to survive Twitter storms,</v>

99
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.100
but we have those same things, the same instincts that are like, if,

100
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.540
if you can't eat your dog right now, right. You're gonna die. Right. Right. Oh.

101
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.180
So anyway, with the jazzing thing, uh, so what happened?

102
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.140
So I just went on his and he had already blocked me and I had never written

103
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.020
anything to him. So I just, so I just posted that and said he got,

104
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.180
he has a lipo suction in his. Cause I thought that was funny.

105
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.860
Cause I didn't wanna go too big. I was like, but.

106
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.250
<v 0>Why even do that? Like who gives a? If he blocks you?</v>

107
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.610
<v 1>I just thought.</v>

108
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.930
<v 0>It was funny. Right. But you're attacking him publicly.</v>

109
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:30.410
This is the thing it's like, you have like how many thousands of Twitter follow?

110
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.290
<v 1>You have like 120,000. That's.</v>

111
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.090
<v 0>A lot of people. So a hun a lot.</v>

112
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.050
<v 1>He's a strong man. Like there's that have messed with me way crazy.</v>

113
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.570
<v 0>Recently. Strong man. Like that's gotta sting.</v>

114
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:45.880
There's be like this disturbance of peace and tranquility for no reason.

115
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.640
Just cuz he blocked you. What do you give a of you? I hope he block Ja.

116
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.320
I like ya. Go block me buddy. I love him.

117
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.400
<v 1>He's a good guy. He's a.</v>

118
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.680
<v 0>Great joke writer. He's a funny guy, man. This is the problem.</v>

119
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.840
It that like I'm a colleague of his,

120
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.040
I'm at the comedy store with him all the time. Yeah.

121
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.440
We go on back and forth next to each other all the time and you know,

122
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.200
there's like, you should attack someone when they do something really bad.

123
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.200
But see, but.

124
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.600
<v 1>You know what I'm saying? I do know what you're saying.</v>

125
00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:15.560
Like does she's sore until you absolutely need it? Yeah. I'm all about that.

126
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.790
And I, I wasn't like full of attack mode though. I, I was being.

127
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.270
<v 0>Playful. The wars started. You're talking about him getting lipo, suction,</v>

128
00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:26.470
talking about him being gay. And you're talking about,

129
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.350
you said a bunch of different things. Well.

130
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.550
<v 1>No, but that's after he said I was in response,</v>

131
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.070
he said that I'm an AltRight third rate piano comic. And I was like, dude,

132
00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:39.180
I just did a, a lipo suction joke. Mm. But the thing is,

133
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.860
I'm not even mad at the guy at all.

134
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.940
<v 0>Like I want them, you again, do a terrible job of representing yourself.</v>

135
00:06:44.941 --> 00:06:48.460
That's a good point because it seems to me, even I had a text to I'm like,

136
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.540
what are you doing? I know. And.

137
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.660
<v 1>By the way, I just wanna give you a compliment. Uh,</v>

138
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.180
I love that you're more critical offline.

139
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:57.300
Like you're one of the few people right now in this world. That's like, oh,

140
00:06:57.301 --> 00:07:00.490
what, what the you doing? I love but online you're chill.

141
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.170
When so many people are the opposite,

142
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.570
they attack online and apologize in the DM.

143
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:07.850
And you're I just wanna say that that's good leadership qualities. Oh.

144
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.890
<v 0>Well that's very nice for you, but I'm not trying to be a leader.</v>

145
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.370
I just try to be a good person. I think if you,

146
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:16.450
you have an issue with someone you should do, you should talk to them in person.

147
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.200
If you can, if not on the own, but that one on one,

148
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.800
like this idea that you should automatically blurt out what you think about

149
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:29.320
someone's public mistakes to the rest of the world to state your position.

150
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.160
Like there was a lot of the request to state your position after Louis CCK got

151
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.560
in trouble. Right? Right. I don't, I don't have no idea what actually happened.

152
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.470
If, if the way the women are telling it is a hundred percent true, then I am.

153
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.390
I think it's gross and disgusting. And I'm sad.

154
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.030
I'm sad that he had that in his head that he wanted to do that.

155
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.230
I'm sad that the girls had to experience it. It's an uncomfortable thing,

156
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.590
but I don't know that.

157
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.230
And I've heard stories about people thinking it was funny too. You know,

158
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.430
there's a, there was like this weird thing going on.

159
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.460
<v 1>To try where it's like, what side of the, what side are you.</v>

160
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.860
<v 0>On? But people were like this,</v>

161
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.580
the Lucy K instance was the first instance that I've can recall where people

162
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:10.100
were demanding a response, like a public response about.

163
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.260
<v 1>Something. Well, I noticed that in entertainment with Trump,</v>

164
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.780
it's like the lack of talking about Trump is now seen as endorsements.

165
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:19.380
Like when, when Taylor swift just didn't get involved in the chaos,

166
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.450
people were calling her like.

167
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.090
<v 0>AltRight &lt;laugh&gt; oh man, it's it's, there's so many people just waiting,</v>

168
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.090
waiting to pull the trigger and they're doing so in such a insane

169
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.810
and ridiculously misrepresented way. There was, uh,

170
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:38.250
something about Jordan Peterson, man, Jordan Peterson, um,

171
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.890
going to speak somewhere.

172
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.120
And there was these people sending emails that he was a Nazi and a fascist and a

173
00:08:45.121 --> 00:08:47.000
racist and transphobic. And just,

174
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.400
but they're just hurling these nuclear bombs of words with literal,

175
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.193
literally no word,

176
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.400
no thought whatsoever about the consequences of using these words to describe

177
00:08:58.401 --> 00:09:01.200
someone. Who's absolutely. Clearly not that. Of course,

178
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:03.880
of course it's when someone can't argue on another side,

179
00:09:03.881 --> 00:09:05.960
they just that's how they shut down the conversation. It is.

180
00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:09.600
But here's my point is that it elevates this manic,

181
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.400
misrepresentation of reality. Cuz they've agreed to not look at it.

182
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:16.390
Realistically. They've agreed. Who cares if he's not a Nazi,

183
00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:20.190
we're gonna call him a Nazi. And in doing that, you've you you're,

184
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:23.710
you're escalating. What's like if there's a mob mentality, right.

185
00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:24.550
It's part of what's going on.

186
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.230
One of the things that happens in mob mentality is people start murdering

187
00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:29.110
people. Yeah. You jump in. Right? Okay.

188
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.510
If people are killing people and you're trying to get away and the guy's running

189
00:09:31.511 --> 00:09:33.670
at you with a knife, you're gonna kill him. That's what people do.

190
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.220
It's it's a normal thing. It happens with mob mentality too.

191
00:09:37.221 --> 00:09:40.460
It happens this with this, these kind of arguments, the same kind of thing.

192
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.220
People can just decide. They don't care. If you're right,

193
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:45.780
they're gonna call you a racist. They're gonna call you a Nazi.

194
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.260
They're just gonna keep saying it until you believe it. 100% like this Nazi,

195
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.740
this Nazi it's Kurt, Matt gentlemen.
