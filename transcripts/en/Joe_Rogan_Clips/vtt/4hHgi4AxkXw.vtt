00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience and what blows my mind is that</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
science is the truth to me.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.760
Good science DNA is the truth.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.970
So here we had a case and this was one where I said, well,

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:16.740
I want to be convinced that he's innocent.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.450
So it's the case of this guy named Clemente, Gary. And if I tell you this story,

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.910
you'll say, you gotta be making this up.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.760
It can't be true because the story from start to finish is,

9
00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.510
is just mind-bending. He's a Honduran immigrant.

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.060
He is escaping Ms. 13 in Honduras and he wins

11
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:41.040
like what? It was like the Honduran version of the voice, right?

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.670
American.

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.770
<v 1>Idol, like American idol, Honduran, idol.</v>

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.890
<v 0>Honduran idol, when he's young, when he's in grade school.</v>

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.360
So the gang leaves him alone.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.800
Cause he's kind of a novelty and he's nicknamed shorty because he's only four

17
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.390
foot 11 as a grown person.

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.380
He's in his early twenties and the violence is getting so bad.

19
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.010
He's I gotta get the outta here. They kill his front friend.

20
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.160
They kill his best friend and dump them in the street in front of him.

21
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.050
So he flees to America and he does the whole circuitous route through

22
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.140
Mexico. Or he gets tries to get a Mexican accent.

23
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.940
He finds a coyote and he swims across the Rio Grande,

24
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.080
almost drowns. Um, and then he's taken,

25
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.380
um, I mean that whole story I could spend a half hour on.

26
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.450
He's putting in an escape hatch of a car and driven around the country till

27
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:35.160
he finally lands in Sanford, Florida. Right? And Sanford,

28
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.100
Florida is where the Trayvon Martin trial happened.

29
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.110
And I end up in front of the same judge that presided originally over the

30
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:47.310
Trayvon Martin trial. So Clemente is accused. He gets to Sanford,

31
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.360
Florida on a Saturday,

32
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:52.890
he's begins working at a golf course on a Monday climbing trees and cutting down

33
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.760
branches. One of the golf members says,

34
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:59.490
I like this kid's work ethic. You want to come work at my restaurant.

35
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.800
And he goes and begins working at the restaurant.

36
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.220
He lives in a trailer in the back of a trailer.

37
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.890
No on vagabond way.

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.080
And he's got neighbors who are three generations of poor white trash.

39
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.460
It's a grandmother, a mother and a daughter. And he's like a novelty.

40
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:20.970
They call them little Mexico. He's not even from Mexico. He can't speak English.

41
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:25.500
And he used to go and do Coke with daughter smoke, weed drink.

42
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.080
And it was like a outdoor dorm. You know,

43
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.220
they would go to his trailer. He would go to hers.

44
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.890
That was like, their doors were always unlocked.

45
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
He's out one day partying with his friends. He does Coke.

46
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.210
He comes home and it's like five in the morning.

47
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.430
And he wants a beer because he wants to try to come down.

48
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.200
So he waits till the sun comes up and he goes to knock on their door and he sees

49
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.770
a bloody shoulder blocking the door and he goes to push it open.

50
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:59.070
And the mother establish 129 times.

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.710
And he bends down here ranger to seeing violence.

52
00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:08.250
He bends down to check her and the dog starts barking.

53
00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:12.210
He hears noise and he picks up, he sees a butcher knife, bloody butcher,

54
00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:16.950
and I'm sitting on a, on a, a box and he picks it up and he screams in Spanish.

55
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.873
Anyone here,

56
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.670
he then walks into the other room and he sees the grandmother slumped over

57
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:28.590
in her wheelchair and he freaks out.

58
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.950
He goes, he's about to call the police. And he says, wait a second. I'm a legal,

59
00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:35.820
they'll never believe me. And can you imagine this on a cocaine bender? Oh,

60
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.990
so he leaves the trailer. He runs back to his throws,

61
00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:42.870
the knife and the grass takes off his bloody clothes off.

62
00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:46.530
His clothes are bloody because he picked up the mother and to check or pulse

63
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.610
takes off his clothes, throw them in a garbage bag,

64
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.990
puts them on top of his trailer,

65
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.020
the boyfriend and the daughter slept out that night. All right.

66
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:01.140
So the mother and the grandmother are dead. The daughter slept out that night.

67
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.160
He embarrassed or with me because this will,

68
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.280
this is like worth waiting for he,

69
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.790
the police show up a couple of hours later because the boyfriend has sent by the

70
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.330
daughter. Daughter says I have a weird feeling about my mother and grandmother.

71
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:22.140
Can you go check on them and get my work clothes? Because she worked at subway,

72
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.130
the sandwich shop.

73
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.470
So the boyfriend of the daughter discovers the dead bodies calls 9 1 1,

74
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.430
the police come, they come next door to Clemente's trailer and say,

75
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.280
did you hear anything last night? You know anything about this? He says, no,

76
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.143
he's freaked out.

77
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.380
He then goes to a friend's house and tells his friend what happened. He said,

78
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:43.380
I'm just going to go back and tell the cops what happened. This is America,

79
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:46.560
right? Oh. And the friend says, you don't know America.

80
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:50.280
You need to get the out of town. And he says, nah, I'm going back.

81
00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:53.520
I'm going to tell them. He goes back, walks over there and says,

82
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.790
tells them exactly what happened. Then they put them in handcuffs.

83
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.110
And then I sit them down and they say, listen, we know how you Latin guys are,

84
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.450
you wanted sex, right them, right? He says,

85
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.630
are you out of your mind? No,

86
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:14.460
I had nothing to do with this PS long story short,

87
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.320
he gets tried convicted and put on death row in

88
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:24.210
Florida crime scene analysts sat on their hands and knees for

89
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:25.710
days in the stinking,

90
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:30.150
Florida heat and scraping blood swabs in the trailer. Okay.

91
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.150
151 blood swabs. And what they're swabbing for is not the victim's blood.

92
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:40.050
They know it's the victim's blood. This woman has been butchered 129 times.

93
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.330
The crime scene analyst in his case testified that we were swabbing for evidence

94
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:47.730
of who the perpetrator was because in a knife fight,

95
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.460
the perpetrator often gets nicked and cut,

96
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:52.860
especially when you're stabbing someone that many times.

97
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.560
So when the innocence project got the case, they said, well,

98
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.710
what were the results of that blood test? You know,

99
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.430
how many drops of blood they tested, not a single drop of blood.

100
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.650
They never tested a single drop of blood because they thought that he was

101
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:13.750
guilty. We had the blood tested and right in the,

102
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.730
within inches of the mother's body,

103
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.180
in an abattoir room where the state argued the killer cleaned up is

104
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.890
the daughter's blood, a trail of the daughter's blood, going to the bathroom.

105
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.200
And then the mother's blood on the outside of the daughters. All right.

106
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.100
We did a, just a minimal investigation into the daughter.

107
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.420
And it turns out that she had a history of

108
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.370
crazy violence.

109
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.690
She had a condition called intermittent explosive disorder

110
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.910
where you would snap and just go off the rails.

111
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.080
It's a condition, it's a condition, a psychiatric condition.

112
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:57.610
We look at her medical file.

113
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.170
When she's diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder, they,

114
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.190
they put four points, restraints. That's your arms and legs.

115
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.660
And there's in the doctor's notes a few years before this happened,

116
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:14.830
where she says to her mother, I'm going to kill you. If I ever get out of here,

117
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:16.240
I'll kill all of you.

118
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.020
Then we find out that she is confessed all over town.

119
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.380
We had people coming in all over for the place,

120
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.840
testifying affidavits. He said,

121
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:28.690
I killed my mother and my grandmother I'll do it to you.

122
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.970
And I got her on the witness. So watch this. The state's still retries him.

123
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.930
His conviction gets overturned. The Florida Supreme court throws it out,

124
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.420
says that he is obviously,

125
00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:44.290
there's obviously a real problem here in the state. Instead of saying,

126
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:47.080
you know what? We screwed up here. They doubled down.

127
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.250
And it happens in all of our cases. Very rare, not all of them.

128
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:54.880
Most of them where the state comes up with new theory. And they said, well,

129
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.640
that must have been old blood from her cutting herself.

130
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.040
And they had no explanation for why her mother's blood is mixed with her blood

131
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.730
in her bedroom. Why her mother's blood is outside of her window.

132
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.470
I demanded proof there.

133
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:12.880
And there was in controvertible proof. So watch what happens.

134
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.750
There's a blood swipe on her mother's.

135
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.600
Her mother is struggling to get out of the house and the killer

136
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.640
grass that her and pulled her pants down. And there's a four finger blood swipe.

137
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.640
And I always thought it was weird or three finger blood swipe, excuse me.

138
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.560
And I always thought it was weird that there was only three fingers and blood at

139
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.400
someone trying to grab at her. So when I had her on the stand man,

140
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.870
I said, I got a court order to take pictures of her hands.

141
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.980
Cause I wanted to see if there were scars on her hand and she lifts up her hand.

142
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.320
Yeah. Her pinkie is bent down like this. And I said,

143
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.680
what happened to your pinky? She said,

144
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.680
I cut my finger off when I was 14. Cause I'm a cutter. And I severed my tendon.

145
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:06.660
That's exactly right. I said,

146
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.020
was your hand like that on the night that your mother and grandmother were

147
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:14.520
killed? She said, yes. And I looked at the prosecutor and I said,

148
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.040
have you, have you seen enough? They don't quit. I had,

149
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.940
they just want to win. They just want to win. They just want to win.

150
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.980
And he, I I'm,

151
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.900
I'm happy to report that after her examination and then an amazing examination

152
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:32.970
by my co-counsel Mari Parmer,

153
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.170
which explodes a bunch of other lies. The ex-boyfriend,

154
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.510
the ex-boyfriend's current wife came in and testified that he told her that the

155
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.680
daughter killed her. And that she snuck out of her house that night, his house,

156
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:50.490
that night climbed out of the window. And then return later in the night,

157
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.820
they dropped the charges in the middle of his retrial.

158
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.510
And I got to walk him out, um, off of death row.

159
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.440
And in Trump's America, they would not,

160
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.240
they put an immigration hold on him.

161
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.540
And it was like out of a movie.

162
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.850
He got walked out of the prison to immigration and there's

163
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:14.790
like a mountain crowd outside of immigration on,

164
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.650
we still don't know how it happened.

165
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:20.550
I got him an immigration bond and walked him out of the immigration center that

166
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:24.030
night. And to Jason's point, I have never,

167
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.760
other than the birth of my kids, marrying my wife,

168
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.790
hitting a home run and little league, I've never had,

169
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.360
I never floated like that. Right. Fighters,

170
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:37.860
winning world titles that you no better feeling than to restore someone's life.

171
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.230
<v 1>You hit a home, run a little league. One would be great.</v>

172
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.730
<v 2>Oh. So it's so hard to hear these stories, man. Cause you just imagine yourself.</v>

173
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.250
Did I get to you on that?

174
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.200
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. He's a beautiful guy too, Joe. I mean.</v>

175
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.650
<v 2>Some guy who comes to America, you know.</v>

176
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.390
<v 3>And you know, you meet, you know, you get me going, you meet this guy and.</v>

177
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.640
<v 0>Here's the crazy part I was called.</v>

178
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.680
<v 3>Oh God, he got crazy.</v>

179
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.180
<v 0>Sure. I'll tell you what I had to go through to get it.</v>

180
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:18.440
I'm not patting myself on the back. Watch this I've skipped one retrial.

181
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.500
The first retrial I was in front of a judge,

182
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.360
the same judge that denied him. Post-conviction relief said,

183
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.050
I don't care that the daughter's blood is there. That she confess, I don't care.

184
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.040
Watch this. She denied him. Post-conviction relief.

185
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.710
And she, he then gets his case overturned in the Supreme court.

186
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.720
Her credentials to serve as a judge in a death penalty case had lapsed.

187
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.390
After his case gets reversed.

188
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.950
She files for special dispensation to become a death penalty

189
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.990
judge and says, even though I don't still have my credentials,

190
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:58.750
I want to be the judge on his case, seeks out his case.

191
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.380
They're seeking the death penalty. And she denied him.

192
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:06.820
The constitutional protections that the us constitution said that when you death

193
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.420
qualify a jury, if you violate these rules,

194
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.990
the case is going back on appeal. And I would say to her, your honor,

195
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.010
you don't understand we're going to be back here again.

196
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.580
You can't not tell the jury. Don't research the case in the hallway.

197
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.610
They're going to research the case in the hallway. And she was,

198
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.550
she wanted to kill him. And at one point I stood up and I said,

199
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:30.370
I'll tell you something. I had to go at her so hard.

200
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.630
I find out that she was the judge and the Trayvon Martin case whose husband

201
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:37.510
represented George Zimmerman and wouldn't recuse herself.

202
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.040
So all of a sudden the papers start picking up that I'm clashing with her in

203
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.960
courts. And I,

204
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.160
one point had such a run in with her that I sat down and Clemente was crying.

205
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.260
And I said, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.040
I thought he was going to fire me because I went at it with her so hard.

207
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.290
And I said, I said, I understand. And he put his arm on me and he

208
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.060
she's going to kill me. He said, please keep doing

209
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.880
this. So I kept, I just kept going at her.

210
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.790
And she finally had to declare a mistrial

211
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.200
because a juror came in and said that they were all researching the case in the

212
00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.034
hallway.

213
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.070
And that they thought that he was listening to music because he was listening to

214
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:33.930
the translation on the headphones. So to get these exonerations,

215
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:36.510
it is such a grueling flight. And if you meet Clemente,

216
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:42.030
he is the most gentle kind human being and is

217
00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:46.350
still an immigration limbo. And to tell you what a great man, this guy is,

218
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.210
I'm in there in Florida, like fighting.

219
00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:53.970
Like I'm thinking there's no way I'm going to get him off.

220
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:57.210
And he's calling me going, listen, when we get them out, I'm going to get,

221
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.120
we'll get them up in an apartment and we'll pay for this and pay for that.

222
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.600
I thought he was crazy. I said, this guy has no clue.

223
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.690
And I'm up against and to, you know, um, I'm such a,

224
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.290
so in his debt and I, I I'm. So in awe of him, even though he's my friend,

225
00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:14.340
that to this day,

226
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.390
he and I have jointly supported Clemente financially,

227
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:23.370
but he pays for his room and board and to be able to be in a position to help

228
00:14:23.371 --> 00:14:27.210
these guys and just help them start a life again. And you know,

229
00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:31.080
this guy still believes in America after all that's happened to him,

230
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:32.850
he still believes it's the best place to be.

231
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.070
<v 2>What happens to a judge like that? How does a judge not go to jail?</v>

232
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.000
How, how does someone, I mean, how does someone get away with that

233
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:48.180
mean she's violating the law and, and clearly he's innocent, right?

234
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.500
So she's trying to kill a man who's innocent. I know the.

235
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.090
<v 0>Judge that took over the case,</v>

236
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.910
she had to recuse herself in a fit of embarrassment.

237
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.880
And the judge that took over the case was such a beautiful guy.

238
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.750
His name is judge Galluzzo and all he did was uphold the law.

239
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.030
And he, the prosecutors would come in and try to get rid of jurors that said,

240
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.260
I believe that, you know,

241
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:13.700
I'll listen to the facts and I will only get rid of,

242
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.600
you know, I, I will consider life instead of death.

243
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.340
And he was just so PR and you know, they have immunity is the short answer.

244
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:26.960
These judges and prosecutors, one of the many flaws of our system, right? Jason,

245
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:29.260
is that they all have immunity. So.

246
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.450
<v 2>What about these cops? When you're talking about the cop,</v>

247
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.620
beat the gun in the confession, how does a cop like that?

248
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.570
Not go to jail? How does, if you know that, what, where is that cop now?

249
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.970
<v 0>One of them got promoted. Um, one of them got promoted.</v>

250
00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:47.350
One of them got, um.

251
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.880
<v 2>This is a cop, know that the kid was innocent and that they did this.</v>

252
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.880
<v 1>Many times. They do Joe. And you know,</v>

253
00:15:54.881 --> 00:15:57.610
we can't say make a blanket statement that they all do.

254
00:15:57.611 --> 00:15:59.770
And none of us believe that all of them are bad,

255
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.370
but there are a lot of really bad actors throughout the system.

256
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.910
And they don't face repercussions. And as a result of that,

257
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.130
and it's so important for people to know this,

258
00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:11.050
I talk about it on my podcast all the time.

259
00:16:11.051 --> 00:16:15.010
And Clemente's episode is so wonderful because in, in that episode,

260
00:16:15.011 --> 00:16:18.670
you really feel his humanity. He still has a great sense of humor.

261
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.440
He still has a joy of life and all the exonerees I find have this sort of

262
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.230
incredible. I can only describe it as grace,

263
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.920
right after literally being to hell like death row in Florida,

264
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.650
it doesn't get closer to hell than that. Right.

265
00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:35.680
And he was there for 14 years and he talks about on the.

266
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.960
<v 2>Pilot, he was on death row for 14.</v>

267
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.590
<v 1>Years. Yeah. Listen, there's a lot, a lot of worse than that too. You know,</v>

268
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.310
don't get me started on Anthony at Panovich, which is a current case in Ohio.

269
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.680
You'll your head will explode. We got him.

270
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.640
<v 0>Off after he, he had, it was actually 10 of the 14 years.</v>

271
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.440
He was on Florida's death row.

272
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.470
The other four years were in jails not to be technical, but yeah,

273
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.550
he was on death row.

274
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.130
<v 1>Right now. But he he's funny, Joe.</v>

275
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.930
Cause we had to inject a little humor into this. Right? So in, in,

276
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.970
on the podcast, I'm wrongful conviction. He talks about how,

277
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.340
when he went to prison, he didn't speak English. And he figured he,

278
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.400
he remembered this Josh and he said he needed to learn how to speak English.

279
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.380
I figured I'm never going to get out of here if I can't, you know,

280
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.920
help in my own defense. So he asked the guard for a Bible and the,

281
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.920
by the guard said, there's no, no Bible to this. He goes, this is hell,

282
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.520
there's no Bibles here. So he gave him instead a letter of a book,

283
00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:28.750
a penthouse letters like porn. He gave him porn. And so Clemente says, he,

284
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.640
he read this thing 17 times and he says the 17th time,

285
00:17:33.641 --> 00:17:36.460
he finally got a hard on it. He says, but not because of the board,

286
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.190
because I realized I could speak English. Right.

287
00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.890
And when you hear him say this and you just, you want to hug the.

288
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.500
He's such a good and decent guy.

289
00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:47.200
And he just loves life and he appreciates everything.

290
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:51.210
But imagine that it took Josh Dubin, right?

291
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:55.920
One of the great lawyers in our country. Yeah. That's that's uh.

292
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.780
<v 0>Right after I, that was that's me on the right. That was right.</v>

293
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.950
That was the moment. That was the moment that he got exonerated. Wow.

294
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.340
And my co-counsel Lindsay boney and Dylan,

295
00:18:07.341 --> 00:18:11.510
black Southern gentlemen who this case changed their lives.

296
00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:16.460
And that's Mari Parmer, who I mentioned before. And when and where is he now?

297
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.190
He's so listen to this. How about this?

298
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.570
He would go into court when he was that guy and the white,

299
00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:27.050
and he would throw a fit. I'm innocent.

300
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.580
Who the are you to do this to me early in his court appearances.

301
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.530
When I knew him, he was very docile.

302
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.380
So he acted exactly how I would expect someone to act,

303
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.000
to watch this three days after he gets out. I always told him,

304
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.490
I'm going to get you outta here in jail. I would say,

305
00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:45.470
and I'm going to take you to the beach and we're going to have a beer.

306
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.110
And I would say to Jason, um,

307
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.190
now I'm starting to think that I'm not going to be able to live up to it.

308
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.500
And I get a call like two days after he's out, we're in a hotel.

309
00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.821
And I said, you know,

310
00:18:58.821 --> 00:19:02.870
he got located at this place called the sunny center in Tampa.

311
00:19:02.871 --> 00:19:06.050
It's this property where they have like efficiency, apartments for death,

312
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.670
rogues, honorees. And Jason goes to me, that's my place. I bought the property.

313
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.160
<v 3>I didn't even know it. I.</v>

314
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.350
<v 0>Mean, he's like this, guy's like Robin hood.</v>

315
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.260
<v 1>There's a gentleman on the beach in Miami and shorty,</v>

316
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.580
like literally from death row to the front row. Right. It's incredible.

317
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.650
And I actually, it's funny joke, as you mentioned,

318
00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:27.770
the music business before I actually had that experience about a year ago,

319
00:19:27.771 --> 00:19:31.670
this is off topic, but I can't help saying this is on my mind. Um,

320
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.670
about a year ago I was visiting an innocent guy. Well, no,

321
00:19:34.671 --> 00:19:37.220
a year and a half ago now. Cause it was early. Uh, late January.

322
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.750
I was visiting an innocent guy on death row in Texas named Rob Wil. And um,

323
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.050
I left there and flew to LA. Uh, that was on a Monday.

324
00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:47.510
I was down there and then, um,

325
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.650
flew to LA and ended up going to the Grammy's on Sunday and ended up, you know,

326
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:53.690
moving around some seats, whatever, and sitting in the front row.

327
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.600
And I had that feeling. I was like, holy, what a week?

328
00:19:56.601 --> 00:20:00.620
I literally went from death row to the front row. It's a strange life I leave.

329
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.160
It's it's a double life, but it's, you know, it's, it really is.

330
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.490
It gives a lot of meaning to, to our days, you know,
