00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.610
I keep thinking that one day they're going to come up with artificial Luke

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:06.960
Skywalker type hands,

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.780
and that people are going to want them instead of regular hands.

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.230
That's what I'm worried about. Wow.

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.780
If they came up with an arm, it would sound.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
<v 1>Like metal on metal. Unless if you had the skin like simulation, it could,</v>

8
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.600
I can play guitar with that. Maybe I'm talking about. So I do some wild.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.870
<v 0>I'm talking about self healing, Bulletproof,</v>

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.060
spider silk hybrid skin like that. The government's working on.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.210
They're working on that right now. They're working on some sort of odd.

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.590
<v 1>I don't doubt it, man. I, I, I read it. I went up, you want to hear a wild one?</v>

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.790
All right. I went on, you know, one night smoking. I went on a little YouTube,

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.790
uh, form whole situation.

15
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.910
And somehow I don't even know if it's a YouTube video or someone else,

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.830
but I wound up on this video that was like,

17
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.510
world's smartest kid thinks that CERN blew the world up in

18
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:01.140
2008. All right. And I'm like, what the?

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.330
So I go on this video, right?

20
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.990
And I'm watching this video and it's this young kid he's like 12.

21
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:09.150
And the talking, you know, half the, your,

22
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.580
you got to invest like 20 minutes into this.

23
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.180
Kid's talking about things that are super smart.

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.820
And it's kind of like to show you, he's super smart. You know what I mean?

25
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:20.760
This kid and his dad's doing the recording, I believe, or a relative,

26
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.750
somebody very close to him.

27
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.160
And he goes into this whole theory of how he thinks when they collided the,

28
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.360
the, the electrons. I believe in the, in the,

29
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:34.980
in the supercollider sorry that they cause some

30
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.360
crazy chain reaction that blew up the universe, but they also weighed, they,

31
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.030
they created an Adam that weighed too much.

32
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.280
And he had the first 20 minutes is also explaining infinite parallel universes.

33
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.410
So what the kid winds up with is this theory of like one Adam weighing too

34
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.280
much and weight.

35
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.930
And is that being just enough to shift our universe into a parallel universe?

36
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.440
So this guy had, this kid had me up because after I watched this,

37
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.880
everything I saw for months was talking about like, it would be news guy on the,

38
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:12.180
on the news. Like, I don't know what universe I'm in anymore, or, uh,

39
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.780
Spider-Man into the spider verse. Like all these,

40
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.710
everything I saw for like four or five months after watching this video was

41
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:23.160
like, multi-verse like about multi versus,

42
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.830
and it's got me up. Y'all I hear.

43
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.420
<v 0>You. I'm.</v>

44
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.450
<v 1>Up, man. Read this kid.</v>

45
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.620
<v 0>Look into it says there, he claims it's CERN destroyed the universe,</v>

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.470
doing recent experiments, which has resulted in us,

47
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:41.070
living in a nearby parallel universe instead.

48
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.110
<v 1>You're welcome, Betty. There's a lot of people.</v>

49
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.010
<v 0>Online. I think this is an explanation for all the Mandela effect things.</v>

50
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.400
<v 1>He goes into stuff about the Mandela effect, how they, you know,</v>

51
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.550
there's like apparently a bunch of people who think melody Mandela died in

52
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:57.810
prison. And like, there's, you know, as far as I know, he was released,

53
00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.440
became president in south America. You know? I mean,

54
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:04.330
that's the university just personally, you know, but it's crazy,

55
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.750
dude. One, because it's not just this video, it's like you watch it.

56
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.650
And that YouTube algorithm starts sending you down a whole bunch of other,

57
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:14.800
you know what I mean? You start hearing and it's like it's and then again,

58
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.410
everything that came out there was all these shows I would see,

59
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.930
or movies or news things about mult.

60
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.070
The multi-verse all of a sudden was everywhere around me. It was nutty dude.

61
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:25.960
So I'm up about that right now.

62
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.390
<v 0>If there was something that they can do,</v>

63
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.170
if there was something they could do that might open up a door to a parallel

64
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.150
universe, you don't think they would do it.

65
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.960
<v 1>Stranger things. You mean? Yeah. I'd say that's the.</v>

66
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.880
<v 0>Stranger things. I mean, things are strange, right? It's stranger things.</v>

67
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.020
<v 1>Bizarro world.</v>

68
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.340
<v 0>You know, what's the weirdest one is the like, well,</v>

69
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:49.720
the people that dismiss climate change,

70
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.810
that is the weirdest one to me because I'm like, what is the,

71
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.260
I'm trying to figure out? What's the benefit of dismissing climate change.

72
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.470
Other than if you work for like the oil industry or something.

73
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.440
<v 1>Excellent. Just lost the glacier. Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.620
Like they just posted a whole thing of 10 year or 80,

75
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:08.620
like something in the eighties, a glacier picture of it. And just now and it's.

76
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.400
<v 0>But I'm not even saying like blaming anybody for it.</v>

77
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.710
I'm saying dismissing it as an issue. I'm like,

78
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.920
let's pretend that people have nothing to do with it. Let's just,

79
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:22.660
I wish people had nothing to do with it because then we can go, holy.

80
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.720
It's getting hot. Like, how hot is it going to get?

81
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.940
Like we could just figure it out. Like if it was just like.

82
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.440
<v 1>Great at this point, when it's two degrees,</v>

83
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:31.330
the oceans are hotter than they've been in.

84
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.690
<v 0>Well, people do that where they try to say, well, this is a natural cycle.</v>

85
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.570
This is something that some people still say. Right. Okay.

86
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.610
Even if it was just a natural cycle,

87
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:43.510
I wish humans weren't in the equation at all. So there was no argument.

88
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.260
I wish it would just be like, Hey guys is again, really hot.

89
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.590
What the do we do as if we had no control over whatsoever?

90
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.190
Not saying that we shouldn't take steps to fix it. And we definitely should.

91
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.050
But I'm saying that if it was impossible for people to have created it and it

92
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:02.290
was happening around us, maybe we would be forced to do something.

93
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.340
Maybe we'd be forced to like go to higher ground, get the out of that.

94
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.600
The really hot spots, you know, make your way towards Canada.

95
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.040
Like, I mean,

96
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:15.040
maybe that would what's w what we would do if there was no other way,

97
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:19.780
but we know that at least part of what the problem is is people,

98
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.480
at least part of the problem. But so many people are start.

99
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.930
They want to start arguments about that and fight that. And to me,

100
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:27.100
it's so strange. It's like,

101
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.810
what's the benefit of arguing against that it's happening.

102
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.020
I don't understand, like it's happening. You see it getting warmer.

103
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.810
You see the statistics, you see everybody freaking out though.

104
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.970
The Amazon's on fire. Have you seen it? Yeah.

105
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.170
<v 1>Yes, no, it's horrifying. There's photos from there just,</v>

106
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:46.030
and I believe it's purposeful.

107
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.890
<v 0>I have heard that that is that some people are.</v>

108
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.580
<v 1>Way on purpose is what, um, if I, if the things I've read over and understood,</v>

109
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.560
I won't swear their truth, because again,

110
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.970
it now that's one of the things you're saying is,

111
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.010
is you got to question everything now. Truth has been compromised, man.

112
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.370
You know what I mean? No matter what side of whatever you are on,

113
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.630
truth has been,

114
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.580
has been seriously compromised because there's a counter opinion to everything.

115
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.710
And if you're not, um,

116
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.120
adept enough to really get involved and find factual information,

117
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.590
you can literally counter any argument there is with, with something. Oh,

118
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:27.470
I said, well, I read this while I read this. Okay, well,

119
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.500
that doesn't mean either one of those things are true. Let's go find the truth.

120
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.360
You know what I mean?

121
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.190
That doesn't exist anymore because it's people just want to Google that,

122
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.790
get on and move on with their day. You know? And, and it's laziness on our part.

123
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.070
A lot of people don't want them.

124
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.190
It's like this thing that everybody's posting with the

125
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.010
Instagram, I don't give you permission to use.

126
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.730
EV I read a whole other thing that says the average American,

127
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:57.320
I believe signs one or two legal documents a day without reading them.

128
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:02.270
And just by logging into on your phone, Amazon or Instagram, or whatever you,

129
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.580
every time you do that you, you subscribing and, and,

130
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.410
and adhere to their terms and conditions. And some,

131
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.360
you think a picture of a copied and pasted Instagram thing over something that

132
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:18.620
was from Facebook 12 years ago, is it it's it's bananas.

133
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.520
<v 0>People get roped into things, you know, once we're,</v>

134
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.740
[inaudible].

135
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.090
<v 1>Better, safe than sorry.</v>

136
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.620
<v 0>Yeah. Like, yeah. I've seen that too.</v>

137
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.530
One argument is that they don't know how to internet.

138
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.630
They don't know how to internet. I'm just saying.

139
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.580
<v 1>Even if it's like, you suspect it's wrong, but it anyways. Like, wait, wait.</v>

140
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.770
That's if you suspect it's wrong,

141
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.830
take the extra time or just don't do it at all.

142
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.260
<v 0>Like why? I'm just.</v>

143
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.790
<v 1>Using that as an example of how,</v>

144
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.610
why we're with the state of things are as they are.

145
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.740
<v 0>Yeah. It's a sneaky little loophole.</v>

146
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.770
That's a sneaky little thing that happens to you. Well,

147
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:58.550
you have to everybody's posting something stupid. Did you send it to me? Oh,

148
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.250
whatever. Lesson it to me, it must be legitimate. Just post it.

149
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.400
You know what I mean? How many times have you done that? I've done that all.

150
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.480
<v 1>As opposed to some cloud in it. And then immediately after it, Dana came up.</v>

151
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.920
It was him posting the exact page with the whole like better safe than sorry

152
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:13.754
thing.

153
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.970
<v 0>Man, dude,</v>

154
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.110
they got everybody though. They got the step Perry guy.

155
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.330
Isn't big Perry's job to like protect the nukes or something.

156
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.540
I saw governor or something posted to Rick. What is Rick Perry?

157
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.660
They said Rick Perry. But, but he has a specific job in a government.

158
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.290
It's like an energy, energy secretary. He's like in control of the nukes. Right?

159
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.040
Is that what it is? You're the energy secretary. Yeah, you are. I don't know.

160
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.250
Whatever the he is. He's got a big job and he fell for it.

161
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.030
It's oh.

162
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.440
<v 1>It's bizarro world. We're in.</v>

163
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.470
<v 0>Bizarro world. Maybe that kid is right. I'm telling.</v>

164
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.303
<v 1>You, dude, you're.</v>

165
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.830
<v 0>Yo, you're going to be calling me in a couple of nights. Like, you, dude.</v>

166
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.050
Why did you even tell me no,

167
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.250
I've really I've bounced the idea of multiple universities.

168
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.080
<v 1>Many times we all have, but this kid watch it just, you're going to invest it,</v>

169
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:14.730
give it 20 minutes or 15, 18 minutes, whatever it is. And then you'll be like,

170
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.930
oh wow. It's it's not that it's. Oh fact it's but it's like, wow,

171
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.450
that's super possible. It's super, super possible. The way he breaks it down.

172
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.170
<v 0>What about this? What if every time you went to sleep and you woke up,</v>

173
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.300
you passed into a nearby and very similar

174
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:35.760
universe, but not quite the same.

175
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.980
And depending upon your choices and how you live your life,

176
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.480
it's how you wake up in what new one you pop into on the other side.

177
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:47.880
And everyone's just a little bit different.

178
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.400
The whole world changes just a little bit.

179
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:52.830
Each time you make a decision one way or another.

180
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.600
Everything changes when you wake up and you think the world is static because it

181
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:01.560
is when you're awake, but you have no idea what's happening while you're asleep.

182
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.360
And when you wake up again, you have this foggy recollection of the past,

183
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.960
and that's what you're going by. You're going by every morning,

184
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.280
waking up with a foggy recollection of the past. That's what you're doing.

185
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:18.090
And you're, you're assuming that nothing's changed and everything static.

186
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.420
And while you were asleep for eight hours, nothing weird happened.

187
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.570
You know what the you're talking about? You have no idea. You're dreaming you.

188
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.410
Haven't crazy fantasies. That weird stuff has happened. And you're mermaids.

189
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.710
You're flying through the air on a, uh, on a helicopter. You know, you don't,

190
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.560
you weird things happen when you're dreaming. What is all that about?

191
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.160
We don't even know. We have no idea what that is. That soup of possibilities.

192
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.730
That's swirling around in between your ears while you're snoring up a storm.

193
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.470
And then boom, you wake up. Are you sure those memories are real?

194
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.810
Are you sure that this isn't a whole completely new university living in today

195
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.290
or a simulation Or simulation?

196
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.600
<v 1>There was some acid simulations.</v>

197
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.320
<v 0>Right there. There was some another genius,</v>

198
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:08.700
super wizard kid who was talking about that. Something about simulations.

199
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.163
I forgot what.

200
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.760
<v 1>Well, I was high at the house with, with the guy who runs my studio divine and,</v>

201
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:18.060
and, and, and we were just laughing, talking one day high. Like,

202
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.980
like what if, like I may have heard, this could have been on your show.

203
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.730
I could have read this. So I'm not claiming like ownership of the thought,

204
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.150
but it was like, what if like we just come from a universe,

205
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:32.940
like that's so perfect and, and it's boring as.

206
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.990
And we just plug in to have all these up like weird problems.

207
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:40.860
And that's why everything's getting weirder and crazier because like,

208
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:43.560
that's kind of why we're here. That's part of the ride. You know.

209
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.993
<v 0>That could be it.</v>

210
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.350
It could be the only way you appreciate love is to know hate.

211
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.360
They'll really appreciate it.

212
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.930
And it could be the only way we would appreciate all the good that we have is to

213
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.150
balance it out with all the bad that we have.

214
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.880
And when they start to overwhelm each other one way or the other,

215
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.690
there's an imbalance that takes place and leads to all of our problems as a

216
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.660
society. And when you,

217
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.670
you think about how long you going to be alive and what it is that you're

218
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.190
doing here and why you're doing it, you know,

219
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.790
all those weird questions and answers that go on inside your head. It's all,

220
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.340
you're distributing energy, right? You're trying to figure out,

221
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.070
am I distributing my energy, right? My, uh,

222
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.340
am I living my life in a way that is, uh,

223
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.500
like the best I can do with what I've got right now?

224
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.093
That's it.

225
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.040
<v 1>That's all you gotta do though. I mean, honestly,</v>

226
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.450
even no matter what we're saying,

227
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:39.820
if you woke up every day and that was your objective,

228
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.600
you couldn't really go or do much wrong.

229
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.050
<v 0>No, no you can't. And what if every day when you did that,</v>

230
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.450
you woke up in a nearby universe.

231
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.470
That was just a little bit different because of what you thought and did.

232
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.290
<v 1>Dude, that's like, you know, that's some magic type.</v>

233
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.900
<v 0>Nevertheless, it's a movie. It's magic.</v>

234
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.340
<v 1>Oh, I see. I see. Okay. I was, I was, uh, I just was like trying to be a,</v>

235
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.460
not such a glutton siloed

236
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.520
DJ melody over there. I was just wondering.

237
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.790
<v 0>Cheers. How about cheers? Let's go American. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.</v>
