<v 0>Alcohol can cross the cell membrane and thus absorbs very easily</v>

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.700
into the human body. Oh, how about this? My friend,

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.920
his wife is a school teacher in Utah and, uh,

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.660
they have a problem in middle school because kids are taking tampons and they're

5
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:25.140
soaking them in rubbing alcohol and stuffing them up. They're

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.060
and.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.770
<v 1>They're getting high. Yes. I found.</v>

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.510
<v 0>Out about it. A bunch of the kids did it.</v>

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.940
And so they had a problem in their school.

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.190
We're kids were playing Tampa,

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
dipping them in rubbing I'll call and stuffing them up there. But.

12
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.920
<v 1>And by the way, I don't know how many millions of listeners you have,</v>

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.040
how many people are now going to do that a lot. 40, 40, 40 people, 40.

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.680
It's been going on.

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.190
<v 0>For awhile. Yeah, apparently I didn't know about it until three weeks ago.</v>

16
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.930
I bet it feels good. Um, nice.

17
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.120
<v 1>And cool. Feels good. Tangle a little bit. You know what?</v>

18
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:09.000
If you've got a hemorrhoid though,

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.510
[inaudible] definition of a drunk,

20
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.950
don't be a drunk, especially when you're 12.
