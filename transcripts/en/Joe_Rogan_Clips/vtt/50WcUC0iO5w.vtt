00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.920
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,</v>

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.400
beyond anti speech or want to limit speech or whatever. I mean, that's.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.440
<v 0>That's a pretty big.</v>

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.400
<v 1>Issue though. Well,</v>

6
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.880
I don't actually agree that it exists on a significant portion of the left.

7
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.040
Like I think a bigger issue, for example, like if you said,

8
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:20.000
what is like a serious issue that the left needs to contend with right now?

9
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:20.834
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

10
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.470
I would say a more serious issue is if you look at the progressive

11
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.790
accomplishments of the early 20th century, for example,

12
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.830
like 1905 to 1925,

13
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.750
and the new deal accomplishments that the left had in the time of FDR,

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.830
what was different,

15
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.860
I think then than the left now is that you didn't have to be

16
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.540
completely in line with a specific set of policies or ideas mm-hmm

17
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.580
&lt;affirmative&gt;. And I worry that now there's a little bit, um,

18
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.020
of the left,

19
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.020
maybe having this idea that if you're not in line on all of these issues,

20
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.100
whatever the checklist is, so to speak,

21
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.450
you're not really worthy of being a participant in what is clearly a

22
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:10.330
leftward move in, in sort of the average Americans political orientation.

23
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.970
I don't wanna see that prevent progress, right?

24
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.530
<v 0>Yeah. That's the, that's the hard tribalism, right? That's that's where the,</v>

25
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.770
the line gets drawn you're with us or against us.

26
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.530
And the there's one way to think there.

27
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.120
<v 1>Is there a lot of that, I mean, I saw it with healthcare recently.</v>

28
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:25.560
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; with healthcare.

29
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.720
I don't think that you can make any serious case from the left.

30
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.080
That healthcare is fine. And the,

31
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600
for profit employer connected system that we have is working. Like, I,

32
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.600
I don't think there's any progressive case to be made for that where people will

33
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:44.550
differ is what about Medicare for versus some

34
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:49.110
other system system that looks more like Canada's or the UK or Germany or

35
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.750
whatever. And I've already started to see, like, when I say on my show,

36
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.710
I'm kind of agnostic on this. Like the system we have is a disaster.

37
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.910
We need a system that will get coverage to everybody. The,

38
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.550
the numbers can be made to work any number of different ways.

39
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.060
We've looked at it, but 80% of people on Medicare,

40
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.020
I believe it is have some additional coverage.

41
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.500
They either are still working part-time or full-time and get coverage that way.

42
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.300
Or they're poor enough to be on Medicaid.

43
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.220
The point is Medicare for all doesn't solve every issue, right?

44
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.820
It's way better than what we have,

45
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.060
but here's like a dozen other possibilities looking at other countries,

46
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.650
there is a portion of the left that doesn't like that I'm saying I'm against

47
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.370
Medicare for all. I'm not saying that.

48
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.250
What I'm saying is there are a number of different ways to improve upon the

49
00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:30.491
system.

50
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:35.330
We have all of which sever this relationship between usually

51
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.410
your employer and these for-profit insurance companies. Yeah.

52
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:40.170
Why can't we be open to.

53
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.000
<v 0>That? I really don't understand private citizens that don't want easy</v>

54
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.800
access to quality healthcare for everybody that confuses the outta me.

55
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.840
Like have you ever been hurt? Have you ever been sick? Yeah. Do you,

56
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.480
have you ever been broke, right?

57
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.920
Do you want to be broke and have no access to healthcare? No one does.

58
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.680
No one wants anybody they care about to not have access to healthcare of all the

59
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.360
things that we concentrate on this country. There's two things that,

60
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.320
that drive me crazy, that people just dismiss education and healthcare.

61
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.920
The idea that you have to like my buddy, Greg, Greg fit Simmons,

62
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.160
he sending his kid off to school.

63
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.310
How much did he say that it was 60, 65,

64
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.030
60 $5,000 a year for both of his kids, for each of his kid. So, you know,

65
00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:26.510
he is got two kids that that's,

66
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.350
that hurts my head to even think about spending

67
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.470
$130,000 a year.

68
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.030
Just on if you you're a regular person with a regular job,

69
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:41.300
how the do you do that? Impossible. It's impossible. It's so much money.

70
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.860
And then that's not even paying for housing and food and transportation

71
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.140
and books and everything else that you're gonna need too.

72
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.860
And to make it more difficult for young people to succeed is one of

73
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.620
the worst ways to make a stronger country. If you want a, a strong country,

74
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.450
you want educated people that can it to pursue their dreams.

75
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.730
And the idea that we are so willing to spend so much money on these costly

76
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.571
regime,

77
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:11.490
change wars and flying troops overseas to these places that

78
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.170
they don't want to go. No one, no one wants it to happen.

79
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.850
And it's trillions of dollars and people are fine with that.

80
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.360
But you talk to them about 'em sort of socialized education system and people

81
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.040
freak out and think you wanna turn us into communists. Well.

82
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.600
<v 1>I think what is really important to understand is that the facts you just laid</v>

83
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.440
out don't matter to people, right?

84
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:34.440
You see this as an issue of what do people deserve, what do they deserve?

85
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.920
So if you say to a fiscal conservative, you know,

86
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.150
if you consider the amount that employee pays for premiums,

87
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.270
plus the employer, plus your co-pays plus co-insurance, you,

88
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.390
you mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; put it all together into some amount.

89
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.950
And you explain to them, there's lots of great analyses that have been done,

90
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:55.310
which tell us that with roughly the same amount of money,

91
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.550
maybe small payroll tax. In addition with roughly that same amount,

92
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.420
it all could be done with a single payer system that covers everybody.

93
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.980
It's the same. You're taking all of these individual risk pools,

94
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:08.860
where you have different for-profit insurers.

95
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.540
And then you have systems for people that don't have enough money. Medicaid,

96
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.380
you have systems for people that are over 65, Medicare, you put it all together,

97
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.300
you spread the risk far wider.

98
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.890
The employer no longer has to pay their part of the premium employee,

99
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.130
no longer pays part of their premium to the for-profit insurance company.

100
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.330
The numbers work. They're still not going to say, you know what? That,

101
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:32.090
that sounds great. It's actually pretty fiscally conservative. Let's do it.

102
00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:34.570
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because at some point there is a,

103
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.290
a portion of the right that just doesn't think people have earned healthcare.

104
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.010
They just haven't earned it. They have, or education or education. Yeah,

105
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:43.880
that's right. And it's very hard to, uh,

106
00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:46.960
change people's minds when that's their view. Uh,

107
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:48.960
I think it's might be George layoff,

108
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.680
who I believe calls it strict father morality, which is like,

109
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.680
how would a really strict father treat a child who comes to them and says,

110
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.600
Hey, you know what? Uh, I figured out a way that we can all have healthcare,

111
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.800
the strict father, even if the numbers make sense, would say, I'm,

112
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.620
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

113
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.160
You haven't earned that healthcare either because you don't work or you don't

114
00:06:11.161 --> 00:06:14.040
make enough money or you're on disability, whatever the case may be.

115
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.390
How do you convince someone to change their mind when that's their worldview?

116
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.950
Yeah.

117
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.551
<v 0>How do you,</v>

118
00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:23.310
when it's an ideologically based decision and you're on team R

119
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.150
or team L you know what, which, uh,

120
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.950
which group of ideas do you adopt? Right? Uh,

121
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.270
the, the UK system sucks. You talk to people that get healthcare over in the UK.

122
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.104
It sucks,

123
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.100
but at least they have a system it's just not the same quality healthcare that

124
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:40.660
you get in America. Same with my friends in Canada.

125
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.380
I have friends in Canada that have come down here to get surgery.

126
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.700
Cuz they find better doctors over here because Brent.

127
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.660
<v 1>Paul was going to Canada to get his, um, uh, operation. Yeah.</v>

128
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.500
<v 0>That was why was that? Why did he do.</v>

129
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.660
<v 1>That? The best places in Canada,</v>

130
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.020
the best place for hernias for that type of hernia? I believe. Yeah. Hmm.

131
00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.010
I mean, here's the thing, even in saying the UK system and the Canadian system,

132
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:03.370
neither one is that good? Right? The, those two systems are totally different.

133
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.010
Right? So it, I feel like, but they're both socialized medicine. They are both.

134
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.610
Uh, well, yes, in some sense,

135
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.730
I mean the Canadian system is administered at the province level.

136
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.730
So the province is sort of like the market instead of having all these submarket

137
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.320
attached to individual for-profit sures at the provincial level, uh,

138
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.960
that's how it's organized. The UK has, uh,

139
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:26.000
the national health service where they're actually,

140
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.000
they don't actually run the healthcare facilities,

141
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.760
but they're the ones who are contracting them. So it's sort of like the,

142
00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:36.680
the healthcare facility still, uh, isn't own entity.

143
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.480
It's not that you're going. And the government,

144
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.070
it is the employer of the doctor,

145
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.510
so to speak mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but they're contracting with the healthcare

146
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:44.344
facilities.

147
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.030
But the point I wanna make is that there are criticisms of all of these systems,

148
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.830
but they're different ones. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So when we say, eh,

149
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.630
the British and Canadian systems, aren't that good, right.

150
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.950
Let's figure out in what ways each is not that good because they're different

151
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.260
ways, whether you're talking about health outcomes, early detection,

152
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.820
cost per treatment,

153
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.020
whatever mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you really have to drill down and figure out in

154
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:08.780
what way are we saying it's not as good.

155
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.020
<v 0>Yeah. What I'm saying is that there's no perfect system. There's no perfect.</v>

156
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.100
<v 1>System systems are. Right.</v>

157
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.010
<v 0>But I believe that most of the best doctors terms of</v>

158
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:22.250
like north America, at least, or in the United States,

159
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.410
I'm sure there's probably some very good doctors in Canada that do specialize

160
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.490
medicine. But I think really good doctors are incentivized by profit.

161
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.650
I really do.

162
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.250
I think there is some motivation for if you spend so much money for medical

163
00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:38.450
school and you, you bust your, you wanna make a lot of money.

164
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.480
And some of the best doctor earn a really good living. I think,

165
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.840
I think limiting their, uh, their ability to earn that money.

166
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.520
Won't incentivize people to be excellent.

167
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.600
<v 1>So couple different things. I mean, number one, to be clear,</v>

168
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.800
we're now starting to get into a little bit of broader economic philosophy.

169
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.480
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like I'm a capitalist I'm I'm for social democracy,

170
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.800
which is a mixed system.

171
00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:03.440
That's a capitalist system that says we're going to invest, uh,

172
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.000
tax revenue in a particular way to make sure that no one falls below a certain

173
00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:09.920
level. So I, my, my,

174
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.200
just to con contextualize that my point of view is not from one of becoming a

175
00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:17.790
social this country. And I think we share those views. I think so. Um,

176
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.190
a lot of doctors will say that even though on sort of on

177
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:26.150
paper, in a socialized medicine system,

178
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.950
they might make less for a particular procedure, for example,

179
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.883
or something like that.

180
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.540
A lot of them are still in favor of those systems because it would drastically

181
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.780
reduce their overhead.

182
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.180
So there's all of this apparatus that includes medical billing and coding both

183
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.180
on the insurer end and at the healthcare provider end the hospital and the

184
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:51.820
insurance company both are battling over what is it that was done, right?

185
00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:54.940
What are the codes that, that apply here and how, what are,

186
00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:58.530
are reimbursed rates? Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; there's fraud when it comes to that.

187
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.670
Um,

188
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.490
and that requires an apparatus for investigating and adjudicating that that adds

189
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.450
more and more cost. So I don't think it's as easy.

190
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.410
I don't think it's as obvious that under those systems at the end of the day,

191
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:17.160
a doctor that owns, uh, PCP, uh, group, for example,

192
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.200
or an orthopedic clinic or whatever the case may be.

193
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.400
I don't know that it's that clear that they end up taking home less money.

194
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.880
<v 0>Hmm. Uh, that's interesting.</v>

195
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.920
I'd wonder if in practice that would play out that way maybe,

196
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:34.160
and maybe I'm talking about just like high end orthopedic surgeons that do knee

197
00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:36.440
surgeries for athletes and things along those.

198
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.140
<v 1>Lines,</v>

199
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.030
they often would be outside of whatever insurance apparatus we're talking about.

200
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:41.391
Anyway,

201
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.750
of course a lot of those folks are often being paid out of pocket anyway. Yes.

202
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.590
So it's less at least some, at least some. Yeah.

203
00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:51.070
So for the average person's experience, I think it's less relevant. Yeah. Um.

204
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.470
<v 0>Then there's also liability insurance, which is extremely expensive.</v>

205
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:57.700
That's a giant issue with, with doctors. It's a huge, huge expense.

206
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.060
<v 1>It is. Yeah. I mean, I think it is necessary. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,</v>

207
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.100
there's a question as to whether it's organized in the best way.

208
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.700
I know less about that component than some of the other ones.
