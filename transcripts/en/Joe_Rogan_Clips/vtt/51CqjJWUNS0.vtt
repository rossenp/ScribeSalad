00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's funny. That's awesome.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.120
But I might move New York too. Cause you know,

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.710
somebody got to shake something up and I feel like shaking something up and then

4
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:15.570
I get very tired. Let's go to Hawaii. But uh,

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.710
you know, I just, the thing I mostly want to shake up is, uh,

6
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.470
comics be brave, stick up for each other. Now,

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:27.000
if you guys had stuck out more for me, I think it would have stopped,

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.590
but you ignored it. Cause you're like, well, she is a whole.

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.660
Anyway, she's done a lot of.

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920
<v 1>I think sometimes when the hits the fan with certain people,</v>

11
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.460
other folks get nervous, it's going to come at them if they defend you.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.830
<v 0>Of course. But you know, now they're starting,</v>

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.150
it's real weird to see a turnaround like piers Morgan, you know, he,

14
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:51.720
he was quick to call me a racist on his show. He said, sure,

15
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.860
she's absolutely racist to have compared this and Matt and saying,

16
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.380
she looks like this, but of course I never said that.

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.170
That's his interpretation of what I said,

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.070
which now he has a little bit more time away from,

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.230
so he's just called and said he would love to interview me.

20
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.790
And my publicist said, well, after calling her race, I doubt that will happen.

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.050
And he said, well, I'm very sorry. And I want to apologize to her. I, I reacted,

22
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.570
uh, you know, a knee jerk reaction as.

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.170
<v 1>So recognizing. And he's he wrote some,</v>

24
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.170
he did some stuff about it recently where he was on.

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.080
I think he was on the Ben Shapiro show where he was talking about it and there

26
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:29.360
was a clip. And I actually read.

27
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.950
<v 0>I'm going to do a Jew beat down on that Ben Shapiro one of these days. Yep.</v>

28
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.800
Why? Because he needs it. What does he need to be tough?

29
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.730
Because he's a young man. That's how I'm going to talk to people.

30
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.780
Now listen to me, young man, you may think, you know,

31
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:50.220
a thing or two about Judaism, but you do not know as much as I know.

32
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:53.100
So you sit down and listen. That's what I'll.

33
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.890
<v 1>Say. Well, maybe he would just listen to you don't have to do all that.</v>

34
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.330
<v 0>Well, I just did it. So.</v>

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.240
<v 1>Anyway, piers Morgan has been talking a lot about how ridiculous this outrage</v>

36
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:04.074
culture is.

37
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.430
<v 0>And they call, they call it that cause of my show, nobody else got canceled.</v>

38
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.450
You know, what's her name called the president's Jewish daughter,

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.860
ACU word to see you next Tuesday and not napping to her.

40
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.960
Cause she liked Hillary. I mean,

41
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.560
it's just going to show it just was all partisan. And our,

42
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.830
our media is that belongs to the people. The,

43
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.990
the airways are the people's AirWave.

44
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:32.430
Another way to show a private public money going into private

45
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:36.470
hands, uh, through corporate maneuvering. But, um, the,

46
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:41.220
the airwaves are belong to the public. So you can't use the public airwaves.

47
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:45.330
I see it way. I see it, uh, to, to, uh,

48
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.160
dumb down the public.

49
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.780
So they won't vote for you not putting poison in their community

50
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.980
or their food.

51
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.630
It's all a scam from top to bottom.

52
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.010
It's all a scam. Every bit of it it's going to implode. It is imploding.

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.610
I don't think society,

54
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.430
as long as people have love in their hearts for their children and their

55
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.280
children's friends and each other and community

56
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.610
To Tiana collapse.

57
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.470
<v 1>I don't want to get back to this 700 years of artificial intelligence.</v>

58
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.560
<v 0>To explain it for the last however.</v>

59
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.960
<v 1>Long mean, what do you mean by artificial intelligence?</v>

60
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.520
How is artificial intelligence running.

61
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.500
<v 0>It's MK ultra mind control a mind control program that shoved down the</v>

62
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.600
throats of a, of a populace of a captive population.

63
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.790
<v 1>Like what is happening when you say MK ultra mind control</v>

64
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.210
artificial intelligence, like what, what is happening to us?

65
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.170
<v 0>Well,</v>

66
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.760
we're being bred for a certain things

67
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.530
or, well, we were bred, but we're being activated for certain things.

68
00:03:56.531 --> 00:04:01.090
And I'm mostly talking about the mentally ill because I can see where, uh,

69
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.430
you know, all these things, these terrible things that happened,

70
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.240
that was a mentally ill person who had mental health issues.

71
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.230
And that's why it needs to be talked about and mental health issues come in,

72
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.680
all colors, sizes and preferences. And, um,

73
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.180
it's time to seriously do something about it rather than just looking the other

74
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:19.511
way.

75
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:24.250
As people die in filth on your fancy streets in of America,

76
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.740
we can't do this. We have to have something else.

77
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.410
It can't be what it has been either.

78
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.460
It has to be a synthesis between all sorts of economic plans.

79
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.570
And Johnny and I, we talked about this 24 7, me and my boyfriend.

80
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.980
That's all we live for is to come up with a solution. And we talk about, uh,

81
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.460
people ism, which is, uh, a hybrid has to be a synchrony,

82
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.330
a synchronized hybrid of, um,

83
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.120
uh, they use of money, uh, uh, of, of, uh, of

84
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.480
making capitalism,

85
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.720
local and kind,

86
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.170
which we can't believe nobody's thought of it yet,

87
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.600
but this was part of my green plan for the peace and freedom party,

88
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.260
the socialist in 2012. Well, I see that the, uh,

89
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.390
Ocasio solitude,

90
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:20.780
whatever her name is or NASCIO saw AOC, I can't remember.

91
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.320
Well, she took my green, she took my green thing and it up.

92
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.030
And I'm because I did think I did put forth solutions. In fact,

93
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.600
I, before Trump, I was the only, uh,

94
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.980
politician running for any kind of office who came out with solutions.

95
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.260
And I thought that I influenced Trump because I ran my campaign

96
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.610
totally on Twitter and self-financed and, um,

97
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.950
uh, you know, all those things and talking about a plan to make a move,

98
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.530
to make our communities work for us, the.

99
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.530
<v 1>Citizens. So are you in contact with him? Yeah. Little, a little bit. Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.470
Yeah.

101
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.210
<v 0>Oh yeah. It's so exciting</v>

102
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.880
as it's not going to Jagger rockstar, but he's bigger than Jagger.

103
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.670
He's bigger than the Pope. I mean, he is.

104
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.770
And what happened today in the Vatican?

105
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.700
That's what I was going to ask you today. Did you see, you saw it right? What.

106
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.380
<v 1>Did you see? I haven't even looked at the news.</v>

107
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.330
<v 0>Let's check in with conspiracy.</v>

108
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.070
<v 1>Headquarters. Jamie's I.</v>

109
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.680
<v 0>Mean, on the internet, Jamie.</v>

110
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.110
<v 1>What does it say about the opposite? What happened.</v>

111
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.983
<v 0>According to.</v>

112
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.790
<v 1>Yeah, there was a rate,</v>

113
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.380
a rate of the Vatican five officials and employees versus spending

114
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.110
to do with finances. Really? Oh, finances.

115
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.383
It should be.

116
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.433
<v 0>No, no, I'm.</v>

117
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.700
<v 1>Dead. Bodies.</v>

118
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.123
<v 0>Were taken.</v>

119
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.680
<v 1>Oh, a lot of kid born. Yes.</v>

120
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.900
<v 0>There'll be a lot of horrible. Like any place you look,</v>

121
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.660
whether it's in the church or.

122
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.970
<v 1>Yeah, but the Vatican's like uniquely gross in that regard. I mean.</v>

123
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.560
<v 0>30 Women who live in that city, you know that it's its own nation.</v>

124
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.793
<v 1>Nation. Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.930
<v 0>And there's 30 women in that nation. So what does that tell you? That kind,</v>

126
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.130
it tells you something, I think.

127
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.000
<v 1>Well, when they were looking for that missing girl, when they found bodies.</v>

128
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.520
Yeah. And then the kids come through there, dozens of bones.

129
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.840
<v 0>A lot, a lot.</v>

130
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.950
A lot of teachers bring their students there to see history because it does have

131
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:31.610
history.

132
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.410
That's what makes me mad is when it has a history of art and it's all art is

133
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.870
totally compromised by church and state.

134
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.640
So that the only way you can see it is by supporting their war on us,

135
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.290
something else is going to happen.

136
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.850
Like Tiffany's talking about a new way of, um,

137
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.700
art, you know, it's kind of like crowdsource art. I, I just like those ideas,

138
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.610
like, well, what have we made a movie that way? That'd be cool.

139
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.590
<v 1>Which Amy, what is the,</v>

140
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:05.060
what's the rate about like what I'm trying to read and it.

141
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.410
<v 0>Financial information and computers.</v>

142
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.110
<v 1>Will take it because it's being invested. And it was.</v>

143
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.000
<v 0>The, the moment it was the Vatican police who did it. That's, what's so great.</v>

144
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:20.450
Because for a long time I've been saying, or feeling like, you know,

145
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:25.250
all the good people are coming together and leaving the bad people by the side

146
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:27.920
of the way, which that's what we have to do. Right.

147
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.450
We cannot include those parts of our peoples who are bad

148
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:35.690
anymore. And that's how they worked us for a couple of generations here.

149
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.840
But now we gotta let our own bad people go and we're not,

150
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:43.190
we don't protect nothing bad. We embrace good in every other,

151
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.100
all worldwide good comes to good. And, uh, it,

152
00:08:47.101 --> 00:08:51.560
it even happened with the Vatican police. The good, uh,

153
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.920
cause I always say like when I talk spirituality,

154
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:59.130
I know you don't care about astrology or any of those things that I'm into.

155
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:00.870
But I felt like, uh,

156
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.220
the good was winning over the bad for a long, long time now.

157
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.410
And I'm tipping the balance.

158
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:12.030
And this was proof to me because it's like the good came together

159
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.350
against the bad together. That's what's going to happen everywhere.

160
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.250
It is happening.

161
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.050
It's just really chilling and wonderful to think about the things that,

162
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.393
you know, uh,

163
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.440
president Trump has done by just by one or two actions he's

164
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:32.190
taken well. He's so nice to Jewish people, Joe,

165
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.890
he's the only president in the whole Western world. Whoever liked us.

166
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.280
Really? Yeah. He liked us moms. Are you kidding? No.

167
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.830
Now, no, no.

168
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.450
<v 1>No.</v>

169
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.560
<v 0>No, no. In another whole way.</v>

170
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.880
No he don't. He, he liked some, he likes.

171
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.800
<v 1>What else has trumped on that? You really like?</v>

172
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.030
<v 0>Well, when his daughter is there,</v>

173
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.430
she will light the Sabbath candles in the white house on Friday night Ivanka.

174
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.240
So you're.

175
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.770
<v 1>Just all about anything. Jewish.</v>

176
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.990
<v 0>Not anything only the good, I don't like the bad.</v>

177
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.800
I'm not going to for the good and the good is, Hey,

178
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:30.840
we have the ability to really fix some.
