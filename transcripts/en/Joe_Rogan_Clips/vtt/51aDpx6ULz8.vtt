00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 2>Did you see that story in California? By the way,</v>

3
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.330
about how they're going to try and reteach math?

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.020
Did you see this one from the New York times? Yeah. The so teach math.

5
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.150
So they're going to figure out how to teach math differently.

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.010
They said that they don't want to have,

7
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.880
they they're getting rid of some of the objective standards with regard to math,

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.050
because math is,

9
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.870
and they want to get rid of the idea that there are naturally gifted children.

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.201
They said,

11
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.420
they're not allowed to say that they're naturally gifted children anymore.

12
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.980
When it comes to.

13
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.570
<v 1>Math with the New York as well, then they.</v>

14
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.900
<v 0>Give it their finger to the magnet schools over there too. But gifted programs.</v>

15
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.890
Yes, they, they, they, the gifted programs cause it's too many Asian kids. Ah,

16
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.160
America's white supremacists. All the Asians were succeeding. I love.

17
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.800
<v 1>That narrative. So no, what are they trying to do with that?</v>

18
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.480
<v 0>So it was this article in the New York times.</v>

19
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.430
And I'm trying to remember all the details they said,

20
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.400
you're not allowed to talk about naturally gifted kids.

21
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.350
You're not supposed to reward right. Answers or punish wrong answers.

22
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.811
Yeah.

23
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:58.740
So it was like a big kind of parents revolt going on in California over this

24
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.630
because the idea was that there was too much racial disparity in math

25
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:07.800
performance in California. And so change, change the standards,

26
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.170
which by the way, I can't think of anything more racist than that.

27
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.000
That is so super racist.

28
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.520
It's like not enough black kids are scoring well on the test.

29
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.490
That means that black kids, I guess, are too dumb to do well on these tests.

30
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:20.490
Get rid of the test, like look or alternatively,

31
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.190
there's an explanation where kids need to study more.

32
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.640
<v 1>Well, you ha you only find out if someone knows things, if you test them,</v>

33
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.810
it's the only way you find out how else do you find out? You have to like, say,

34
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.290
show me how to do this problem. And then the kid tries and he goes, oh,

35
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:34.880
that's not how you.

36
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.130
<v 0>You do it. By the way. I think this is like entire,</v>

37
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.740
I think the scam that is college is predicated on a society trying to get around

38
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:43.560
the basic truth that you just said, which is we can tell by test scores,

39
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.330
whether you know, things that aren't good at things. Well.

40
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.960
<v 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.980
obviously there's some tests that favor people that have grown up in certain

42
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:53.310
environments because you have more access to certain kinds of information,

43
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.530
but once you teach people and then you test them,

44
00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.921
the only,

45
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:02.460
there's only one way to find out whether or not they know the information they

46
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:03.330
have to be tested,

47
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.810
like the idea that you're going to eliminate tests and somehow make things more

48
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.300
equitable or more even is kind of.

49
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.090
<v 0>Actually what you're gonna do is gonna make people more racist is what you're</v>

50
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.630
gonna do. And the reason for that is because Thomas Hall talks about this,

51
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.510
he talks about different types of discrimination. And he says,

52
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:22.980
there's group discrimination where you base your perception of an individual on

53
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.280
the group data that is available. And then there's like discrimination,

54
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.420
discrimination, which is, you know,

55
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:29.790
that a person is smart and they're of a group you don't like.

56
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.010
And so you just ignore the fact they're smart because they're from that group.

57
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.560
So the, the two examples that he gives, right,

58
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.460
is let's say that you're walking down the street at night and it's in an inner

59
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:42.000
city neighborhood and there's a black guy walking down the street and he's

60
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.630
wearing a hoodie and he's a young guy, 17 years old.

61
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.060
Are you going to cross the street or not?

62
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.800
If the opposing example is an 80 year old white woman, right? And he says, well,

63
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:54.030
you know, based on the group statistics,

64
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.380
you're probably going to cross the street more often.

65
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.600
If it's the 17 year old black kid, then if it's the 80 year old white woman,

66
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.000
now let's say that that 17 year old white kid, that 17 year old black kid,

67
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.940
you know, you know the kid, he's a nice kid. If you still cross the street,

68
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.310
that's what makes you like a super giant racist. In the former case,

69
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.020
you're just using the group data available.

70
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.560
The problem is that using group date available very often is wrong, right?

71
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.540
What if the 17 year old kid isn't nice kid, right?

72
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.060
You shouldn't be doing that either. You need specific data.

73
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.680
Test data is specific data.

74
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.850
So let's say now that you are an administrator at a college and you're not

75
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.350
allowed to use test data, all you know,

76
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.320
is that on average black kids score lower than white kids, right?

77
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.840
So who do you let it? How do you make that decision?

78
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.570
Wouldn't it be better for black kids, for you to have the test data?

79
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.021
Cause you know,

80
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.740
which black kids definitely deserve to get in as opposed to which ones don't

81
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.320
deserve to get in. So you start using stupid generalizations.

82
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.930
The whole point is more specific. Data is better,

83
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.510
more specific data fights discrimination.

84
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.630
And yet we have this whole weird idea that if we get rid of specific data,

85
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:49.390
if we get rid of test data, objective data, this is going to end discrimination.

86
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.210
Precisely the reverse will occur. People will start using stupid stereotypes.

87
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.870
