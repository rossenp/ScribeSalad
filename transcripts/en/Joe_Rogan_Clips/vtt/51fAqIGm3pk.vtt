1
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>The point I'm making is what is it going to tell me?</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.520
Here's the thing we don't know. One of the things is, you know,

3
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.354
I'll tell you a little problem,

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.790
cause I've seen hundreds of hundreds of people who've already done blood work.

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:14.460
So I know it's going to show basically, you know, so I've gotten,

6
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:15.600
we've got this study going,

7
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:20.130
we've got all these people with submitting blood work, but the, uh, you know,

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.610
probably my HDL will go up. My triglycerides will go down.

9
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.300
My blood sugar will stabilize to a low level. My, my, uh,

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.190
inflammatory markers will be normal.

11
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.710
That's because I've seen lots and lots of other people's blood work already.

12
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.190
So I know what's going to show my cholesterol may be up or down and that's,

13
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.280
and that's something that we, a lot of people worried about that. And, you know,

14
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:43.020
I can talk about cholesterol in my view is a pretty worthless marker,

15
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.110
you know, by itself, you know, you have to take it into context.

16
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.380
And so there's a, you know, there's a couple of people that are really,

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.410
really intelligent about cholesterol that are really testing this sort of stuff.

18
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.550
One guy's name is Dave Feldman on Twitter. His name is Dave Quito.

19
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.620
There's another guy named Ivor Cummins.

20
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.750
Who's an Australian named both engineers. And so this was,

21
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.010
this is what happened. This guy, Dave,

22
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.000
he goes on a ketogenic diet and his cholesterol goes sky friggin high.

23
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.740
It's like 400, you know, way, way up there.

24
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
And his doctor freaking out and he's freaking out. So he's like,

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.560
I don't understand this. I mean, I feel great.

26
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.440
Everything about me is just the best health ever felt in my life.

27
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.310
So what he does is he starts drawing his blood every single day.

28
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.360
He gets a blood test.

29
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.340
And what he finds out is that his blood cholesterol is all over the

30
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:29.460
place. One day, it's 300, the next day, it's 201 day.

31
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.980
It's three 50 the next day. And so what we,

32
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:34.140
when we go to the doctor every six months a year and they get a blood

33
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.600
cholesterol, you assume, well, that's my cholesterol. And it's always that way.

34
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.330
Well, he found out that it's so variable.

35
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.250
They've actually known about this since the 1950s,

36
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.480
but no one has been talking about it.

37
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.500
So what he figured out and he's a systems engineer and he's engineers are some

38
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:49.770
smart guys. I mean, that's the one thing I kind of talk about.

39
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.310
It's just get somebody an MD or PhD doesn't mean they know everything.

40
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.430
There's a lot of people that are plumbers and whatever.

41
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:58.980
They don't have any formal training that configured they're smart people and

42
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:02.550
they can figure this stuff out. So he's an, he's an engineer, real smart guy.

43
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.890
And so what he does is he figures out the cholesterol is basically all it is,

44
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.670
is it's traveling around in your blood based on energy flux. So how much,

45
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.930
so if you've eaten a lot,

46
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.920
so if you've eaten a whole bunch of food and your fault, your liver is saying,

47
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.820
I don't need to put out a bunch of fat because we burn fat as fuel.

48
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.870
Even if you're not on a ketogenic diet. So what it does is it transports fat.

49
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.360
So when you're hungry and you haven't eaten it for awhile,

50
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.070
like you fast it for a blood test, your liver says we need fat in the Cisco's,

51
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.320
we're low on energy. And so it shoots out all this fat.

52
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.730
And what happens is cholesterol is cruising around for a ride.

53
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.560
So it's just sitting there, you know, um, you know, as a passenger.

54
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.250
So depending on how much you've eaten, when you've eaten,

55
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.360
it'll change your cholesterol. And so it's not ever a good marker. I mean,

56
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.630
you can, you can find studies that show for all cause mortality.

57
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.790
Like if you're like you, you and me on it. Cause you're,

58
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.750
you're the same age as I am. I think you do it right. 50 50. So if we look at,

59
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.700
you know, and again, associational studies are not that great,

60
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.280
but if you look at that and you say all cause mortality,

61
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
if I'm am I going to die or not? If your cholesterol is high,

62
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.950
you're less likely to die. If your cholesterol is high,

63
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.860
you're less likely to get Parkinson's disease. If your cholesterol is high,

64
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.010
you're less likely to get a bunch of cancers. You know? So it's like.

65
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.660
<v 1>So you're saying that though, but most people hear this and they go, blah, blah,</v>

66
00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:19.060
blah, blah, blah, blah. If your cholesterol is high,

67
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.560
you're gonna get a heart attack. Well, here's the deal.

68
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.680
<v 0>Yeah. Here's the, here's the deal with heart attacks know,</v>

69
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:24.940
and this is interesting because you know, vegetarian to vegan,

70
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.400
I don't mean to pick on vegetarians and vegans because you know,

71
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.190
I know some great ones are great people. And I think, you know,

72
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.220
there shouldn't be a war between us, but vegetarians and vegans,

73
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.980
the number one killer of vegetarian vegan is heart disease. I mean,

74
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.280
that's what kills them too. It kills everybody. So it's just like, you know,

75
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.680
you know, do you trade, am I going to have cancer?

76
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.840
Am I going to try to have heart disease? You know, which one.

77
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.820
<v 1>Pick your poison. Most people don't understand that the sugar industry's</v>

78
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.460
hijacking of science in the 1950s,

79
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.240
the way they paid off those scientists to literally false

80
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.260
advertise the idea that sugar is safe for you,

81
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.890
but that saturated fat and cholesterol is what's causing all these issues with

82
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:06.070
people and heart attacks to this day. People just sort of repeat that.

83
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:06.904
Like they think it's.

84
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.940
<v 0>Yeah. I mean it's, and it is, it's part of the, it's part of the,</v>

85
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.980
the framework of society now. I mean, it's like.

86
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.790
<v 1>That got you to say, I'm just gonna eat nothing but meat.</v>

87
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.040
Was there anybody that you knew that was doing it really well,

88
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:19.600
that you were talking to? Did you get some.

89
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.950
<v 0>Like I said, it was just reading about people online, you know, um, you know,</v>

90
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.890
there's, uh, you know, if there's a, I'll tell you what,

91
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.340
there's a guy named Joe Anderson on Twitter, his handle is Joe Charlene,

92
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:34.180
98, 8 88, 98 or 98, 8 is this guy, you know,

93
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.280
it's just the guy who's been doing it for 20 years. I'm just like,

94
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:38.620
this is pretty cool. Like I said, reading back on that stuff.

95
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.770
And then just because I've been an athlete, I'm like, and I don't, you know,

96
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:43.750
I've never taken drugs and stuff like that. And I was always like,

97
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.750
what can get me to the next level as far as athletic comp,

98
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.990
because I'm just a really competitive guy. I mean, I just, I just like to,

99
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:50.920
you know, push myself.

100
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.910
<v 1>I know a lot of Savage people that eat mostly meat, my friend cam,</v>

101
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.870
Hans eats almost all meat. He occasionally eats like something else.

102
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.250
But most of what he eats is me, my friend Jocko, Willink. Yeah. When he's tired,

103
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:05.410
he goes, I need more steak. That's what he does. He eats it.

104
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.470
<v 0>I mean, I'd say it was a frickin health food. It totally is. I mean,</v>

105
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:12.430
and you know, there's a guy named Bobby Maximus. Who's a, who's a fitness guy.

106
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.710
He was, he,

107
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.370
I guess he was used to meet an MMA guy years ago or something like that.

108
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.770
But I know he did this steak every day thing.

109
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.680
And so if we look back into history, I mean,

110
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:24.490
there's all kinds of accounts of people using meat as an athletic performance

111
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.040
enhancer, you know, back in the original Greek Olympics,

112
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.640
those guys knew that they had a lot of meat there perform better. You know,

113
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:32.170
the Beefeaters out of London, you know,

114
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.610
these guys were the guards for the Kings. You know, they gave him extra meat.

115
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.070
Cause I know they would fight better. The, you know, the Mongols, you know,

116
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.080
they just decimated, you know, all through Asia,

117
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.590
they basically just ate their horses and their meat. You know,

118
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:45.310
that's what they did when I traveled with that. You know?

119
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:49.600
And so you've got all these historical examples of people performing better.

120
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.680
You know, they, they were, they were,

121
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.050
they were known to have this incredible work capacity and all, they, you know,

122
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.800
they, it was seal meat and, and reindeer and you stuff like that.

123
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.730
So what's a typical.

124
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 1>Diet for you. Like you give me a normal day, you wake up in the morning.</v>

125
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.570
<v 0>Well, I'll tell you what to do. So today, I mean, you know, eating wise,</v>

126
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.730
some that, you know, generally either one meal or two meals,

127
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.210
depending on what my workout training is going to be. So this morning, you know,

128
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.730
cause I knew it was coming up here. I train real early morning. Well, it's fast.

129
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:16.850
I, you know, I set a new record by the way in my personal record is doing that.

130
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:20.690
But I had a couple of New York strips. I had them out, uh, two pounds.

131
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.620
<v 1>You ate two pounds of meat. Well, that's a snack. Is that your phone man?</v>

132
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:27.170
To keep it? It might be, you might have your little thing on.

133
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.420
<v 0>Getting notifications from people saying.</v>

134
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.460
<v 1>Hey brew, you.</v>

135
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.073
<v 0>Let me turn it.</v>

136
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.480
<v 1>Man. You look just like you.</v>

137
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.880
So you had two New York strips today. Yeah. I mean, that's two pounds of me.

138
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.100
<v 0>You know, it took me a while to build up to this before, you know,</v>

139
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.410
like a pound of meat would be, you know, that'd be tough now I can,

140
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.530
I can put down four pounds at one time with them.

141
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.170
<v 1>People looking at you would go, well, he's super lean.</v>

142
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.880
I got obviously whatever you're eating your body's processing it really well

143
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.140
when you don't have a,

144
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.170
you don't have what someone would think of as a steak heater gut.

145
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.310
Like you tell a guy, someone, a guy eats two steaks a day and like,

146
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.330
oh it must have a gut,

147
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.650
but that's all that mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese and bread. Yeah.

148
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.430
<v 0>Yeah. It makes the stuff you eat with it. I mean, I've just, uh, you know,</v>

149
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:15.950
I put like I sit on that Instagram page, I've got, you know,

150
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:18.890
me exercising and doing stuff and you know, pictures.

151
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.260
<v 1>That was something that you talked about, uh,</v>

152
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.890
outside the studio right before we came in that the studies that have been done

153
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:27.320
on people consuming meat. And I brought this up as well.

154
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.000
That there's a lot of misconceptions about these studies because they're not

155
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:36.890
very clear when they say that people who eat meat five times a week are more

156
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.330
likely to get cancer.

157
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:42.560
What they're not telling you is what these people ate along with the meat.

158
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.850
Are they eating cheeseburgers or are they eating grass fed beef or it's grass

159
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.710
finished grass fed, you know, high in essential fatty acids, healthy for you?

160
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:56.150
Or are they eating some cheeseburger with a sugary drink?

161
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.010
Like what is the rest of their diet?

162
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.530
Are they consuming a lot of refined carbohydrates?

163
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:03.350
Are they consuming a lot of sugar? Are they drinking alcohol?

164
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:04.430
They smoking cigarettes.

165
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.930
All you're saying is they're eating meat five days a week. It's not,

166
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.650
it's not specifying in any way their actual overall diet.

167
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.930
<v 0>No, they don't sort that very, very well out.</v>

168
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.930
So they've got all these epidemiology studies and basically a mediator is

169
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.960
basically someone and, you know, statistically,

170
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:23.060
we know they're more likely to smoke. They're more likely to drink.

171
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:24.680
They're more likely not to wear their seatbelt.

172
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.090
They're more likely to be in accidents.

173
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.860
They're more likely not to go to their doctor or they're not.

174
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.210
They're more likely just not to care.

175
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.660
So you've got that's what a meeting is that what's this cause people,

176
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.340
cause if I tell you, as I say, Joe, eating meats bad for you and you say a few,

177
00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:40.340
I don't care. I don't care about my health. Right? So you just don't care.

178
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.470
So this isn't, so they can't separate that out.

179
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:46.820
So they've got all these studies where they, they try to separate out and say,

180
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.550
well kind of what kind of, even up to smokers, but they never can take that.

181
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.440
I don't give a, you know, I don't give a right thing out of it.

182
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.010
So you've got this stuff and then all the studies are really,

183
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:58.740
really low strength. So if we look at well, you know,

184
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.190
and we can talk about this, about meat, meat being causing cancer.

185
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.620
Cause there's a, there's some concern about that with colon cancer.

186
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.780
But if we look at smoking, you know,

187
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.670
when they determine that smoking cause cancer,

188
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.710
the epidemiology showed a 2000% increase in the incidence

189
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.670
of cancer. And a lot of studies when they compare that to meat and cancer,

190
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:22.290
they found it 18% increase, which is nothing. I mean, it's like, it's like,

191
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.460
it doesn't even matter. It's so.

192
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.470
<v 1>1% Is in high, not.</v>

193
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.350
<v 0>Not when you look at relative risk, right? So if your risk,</v>

194
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:33.240
if your risk of getting colon cancer is one or say your risk of getting

195
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:38.130
colon cancer is a five in a

196
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:42.750
million. Right. And now it's six in a million. I mean,

197
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.690
it's like nothing. I mean, it's like, it's so minor,

198
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.800
but if your risk is going from five and a million to 300 and a million,

199
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.010
then you're like, well, that's pretty powerful problem.

200
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:54.720
So it depends on the incident.

201
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:57.750
So if it's really low to begin with and you only raise it by tiny amount,

202
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.870
it's so small. And so what we know there was a guy named Bretford hill,

203
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.390
talked about statistical correlations on when these things actually matter and

204
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.900
not to get to 200% or 300%, does it even matter?

205
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.450
You can't draw any conclusion from that, the problem.

206
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.160
<v 1>200, 300% difference out of like a thousand. Yeah. Instead of two,</v>

207
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:20.130
it would be six. Yeah. So something along those lines.

208
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.080
<v 0>So instead of right, so instead of being 18%, more like a year, 200%,</v>

209
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:25.914
more likely.

210
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.150
<v 1>Numbers are confusing to people though, the way he's saying 200%, like what,</v>

211
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:30.810
when you.

212
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.980
<v 0>It's a lot of people, right? So,</v>

213
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:34.650
so you would have to double or triple your risk.

214
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.160
So 18% is not double or tripling. It's only putting it up by a fraction. Right?

215
00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:42.570
Right. So when you, when you separate all that stuff out and then, then,

216
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:47.400
you know, there was, uh, you know, the world health organization two years ago,

217
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.410
last year, two years ago, declared that red meat was a class, two carcinogen,

218
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:54.660
a processed meats was a class one carcinogen, you know,

219
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:57.300
they said it's like plutonium and smoking. And you know,

220
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:59.970
everybody runs to runs all over the place with that. Well, why did they do that?

221
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.610
So here's why they do that. So first of all, and you can,

222
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.980
you can go on their website and you know, they'll tell you what their,

223
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:06.060
what their conclusions were.

224
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.380
So this was done by an organization called the international association for

225
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:14.430
research on cancer. They're based out of Leland, France, and they are, uh,

226
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.950
you know, that's what the world health organization, uh,

227
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.070
uses to determine their stuff. And so they're written, and this is, you know,

228
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.560
besides the point where right now the IRC is under,

229
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:27.330
under investigation by us Congress for using crappy science and, you know,

230
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.700
promoting a political agenda. So I don't know if that's true or not.

231
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.490
Part of that's generated by probably big corporations that don't like their

232
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.860
findings, but so they're under investigation for that.

233
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.400
But what they say is we have some weak epidemiology,

234
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.900
which is this 18% stuff,

235
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.950
but we think we have some strong mechanistic reasons for this, right?

236
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.900
So if everybody, you know, there's a,

237
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.010
there's a doctor named George E E D E who's, uh,

238
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.680
who's a psychiatrist out in Maryland. Who's got this, just tremendous analyzed.

239
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:57.370
The whole thing. She has a website called diagnosis, diet.com.

240
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.300
So she did an analyst analysis of all the 800 studies they used.

241
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:05.380
And she found that what they ended up doing is most of them showed me didn't

242
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.450
cause cancer. There was a small percentage that didn't,

243
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:09.700
they looked at all these rat studies and there was about 20,

244
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.310
20 twenty-five rat studies.

245
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.370
And they found like three or four of them showed meat. You know,

246
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:16.990
if we gave this type of cancer,

247
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.760
if we gave this rat a certain amount of meat and we genetically

248
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:25.510
bred them and we gave them a medicine that makes them get cancer,

249
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.650
that they get a little bit of change in their colon that might turn into cancer.

250
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.210
<v 1>Medicine that makes them get cancer.</v>

251
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.100
<v 0>Oh, I don't remember.</v>

252
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.420
There's something there there's a special way to make rats get cancer.

253
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.720
So they have this model that it makes them get cancer really, really easy.

254
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.093
So what they did is.

255
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:39.911
<v 1>Why would they do that?</v>

256
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.920
If they're trying to find out if something gives something cancer.

257
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.190
<v 0>Because they want to make it, they want to be able to, you know,</v>

258
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.090
they want to differentiate that as quick as possible because they gotta use a

259
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:50.500
million rats and I get it.

260
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.840
And I see what you're saying is the real fast way to show up they get cancer.

261
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:55.390
But the problem with that, and she explained them very well,

262
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.510
is that we don't know that they would get cancer. It's not shown.

263
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.940
And the other thing when we talked about this before,

264
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:04.000
is that if you want to look at rat studies and it's not to say that plants give

265
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:04.481
you cancer,

266
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:09.100
but there are pesticides and plants that have been studied in rats that we eat

267
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:13.210
every day, natural foods and vegetables and fruits that also give rats cancer.

268
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.210
And so the only difference is we've got some yes.

269
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.261
<v 1>By pesticides.</v>

270
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:21.820
You mean things that natural compounds that plants extract or they

271
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.620
secrete in order to discourage predation. Exactly. So these natural substances,

272
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:28.990
when they feed them to rats, the isolate them and feed them to rats,

273
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:30.790
it gives the rods cancer of 52.

274
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.410
<v 0>They get tested 27 of them.</v>

275
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.410
<v 1>These are just normal foods that we eat on a daily basis.</v>

276
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.000
<v 0>And stuff we eat on a daily basis.</v>

277
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.910
So it's not to scare people out of eating that stuff. Right. But it's the same,

278
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:42.010
that's how much BS and stuff is based upon.

279
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.050
<v 1>It seems to me to be so crazy that they would,</v>

280
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.160
they're doing a cancer study and they give the rat something that induces cancer

281
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.470
in order to find out what gives them cancer more.

282
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.470
So they give them this compound that on top of the compound and they,

283
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.480
they check their diet. Right.

284
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.410
<v 0>And they also feed them sugar with it. You know, that's kinda like,</v>

285
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.740
it's just the way they do it, you know? And so, you know, you, you, you can,

286
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.140
you can extrapolate, does that really matter to humans or not?

287
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.550
<v 1>It's just so hard to tell. I mean,</v>

288
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:09.400
there's so many things that animals can eat that we can't, it's just,

289
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.900
the whole thing is bizarre. Yeah.

290
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.790
<v 0>I mean, we're not rats, you know, that's interesting, you know,</v>

291
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:15.130
it's like the same thing when we talked about, you know,

292
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:18.010
cancer rates in the historical populations, you know, what Messiah they didn't,

293
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:20.620
they didn't have much cancer, you know, not until we started feeding them,

294
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.290
you know, in the 1940s, thirties and stuff like that. None.

295
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:27.640
So till we started feeding them all our crap that they started to get those

296
00:14:27.641 --> 00:14:28.150
diseases.
