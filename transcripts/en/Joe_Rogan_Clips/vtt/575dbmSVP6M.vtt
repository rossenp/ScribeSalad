WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.150
<v 0>Uh, in your personality in your life. And you're like,</v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.090
that can either help you or hurt you in this process.

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:13.200
And some people's music sort of represents the torment of their life.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.350
And some people's music represents the purity of their vision,

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:20.280
but it's all has different effects on people in some sort of strange and bizarre

6
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:23.130
way. Yeah. I like to say that, uh, you know,

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.550
the songs I was talking about the effort where I was talking about this, but,

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.803
uh,

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
I like songs that allow you to take ownership of them

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.560
and make them personal to you. Does that make sense? And I,

11
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:37.410
and I like listening to,

12
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.150
and I think that's probably what we all like about

13
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.900
songs eventually is our ability to relate to them.

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
But also they've been, and they become like, I can back and write a song.

15
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.050
I can play a song on a stage,

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.410
but it doesn't really mean anything until somebody listens to it.

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.860
And then they're, uh, you know,

18
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.450
perception of what that song is about in relation to them comes back at us,

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.320
you know, on a stage or it comes, or it lives in the world that way. And,

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.640
and that's so cool to me. That's, that's the,

21
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.210
that's the thing that makes a song complete.

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:17.070
I don't feel like they're even done until somebody listens to it and attaches

23
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:21.660
to it. That's, that's the thing that I love so much about songs.

24
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.160
Yeah. And everybody's thing is different too, right? It's like,

25
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.730
you can have two songs that are the exact same song,

26
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:32.250
but they're sung by different people and they have a completely different

27
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.390
feeling. Like some certain covers you listen to certain covers, you just like,

28
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:40.680
whoa, just has it. It just hits you in a totally different way. Yeah,

29
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.910
absolutely. But, and then the other side of that is, you know,

30
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:48.120
two different people can listen to the same version of a song and it means

31
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.470
totally different things to them because they attach the pieces of their life to

32
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.760
it in a way that is unique to them. And that's, that's the coolest thing in the,

33
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.230
yeah. It's interactive in some sort of weird way, right? Yeah. Absolutely.

34
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.920
If it's not it's, it's nothing exists. What I mean by like,

35
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.190
sometimes people's music represents sort of the torment that's going on in their

36
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.760
own personal, what I was thinking specifically, I was Amy Winehouse.

37
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.380
I was a big Amy Winehouse fan and there's something about dash great phenomenal.

38
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.570
And something about that rehab song,

39
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.040
because she put that rehab song out when everyone knew she was a mess. Right.

40
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.290
And then she still, you know, try to make me go to rehab. I said,

41
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:31.320
no, she made it sound happy. Yeah. She's like, it.

42
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:33.360
I'm riding this thing right into the beach. Right.

43
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.270
I'm not stopping for the rocks. I'm hitting the throttle.

44
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.580
I'm going to see where this goes. It was tragic, but yeah,

45
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
there's produced some, some phenomenal music. No doubt. Yeah. Yeah.

46
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:43.380
There was something to it.

47
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:48.360
There was like almost a fatalistic acceptance of our own

48
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.550
fate or something like, well,

49
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.740
and we can listen to it in that perspective now that she's not with us anymore,

50
00:02:55.741 --> 00:03:00.070
but you know, at the time it's, you know, it was a lot of angst sounding,

51
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.690
sounding celebratory.

52
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.060
It felt celebratory at the time on the other side of, of, of the tragedy of it.

53
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
Uh, it, it has a little more weight I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

54
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.210
But I mean, man,

55
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.310
if you stop and think about how many tortured souls put out unbelievable music,

56
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.320
oh, it gets, uh, you know, to some degree, some of the greats, you know,

57
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.010
it's almost like a requirement that they are a little bit out there. Yeah.

58
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.970
You know, and, and so, um, which is, it's,

59
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.300
it's a horrible thing right. For the them,

60
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.540
but it's a beautiful thing for the rest of us. We get to listen to it. Yeah.

61
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.990
Right. Man, it's just the, uh,

62
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.740
just to be an artist in any form. Right.

63
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.710
Requires all this vulnerability and just trying to,

64
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.120
trying to find whatever it is when you're trying to create something.

65
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.190
W where is that coming from? The ether,

66
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.130
the muse is trying to just find that thing.

67
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.090
And then when you dealing with your own personal demons, like,

68
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.320
especially the deep drug demons seem to produce some of the most insane music

69
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:09.730
ever, you know, you think Hendrix and Kurt Cobain. Absolutely.

70
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.930
And you can keep going down that list forever. Really? Yeah. And, and,

71
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.710
and I have a songwriter friend who is convinced that you can't really

72
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.540
produce something that is, you know, really noteworthy,

73
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:26.980
unless you have some kind of, uh, an addiction issue. So really? Yeah. Uh, but,

74
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.390
uh, I don't know if that's true, but you know, if you're saying that very thing,

75
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.850
you know, like you look back at, uh, you know,

76
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:37.000
history of rock and roll and music in general, you know,

77
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.420
there's a lot of heavy drugs and a lot of, uh, you know,

78
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.240
getting out there on the edge. Yeah.

79
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.620
Has in fact produced some of the greatest music that we've ever heard also can

80
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.950
hear it in the music like Stevie Ray. Vaughan's a great example.

81
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.780
He like hear the getting out there on the edge in the music. Absolutely.

82
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.110
You, you hear it with every ounce of everything in it.

83
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.680
There's no safety net in that kind of music. This is just,

84
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.650
it's just all raw. Yup. Absolutely. She got a crazy life, man.

85
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.950
It's a crazy way to make a living. It is a crazy way to be super happy.

86
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.520
I don't have any of those issues. I don't know. I know, but I mean,

87
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.500
but you don't have to have any of those issues.

88
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.260
I don't think that you have to have an addiction issue to be great.

89
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:23.900
I just think you just have to pursue it. Yeah. You know, well maybe,

90
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.500
maybe the addiction, I mean, there's, there can be healthy addictions.

91
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.880
I think it's true. I think everybody would look at it. Um,

92
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.710
most people that I meet that are successful in one way or another,

93
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.600
they have at the very least kind of obsessive tendencies about something. Right.

94
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.820
Uh, whether, and generally it's some part of the work, but, um, yeah. It's uh,

95
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.910
and, and focus, I see a lot of focus like this kind of super focused thing that,

96
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.030
um, when you, when you see certain people, you're like, oh,

97
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.280
that's why he can do that because he or she can do that,

98
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.390
that they have this ability to focus. Yeah. There's a,

99
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.160
I've always been amazed too,

100
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:08.690
when someone can take an instrument and make that instrument sound very

101
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:13.520
specific to them. Like Gary Clark Jr. Is another good example of that. Like, um,

102
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.870
see if you could find that video that I've put up on my Instagram way back when

103
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:22.190
with honey, honey, honey, honey, and Gary Clark Jr.

104
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:27.110
Performed this really tiny place in downtown LA about maybe a year

105
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:31.820
ago. And, uh, they did a midnight set on like a Wednesday night or some. And,

106
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.980
uh, Gary Clark is up there doing the almond brothers midnight rider,

107
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.570
like listen to this and it's.

108
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.300
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

109
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.350
<v 0>That's it? You know what I'm saying? Like that sound that's him.</v>

110
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.800
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

111
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.210
<v 0>That's a perfect example of what I'm talking about. Like that is him. Well,</v>

112
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.330
well that, that is him, but it's also everybody that's before him that,

113
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.670
and he's probably the one guy that we have, uh,

114
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.130
in modern times that really can,

115
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.060
can carry that torch for the blues and, and, you know,

116
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:52.490
all those rate, uh, you know,

117
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.750
great guitar players that we don't have a lot of them left, you know, like,

118
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.790
um, and he, he can do that. And, and that's real kind of, you know,

119
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.320
BB king approach, you know, just playing some real straight line stuff,

120
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.450
but then he can, he can do Hendricks and all,

121
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:12.680
you get be crazy and psychedelic too. He can do any of that. Yeah. And that's,

122
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.250
you know, that guy shines when you, when you step on a stage with him, you know,

123
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:19.550
it's, uh, we played, we played, he and I,

124
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:23.150
and Bonnie Raitt played a BB king tribute on the Grammys a few years back.

125
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.240
And that was intimidating because, you know,

126
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.970
you know, Bonnie rate's excellent in her own way, you know, like she has,

127
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.890
she has that thing just like he has where it's just like, those,

128
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:41.000
those people are, uh, they're special people. Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.930
I agree.

130
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.830
And there's something about them that like what hunter was saying that their

131
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:49.820
fuel, like, I saw that and I ran home and I wrote,

132
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:53.180
I wrote for like three hours. Yeah. So it just was pumped up. I just,

133
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.840
I just felt like, like I'd seen something, you know, like I got, I just,

134
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.280
I touched some new dimension and he listened to a lot of Freddie king.

135
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.920
You're listening to Freddie king. No. Oh no, man,

136
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.340
this time I'm gonna start writing down. You gotta get on Freddie king,

137
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.110
Freddie king. What, what kind of is he blues? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He's,

138
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.800
he's not with us anymore, but oh, uh, you know, there's BB king,

139
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:20.460
Albert King and Freddie king. And I've never heard of Freddy. Oh, uh, well,

140
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.090
you've probably ever seen that show, uh, eastbound and down. Yeah. You know,

141
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:27.300
the same theme song with the front of that. Yeah, that's right. I king. Oh,

142
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.740
okay. But there's one. I love Freddie king. Yeah. There's a,

143
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.450
there's a wealth of, uh, fuel, if you want some. Yeah. Uh,

144
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.570
and freaking that's, that's a pretty, uh,

145
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.190
standard staple of, of listening for me. If I go,

146
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.080
if I want to turn something on and let it make me feel right. Freddie,

147
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:53.400
Freddie king, I got a John Lee problem. When I start thinking about blues,

148
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.240
I just listened to Johnny. I've so much John Lee on my phone.

149
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.370
I have no room for other people. Oh, you got, you gotta get,

150
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:01.320
you gotta get Freddie king in there. All right.

151
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:03.840
I'll get some Freddie king in there. But when I, when I'm tired,

152
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:07.620
I don't feel like working out. I put boom, boom, boom. On. Alright and woo.

153
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.870
Here we go. We're off to the races.

154
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.240
It's just something about those types of songs. You know,

155
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.980
that deep blues,

156
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.510
it's just got this extra special soul to it. You know,

157
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:26.460
