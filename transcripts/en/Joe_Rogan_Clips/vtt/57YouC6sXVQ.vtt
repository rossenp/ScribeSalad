00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.560
<v 1>Experience. On having, uh, five kids, but like, I'll do,</v>

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.040
like if I talk about having five kids in New York city in, in,

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.640
at a show in New York city, people are like, you're crazy.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.600
And then if I talk about having five kids in Boston, uh,

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.670
and I'm generalizing people in Boston, be like, you're crazy.

7
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.470
I came from one of those families. And if I do it in Utah, people would be like,

8
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.870
yeah, we are crazy for having five kids. So it is the same joke.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.190
And it's the same point of view, but it's tweaked a little bit.

10
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's so fun,

11
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:40.270
kind of traveling around and learning that material and learning

12
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.220
the impact and how it's digested. Well, comics.

13
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.180
<v 0>Have a unique perspective on America because of that,</v>

14
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.260
because we don't just go to these different places,

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.300
but we also perform material yeah. In all these different places.

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.940
So I think like we, I've been talking a lot with comics lately about like,

17
00:00:55.941 --> 00:01:00.460
what was your reaction to Trump winning the election comics sought coming

18
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.650
more than most people who live in LA.

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.850
Cause most people live in LA are very liberal. Yeah. Very left wing,

20
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:10.370
convinced that, you know, this is even, it didn't matter who you voted for.

21
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.930
Hillary was gonna win California, no matter what. Yeah. Like we were,

22
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.730
this was a pro yeah. Democrat state. And when Trump won,

23
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.200
I, I ran into people that were shellshocked. They couldn't, I mean, I think.

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.840
<v 1>Uh, I mean I was surprised I was Def I was definitely surprised,</v>

25
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.160
but that being said,

26
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.760
I wasn't surprised by, um,

27
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.213
the, uh,

28
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.320
the logic behind some of the people that voted for Trump last time

29
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.150
that are sheepish to admit it now. Yes. Um,

30
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.910
I understood some of that logic,

31
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.030
but I thought it was fascinating cuz there was a time for me cuz I

32
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:55.350
tour with, uh, Ted Alexand a lot and he's like a I lot. I love Ted he's like,

33
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:58.630
he's like an occupy wall street guy. Like he's like, uh,

34
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.980
very progressive and we would tour and he would have during the

35
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.220
election, he would have some material on Hillary and some material on Trump.

36
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.300
And it worked everywhere. Worked in Texas, worked in Tennessee,

37
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.940
which I think is the most conservative place outside of Nashville. And,

38
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.940
and so it would work everywhere and then the election happened

39
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.730
and that same material and it wasn't just the context of the at post-election.

40
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.330
It was, I,

41
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.610
I describe it as people looking at the ceiling is that people didn't want

42
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.530
to hear it. And, and I think some of it is people like,

43
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:41.170
we deal with this all day, we need a break from it, but it was both sides. Yeah.

44
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.760
So like Trump voters were more emboldened kind of like that that's right.

45
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.240
And then also the left people were like, please &lt;laugh&gt; can I,

46
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.920
I just want to hear Jim talk about horses for 10 minutes.

47
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.173
Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

48
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.640
And so there is something fascinating that occurs and there's also something

49
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:04.520
fascinating about international shows because when Bush was,

50
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.760
when w was president, there were much more people coming up to me going,

51
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.120
how dare he, you know, start the Iraq war and with, with Trump they're like,

52
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.120
yeah, you probably didn't have the anything to do with that. Yeah.

53
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.190
I would say that's my takeaway. &lt;laugh&gt;.

54
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.030
<v 0>Yeah. It's people are definitely fatigued. I think we have, oh yeah,</v>

55
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:27.070
we have political discourse, fatigue.

56
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.750
<v 1>It's never.</v>

57
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.790
<v 0>Ending, never ending. And it, if it is how much of is your life,</v>

58
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.550
if you really stop and think about if you're alive for 75,

59
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.430
85 years on this planet,

60
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.340
and most of waking time interacting with people is discussing politics.

61
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.060
How much of it actually does affect your life? Other than those conversations,

62
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.940
those conversations. It's a, a, a giant part of,

63
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.940
a lot of people's anxiety, a giant part of the AR, but the real life,

64
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:57.340
like getting up in the morning, fixing breakfast for your kids. Yeah.

65
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.250
Taking 'em to school. How much does Trump play upon hard in any of that?

66
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.170
Not that much. Well.

67
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.930
<v 1>I did, I did a CBS, uh,</v>

68
00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:07.410
Sunday commentary on how all conversations lead to Trump.

69
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.250
Like it's just, every conversation eventually gets to,

70
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.930
and then Trump did something like that. But it is, I, I was also thinking like,

71
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.280
cuz we, we live in this very pre curious time and uh, you know,

72
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.400
a very divided country on a lot of different levels and there's so much drama

73
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.560
and there's, you know, uh, you know,

74
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.040
environmental disaster impending and I, and again,

75
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.880
to my point of like, we finally figured it out,

76
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:42.510
this is the most dramatic period. But compared to a world war II, no, this is.

77
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.343
<v 0>Nothing, nothing.</v>

78
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.790
<v 1>Yeah. This is nothing. I was in central Europe. What the like human beings.</v>

79
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:53.430
Like we, I, you know, you know, and we were going around this, uh,

80
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.030
terrorisn this place outside of Prague where they stuck all the Jewish people

81
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.580
and with my children and my children who were like,

82
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.940
just wanna play on iPads were just mesmerized.

83
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:10.260
They're like what? And, and the takeaway was not, oh,

84
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.500
the Germans are bad and Nazis are bad. The takeaway is, oh,

85
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:17.420
humans are crazy. Like,

86
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.260
it's just a matter of months that these same people,

87
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:24.450
that out were your neighbors that you would go to their kids' birthday parties.

88
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.970
You were waving goodbye too, because you got their apartment. And I'm like, oh,

89
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.090
like it was terrifying. Like human beings. It's very easy for us to go. Yeah.

90
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:38.010
It was the Germans. It was the Germans that did that. You know,

91
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:40.010
it was the Lithuanians did it, but it wasn't,

92
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.080
it was human beings that were like, manipulated like that.

93
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.720
<v 0>Yeah. If we catch the wrong leader. Yeah. Yeah. Like we right next to you,</v>

94
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.360
that's that is a world war II helmet.

95
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.120
That's a legitimate world war II helmet in a bay. Andette wow. That, uh,

96
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.680
it's a good reminder. It's filled with little holes and.

97
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.200
There's apparently places in Europe where you can find thousands of those things

98
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.200
just scattered out there. You know,

99
00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:09.160
there's areas in France that are impossible for people to go to

100
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:12.960
because there's so many rounds that have been shot into the,

101
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.110
the ground there and so much toxic chemicals and stuff from world war II that

102
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.110
to this day, they, they don't want people traveling to, I mean,

103
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:25.070
it's an enormous size, the size of Paris that's in France. Yeah.

104
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.830
See if you can find that, um, that's.

105
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.070
<v 1>Amazing. Like there's also to this day from the forties.</v>

106
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.430
So like when I was in Prague and you know,

107
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.150
you go on these tours and the punishment,

108
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.260
like they would just be like, and this, I also learned this in Greece.

109
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:43.380
They'd be like, they'd be like, uh, okay. So as punishment,

110
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.300
we are gonna murder an entire village. So we're gonna, and you're like, what?

111
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.340
And by the way, again, we can characterize this, this of,

112
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.780
because on the internet, everyone's gonna be like, gigan was defending Nazis.

113
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:59.050
That's not my point at all. The &lt;affirmative&gt; is just that human beings.

114
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:04.010
Like it wasn't that long ago when like rape and pillage was the go-to

115
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.770
tactic. It's like, all right, we conquer then we'll rape and pill. You know,

116
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:10.770
there were some guys that were like, you know, what can I just pillage? I just,

117
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:14.490
you know, I got a girlfriend now and I don't really feel like raping. Well, we.

118
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.970
<v 0>Were talking about kirkesstan the other day that to this day, 20,</v>

119
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.440
20% of all marriages begin in kidnapping, what? Yes.

120
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.053
20%.

121
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.640
So one out of five marriages started with the groom

122
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.440
kidnapping the bride,

123
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.160
like that's how they had to get married because he raped her.

124
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.680
So in order for her to, so its.

125
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.870
<v 1>Romantic, they it's, it's, that's unbelievable'.</v>

126
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.110
<v 0>It's crazy. Here. It is.</v>

127
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.070
The red zone in France is so dangerous that a hundred years after world war II,

128
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:47.470
it's still a no-go area.

129
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.470
There's all sorts of rounds and munitions and, and there's all sorts of,

130
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:52.831
I mean,

131
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:57.670
there's so many rockets we're fired into this area that this is still in,

132
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.380
in the soil and.

133
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.220
<v 1>Everyone why, you know, this also brings up a, a separate point. Why,</v>

134
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.660
why is this sursurprise well, like humans also have a,

135
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:12.180
really a real short term memory problem. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

136
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.380
we don't remember things. Right. Like I don't think people really, uh,

137
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.850
appreciate, you know, world war II was like 70 years ago.

138
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:25.490
Right? Like it was not that long ago. Right? Like even the, you know,

139
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:29.410
like Serbia, I was in de brovnik and they're like, yeah, up there,

140
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.850
the Monte nerons used to shoot at us and all those guys, you know,

141
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.970
now we go to their bar and you're like, what? Like that was the nineties. Yeah.

142
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.010
It's just, it's just terrifying.

143
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.360
<v 0>It it's hard to believe.</v>

144
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.680
But if you're in the wrong place in history at the wrong time,

145
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.680
like right now, if you're in Libya, if you're in Libya right now or Syria. Yeah.

146
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.440
Well liby's a failed state. I mean, Syria's horrible. You got Asad running it,

147
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:58.600
but Libya is no one running it. Libya. They're selling slaves on YouTube.

148
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.640
I mean, you can watch slave auctions in real time. Right now it's a terrifying,

149
00:09:03.641 --> 00:09:04.520
terrifying place.

150
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.200
And it's because they killed uh momardafi and then the rebels took over and then

151
00:09:09.201 --> 00:09:13.920
it became a felt failed state it's chaos. And this is right now in 2019,

152
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.630
if you were unfortunate enough to be born in Libya,

153
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.710
you are stuck there right now. And you're living in hell.

154
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.790
You're not living in Manhattan in 2019 where it's wonderful.

155
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.950
Jim gaffkin can hop on over to goham. Yeah. Say hi to Jerry Seinfeld,

156
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.190
do a set and have a meatball sub and you know, do whatever the you want.

157
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.910
No you're living in a chaos filled environment where Barb barbarians

158
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.060
running the show, and this can happen. This can happen.

159
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.580
And this is one of the reasons why our democracy is so important.

160
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.700
It's one of the reasons why compassion is so important and kindness and talking

161
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.320
to people.

162
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.620
And it's also important to look at things objectively and label things based on,

163
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.500
uh, compassion and looking at things in, in,

164
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.170
in an intelligent non-biased way to really get a sense of what the landscape

165
00:09:57.171 --> 00:09:59.890
really is. If you are, you know, if you're,

166
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:03.170
everybody's a Nazi and everybody's terrible and white privileges,

167
00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:06.330
white privilege that everyone's a criminal everyone's bad. No, no, no. Yeah.

168
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:10.530
There's real crime in the world. There's real terror and real awful things.

169
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.410
Right. And we have more unity and we have more in common than, than we promote.

170
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.930
<v 1>You know what I think is it?</v>

171
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.040
And I think this is also a reflection of the success of comedians

172
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.840
podcasts is that what people don't realize is that comedians

173
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.600
really appreciate a different point of view. We actually like,

174
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.520
we have friends that like, we don't agree with. In fact,

175
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:35.960
we almost find it entertaining.

176
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.230
Let's talk to this friend because I know I disagree with him and we can have

177
00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:45.390
that banter. And I think that particularly in this, uh,

178
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.070
cancel culture, there is. And so like you get these comedians,

179
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.150
like you hosting these podcasts, having these discussions and,

180
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.420
and comedians have kind of like the, uh,

181
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.180
boldness to step in it and say, Hey, I don't know about that.

182
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.020
Tell me about that. Whereas like from a societal basis, there's like,

183
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:09.380
don't question, don't question, uh,

184
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.500
why we we're pursuing this because if you question it,

185
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.820
that means you're not a true believer and we're looking for true believers.

186
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.410
Whereas, and by the way, it's, it's just interesting because, uh,

187
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.770
I think, you know, I have a friend,

188
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.610
Tom Shalu who I love who's who has a show on, uh,

189
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.690
on Fox, uh, nation.

190
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.930
And it is weird cuz like six years ago and I did this interview and I talked

191
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:39.520
about it and, and I could see the interviewer go,

192
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.000
you you're friends with someone that works at Fox and I'm like,

193
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:50.120
yeah. You know, it's like, it's okay. Yeah. It's okay. He's not a monster.

194
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.960
Yeah. He's not killing, you know,

195
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.920
he's not putting children in cages''m.

196
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.320
<v 0>Good friends with Steve Hilton. He has a show on Fox.</v>

197
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.920
He interviewed Trump by my family and his family go on vacations together.

198
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.280
Nice guy. And.

199
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.080
<v 1>It's, it's like, why? Like it's, it's,</v>

200
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.880
it's this strange thing where I'm like,

201
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.310
I can underst and how important these beliefs are.

202
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.950
And I can understand how threatening, um, democracy is.

203
00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:24.070
And I can understand how we have to face our history and, and all these things.

204
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.310
But it's like the discourse has to remain. Yes.

205
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.470
<v 0>Doesn't it. Yes. We have to be able to talk to each other.</v>

206
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.980
And I think that's one of the things that kind of died with the Trump election.

207
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.540
People were like you're with us or against us, you're either for him or,

208
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.500
or you're for the future and compassion and, and,

209
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.580
and caring about everyone or you're a monster and there's no,

210
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.620
there's no discussion about finances or the best way

211
00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:54.850
to run the economy or international a trade. No, no, no, no, no.

212
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:57.570
You're you're with the good or the bad you're binary,

213
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.970
it's one or zero you're black or white you're one or zero. And.

214
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.930
<v 1>It, that is the same thing that they criticized about.</v>

215
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.050
W mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; saying you're either with us or against us. Yeah.

216
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:11.410
Which by the way, being a father of daughters, you know,

217
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.480
is also a line from beauty in the beast. Yeah.

218
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.360
<v 0>Right. &lt;laugh&gt; if it is it's true and appropriately, so right.</v>

219
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:23.320
It's like very childlike like that, that perspective is very childlike.

220
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:25.680
There's a lot of people that are conservative that are very good people.

221
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.803
Absolutely.

222
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.800
<v 1>That's I, I, you know, here's another thing that I find very frustrating.</v>

223
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.910
I feel as though I'm sometimes, and sometimes I'll get, uh,

224
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.630
messages on social media and they'll be like, you know,

225
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:45.550
that some of the people that like your comedy are Trump supporters and I'm like,

226
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.150
I hope so. I, I hope that I appeal to a lot of different people.

227
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.300
Uh, you know, I it's, it's a very strange look.

228
00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:01.340
I remember the success I had and I'm so grateful for the success that I've

229
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.580
had, uh, on, beyond the pale.

230
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.580
I remember like I came back to New York after I had done this tour.

231
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.460
And you don't know with standup, you don't know how long it's gonna last.

232
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.580
You don't know what's going on.

233
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.300
And I came back and I remember someone reading an article,

234
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.410
maybe it was in time out in New York. And they're like,

235
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.650
he's very mainstream mainstream. And,

236
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.050
and there was recently a New York times article. He's very conventional.

237
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.970
And I'm like, what is that?

238
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.490
Do you mean like conventional in that people want to go and see me perform like

239
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.490
a lot of people like, like you, like, that's like, that's a crime. Yeah.

240
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.040
Like that's, he's, you know, you know, it's like,

241
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.920
it's so we live in this age.

242
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.000
Like there used to be comedians.

243
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.800
And I think it's inhibited some people's success where like,

244
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.600
if it's like bill Burr, one of the best comedians today.

245
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.640
And I think people are, sometimes people in the media are like, you know, uh,

246
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.600
the wrong people might like his material and you're like the wrong that doesn't.

247
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.840
Do you know what I'm saying? Yes, I do. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm like,

248
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.720
no, I get that from this podcast. It's, it's a very strange

249
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:12.110
it's it's, it's almost kind of a, I, you know, and I,

250
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:14.670
and I don't know if I've talked about this, but like, you know,

251
00:15:14.671 --> 00:15:17.910
like there's this cultural revolution that is occurring.

252
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.830
That is it's well intended, but it's almost,

253
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.390
it's almost puritanical and it, and by the way,

254
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.790
I'm not somebody I I'm against any form of censorship,

255
00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:34.300
but I'm also somebody that believes that if we can articulate,

256
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.140
uh, transgender terms that make people that are transgender or feel comfortable,

257
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.060
there's, there's nothing wrong with that. We can adjust our language,

258
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:43.900
we do it all the time.

259
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.540
But I do think that there is kind of this almost

260
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.010
puritanical thing that's ironically on the left.

261
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.970
That is what we, you know, as comedians,

262
00:15:56.971 --> 00:16:00.050
we used to make fun of the right for. Does that make sense? Yes.

263
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.010
A hundred percent. It's a very strange kind of like, wait,

264
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.970
you guys are doing what you accuse these guys of doing forever.

265
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.890
If they don't see it that way, because they feel like they're right.

266
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.440
And if you're right, then it doesn't matter. And I do think it's well intended.

267
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.080
Yes, I do think it's well, I don't question someone's motive.
