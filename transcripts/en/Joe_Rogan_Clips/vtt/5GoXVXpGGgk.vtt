00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.220
I have this thought about how much culture has shifted through the internet and

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.020
how much culture will shift again in even more astronomical way once we can read

4
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.360
minds. And I don't think we're far away from that.

5
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:19.860
I think we're a few decades away from some technology that allows people

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.150
to establish intent and to see thoughts.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.220
And I think they're very,

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.440
there's some sort of theoretical work they're doing on this right now.

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:35.730
And there's, there's different models that they're trying to achieve.

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.430
I think that's going to eliminate a lot of the of communication

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.710
and I think it's going to happen really quickly.

12
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:47.490
Just like Google sort of eliminates a lot of the of people telling stories about

13
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.670
something that someone goes, what, what happened? Wait a minute, what year?

14
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.830
And they'd go good. That didn't happen.

15
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.140
And they can find out like almost instantaneously.

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.210
I think we're going to be able to figure that out with people.

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.780
I think there's going to be a way where you can,

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.590
where we can see intent and we can read minds.

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.140
I don't think we're far away from that. I mean,

20
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.040
I know this neural link thing with Elon Musk is very,

21
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.200
Elan's very hush hush about this is different sort of electronic

22
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.400
brain interfaces that they're trying to, uh, experiment with.

23
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.750
<v 1>I wouldn't wouldn't you worry be that if we read,</v>

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.620
we're able to read someone's thoughts, intentions,

25
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
what we would in fact discover is even more confusing than what we know

26
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:34.584
now. In other words,

27
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.030
maybe what's inside my head right now are 35 different thoughts and

28
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.460
intentions warring it with each other murders.

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.010
<v 0>Scenarios. Yes. Mercenary.</v>

30
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.340
Then Malcolm just sort of keeps everything on the surface.

31
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.480
Super normal.

32
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.300
<v 1>I think it's totally true. Think about it.</v>

33
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.420
Most of us there's any number of things. Think about the,

34
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.400
the list of the list of possible things that could come out of my mouth at this

35
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:01.950
very moment is infinite, right? It is infinite.

36
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.070
There are at this very moment.

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.870
God knows how many scenarios swirling around my head about what should I say

38
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:14.370
next? Right. And why is my intention to try and make you laugh,

39
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.660
to impress you, to you off, to disagree with you, to agree with you? I mean,

40
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.390
we can go on and on and on and on all those are in play.

41
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.970
So you really want to look inside my head and get,

42
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.550
you're not going to get clarity. It's going to be a mess.

43
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.840
<v 0>Or we're going to realize we're all a mess or make us feel a little bit better,</v>

44
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.380
like, oh, everybody's out of their mind, but.

45
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.120
<v 1>Would you want that? Yes.</v>

46
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.810
<v 0>You would. Yes. I'm endlessly curious about,</v>

47
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.790
I know my mind is such a mess and there's so much chaos going on in there.

48
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.890
I want to know what's going on in other people's.

49
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.000
I want to know how up am I or am I normal? Is it.

50
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.290
<v 1>Here's my fear. I have many fears about this kind of thing,</v>

51
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.690
but my fear would be as follows that, um,

52
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.100
I cannot count the number of times when I have had reactions to things that

53
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.780
people have said in a moment that turn out to be wrong deeply and badly

54
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:08.500
wrong.

55
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.070
And one of the things that I have learned as an adult is to deeply distrust

56
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:16.780
those kinds of reactions and to wait. And very often what'll happen. In my case.

57
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.700
Sometimes the waiting takes a long time.

58
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.850
I'm the kind of person who sometimes a month will pass.

59
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.360
And I will think back on a situation and I'll think, oh my God,

60
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.980
I totally misunderstood that this person who I thought was a is actually

61
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.061
someone, you know,

62
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.900
a lovely person who I should give a second chance to or whatever that comment

63
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:38.500
that someone made that I thought was stupid is in fact,

64
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.760
extremely thoughtful and insightful. This will happen weeks, months later,

65
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:43.594
whatever,

66
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.130
if you were able to read my mind in a moment,

67
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.110
you would judge me for my mistake and not give me an easy way to correct it.

68
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.110
And it was, you attract me in like, what if this,

69
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.290
what if I've had a reaction to something you said in this conversation,

70
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.100
in which I said, Jesus, I can't believe that that's dumb.

71
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.480
And then I'm driving back to LA tonight. And I think, oh actually, oh,

72
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.340
that's really interesting and thought about at the time,

73
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.540
I don't want you to short circuit my learning process about you.

74
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.470
I want, I want to give me the privacy of my,

75
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.420
my six hours of thinking about what you said and allow me

76
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.890
give me that kind of time to come to a reasoned and insightful conclusion about

77
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.724
how I feel.

78
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.451
<v 0>Interesting.</v>

79
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:33.280
But we're talking then about only one person having the technology,

80
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.610
because if you both have the technology, then there wouldn't be any issue.

81
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.630
You wouldn't be confusion as to why someone was saying something you'd,

82
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.650
you've a much clearer path to understanding their thought process and their

83
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.980
intent behind it. Really. I mean,

84
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.840
if one person has it right then yeah, I get it. Yeah. If I can read your mind,

85
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.480
oh, I said something in Malcolm thinks I'm a retard. Like, you know,

86
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.970
there's that, but there's another,

87
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.580
there's another possibility that both people have it.

88
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.110
And this is also one of the things that would be fascinating about this is one

89
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.010
of, one of the things about forbidden words is forbidden words

90
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.620
carry with them intent. They have automatic intent, right?

91
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.380
But you can say the exact same word and have different

92
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.360
intent behind it. If we could understand clearly what your intent is,

93
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.860
then taboo words would automatically become meaningless.

94
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.160
That wouldn't mean it's not about sound you make,

95
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.780
it's not about forbidden sounds what it's about as thoughts and what you're

96
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:40.420
trying to convey. And what's happening to you as a human being.

97
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.310
Who are you like, what, what, what is your process for the way you communicate?

98
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.160
What is your process for the way you're trying to, uh,

99
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.330
develop these thoughts in your mind and express them to people? Well, well,

100
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.630
part of the problem with that is language, right?

101
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.770
And part of the problem with making certain aspects of our language forbidden is

102
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:03.320
you limit people's ability to colorfully,

103
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.050
communicate and express themselves in certain ways.

104
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.760
I think that alone just eliminating that alone,

105
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.930
eliminated and confusion, and also highlighting, you know,

106
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.370
you could highlight real problems with people's thoughts and the way people

107
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:23.810
communicate, but also eliminate many problems. So you'd say, well,

108
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.700
he doesn't mean that like you could see what he means.

109
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.040
Like this is what this is where his mind is. You could see,

110
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.290
you could literally see the thoughts. Yeah.

111
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.070
<v 1>Yeah. I guess I would also, let me, let me get,</v>

112
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.020
let me throw another complicating factor.

113
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.850
It still leaves the question of cultural contexts. So of course,

114
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.290
one of the things I got really interested when I was writing my book was how our

115
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:49.760
kind of cultural frames of reference, um, profoundly, um,

116
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.330
complicate our attempts to understand other people.

117
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.400
And so in your scenario where I have some kind of window into your thinking and

118
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:01.850
intention, I still need to know in order to make sense of you.

119
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:04.700
I still need to have a very clear idea of the,

120
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.240
the cultural kind of rules of the road that you're using.

121
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.380
And they're likely to be different from mine. Sure. Particularly if, you know,

122
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.440
I mean, I'm a Canadian, you're not. Um,

123
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.040
but imagine if the difference between us was more profound, if I was, you know,

124
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.670
then you you're still like, like I was, there's a really cool thing. I've,

125
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.740
I've been obsessed with, um, uh, with memory, I'm doing these things on memory,

126
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.380
in my, in revisions history, this coming season.

127
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.450
And I was reading about this really fascinating experiment, which has done with,

128
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.070
uh, Korean and American, um, college students,

129
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.380
adults essentially. And what I do is I give you three circles,

130
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.530
B paper circles, and one is past one is present. One is future.

131
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.300
And I say, those are three concepts represent those three concepts,

132
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.630
um, uh, with these three circles.

133
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.230
So the American kid has passed here,

134
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.920
present in the middle future over on the right, right.

135
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.450
Three independent circles.

136
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.000
The Korean kid puts all piles, all three circles on top of each other.

137
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.970
Now what does that mean? I don't know what that means.

138
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.660
It means something interesting, right? It means that they don't,

139
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.830
they're not separating these three modes the way that we are,

140
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.670
they're certainly coming at experience with a very different set of assumptions.

141
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:34.040
So maybe so I think of the civil war is a

142
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:36.080
long time ago, but if I'm Korean,

143
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:40.850
maybe the civil war is as present in my kind of consciousness as

144
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:43.340
something that happened last week. Is that maybe that's what that means.

145
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:46.040
I'm not exactly sure. I'm sort of guessing because I don't know the,

146
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.130
I haven't fully investigated, but the point is there are,

147
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.180
I've just given you one random example. There are re way,

148
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:58.170
incredibly different rules at different cultures use to organize experience.

149
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.280
So if I'm looking at you and reading your thoughts,

150
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.870
I have to know those rules because those rules are sorting out how people,

151
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.710
so this is only, this is not, I'm not, I'm not dissing this notion of that.

152
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:13.830
You're talking about. I'm saying that it needs to have another layer as well,

153
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.780
a cultural level, a cultural layer,

154
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:19.560
which kind of alerts me to how you're organizing experience certainly makes

155
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:19.680
sense.
