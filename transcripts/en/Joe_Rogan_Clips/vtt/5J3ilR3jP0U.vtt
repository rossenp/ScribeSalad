1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.620
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It does. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.430
just because you don't like Trump as an individual that suddenly you're okay

3
00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:10.640
with hard left policies, but I think the Democrats make that mistake.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.710
<v 1>Think they're there.</v>

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.410
They think that that's the solution to Trump go as far away from him as

6
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:18.820
possible. Yeah. And the solution by the center. I think exactly.

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.190
That's the solution. I think the solution is somewhere in the center and when,

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.430
when you see like what's happening in Portland and Seattle,

9
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.780
I think people are more aware than ever now that civil unrest is like,

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.540
it's, it's very strange.

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.200
It's very strange to watch them try to break into that.

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.210
What was the building in Portland? They were, oh, the.

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.330
<v 0>Hatfield, uh, courthouse, the federal courthouse. Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.730
<v 1>That was insane. Yeah. Watch on. That was insane.</v>

15
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.780
I don't understand the motivation, like connecting that to,

16
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.650
how do you connect that in Portland? The most liberal city in the country?

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.670
How do you PR how do you are arguably right. Probably the most liberal,

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.460
the most progressive, not all Portland right there.

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.800
How do you connect that to black lives matter? I mean,

20
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.480
how do you connect that to George Floyd's death?

21
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.860
How do you connect that to w Y Y Y I just don't understand.

22
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:08.720
Why would you try to break into the courthouse?

23
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.160
They're trying to recreate what went wrong. What didn't work in Seattle, right?

24
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:18.140
That whole a zone channel Toronto. Yeah. That didn't work.

25
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:19.520
I mean, that was nonsense. It was crazy.

26
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.860
You made a worse version of American six blocks.

27
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.370
It's like one of those little tiny, a little, you know,

28
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:28.850
like if you took like a glass dome and you put like little animals in there and

29
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:31.610
you'll let them eat each other alive, like I was like, we're going to,

30
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.260
we're going to create utopian glass.

31
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:36.140
Like they made a worst version of the United States.

32
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.110
They put up borders immediately. They stopped people from coming in.

33
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.070
They had armed guards, they wind up using police tech. They didn't have cops,

34
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:46.580
but they have people that act like cops and beat the out of people for filming.

35
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.220
Right. The whole thing is madness. They had murders.

36
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.930
<v 2>It was quick.</v>

37
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.950
<v 0>I mean, look, Portland. I, I know Portland extremely well. My parents lived,</v>

38
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.730
uh, in Portland for a couple of decades. It's a, it used to be a real,

39
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.660
a hell of a place, but over the years, and, and, you know, I,

40
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.990
I know Republicans and Democrats who feel the same way who were in Portland and

41
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:12.860
the surrounding area. And they all feel like this place is, is slowly, you know,

42
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.720
circling down a toilet because of local and state, uh, management.

43
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.590
Right. And so, uh, what happened in Portland?

44
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.180
Not really a surprise, you know, it's, it's the same. The, the, the people that,

45
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:29.420
that, that did that do this sort of activity, right.

46
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.980
That have been referred to us Antifa or anarchistic or whatever.

47
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.230
<v 2>They.</v>

48
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.170
<v 0>The same sort of trust a ferry and, you know, bottom feeding folks in,</v>

49
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:46.040
in really any city in the world who engage in a WTO protest because it's

50
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.790
cool to get out there and protest. I don't understand the mentality,

51
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.700
but if you try to figure out a motivation for them, you know,

52
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:54.500
you'll lose your mind. Cause they definitely don't have one.

53
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:58.580
You could take 10 of those people out of Portland who were engaged in sort of

54
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.190
the violent activity and asked him, well, why are you doing this?

55
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.370
And you'll get 10 different. I do.

56
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.850
<v 3>Think a lot of this is coming from empathy, which is a good thing. And I,</v>

57
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.380
I have to say, you know, I, with regard to the issue of transitioning children,

58
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.150
I do support traditioning and adults.

59
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.290
I think it can help adults who are transgender. I think if you were an adult,

60
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.970
you it's your decision. It's your body.

61
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:22.680
It's no one's place to tell you what to do.

62
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.080
But I think a lot of this is coming from,

63
00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:29.400
so I grew up in the gay community and I remember seeing how homophobic people

64
00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:33.570
could be toward my friends. And I think things have changed.

65
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.750
Things have gotten better in some ways I think homophobia still exists.

66
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:39.480
And we can talk about that because I do talk about how that affects a lot of

67
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.200
what we're seeing in the book. But I think for a lot of people,

68
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:46.110
they look at that and they say, okay, we were wrong about that.

69
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.510
We were wrong to treat gay people differently.

70
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:51.000
We were wrong to say that being gay is something you can change.

71
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:54.180
So now they've gone completely in the opposite direction saying, okay,

72
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.050
no matter what anyone says with regard to their identity,

73
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.560
with regard to their gender, this is something that we should not challenge.

74
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:04.500
We should fully support. And if you question it in any way,

75
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:08.220
even in the most nuanced or sensitive way as I try to, and I said, thank you,

76
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:10.110
do that's still not acceptable.

77
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.100
<v 1>Yeah. That's, what's strange. It's, it's an ideology. It's rigid.</v>

78
00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:15.090
It's like a religion.

79
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.210
<v 3>It is. It is. I think I find people who are, you know,</v>

80
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.950
middle of the road. They're not sure what to think.

81
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.340
If they read my work or they talk to me, they say, oh wow. I had never,

82
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.770
I never realized that. I didn't know the science said that.

83
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.680
And they changed their perspective. But I think for some people,

84
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.980
if they are very much invested in the identity or very,

85
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.370
very invested in activism or for whatever reason,

86
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.640
this ideology means something to them, it's, you cannot,

87
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.690
you just cannot reason with them. It doesn't matter what the science says.

88
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.290
They will find something to pick at. And especially with desistence,

89
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.090
which is that, that, um,

90
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.600
the research I was mentioning where it shows that most kids will not feel gender

91
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:58.860
dysphoric anymore. When they repeat reach puberty, they w they just, people,

92
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.830
some people can not accept it and they will call you transphobic.

93
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.130
They'll call you bigoted. And, you know, I don't think I'm any of those things.

94
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:09.450
I'm really just trying to help prevent these children from making potentially a

95
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.220
very bad decision that they're going to regret.

96
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.570
And especially now we're seeing in the UK that this is happening where more di

97
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:19.230
transitioners are saying, this was something I regret. This was a mistake.

98
00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:22.500
Why did the adults not challenge me? I really think so. Right now,

99
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:25.200
we're in August, 2020, I think within the next five years,

100
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:26.250
or maybe a little bit longer,

101
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.120
we're going to be seeing an explosion of children coming out and saying,

102
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.550
I did not want to transition. This was a mistake.

103
00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:34.440
And it's really going to be awful. We're.

104
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.890
<v 1>Already seeing that there's a lawsuit that was a very prominent in the UK</v>

105
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.710
recently about a young girl who transitioned to be,

106
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.600
do you know the lawsuit I'm talking about? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's,

107
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:49.410
it's heartbreaking because they she's essentially ruined her body

108
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.590
to the point where she's not going to be able to have children. She's she'll,

109
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.060
you know, she, in, in many cases, a lot of these girls can't have orgasms ever.

110
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 3>No, exactly. Yeah. But I think in north America,</v>

111
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.850
we are still very much in denial about those. If, I mean,

112
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.730
whenever I am on a show, if I'm on TV and I talk about this,

113
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.530
the backlash after is just crazy. And I'm thinking people need to wake up,

114
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.900
but I'm trying to stop this from happening. Right?

115
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.240
The whole point of writing this book and saying these things is trying to

116
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.410
prevent what's about to happen.

117
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.350
<v 4>It's important. You know,</v>

118
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.670
I can't help talking about the death penalty when we talk about shorty Clemente,

119
00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:29.290
because in this country, a lot of people still believe in death penalty.

120
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.060
And I don't. Um,

121
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.350
and what I say to people who believe in the death penalty is I respect your

122
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:36.184
view,

123
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.050
but what percentage of innocent people are you okay with executing? Right?

124
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:44.170
Because the system is fundamentally flawed.

125
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.250
And even if the system was reformed in all the ways that we could sit here and

126
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:50.200
think of, right, and I have some ideas on that,

127
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.380
there's still going to be errors. There's always going to be,

128
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.760
they're always going to be errors made.

129
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.290
And so you have to accept that they're going to be mistakes.

130
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:03.310
We know that like in Florida, where Josh represents James daily, and again,

131
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:07.240
we did a podcast episode about his case as well. Um,

132
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.710
James is either going to be the hundredth guy executed by the state of Florida

133
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.290
or the 30th guy exonerated from.

134
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.310
<v 0>Death row Clemente was the 29th. And I'm representing who should be the 30th.</v>

135
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.910
So.

136
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.090
<v 4>They're not even if all the people they executed were guilty.</v>

137
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:23.710
And we know they weren't. Right.

138
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:26.950
We know certain people like Jesse to Pharaoh who was absolutely innocent

139
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:30.730
executed by the state of Florida and that gruesome execution where the electric

140
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.880
chair quote, unquote malfunction and his head caught on fire.

141
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.220
And they had to ex electrocute him three times.

142
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.050
But even if they got those right, they aren't even batting 700.

143
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.670
Right. And then in, in Louisiana, you know, to your point before Joe, um,

144
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.240
a guy named John Thompson rest in peace was a good friend of mine. Um,

145
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.040
he came within a month of being executed by the state of Louisiana when an

146
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.270
attorney, uh,

147
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.220
investigator staring into a microscope and saw the DNA evidence that proved that

148
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:03.220
he was not guilty of this murder. And he was ultimately exonerated.

149
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.140
And he wrote an opinion piece.

150
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.000
Then New York times where he set out on understand why the prosecutor who

151
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:10.720
prosecuted,

152
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.540
because he proved that they knew he was innocent before they prosecuted him.

153
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.260
Right. He knew it. And it was absolutely proven. That was not in question.

154
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.390
So he said,

155
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:22.570
I don't understand why that prosecutor's not being charged with attempted

156
00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:25.270
murder. They tried to kill me and they knew I was innocent.

157
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.040
And I've proven that, but, and what.

158
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.130
<v 1>Happens to the prosecutor? Nothing, nothing, nothing. This is,</v>

159
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.050
I've been saying this for a long time,

160
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.710
but there's a real problem with human beings when it comes to anything where

161
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:40.420
there's a game and the problem with policing and prosecuting

162
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:41.980
people and convicting people.

163
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:45.940
And it's a game and meaning that there's winners and losers. And when,

164
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.620
when there's winners and losers, people cheat.

165
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.670
There's a lot of people with poor character and they just want to win.

166
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:54.940
And they get caught up in this game. I mean, you can call it a game.

167
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.180
You can call it a pursuit, whatever you want to call it. There's a,

168
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.990
there's an end that you want to achieve if you're successful. And if you,

169
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.360
if you don't achieve that end, you're unsuccessful.

170
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.190
So when people are trying to achieve this end, they will do all kinds of things.

171
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.910
You know.

172
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.860
<v 5>The thing about Farley was, um, he,</v>

173
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.850
he in spade used to fight over me. Like I was the girl,

174
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.500
probably because let's face it. I'd kind of look like and certain lighting. Um,

175
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.250
and, uh, they'd be like, I heard you in the jacuzzi with Rob last night.

176
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.350
Yeah. Oh, we didn't call me well, and they would, they, they would like fight.

177
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.250
It was, it was very funny and sweet. One night I took, uh,

178
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.900
I took the gang out to barbarians steakhouse in Toronto. Great steak.

179
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:39.734
I don't know if they're still there.

180
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.540
Chris ordered to bone in two bone in state. Uh,

181
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.280
porterhouse steaks ate both of them,

182
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.960
but on top of each bite he put a cube of butter.

183
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.380
And when I looked at him like, what the are you doing?

184
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.040
He was like, it needs a hat.

185
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.510
<v 1>So if you want to put a hat on your steak,</v>

186
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.040
some people just genuinely don't give a. No given. Yeah, obviously.

187
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.640
Yeah. He's a wild man. I met him once on the set of a news radio.

188
00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:17.240
He's partying with Andy Dick. Oh, he showed up gray,

189
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.010
like wet cardboard. He looked gray and I'm like, Hey man. He's like,

190
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.440
it was just, he was gone. Oh, it was, it was sad. It was weird.

191
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.530
He had gray skin. And I remember thinking, Jesus Christ,

192
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.490
Chris Farley has gray skin. Like what's going on? Like he was sweaty and just,

193
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.620
just all up. Yeah.

194
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.890
<v 5>He, he had major, major demons. Uh,</v>

195
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.450
and a lot of us really worked, you know, we're were worked out, you know,

196
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.170
but you know, it's some people can't, they can't make that leap. Man.

197
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.030
The thing about him though, is the.

198
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.780
<v 1>I always wonder about guys like that, that are so powerful. Like,</v>

199
00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:56.060
is it the demons that made him so good?

200
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.920
<v 5>He was so good. So good. He would go ape. I mean, he had the.</v>

201
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.040
<v 1>Horsepower. He had, it was so stunning.</v>

202
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.720
And you have these scenes where he would just go crazy. It was so fun.

203
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.850
I would wonder, like, what is, is that same thing?

204
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.220
What makes him, I mean, cause it was so real.

205
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.270
Is that what made him just go crazy with Coke and go crazy with everything.

206
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.960
<v 5>Else? I mean, I think, I think like people, like,</v>

207
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.640
I don't see a lot of normal people drawn. Well,

208
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:31.190
why would any normal person want to be in entertainment? Right. Right.

209
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.410
W w why would they, so I think just by default damaged

210
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.200
people or people with more, more,

211
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.850
more articulately people with a hole to fill are drawn to

212
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.620
entertainment to fill the hole.
