<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.080
<v 2>My lucid dreaming has become. So where I,</v>

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.921
you know,

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:13.720
that feeling where in a dream where you're in a high precipice and you think

5
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:17.520
you're gonna fall right now in a dream, I can jump off of it. I know, oh,

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.373
I'm in a dream.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.750
I can I'll jump and I'm gonna float or fly or sink slowly and

8
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:28.110
safely to the ground. I get the same feeling in real life, on a,

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.550
a high, I,

10
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.430
we were crossing the Mississippi once and I was behind the wheel and I started

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.750
to have this panic attack and Cha's editing in the passenger seat.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.940
And I'm like, take the wheel, take the wheel. I I'm freaking out a bit. So now,

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.140
like, I, I need to be a regular dosage of Xanax.

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.730
Well.

15
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.340
<v 1>Hold on. Before you get into that, let,</v>

16
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.420
let me take you back to the Luci dreamy thing. Like when did that start.

17
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.220
<v 0>Over the years? I recently, well, no, over five.</v>

18
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.210
<v 1>Years, years, it's like how many.</v>

19
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.010
<v 0>Years it's, it's getting better all the time. You you're.</v>

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
<v 1>Better at lucid dreaming than you were before. Did, was it.</v>

21
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.290
<v 0>A, um, I had to come out this morning. I took a Seroquil,</v>

22
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.930
which I try not to take. What's that?

23
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.810
It's a very powerful antipsychotic.

24
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.970
&lt;laugh&gt; that? Uh, it's probably bad for your liver.

25
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.240
Why taking an antipsychotic? Because it, I sleep.

26
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.360
I can sleep like 14 hours. I'll get up to,

27
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.800
go like lucidly out of the dream, remembering the dream and go back,

28
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.400
hang on. I have to just like I here on the podcast.

29
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.430
I can get up out of a say, please hold dream.

30
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.910
lucidly. I'm not in a closet. Like Sean R &lt;laugh&gt;.

31
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.070
So Sarah and go back for you. Yeah, I, I,

32
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.710
and that's why I use it very sparingly.

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.430
<v 1>Jesus Christ. That sounds amazing.</v>

34
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.590
<v 0>It's the best. Like.</v>

35
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.630
<v 1>What else does it do.</v>

36
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.820
<v 0>Though? What the bad is you not shared dreams with people?</v>

37
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.260
I know it's a hack premise. Mm. But where I woke up this morning,

38
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.340
I went to bed after red band.

39
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:14.460
Finally called me &lt;laugh&gt; and told me, oh yeah.

40
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.500
I prompted Joe Rogan to finally respond to you. What time am I gonna be?

41
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.900
I didn't know what time I'm supposed to be here. Mm. He told me the address.

42
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.820
I think you were texting the.

43
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.330
<v 1>Wrong number. No, I'm pretty sure. No, no. With me.</v>

44
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.330
<v 0>Me. Uh, do you want, uh, if you want to put a half a million dollar bet,</v>

45
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.290
I'll use your half million as a down payment on that comedian Grove.

46
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.130
This is comedian Grove. Um, I'll I'll show you the text.

47
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.130
<v 1>What, what? We were just saying something though. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.560
<v 0>About lucid dreaming lucid. So, so I,</v>

49
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.240
I was in such a state when I woke up this morning from dreams where, you know,

50
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:53.840
the dream where you wake up and go, oh thank God. Everything was going. Right.

51
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:54.480
But I wanted, this is.

52
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.313
<v 1>What I wanna know. Did,</v>

53
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.640
did the lucid dreams start independently of this clerical stuff? Oh,

54
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.600
did they start with yeah, no. Since I was a kid, oh, you've always had lucid.

55
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.720
<v 0>Dreams. I remember when I was probably an early teenager,</v>

56
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.760
the first time that I could correlate that stomach drop feeling

57
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.720
of when you're about to fall off of something. But you could fly. Yeah. Like,

58
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.680
do you have flying dreams sometimes? Yeah.

59
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.070
But those have grown where, okay, now I can fly.

60
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.470
Now I know I'm in a dream. I can kind of control it. I,

61
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.510
I know what's going on and I can wake up and and go back to bed

62
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.190
and get right back into the same dreams.

63
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.470
<v 1>Did you read books about this?</v>

64
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.670
Is this something that you just figured out as you were doing it as you were

65
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:38.910
having these lucid dreams? Yeah.

66
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.780
<v 0>But at the same problem that everyone who has dreams,</v>

67
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.500
you can't quite remember it, but the feeling, the stomach drop feeling the, oh,

68
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.580
I'm, I'm floating things that connect your brain back to,

69
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.260
okay. I know I'm in a dream, but I'm not gonna wake up. Let's with this. But.

70
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.300
<v 1>You, so you,</v>

71
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.250
but you got better over the years just by having Lucy dreams over and over again

72
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:02.570
and realizing what's,

73
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.130
what's the thing that you do that gets you out of the dream. Don't do that.

74
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.810
And just figured out what to do to.

75
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.730
<v 0>Stay in that state. Sometimes you, you,</v>

76
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.890
you wake up or sometimes you're only alerted to the fact that you're dreaming.

77
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.010
Cuz you had BA BA BA oh, I get a text message. Okay. Reality's on the outside.

78
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.320
It's me up. Shut off your phone before you go to.

79
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.640
<v 1>Bed. But thes is more extreme.</v>

80
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.960
<v 0>It's bigger than it makes you sleep longer. I don't know.</v>

81
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.840
I don't know the science.

82
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.080
<v 1>Behind it, but, but is,</v>

83
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.760
does thes making you have more lucid dreams or better control of your lucid.

84
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.200
<v 0>Dreams? It it's, it's making me sleep longer and uh,</v>

85
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.790
making, be more aware that I'm in a dream. I don't know.

86
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.510
I just know sural dreams. I've lived an entire,

87
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.270
these altered states where I woke up and I'm like,

88
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.550
is there still a receipt in my pocket from that dream that I can prove there's

89
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:00.670
two different worlds. It was that up. But you can't explain that to people.

90
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.740
I wanted to call anyone. I woke up and I was like, it was just a dream.

91
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.220
<v 1>There's a, a movie about, uh, recording dreams.</v>

92
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.780
That was pretty good that I saw the other night. I think it's called come true.

93
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.420
And it's about apparently there is some technology that they're working on

94
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.730
right now where they can record certain aspects of your thoughts.

95
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:26.090
Like if you're thinking about a triangle,

96
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.450
it'll show an image of a triangle and they think read something about it. Yeah.

97
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:34.090
They think they're going to get to the point where they're going to be able to

98
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:37.530
get at least some sort of a reasonable fact simile of the visuals that you're

99
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.930
having in your dreams catch new episodes.
