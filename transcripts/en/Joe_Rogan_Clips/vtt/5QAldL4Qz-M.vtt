00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.180
<v 0>I took a bike riding during this quarantine.</v>

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.190
You know what time I leave my house? Eight, 15:00 AM. You know, I do that.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.140
There's a reason why there's just nobody out. Yeah. I go against the grain.

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.870
I don't let cars by me. I go against cars. You got something to say,

5
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.130
you put your mouth.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.570
I wear a hooded sweatshirt with a 22 just in case I don't,

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.090
I don't tell people that I don't wear headphones.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.470
Sometimes I go on the sidewalk, whatever, but trust me,

9
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.630
I know that I'm in danger of getting hit because there's a lot of

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.370
texting. I see it. You, when you're on a bike, you're in danger,

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.050
human danger, your best bet is to get a bike and go on to Chandler trout.

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.590
You're pretty safe that, you know, I've done that a lot too.

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.570
But the Chandler trail is kind of weird that there's people walking and there's

14
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.680
people dogs.

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.670
They got to take their dogs everywhere because he believed the book,

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
Gallup water. Yet. You're going to note here. I want to eat.

17
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.060
Now the lady sitting there with a ball,

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.740
the dog gets they home. Not one day.

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.960
Everybody in California got to take a dog.

20
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.080
They have a most dogs take Xanax.

21
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.940
Like everybody out do a line of Coke. Wait, did Coke is up to 1800. An ounce.

22
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.960
Isn't really a hundred an hour. What did it used to be six?

23
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.510
They were giving it away three years ago. What happened?

24
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.401
[inaudible] oh,

25
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:39.090
it's hard to get in COVID and they got an extra 600 a week on an employment.

26
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.900
What did he get? New Mexican tunnel. They just found located tunnel.

27
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:47.760
They've ever discovered. That's an easy one. They gave him that. Yeah.

28
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.160
