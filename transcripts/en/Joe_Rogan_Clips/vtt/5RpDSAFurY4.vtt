WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
<v 0>So when you,</v>

2
00:00:00.971 --> 00:00:04.950
you took the pictures that was you in between the second and third fight.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.870
<v 1>Is the bright before the third fight I was waiting at, it was the King's cup.</v>

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.180
So it was the King's birthday. Yeah. It's yeah. So that's that's actually. Yeah.

5
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.570
And you can see my ankle and it actually went underneath my toes.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.940
<v 0>And this was before it was a fight. Again, both legs.</v>

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.800
<v 1>Were like that. Yeah. Both were like.</v>

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.480
<v 0>This and you have to fight again. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.440
<v 1>So do you know what Amanda Johnson that's him rubbing me.</v>

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.880
And so he tried to give me the tie they gave you the pre-fight massage with the

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.210
time limit. He couldn't touch me. It was so bad.

12
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.950
<v 0>Did you fight like this? I don't know, but that is so insane.</v>

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.520
Your legs are so banged up. The fact that you fought. Yeah.

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.840
<v 1>Yeah. And so like mentally, I was just like, wow, this is, this is,</v>

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.380
this is happening. This is, um, I'm going to do this and I'd look at my legs.

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.300
Okay. Okay. This is happening. This is, this is okay. And.

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.170
<v 0>Yeah, no. Once he started fighting, what did you feel? I don't think about that.</v>

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.740
<v 1>Sometimes you get kicked in and it gets, it goes through,</v>

19
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.010
like it gets through here for shield, you know, like you kind of put up this,

20
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.360
like, I don't know when I fight, it's like I'm fighting and the thing, you know,

21
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:17.100
it's a poor shield in a sense, you know? Um, and uh,

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.760
sometimes if it hurts enough, like when I got my ribs cracked,

23
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.290
I felt that right. Like it went through and they like disrupted my force shield.

24
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.230
And so sometimes that's something we'll go through like a good, solid kick.

25
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.483
So my forced shield.

26
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.100
<v 0>Activate your attitude. Your mindset is like, you're fighting. You're,</v>

27
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:36.720
you're ready to accept all sorts of.

28
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.910
<v 1>Yeah. Like I could die or even harder.</v>

29
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.840
I could kill someone.

30
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.260
<v 0>Do you think it'd be harder to kill someone than to die? So.</v>

31
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.670
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Because then you think about their loved ones.</v>

32
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.500
So think about all the people that loved you. We fight.

33
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.250
Think about all the people that love you. Right. And so when we fight,

34
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.440
I didn't, I didn't break any rules, but I killed you. Right.

35
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.230
Think about all your loved ones, everybody that loves you.

36
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:12.090
That's attached to you think about that. All that pain

37
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.010
because of what I did to you. Right. Even though I didn't break any rules.

38
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.770
<v 0>Have you ever been in a promotion where someone died.</v>

39
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.880
<v 1>But that's heavy, right? Yeah. And I don't,</v>

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.500
I think probably why a lot of fighters

41
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.050
I have noticed, like, there's, there's,

42
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.250
I don't think the majority of fighters, um,

43
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.210
look at what they do with the gravity that,

44
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.680
that it deserves, you know, like you could kill somebody.

45
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.760
Like, you need to think about that and be okay with that. Not okay.

46
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:51.510
But just understand like, all right, that could happen.

47
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.250
And I'm going to be calm, consciously knowing this and choosing to go forward,

48
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.500
they just think, oh, I'm going to fight it. It'll be fun. It'll, you know,

49
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:02.320
whatever. Or it'll be hard or I'm gonna like, whatever,

50
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.760
they don't think about these things.

51
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.770
<v 0>It's just something that you thought about when you were young.</v>

52
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.230
<v 1>Yeah. Before I really got into it.</v>

53
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.850
<v 0>So you, this is, uh,</v>

54
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.050
something you've been contemplating even before you started fighting,

55
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.930
you are aware of all the possibilities. Yeah.

56
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.030
<v 1>Aye. Okay. All right. I'll say it. So I was, um,</v>

57
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.490
it was about 28, I think.

58
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.690
And I don't think I had my pro boxing debut yet

59
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.850
and I took some mushrooms and I was thinking

60
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.510
somewhere along the trip, I started thinking about fighting.

61
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.030
And I started thinking about like, what could happen to me.

62
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.120
And I think it's I thinking about the death of me.

63
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.930
And then I started thinking about what could happen to my opponent.

64
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.170
Like what's worse than that. And I thought about, I could see,

65
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:53.140
like somebody had a fight and I saw all the, like,

66
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.160
like lines of gold thread attached into them, like, uh,

67
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.600
from their loved ones.

68
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.610
And then all the lines got snipped when they died. Yeah. I saw this one,

69
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.260
this mushroom trip. And I was just like. And so then when I decided to fight,

70
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.980
there's more intent, you know,

71
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.720
and more commitment and more resolve.

72
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.050
<v 0>That's heavy. Yeah. Yeah. But that is what it is. Right.</v>

73
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.880
<v 1>And that's where the, I think real, there's more power.</v>

74
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.450
<v 0>To people that have never fought for. And people that don't understand fighting,</v>

75
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.120
they did this. I don't get the appeal. I dunno why you watch it.

76
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.070
That the reason that Pete, one of the reasons there's many reasons,

77
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:40.300
but one of the reasons why people enjoy participating in it so much is because

78
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:44.680
there's so much risk and it's so dangerous and it's so difficult.

79
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.400
So unbelievably difficult to prepare, unbelievably difficult,

80
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:51.730
to put yourself in the proper mind state, especially to be a champion,

81
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.590
to beat the best of the best and to get to the top of the heap that

82
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.080
once you do succeed,

83
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.080
like explain that feeling to people,

84
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.680
explain that feeling when they raise your hand and put that belt around your

85
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.780
waist. And the crowd is cheering.

86
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.200
<v 1>I'm kind of weird because I actually get depressed. You get depressed.</v>

87
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.090
<v 0>You get depressed when you win.</v>

88
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.110
<v 1>Uh, at times. Yeah. Or, or I'm just,</v>

89
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.080
I think for me,

90
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.010
what I've come to realize about myself is that it's about authentically

91
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:30.130
expressing myself in the moment. And I think with a lot of my fights,

92
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:31.270
I wasn't being honest.

93
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.920
I didn't take my heart and cut it open and pour it out on the mat or the canvas.

94
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.490
I played it safe. I didn't go in for the knockout.

95
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.130
I didn't slip a punch in counter and get inside.

96
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:45.910
I stayed outside or when I was inside, I would clinch up an elbow and knee,

97
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.160
you know? So, um,

98
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.760
for me it hurts when I'm being inauthentic. And I know that

99
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.770
with pretty much all of my, my high fights, I wasn't.

100
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.470
<v 0>But is that the case or is it you being hyper critical of</v>

101
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.304
yourself?

102
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.660
<v 1>Always. He always said so I've, I've actually, you just said, carry it on.</v>

103
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.750
And he can attest to this. I've I've come out of fights and,

104
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:18.110
and won the world title and done a great job.

105
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.700
And I go into the gym the next week and it curing, this was stupid.

106
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:25.280
I looked stupid. I didn't do this. Right. This is up.

107
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:29.420
I can't fight like that again. Like we got to fix that. And I was just like.

108
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.240
<v 0>That. That's what makes a champion though. Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.110
<v 1>But mine was unhealthy. So mine was more, I think,</v>

110
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.090
I think I'm more of a champion now than I ever was when I was

111
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:43.850
actively fighting. And when I was, um,

112
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.220
I was

113
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.060
trying to be good enough instead of just focusing on

114
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.330
how do I say this? My, my,

115
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.000
my pursuit of world titles. Wasn't wasn't about it. It was, uh,

116
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.830
in a defense of something that was told to me when I was growing up.

117
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.630
So it was like I'm world champion.

118
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:17.900
So you can't tell that's not true because I'm a world champion. Right.

119
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.820
That's what that was about for me.

120
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.380
<v 0>So it was about making up for a lack of love, a lack of appreciation.</v>

121
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.470
<v 1>Yeah. Lack of like, I'm not good enough.</v>

122
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:31.150
So I'm gonna win this world title and prove that I am good enough. So F you,

123
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.770
and that's not a pure place to express yourself from. Right. You know,

124
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:37.630
like now, um,

125
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.930
I'm more of a martial artists than I've ever been,

126
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.780
and I'm more of a teacher and a student than I've ever been.

127
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.850
And I'm more of a champion than I've ever been. How.

128
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.770
<v 0>Are you more of a champion than you've ever been? It's.</v>

129
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.460
<v 1>The way, uh, my outlook and the way, uh,</v>

130
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.080
I learn the way I attack new information, the way, how malleable I am,

131
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.900
um, uh, how quickly I take things on,

132
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.550
you know, how driven, you know, it's easy to be.

133
00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:10.960
It's a lot easier to be championed when you have the six pack and the muscles

134
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.870
and the youth and the, everything the back that up.

135
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.100
But when you have those things taken away from you, then what is it champion?

136
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.720
What is it without those things? It's your hearts, your desire,

137
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.160
it's your resolve? It's your mind.

138
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.440
<v 0>But using this expression champion, like what, what, why, why champion?</v>

139
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:30.761
Because you're,

140
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:34.330
if you're a champion you're competing against someone to become a champion,

141
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.060
that's a mixing chance, right?

142
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.740
So you have better.

143
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.593
<v 1>Mastery.</v>

144
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:47.290
<v 0>Over the things that you feel held you back and limited your potential when</v>

145
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.690
you actually were a world champion. Kickboxer.

146
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.410
<v 1>And so now it's more about that expression.</v>

147
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.470
<v 0>You're more balanced person. Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.820
<v 1>Definitely. And now it's the pursuit of self-expression and it's the pursuit of</v>

149
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.950
authenticity. Um,

150
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.420
and like finding that moment to ride the Razor's edge instead of playing it safe

151
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.990
and staying outside, but not having a satisfying fight. Yeah. You know.

152
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.790
<v 0>Even though you won not having satisfying fights because you could feel the</v>

153
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.624
flaws.

154
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.650
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I could just feel how I was holding back. Right. And it's like,</v>

155
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.080
you can feel when you're in the zone and you go for it a hundred percent

156
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:25.170
commitment and you're just in it, you know, you're in it. And so.

157
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.530
<v 0>What fights have you had where you really felt satisfied?</v>

158
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:30.963
<v 1>Uh,</v>

159
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.280
I would say the fight after I fought Julie. Yeah.

160
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.140
She she's went up kitchen. Yeah. I went up and wait to fight her. She, she,

161
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.850
um, uh, went up to one 40, it was a champion, a champion. She had 58 fights.

162
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:48.260
I think 14 world titles.

163
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.120
I had 14 fights at the time and six world titles,

164
00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:55.100
I think. And, um.

165
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.670
<v 0>That's pretty crazy. 14 fights. Six world titles. Yeah.</v>

166
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.313
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

167
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.770
<v 0>Karen and said that you were the most talented person he's ever worked with.</v>

168
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.230
<v 1>I would agree. I would. I would, because it's so.</v>

169
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.760
<v 0>High praise Kevin's. I mean, that's really,</v>

170
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.260
it's amazing stuff.

171
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.420
<v 1>Well, I'm malleable and I'm really dry. Like I'm like, no, that's not right.</v>

172
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.640
Do it again. That doesn't feel right. Do it again. What do I,

173
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.530
what are you doing? What am I doing? What does it look like?

174
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.230
What should it feel like? Where's my pressure. Where's the leverage was this,

175
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.060
you know, like, I'm like, I'm like that, you know? No, it's not right.

176
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.600
Let's do it again. Oh, that was perfect. But let's move on to the next thing.

177
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.760
<v 0>And this sort of level of dissatisfaction with your performance as though don't</v>

178
00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:41.840
you think that that's ultimately,

179
00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:44.540
what makes you such a champion in the first place?

180
00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:48.410
Like you Alexander Gustafson put it best once when he was talking about one of

181
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:51.710
his training camps, he's like, this is the life of a professional athlete.

182
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:53.900
You're just never satisfied. He's if you achieve,

183
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.780
if you want to achieve greatness, you're never satisfied. Yeah.

184
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.590
<v 1>No, I agree. But not with the way I was doing it.</v>

185
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.300
<v 0>So you were doing it, but you were doing it in a manic almost unhealthy way.</v>

186
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.990
<v 1>Yeah. Like I could never just give myself that. Right. I've never like, alright,</v>

187
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:12.830
that was great. This needs adjustments. All right. So here's the game plan,

188
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.700
you know, like, oh, here, you know, you did this, this was an accomplishment,

189
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.200
uh, or, you know, you, you conquered this, you took on this new skill.

190
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.980
All right. Let's give yourself that credit. Right. It's never good enough.

191
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.470
Never good enough. Never, never good enough.

192
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.200
<v 0>But is that never good enough fuel? Like,</v>

193
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:32.570
is that thought like you never good enough? Never good enough.

194
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.960
<v 1>It is. Right. But it's not, there's, there's,</v>

195
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.170
there's much more environmentally friendly, fuel.

196
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.870
Like this is like con pollutants.

197
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.520
<v 0>Yeah. And as far as your life goes, right? Yeah, yeah.</v>

198
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.840
<v 1>Yeah. Now, so, um, I am working with,</v>

199
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.660
I am back at CSA working with carrion, you know, but I told him, um,

200
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.210
for more Tai,

201
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.430
I actually told Dave and Kurian us, or did I kill it carrion?

202
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.520
Well, I guess I'm telling them now, if I were having a boy tie fight,

203
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:08.770
obviously I'm not gonna, you know, I would,

204
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.790
I wouldn't be with anybody else. Like he's,

205
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.670
that's where the success has been. That's where the formula works.

206
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:20.440
I'm not going to change that. But, um, now I'm also over at, uh,

207
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.190
gorilla jujitsu with Dave Camarillo. And so,

208
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.320
oh my God genius. Whole Jedi Knight, dude. Yeah. He's a Jedi Knight.

209
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.750
Holy. Yeah. He's amazing. He's amazing. Um,

210
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.250
but now I get to learn from him.
