00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I mean, look, man, you had some incredible fights,</v>

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:09.360
but to me, um, one of my fondest memories is, you know, Kevin,

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:12.480
James is from the king Queens on the TV show. Me and Kevin,

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.140
James were at my house and it Encino the night you fought Tyson, the first one,

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.980
the first fight. When, when you dropped Tyson, I'll never forget it.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.330
Because back then we knew that Buster Douglas had beaten Tyson,

7
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.400
but we kind of almost thought it was like a fluke,

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.940
but when you were battering Tyson, and then you put him down and stopped him,

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.160
I'll never forget, Kevin, James jumping off the.

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.870
<v 1>Couch, just jumping. Oh my God. We're throwing our arms up in the air. I mean,</v>

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.190
that was for.

12
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.671
<v 0>Sure.</v>

13
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.870
One of the greatest heavyweight championship victories in the history of the

14
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:46.560
sport. It was just an incredible fight because in a lot of people's eyes,

15
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:51.000
Tyson was like this, a bad guy. He was like a live people,

16
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.490
thought of him as like a thug, you know?

17
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.840
And you were thought of as this like really good guy and many people didn't

18
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.280
think that you were going to be able to beat him.

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.810
So when you didn't just beat him, but you took it to him, you took it to him,

20
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.490
you know, like early on in the fight,

21
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.600
you could tell that you had decided you were going to push him around and you

22
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:14.580
know, once you had stopped him, I mean, it was pandemonium in my house.

23
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:16.530
So everybody was going crazy. They couldn't believe it.

24
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.770
<v 2>Well, yeah. I know big Arabic, you know, I had, you know,</v>

25
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:25.400
I'm like, you know, I'm a Christian, I,

26
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.210
but the point of the point of the matter I work hard.

27
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.120
I train hard and you know, my momma said,

28
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.510
ain't too many things that you do well. So son,

29
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.200
you know which one, which one is sports you going to do?

30
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.800
Because I was a good athlete. I could, I,

31
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.300
but football and boxing was my two best one.

32
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.560
But you know, I played basketball. I did baseball. I did everything.

33
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.720
My mama said. And enough time in the day to be the best at everything. Yeah.

34
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.710
Know what I'm saying? She says you got to pick one. So when I played,

35
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.150
when I played football in 10th grade and they put me on the bench and

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.140
I started crying and my mother said,

37
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560
you can't quit too. The season is over.

38
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.310
So I had to play on a play on that game. They pounded,

39
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:18.410
let me play in the championship game.

40
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.900
And they seen how good I was and asked me was I come back next year? I said, no,

41
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:28.010
sir. He said why? I said, my mama said, I ain't got to like this.

42
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.990
My mama told me, you got to bet on yourself. Are you going to bet on the coach?

43
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.770
Right. So in boxing, you bet on yourself, right?

44
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.740
In teen sport, you bet.

45
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.330
<v 0>You bet on the coach.</v>

46
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
You're betting on the other players and you bet on the coach letting you play.

47
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.080
Right. Whereas in boxing, they have to let you that's right? Yeah.

48
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.300
<v 2>You may be asking somebody to tag him.</v>

49
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.270
<v 0>Now, when did you think that boxing was going to be your career?</v>

50
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:58.760
Was it right after that? So like around 10th grade.

51
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 2>Oh, weren't yeah. After 10th grade I realized that,</v>

52
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.790
you know, it came down to one,

53
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.700
one sport that I really do real well.

54
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.710
And so when I, uh, you know,

55
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.120
I just put everything in it.

56
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.560
<v 0>Well, you were a part of that incredible Olympic team too. I mean,</v>

57
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:24.390
so many great fighters came out of that Olympic team. Right? Freeland personnel,

58
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.210
Whitaker. Taylor. I can tell you all.

59
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.770
<v 2>Of them. Paul Gonzalez, 1 0 6, Steve McCurry went 12,</v>

60
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.030
19, Robert Shannon, 1 25, Mildred Taylor,

61
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.530
1 32 Panell Wilker, 1 39, Jerry,

62
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.480
Jerry, and, and one, four to seven with Martin.

63
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.280
[inaudible] 1 56. Frank, take 1 65 Virgin here. Seven,

64
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:52.830
eight Virgil hill. Dan,

65
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:57.240
Dan Henry Tillman and uh, Tyrell.

66
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.830
Debra bigs. What.

67
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.470
<v 0>A team. Yeah. Crazy team.</v>

68
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.780
<v 2>Now I can go mellow one. Civil Chevron. Amazing. Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.380
<v 0>And you, besides Michael Spinks,</v>

70
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.990
you were one of the rare guys to move up,

71
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.200
to move up and be successful as a heavyweight.

72
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.440
Did you just decide like after you'd beat white Muhammad Kawi,

73
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:22.680
who was a cruiserweight champion and you'd beat, you know,

74
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.520
some real good names at that weight class you had just decided that heavyweight

75
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:27.810
was where the real money was at?

76
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.410
<v 2>No, actually, you know, my goal,</v>

77
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.410
I wanted to be the heavyweight champion of the world and,

78
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.510
and the only person that I knew if Mike Tyson do it,

79
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.400
I could do it. So, so when Mike Tyson, well, everybody,

80
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.870
you know, you know, you know, people tend to make up excuses now,

81
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.760
Mike Tyson, as a small person, right. He, he, after me,

82
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.690
he hit hard, but he got short arms. Right.

83
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.830
And so I seen Mike whoop whoop and people that

84
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:06.720
6, 4, 6, 5, 6, 6, they are weighing by 20,

85
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:09.690
30 pounds. He beat the daylights out of them.

86
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.690
I figured it might could do it. I could do it.

87
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.350
<v 0>So that gave you inspiration. That.</v>

88
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.920
<v 2>That gave me inspiration. My own thing is that, you know, you know, you know,</v>

89
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.670
I actually, you know, boys, the cruiserweight division,

90
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.210
I kinda went through that.

91
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.700
And what's the next goal is to go up and, you know,

92
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:34.320
and, and I, I chose to do it. And a lot of people say, man,

93
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.440
you crazy. Well, you know,

94
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.130
you have to be a little of that to be in this hand to work. Yeah.

95
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.200
There's no doubt about that. Right? Yeah.

96
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.720
<v 0>So when you first did fight,</v>

97
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:49.950
my Tyson was that like something you would always knew was going to happen,

98
00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:51.300
but once he got out of jail.

99
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.410
<v 2>Well, it was a, it was like this, my mom would just tell me, she said,</v>

100
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.780
now let me tell you, bye, good fighter. Who came, wish them away.

101
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.160
They ain't never going nowhere. You got to face it. And so, you know what?

102
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.270
And you know, and everybody in everything that I done,

103
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.610
everybody will always remind me, you didn't beat Mike Tyson. And I'd be like,

104
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.030
well, you're right. And I said, but it's not like it was my fault. And I just,

105
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.080
you know, every time I got rid of the phone, something happened, I said,

106
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.880
but one my fault. Well, you, you ain't really the champ till you beat him.

107
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.720
I, it was amazing that he was so popular.

108
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.330
I'm special in my house.

109
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.700
<v 1>I was, you know, when people get mad at me, they.</v>

110
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.280
<v 2>Tell me, I can't wait till you fight Mike Tyson.</v>

111
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.720
So the thing is, is that, you know, you know,

112
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.770
he was that person that I watched everyone in his fight. And,

113
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.020
and I realize you can't make that miss that many mistakes with Mike. Right.

114
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.850
When.

115
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.570
<v 0>You finally did beat him, do you think when you did fight him and did beat him,</v>

116
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:57.250
do you think that that raised your,

117
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.580
your celebrity and your notoriety to a different level?

118
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.610
<v 2>Well, no, not really. I think that it,</v>

119
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.570
it let people know that you ain't gotta, you,

120
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:11.800
ain't gotta be considered a bad person to be good in the ring. Yeah.

121
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.680
Because when you're in a mountain thing, I could box. And,

122
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:18.380
but everybody thought that because I didn't curse a lot.

123
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.770
I don't get in trouble that you,

124
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.810
you a mean enough to beat a mean guy and most

125
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:30.190
so that I'm, I'm a skilled for fighting. I took him abide in. I did everything.

126
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.980
Right. Um, you know, I, you know,

127
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.990
in general I follow a lot, a guy who, a lot bigger and, and,

128
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.950
but there's an art to the game. It's really art.

129
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.640
It's really art. It is. It's not just one thing. You just,

130
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.240
you hit harder because you got to be able to take something to give something

131
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.960
right.

132
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.700
<v 0>Where you always can take it. Yeah. Part of your,</v>

133
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.600
your career when you had an iron chin, I mean, Riddick,

134
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.450
Paul was a giant man and he hit you with some bombs.

135
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:01.900
And those wars that you guys had, you were able to take some incredible punches.

136
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.130
<v 2>Yeah. The art me, I knew that I could take,</v>

137
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.170
but can you take it? And so the whole big thing is the whole big thing.

138
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:14.410
My whole thing, my whole, my whole big thing with my,

139
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:19.330
is that what Mike had told somebody say, everybody got a plan till they get hit.

140
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.460
And he was right. Because, you know, if, if you hitting it,

141
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.000
this guy worry about you hitting him and he worry about getting hit. So he,

142
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.240
ain't got to worry about it. Right. But I knew if you hit me,

143
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.313
I'm going to hit you back.

144
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.390
<v 0>And so that was part of the plan was to let him know that early. Right.</v>

145
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.760
It seems like that was when you, when you fought him,

146
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:41.650
particularly in the first round, you pressed him.

147
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.730
And then that was a rare moment to see someone like really pushing Mike back and

148
00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:47.080
getting Mike back on his heels.

149
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.810
<v 2>And are the other game. If, if you like might get you back, that may be it.</v>

150
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.640
Right. Right. So you had to attack him. So the whole big thing,

151
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.350
the whole big thing would mean was if things that my momma said, she said,

152
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.690
let me tell you when you know, when you know how good you are,

153
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.200
when somebody depress you with what you're doing, she said,

154
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.060
Mike load oppress other people with Deakin. He handed the press. My mom said,

155
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.190
do it back to him, do it back.

156
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.790
If you want to see somebody to stop doing something, to do it to them,

157
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.620
all of a sudden they'll stop people. Really. Don't like what you make,

158
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.880
what you do to somebody and somebody do it again. You get ticked, right?

159
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.790
Like that. So the thing was too,

160
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.560
we practice just putting pressure point pressure, point pressure,

161
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.830
make him feel the same way that he make other people feel.

162
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.250
<v 0>So that was the game plan going into the game plan.</v>

163
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.500
Was there anything surprising about that? Fine.

164
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.350
<v 2>Um, not, not to mean,</v>

165
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.740
cause I didn't want no surprise because of the surprise you may get bugged out.

166
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.110
Right? So the thing is it's to stay over him and admit him,

167
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.450
think about all these things.

168
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.920
<v 0>Now, once you stopped them in the first fight, the second fight is the fight.</v>

169
00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:06.560
That's probably the most famous fight. Cause he bit a chunky ear off.

170
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:09.440
And I saw it when you were coming in here, show everybody that well.

171
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.320
<v 1>Did you ever think about getting that fixed? Well, no.</v>

172
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.820
<v 2>And you know, not that's my identification. I ain't got my ID.</v>

173
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.160
I can show him. But yeah.

174
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.480
<v 1>That is.</v>

175
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.700
<v 0>Right. If you want to get into somewhere. Oh, do you know who I am?</v>

176
00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:27.140
Look at my hair. Yeah. That's crazy, man. That was one of the craziest moments.

177
00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:31.160
When mills lane looked at you and you were jumping up in the air and looked at

178
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:35.660
Tyson and realize, holy, he bit a chunk out of your ear.

179
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.840
Right? Like what, what were you thinking at that time?

180
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.570
<v 2>By Nunberg I'm I'm serious. I will get rid of the bike,</v>

181
00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:47.690
the daylights out of him. And I'll going to bite him in the face. I,

182
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.440
everybody face. I wouldn't no wait for the ear. I'm going to get the fats up.

183
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.560
You know? Cause you know, when you're from the ghetto, they say,

184
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.790
if you do something, you gotta do it worse than what they did. And so, you know,

185
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.900
and I told my talk show, I said, no. I said, no,

186
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.320
I will pretended like, like I was hurting real bad,

187
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.950
but I was going to trip you up and bite. You read in your face.

188
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.390
Everybody know what I was going to do. I said, but uh,

189
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.150
this, this prophet told us before the fight, he told me, he said, look,

190
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.620
he going to do something in your face areas that,

191
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.210
but you got to stay focused because if you don't stay focused, God,

192
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:32.780
that's the only way that he going to get you. Right. So by him by email my ear,

193
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.220
when a man and I knew I'll get me to buy him back.

194
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.100
And, and,

195
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.520
but my corner person stuff started telling me and keep my mind on the Lord.

196
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.430
And because the prophet told me,

197
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:50.630
he say only way he can get you to get your mind. He,

198
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.310
he going to do something to you. I thought he to hit me away,

199
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.920
elbow a hip, but anything like that.

200
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:01.810
But I never ever thought in my life he

201
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.730
would bite Monier and find a chunky. And it hurts so bad. And people say,

202
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.820
how bad did it hurt the DTC? I had.

203
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.040
<v 1>Jumped. Oh no, it was crazy. He just leaped up in the air.</v>

204
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.140
<v 2>It hurts so bad. And I said, Dan, I said, Dan,</v>

205
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.930
that guy, my corner guide,

206
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.780
Tim hallmark would kept telling me to keep my mind on the Lord.

207
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.700
And I ain't want to hear that. You know, even though he was saying,

208
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:36.130
and I was man, I was still, I was just trying to remember that, get him,

209
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.070
I want to bite him. I w I,

210
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.650
I really wanted to bite him back.

211
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.330
And all of a sudden I hit my mind that

212
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.430
they always catch the second person. Right.

213
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.920
I'm telling you anything in life.

214
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.770
And I'm the one that people only did something to them.

215
00:12:56.771 --> 00:13:01.510
They will always catch me. And I'm the only one to get, get caught all the time.

216
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:05.950
Cause they all catch me trying to get to get back. So revenge is the Lord.

217
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.810
So you don't go get back cause you going to get caught. Yeah.

218
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.510
<v 0>Well, I was amazed that they didn't stop the fight immediately.</v>

219
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.790
<v 2>When they came back and check and Andy, he asked me, you are Ray.</v>

220
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.990
And I said, yeah, because I least want to hit him. Right.

221
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.500
I really wanted to hit him. I was mad. I was, I was really upset,

222
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.490
but he tried to bite you twice, right? Well, yeah, he bit me twice. He beat you,

223
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.930
but you bit me, when, when we went back in, he thought I was going to be scared.

224
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.090
Then he seen, I caught him with the two shot. Then he bit me again, man.

225
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.270
And I jumped back and I was just getting ready to kick him in a bowl

226
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.500
and in a bail wrong. And I went back to the corner boy and I was so doggone,

227
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.400
man. I was really going to get him and they stopped the fight.

228
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.370
And then I got mad because they stopped the fight.

229
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.210
<v 0>Cause you were going to get him. I wanted to get him back.</v>

230
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.520
Like he thought that you were going to get him.

231
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:05.790
And he was trying to find a way out. Well, yeah,

232
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.830
that's the only thing that made sense. Well.

233
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.670
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

234
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.470
but the thing is only thing that I guess with me

235
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.880
and what I stand on is that I was able to forgive her. And that,

236
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.950
that has been the turnaround in my life to tend to make

237
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:27.360
people, people, all we wonder by the nearby Nazi.

238
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:31.380
But I forgave him. Everybody said, so what's special about dead eyes,

239
00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:36.360
but everywhere I go around the world with the Muslim of

240
00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:40.620
whatever, and people said, wow, this guy can put here.

241
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.270
How can you forgive when you already beaten the guy? Yeah.

242
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.180
But you know, but it's, it's what,

243
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.750
what life has to be if going to survive with even your brothers and

244
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:58.040
sisters. Cause if you don't forgive nobody, you're going to be a mad person.

245
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.850
You're going to find yourself locked up. Right.

246
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.000
<v 0>Right. And it's going to haunt you. Whereas if you forgave him,</v>

247
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.290
it took a weight off your shoulders.

248
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.160
<v 2>I'm telling I'm Mike and I,</v>

249
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.150
we do a lot of things together because that forgive this part.

250
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.680
<v 0>Cool to see you two together now. I mean, when,</v>

251
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:19.540
when I have seen things that you've done together, I'm like, wow, it was crazy.

252
00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:24.070
Like after he beat you, those crazy fights and to see you together,

253
00:15:24.071 --> 00:15:26.980
laughing and joking around together, it's, it's pretty interesting.

254
00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.200
<v 2>Well, I'm telling you, when you tell people, you know,</v>

255
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.590
when you don't choose your parents, you don't choose your neighborhood.

256
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.790
You ain't choose your skin color. You ain't choose to be tall to short,

257
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.440
but you know, this is your statue. And at two people,

258
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.430
two people who came from the ghetto who box and

259
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.720
box was the only thing I did real well. Okay. And football.

260
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.580
But the thing is that after all that look how much money we may

261
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.170
doing something that we, by doing it properly, we made money.

262
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.220
We made money and we can both, you know,

263
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.630
raise our family and the way that we want to raise.

264
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.050
<v 0>Him. How long did it take after the fight before you forgave him?</v>

265
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.540
<v 2>I think at about that time, I,</v>

266
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.640
I got into the locker room and everybody started

267
00:16:21.641 --> 00:16:25.510
complaining, man. I can't believe he did this, this, this, this. I said, Lou,

268
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:30.160
I said, did he bite you? They said, no. Okay. I said he bit me. Right.

269
00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:32.650
And I said, now I'm going to forgive him. And you know what?

270
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.550
Y'all got to forgive him too. Wow. There's a, what it mean forgiven. I mean,

271
00:16:36.551 --> 00:16:36.820
he ain't.

272
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.320
<v 1>Bite you. Cause he been me. I said, look, I'm going to forget it. Wow.</v>

273
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.650
<v 0>Wow. So you forgave him in the locker room right after the fight.</v>

274
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.440
<v 2>Cut. The thing is the thing is I, you know, I was really mad coming,</v>

275
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.350
coming down and people throwing water and people, man.

276
00:16:53.351 --> 00:16:57.130
And they upset because they ain't get a chance to see what they really wanted to

277
00:16:57.131 --> 00:17:00.520
see. Right. Like this. And so they were mad and they were upset.

278
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.080
And I asked me, I figured,

279
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.300
who in control God? So I said, Lord, what is this thing all about it? He said,

280
00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:14.140
forgiven, I want to forgive.

281
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.210
But this is what it is. We we're the two very important people.

282
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:19.361
They,

283
00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:24.170
everybody come to see and they need to know that forgiveness is a big part of

284
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.890
the life. And so I was able to do that.

285
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.110
So in the point of being able to do that, you know, I, I,

286
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:34.900
I realized that it made my life better all over the world.

287
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.930
Kleenex. Yeah, sure. That's.

288
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.040
<v 0>A very powerful thing, man. It really is.</v>

289
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.230
That's a very powerful decision and you know, it's a very powerful statement,

290
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.300
you know, to, for you, to him after that. I mean,

291
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.860
that really probably did a lot of good for a lot of people to realize, man,

292
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:56.371
if a Vander,

293
00:17:56.371 --> 00:18:00.120
Holyfield can forgive Mike Tice after he bit a chunk of his ear off,

294
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.160
I mean, that's a, that's a strong statement of character right there.

295
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.130
<v 2>Well,</v>

296
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:11.120
you're not the thing is I did know a little earlier than

297
00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:13.400
that. Then they may not want to got that.

298
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.033
<v 1>In his face.</v>

299
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.500
<v 2>But, but it's, it's amazing how, what time would do for you,</v>

300
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.820
right? At one point in time, I'm talking to Sam, Sam would have happened,

301
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:31.220
but because they gave me a little time to think about it and gave me an and I

302
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:36.080
was like, and you know, you know, with me when, when things, things don't go,

303
00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:40.910
right. I go back to the prayers, Lord, what is this all about? Right.

304
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.640
And he said forgiveness. And you know,

305
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.050
and I wouldn't be who I am is a Wednesday on forgiveness.

306
00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.100
Everybody don't fell short somewhere. Right. Am I dead? So, you know,

307
00:18:52.101 --> 00:18:57.080
the whole big thing is, and, and I talked to the week,

308
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.130
a week after that, I talked to my, we were, we,

309
00:19:01.131 --> 00:19:05.750
we said all Shaw basketball game and in New York and,

310
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.220
and I looked up and everybody was streaming.

311
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.100
And I wonder what they're streaming about, telling me to watch out.

312
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.810
I'm like watch out for who I looked up or Mike.

313
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.570
And he had the big bow and he liked this.

314
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.510
And so everybody was telling me

315
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.930
and wanted me to Mike Mike there hit a big bear skin coat, whatever,

316
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.290
you know, he had a big fur coat and stuff like that.

317
00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:37.940
And he went through a number of shake hands and, and a week after a week after,

318
00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:41.470
you know what I'm saying? So it was probably still sore. No,

319
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.280
I wasn't even that the thing is with my ear ma is almost like a

320
00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:48.800
testimony. And you know,

321
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.660
it's almost like you win a trophy yourself, there a person looking and said,

322
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:57.800
man, he became the guy. So I see that more people,

323
00:19:57.801 --> 00:20:01.880
when they see me, they look at my ear, then that's they see me. And then he,

324
00:20:01.881 --> 00:20:05.580
I smile. And like I said, not in anger, they smiled and said, well, you know,

325
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.230
he, he became that guy. Wow. So.

326
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.700
<v 0>When you saw Mike, did you guys talk? Yeah. Yeah. A week after the fight. Yeah.</v>

327
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:20.210
<v 2>Matter of fact, his, his room with next door to mine. I didn't know.</v>

328
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.270
We came, we came out, we come out at the same time. He looked, he looked,

329
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.880
he asked me, this is all good. I said, yeah.

330
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.550
So we get on the outer avator together.

331
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.570
And we come down with a door open, everybody was shocked.

332
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.020
They were shocked when the, while we wasn't pipe. Right. I did.

333
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.370
<v 1>I was just you to an elevator. That's just you to an elevator.</v>

334
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.900
And so.

335
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.320
<v 2>I, the shotgun part and they said, man,</v>

336
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.940
and we thought they will be fine. And I told the guys, man, I said,

337
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:58.210
you know how much money I got paid in that fight? How much money can you say?

338
00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.053
We go fight for free.

339
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.860
Was ever talk about a third fight. Yeah. And have people mentioned,

340
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.610
you know, they, they mentioned it. And, but you know, the thing is,

341
00:21:11.611 --> 00:21:14.400
is that they want to give a lot of money and they,

342
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.270
they acid me to try to, and that,

343
00:21:18.271 --> 00:21:22.950
my only thing is that I got to feel like it's kind of a bully for you to

344
00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:26.970
ask somebody, to fight the fight you again,

345
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.250
when you know you're going to win again. I'm you know,

346
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.040
so the whole big thing is, you know, I just didn't, I didn't think they,

347
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:40.020
if Mike is Mike wanted to do it, I would have done it, but I wasn't going to go.

348
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:41.520
I think,

349
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.080
I think you've been a bully when you know you better than somebody and you want

350
00:21:46.081 --> 00:21:48.870
to, you want to play them and something that, you know,

351
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.590
you're going to beat him. Right. Right.

352
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.550
That's a challenge is how about the challenges like that?

353
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.740
I can come back and beat you, but you know, just to just,

354
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.780
you know, you feel that you better.

355
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.740
And so I think it'd be wrong for me to ask it. Right.

356
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.320
<v 0>No, that's, that's amazing. I mean,</v>

357
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.980
but that just shows what kind of a person you are like that shows what kind of

358
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:14.250
character you have and that sort of defines your career,

359
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.330
that you are the guy that did always seek the big challenges.

360
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.250
<v 2>Yeah. I, you know, I, when in this, you know, I,</v>

361
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:27.810
you know, the nickname real deal. And I was like, and people ask me, I,

362
00:22:27.811 --> 00:22:30.660
you get that name, real deal. I said, you know,

363
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.410
I ju I thank God for all the, anything that great.

364
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:39.090
It come from God at all. Given time, you know, I'm, you know,

365
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:43.980
I had a mom who, who had a sixth grade education, but she raised me.

366
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.950
She raised the four time heavyweight champion, the world.

367
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:52.100
She stayed on me all the time. And my brothers and sisters, he said, mommy,

368
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.710
you gonna make a sister to him. You let him go out Julie, up through nothing.

369
00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.540
My momma said, he going to be all right. You just wait and see. And,

370
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.250
and when I think about,

371
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.290
she never did give into what nobody said about,

372
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.080
about me and I became who I am.

373
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.880
And I'm just so I'm just so thankful that in the Bible said,

374
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.850
all good things come and God, anything that is good,

375
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.040
but you came from God.

376
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.750
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
