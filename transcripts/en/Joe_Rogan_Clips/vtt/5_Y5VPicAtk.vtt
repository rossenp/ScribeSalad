00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 1>You think about all this,</v>

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.670
all what we're doing for the Florida shooting and for the shootings and what

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.460
that David hog guy come on, man. That that's,

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.220
what's scary is that people are buying all that stuff, buying all.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.053
<v 2>That stuff.</v>

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.340
<v 1>The whole gun control propaganda, you know, it's so obvious. It's, it's,</v>

8
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:25.680
it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.360
<v 2>The gun control propaganda is.</v>

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.430
<v 1>It's really simple, man. It's like, they've been tr you,</v>

11
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:35.310
you have to disarm the population and that's what they're doing.

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.960
And by buy-ins trying to disarm it, they used to say, they used to say, oh no,

13
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.180
we just want some restrictions. And some background checks.

14
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.830
Now they're just saying it. You know, they.

15
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.190
<v 2>Some people are saying D revoke, the second amendment.</v>

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.570
<v 1>They're tearing the constitution. They're tearing the constitution.</v>

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.430
Those four kids, those four kids.

18
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.410
<v 2>There's a constant. No, they weren't. They weren't, that's not true. No, no.</v>

19
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.880
That's Photoshop. No, it isn't. Yeah. There's original image that,

20
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.580
that girl was tearing. It was like a target. She was saying,

21
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.060
target someone replaced that image with the constitution.

22
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.920
<v 1>But they're essentially doing the same.</v>

23
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.220
<v 2>Thing. Yeah, no, I know what you're saying. That look, first of all, they're 17.</v>

24
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
They were at a school that got shot up. Their friends died.

25
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.940
I get it from their point of view. If I was 17, I would think.

26
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.760
And also they got cameras in their face and everybody's paying attention to

27
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.370
them. And every, the New York times is interviewing on the Washington post.

28
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.050
Everyone's calling them up. If I was them,

29
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.030
I'd probably be doing the same thing you would probably too.

30
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.720
If you were in high school with those kids and all that went down,

31
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.030
I don't blame them by any stretch of the imagination.

32
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.910
I don't even blame people that are trying to revoke the second amendment.

33
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.710
The thing that infuriates me the most is that all people want to look at is the

34
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.480
guns. That's all they want to look at.

35
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.680
You need to look at the mental health of individuals that are willing to shoot

36
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.040
up a group of kids. Like why, why the would someone do that?

37
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.270
Psychiatric medications are a big one that if you bring up people roll their

38
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:55.500
eyes like, oh, this again,

39
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.200
they're massive changes to the chemical composition of your brain.

40
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.280
When you take these things, what you're capable of doing, what bothers you?

41
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.270
What freaks you out?

42
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.870
What you don't give a about when you got all these people that are on an SSRI,

43
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.680
antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication and over and over and over again.

44
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.000
When they test these shooters,

45
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.500
they all test positive for something the pharmaceutical companies do not want to

46
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.280
hear about this. They don't want to talk about this. Phil Hartman,

47
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:26.340
my friend who got shot by his wife, she was on Zoloft.

48
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.960
They got a settlement from Zoloft.

49
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.440
The family got a settlement from Zoloft after she shot him in the head while he

50
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:36.060
was sleeping. This is there's a lot going on. It's not just guns.

51
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.750
It is crazy that that up kid could get guns. It is crazy. Crazy.

52
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.940
The FBI went to his house two years before, but what can you do?

53
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.890
Do you hear about that kid? That they just stopped in China,

54
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.360
the Chinese immigrant kid,

55
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.200
they're sending back that his roommates in college were saying, this guy,

56
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.660
stockpile and guns. The cops went to visit him.

57
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.540
He went and bought another gun and he's talking all kinds of crazy.

58
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.990
And everybody's nervous about him. Like, he's a shooter, wedded,

59
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.950
ready to happen, stop going to class.

60
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.130
And that's how they sent him back because he's on a student visa.

61
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.730
You can't not be in class. This kid was like gearing up.

62
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.810
He was gearing up and maybe, maybe they caught it before it happened.

63
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:17.020
And maybe they wouldn't have like two years ago when they interviewed this, uh,

64
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.160
the kid from Parkland.

65
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.740
<v 1>Now the strangest thing about that Parkland shooting is</v>

66
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.570
the interview. One of the teachers did on ABC.

67
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.370
That's this, this doesn't make any sense to me at all. It's like, uh,

68
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.990
she said, um, I have the video. I could send it to you. It's less than a minute.

69
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.140
She says, why? I opened up,

70
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.470
I heard the sh I heard shots opened up the door. All the kids ran in.

71
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.420
They hid behind their desk. And there, I saw the shooter 20 feet away from me.

72
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.390
But at first I thought he was a policeman. I'm like,

73
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.710
what is the police doing here?

74
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.020
He had full body armor a mask on a helmet on and was shooting.

75
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.780
I was like, what is the cart? What are the cops doing here?

76
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.950
That is the strangest, uh, video I've.

77
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.650
<v 2>Seen because possibly someone shooting at the kid.</v>

78
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.610
<v 1>That's not, when she said, she said she saw the shooter. That's right.</v>

79
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.980
<v 2>But I mean, how long was she watching for, right.</v>

80
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:16.080
If you look looking out the window,

81
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.940
you see someone that's shooting someone or shooting a gun,

82
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:20.470
or even holding a gun. First of all,

83
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.750
you have to realize that people in those traumatic situations,

84
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.600
their memory is very up. It's very shaking.

85
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.710
Your brain is flooded with adrenaline. You remember you're open a suggestion.

86
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.070
People can put things in your head and you all of a sudden think that that was a

87
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:34.210
real memory that you saw.

88
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.290
There's been like scientific studies on that and about suggestive memory and

89
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.740
about someone can literally, especially during periods of great duress,

90
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.730
they can introduce ideas into your head. And you will tell those ideas,

91
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.810
uh, hours later, days later as your own.

92
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.360
And you don't even realize that they put them in your head.

93
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.830
It's real weird memory in traumatic situations like gun

94
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.370
shootouts and like that is haywire because you're on,

95
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.680
you're working on that reptilian part of your brain.

96
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.100
You're down to the lowest level. Like my friend, Steve,

97
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.570
Rinella got attacked by a grizzly bear. He was in a fog neck island.

98
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:12.850
It's a crazy podcast. Him and these other guys,

99
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.940
they had killed an elk and they were packing this elk out.

100
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.030
And they left the elk by the tree while they were at their camp.

101
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.450
Then they went to go back in a Baird claim, the elk and this bear rushed him.

102
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.360
And he was like, one of the ways he described to me, it's like,

103
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:28.450
you have an idea in your head of like, what,

104
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.870
like an animal instinct is like, and he goes, I'm telling you,

105
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:34.210
this goes way deeper than that. This goes, wait,

106
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:37.450
when you really think your life is in danger, you really think it's over.

107
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.830
You don't even exist anymore. You're moving. You have no idea what you're doing.

108
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.760
You're you're you, you have to piece together what happened afterwards.

109
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.660
And you were barely there in the first place. You're just gone. You're gone.

110
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.800
You see somebody outside,

111
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.330
you have no idea who you even are right there.

112
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:56.710
And then all these people they're like,

113
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:01.250
I want run in the building kicked that guy's. You barely even know who you are.

114
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.293
You got this video.

115
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.600
<v 1>I sent you the video, the video that, uh, people.</v>

116
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.330
<v 2>Have to understand memory. Well, let's do it. Listen.</v>

117
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.990
<v 1>To us. And then let's see if she sounds like, let's see.</v>

118
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.823
<v 2>What she says.</v>

119
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.260
<v 1>Now. I actually sent, sent you that the actual clips.</v>

120
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.103
<v 2>This is not it.</v>

121
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.130
<v 1>Didn't I send, I sent you one right on your phone. That's that's the lady.</v>

122
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:30.110
But I don't know when, when she's going to say.

123
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.960
<v 2>Well, let's just play it. Cause we don't hear it. We're not hearing it Jamie.</v>

124
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.573
Okay.

125
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.990
<v 3>Dick writing love letters. When the fire alarm went off,</v>

126
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.430
as students filed into the hallway, she heard gunfire the killing.

127
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.220
<v 4>I was about two feet away from my door.</v>

128
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.800
All of a sudden I heard gunshots in the stairwell,

129
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:50.600
which is about 20 feet away from my room.

130
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.790
And then kids were screaming and then running back towards me and towards the

131
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:56.451
end of the hallway.

132
00:06:56.451 --> 00:07:00.980
So I just went in this very strange autopilot mode where I pivoted on my feet.

133
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.310
I unlocked my door and the kids just start pouring in my room.

134
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:05.450
I don't know how many kids were in there,

135
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:08.540
but I was pulling them and getting them in and shouting at them to get in the

136
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.320
room.

137
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.550
And then I suddenly saw the shooter about 20 feet from me standing at the end of

138
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:17.390
the hallway, actively shooting down the hallway, just a barrage of bullets.

139
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.660
And I'm staring at him thinking, why is the police here?

140
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.910
This is strange because he's in full metal, garb, helmet, face mask,

141
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.790
a Bulletproof armor shooting.

142
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.550
This rifle that I've never seen before.

143
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.050
<v 2>Saw something. Yeah. That's very good.</v>

144
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.760
<v 1>Yeah. There's another video of a girl saying, yeah,</v>

145
00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.860
we heard shots and we're running through the hallway.

146
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.790
And then I run into Nicholas Cruz and I looked at him and I told him, I'm like,

147
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.340
isn't it weird that everyone thought this was going to be you?

148
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.180
And then he just stood there. And then we ran off. Cause we heard more shots.

149
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.610
That's th th it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense.

150
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.300
And that stops. Now those videos get taken down. Those videos get taken.

151
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.210
<v 2>Down videos, not taken down. They've.</v>

152
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.740
<v 1>Been taking them down. When they find them, they take their people,</v>

153
00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:08.910
actively taken down,

154
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.720
witness testimony that doesn't go with the official narrative, man.

155
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.610
<v 2>So you think that this is like a false flag. Like someone shot up.</v>

156
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.330
<v 1>They do it all the time. That's what they do. And then they focus on it.</v>

157
00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:23.700
They got it. They got bad. This Nicholas Cruz guy. And they got all,

158
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:28.200
we got a perfect guy. So they come in, they have a professional team.

159
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.570
They drag a Nicholas crews. They do what they gotta do.

160
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.210
They throw them in there, arrest them and go, we got them.

161
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.790
And then everyone buys it. That's what's going on. Right.

162
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.920
<v 2>But this is a, this is a crazy opinion, right? Because you weren't there.</v>

163
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.920
I'm at the other side of the country. I'm sure.

164
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.510
But every time there's any sort of a mass event, some horrible event,

165
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.790
there's always conspiracies. You know.

166
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.820
<v 1>Because most of these staff they're like, they have, uh,</v>

167
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.920
what was going on right before this was the release of the Pfizer document and

168
00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.754
conspiracy, you know,

169
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.620
and the media was bearing that the fact that document was a document that

170
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.220
Trump released and got zero,

171
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.300
zero air up a play from mainstream media.

172
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.380
And it was a document that, that showed that

173
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.310
a lot of really important people in government from all the agencies

174
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.680
were all colluding together to take down Trump and there's text messages and

175
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.390
emails, they're going back and forth.

176
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:34.410
So they all worked together with Hollywood, with using Hollywood.

177
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.513
So there's this.

178
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.000
So Pfizer document was about to get dropped and everyone was saying, wait, what?

179
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.990
They're they they're backed into a corner. They're going to pull something off.

180
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.300
Watch here it comes. They're going to pull out.

181
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.690
There's going to be a shooting or something. Wait for it. Here it comes.

182
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.820
And then boom. So as soon as it happened,

183
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.310
the reason why conspiracy theorists are gone, that's it.

184
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:55.790
And look at all the mistakes. Look at, look at all that,

185
00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:58.890
the testimony that doesn't make any sense that they're ignoring like that.

186
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.000
Th th the thing that,

187
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.770
the thing that gets me is it there's so many ups in that shooting as a

188
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:08.550
false flag where like all these, these witness tests, the witness testimony,

189
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:10.380
that doesn't make any sense. That to me,

190
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.120
I think they did it on purpose to keep all the conspiracy theorists busy,

191
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.190
because there's so much that's going to clear and to keep, to keep everyone.

192
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.380
<v 2>Away, that doesn't make any sense to keep everybody.</v>

193
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.213
<v 1>Away from the fight.</v>

194
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.930
<v 2>But you know what? It's also possible.</v>

195
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.570
The people that were at that shooting their memories all up,

196
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.020
because there were so many shooting people. That's a real thing.

197
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.670
Like that's a hundred percent.

198
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.620
<v 1>She sound like she didn't know what she was talking about. It didn't.</v>

199
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.130
<v 2>Sound like it then, but that wasn't when the shooting was going down. Yeah.</v>

200
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.120
You got to see people when you see people like right. When they've seen some,

201
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.100
their brains scrambled. Yeah.

202
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.680
That's something that have to take into consideration,

203
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:49.980
especially some nice lady, probably never saw anybody get shot in their life.

204
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.270
Probably never saw much violence.

205
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.720
<v 1>Maybe. I don't know. There's two, there's two sides of it.</v>

206
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:57.240
There's there's people that believe the official story.

207
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.280
And then there's people that see it as, oh,

208
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:03.260
this was the false flag to distract from the Pfizer document.

209
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.550
<v 2>I'm not saying that false flags don't exist. I mean,</v>

210
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:08.640
you and I have was discussed on this podcast in great detail,

211
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.180
the most important false flag, which is operation Northwest. They're willing.

212
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.940
<v 1>To do that. They're willing to do anything. Well, it's.</v>

213
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.960
<v 2>Not that this is also the problem. When we say they operation north,</v>

214
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.460
which was 1962, the question is if that's how they did business back then,

215
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.740
which is what they did. I mean, operation Northwoods,

216
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:30.060
they were planning on attacking Guantanamo bay with a Cuban,

217
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.030
going to arm, Cuban friendlies have them attack Guantanamo bay.

218
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.530
They're going sacrifice American lives.

219
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.560
They were going to blow up a drone jetliner, blame it on the Cubans.

220
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.340
All this was to get us enthusiastic about going to war with Cuba.

221
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.370
They were going to sacrifice American lives. This is a hundred percent.

222
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.110
They were going to lie and think.

223
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.610
<v 1>Which is normal empires for all countries. This is just a normal,</v>

224
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:51.444
false flags are,

225
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.480
it's nothing new it's been going on since the Dawn of time false flags.

226
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.620
<v 2>The question is, and this is for the rational person. Who's like,</v>

227
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:04.150
this is ridiculous. You have to wonder, is that evolved? Right?

228
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:08.710
Everything evolves. The, the, uh, the, the, the way we use technology evolves,

229
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.940
the way we use literature evolves the way we use TV evolve, everything evolves.

230
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.780
Does that evil corruption in government evolve too?

231
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.380
Or does it just somehow or another gets snuffed out because of the light that I

232
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:22.000
don't buy, that I don't buy.

233
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:25.030
That if you look at all the different things that we've shown that there's

234
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:25.900
collusion in,

235
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.890
just look at the fact that someone like Hillary Clinton can run for president

236
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.730
while she was making hundreds of thousands of dollars giving speeches to banks.

237
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.210
Like when she was in that debate with Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders was

238
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.830
like, release his transcripts. Tell us what you said,

239
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.710
tell us what you said to those nice banker people that gave you a half a million

240
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:42.940
dollars or whatever the they gave you.

241
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.360
That's insane to think that someone was like, listen, dude,

242
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:48.670
she is so entertaining.

243
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.500
We're going to give her $250,000 for an hour. It's worth it. Trust me.

244
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:57.280
I know we're in the banking business and I know we make money with money.

245
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.660
You know? I mean, we're all about money.

246
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:00.970
We know the value of money we're in the banking business.

247
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.510
This lady talking is worth a quarter million dollars.

248
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.890
It's the best she's going to go up there. She's going to knock your socks off.

249
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:09.670
So good.

250
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.750
<v 1>She's amazing.</v>

251
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.440
<v 2>She's fun.</v>

252
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.830
<v 1>Funny. She's hilarious. Oh my God. She's amazing.</v>

253
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.680
<v 2>Speech is super well haired.</v>

254
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.910
And she stands up there on the podium and just knocks your Dick into the dirt.

255
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.600
What is this? Hillary Clinton gets humiliating $7,000,

256
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:30.100
less than Snooki for a speech at Rutgers as their story grows old.

257
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.500
Wow. So she got, she got her price slashed at $25,000. I.

258
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.690
<v 1>Think they're going to throw her under the bus. Her standard.</v>

259
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.760
<v 2>Fee was $200,000 per speech,</v>

260
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.250
but some folks suggest that it may be her broken record that set the

261
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:47.860
recent slash price of 25,000.

262
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.240
<v 1>He made so much money off the Claire foundation. She's fine. She's about that.</v>

263
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.820
And she's like, I'll do it for a thousand.

264
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.390
Did I got a hundred million from that Haiti earthquake? Or you get it?

265
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.530
<v 2>Yeah, but those people, people like her,</v>

266
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:02.260
I think one of the things in the back of their head is always the potential

267
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:05.620
litigation. I think they always want to stockpile legal funds.

268
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.300
Cause someone could always come after them.

269
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.270
<v 1>They're like, you know, if you had a hundred million and now you have, you know,</v>

270
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:17.450
75 million, you're like, oh my God, to 50, we got,

271
00:14:17.451 --> 00:14:21.430
I gotta take some odd jobs and, do some speeches in Saudi Arabia.

272
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.450
<v 2>Listen, it should be illegal for someone to run for president.</v>

273
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:29.620
If someone who they could influence in a positive way with passing things and

274
00:14:29.621 --> 00:14:31.960
signing legislature. If, if you know,

275
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.760
pushing things forward using their influence.

276
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.390
If someone is in a position that they could do that for a company and that

277
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:40.390
company wants them giving you $200,000 to talk,

278
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.710
that's just insane. That's insane. That's bribery. That's it.

279
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.730
Are you saying that it's worth $200,000? If she sucked every Dick in the room,

280
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:50.890
it wouldn't be worth $200,000, right?

281
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.990
There's no way who's going to pay a thousand dollars for Hillary Clinton, bro.

282
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:55.310
Job. Other than for the story.

283
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.390
<v 1>I think she didn't get a lot of money for blow jobs. Did I think</v>

284
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:05.630
all right guys, we'll just be on down. Dude. Busting Devin,

285
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.450
boot cockies. You know what I mean? She'll do do a bit cocky.
