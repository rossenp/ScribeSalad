00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.840
<v 2>You know, he became, uh, he was it once for, uh, Stephen King's movie. It,</v>

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.280
he was the it. Oh, oh really? Yeah.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.160
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I'm afraid to watch.</v>

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.360
<v 1>Those. Have you ever seen the, the original, the original TV one, which it was,</v>

6
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.040
it wasn't as scary as the yeah.

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.990
That's Tim Curry as Pennywise and the 1990.

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.670
<v 0>Yeah. I would never watch that. And.</v>

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.390
<v 1>It's, it's a good exam, but it's not.</v>

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.670
<v 0>I like him over there.</v>

11
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.110
<v 1>I know, but that, that one, the TV 1990, it is not that scary.</v>

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910
<v 0>Any of them are scary. My mom used to read the book and she'd have,</v>

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.060
it was like this thick and we would always tease her. Like you finish it yet.

14
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.620
Like how, what is that about? Like, it just, we didn't understand it.

15
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.860
And then the movie came out and we were like, yeah, we're not watching that.

16
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.900
<v 1>I used to have to take, uh, the tea from my house to, uh, Boston.</v>

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.140
I lived in Newton and I'd take it to Boston when I was a teenager. Okay. And,

18
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.900
uh, what do you mean thet? The T it was like, uh,

19
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.010
the Boston version of the transit system.

20
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.970
<v 0>Oh, oh, the tea. Jesus, Joe. That's what they call it. I drink ice tea.</v>

21
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.010
I'm literally like what? The Boston tea party. Sorry. Where are we going? Sorry.

22
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.090
<v 1>I thought like.</v>

23
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.570
<v 0>You know, okay. I'm sorry. We have the L so I would read.</v>

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.970
<v 1>Sorry, we have the L yeah, Stephen King books. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

25
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.210
And I read like, basically every Stephen King book from like

26
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.240
lawn man. I like some of the short stories, my, all the Richard Bachman books,

27
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.240
I read all of them, but it was one of the weirdest ones. It it's a weird, yeah.

28
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.910
It's like.

29
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.760
<v 0>It's giant. It's like, what is going on? It's a weapon for you on the.</v>

30
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.400
<v 1>Team. What's going on in your head, man. Wow. What's going on in your head.</v>

31
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:41.560
You're inventing this. He's frightening clown. That eats kids.

32
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.630
<v 0>Whew. Yeah. If you look into that, would that,</v>

33
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.110
I don't know. That's.

34
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.150
<v 1>Scary. Stephen King had so many books like that. Didn't.</v>

35
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.950
<v 0>He have a lot of trauma around him, for sure. Well.</v>

36
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.950
<v 1>You know, he grew up in Maine. It's hard living up there. Okay.</v>

37
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.390
And he grew up poor, you know, you know, he didn't have any money. Like he,

38
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.380
I I'm, I've read, um, uh, Stephen King on writing.

39
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.020
It's an amazing book cuz it tells you, uh,

40
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.380
not just how he writes and what he thinks about writing,

41
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.460
but also it tells you about like sort of the history of his career and how

42
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:19.980
difficult it was. And, and when he sold, I think it was care.

43
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.060
It's been a while since I read the book,

44
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.690
but I think Carrie was like the first big sale that he had. I think it was. And,

45
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.290
and all of a sudden he was wealthy and,

46
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.690
and the fact that they were trying to like look at the numbers and they thought

47
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.890
the numbers were wrong and the first check they got like what is happening? Oh,

48
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.410
wow. Yeah. It's a crazy story because you know, he was struggling.

49
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.840
He was teaching and he was writing these books and you.

50
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.760
<v 0>Know, that's how writers do they struggle like that, but then you strike gold.</v>

51
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.600
Like he did. Carrie was great with the dirty pillows. So funny.

52
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.480
Did you ever &lt;laugh&gt; he, I read when she went to the prom and her boobs were at,

53
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:02.440
why do you have your dirty pillows out? Dirty pillows? The.

54
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.680
That's.

55
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.840
<v 1>One of those things that it's almost better if you just read it.</v>

56
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.160
I used to think that was a stupid idea. Yeah.

57
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.840
But the there's a way that he describes things in the book.

58
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.000
So that's open to the, my mom.

59
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.280
<v 0>Says the same thing. She's like, oh, this whole scene lacks because blah blah.</v>

60
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.270
You know? And I'm like, whatever lady.

61
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.550
<v 1>Not reading. It's it's like,</v>

62
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.390
if someone could capture it all visually that's better. Right.

63
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.190
But can they capture why get lost visually the way that we, I don't know.

64
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.263
I think it's, uh,

65
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.630
there's certain things it's like the way a writer writes,

66
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:40.620
like a guy like Stephen King, like you feel, feel the,

67
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.420
you have access to the thoughts that these, uh, characters have.

68
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.500
Right? You have access to everything.

69
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you have access to not just like their actions and how it

70
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:54.340
plays out and you can't even actually see it. So you have to imagine it,

71
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:55.980
which sort of stimulates your imagination.

72
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.220
But you're also getting access to their very thoughts. Right?

73
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.090
Because weird parts of writing that like are almost more

74
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.730
descriptive than seeing it cuz when you're seeing it and hearing it, it's like,

75
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:08.570
it's pretty cool. Right.

76
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.610
You watching a great movie with great effects and and you're seeing it and

77
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:13.930
hearing it. It's cool. But when you're reading it,

78
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:17.130
there's a weird thing that's happening where you're you have to fill in the

79
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.730
blank and it stimulates your mind in a different way.

80
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.880
&lt;affirmative&gt; and Stephen King was the master of that. Yeah. And it's like,

81
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:27.400
when, if you read his and then you watch his movies,

82
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:31.440
you're like the movies are like, he made some, amazing movies.

83
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.560
No doubt about it. Like Carrie freaked me out.

84
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.800
<v 0>To me. Carrie was detailed enough. But if I was reading the book,</v>

85
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480
I probably would never sleep. I think.

86
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.390
<v 1>That was a movie. That was a book rather. He doesn't remember writing. I'm.</v>

87
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.270
<v 0>Pretty sure. I'm pretty sure. Was he on Adderall? No, he was sorry.</v>

88
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.550
<v 1>That's was cop up. And he was doing, he was drinking like crazy.</v>

89
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.070
I think that was one of the ones. I think it was Carrie and maybe uh, Christine.

90
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.763
Oh, Christine's great.

91
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.340
Maybe it was CJO maybe the C word a C I think it was Cujo.

92
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.380
I think it, he got stuck on seas. I think I got stuck on a sea dude,

93
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.700
but there are so many good books man. But uh, I think it was Cujo. I think Cujo,

94
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.580
he wrote when he was so high and so up.

95
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.140
He literally just doesn't remember writing.

96
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.980
<v 0>It. It is funny just to get stuck on a letter.</v>

97
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.860
<v 1>I'm listen, I'm not a, I'm.</v>

98
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.730
<v 0>Not the person. What could we call this? What could we call.</v>

99
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.330
<v 1>The dog? There it is. Stephen King discusses Cujo in on writing,</v>

100
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.730
referring to as a novel. He barely remembers writing at all. That's it?

101
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:30.440
There it is.

102
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.530
King wrote the book during the height of a struggle with alcohol addiction or

103
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.810
killing it. Right. Can you decide to say he likes the book?

104
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.883
The movie was and wishes.

105
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.640
He could remember enjoying the good parts as put them on the page. Wow.

106
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.440
It's a great book though.

107
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.840
<v 0>That's what its amazing reading. That book I think would be insanely crazy.</v>

108
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.680
Cuz like even watching the Mo you get frustrated, you're like, do this, do that.

109
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.600
You know? Like the movie's not good. No. Yeah. It's not good. It's not the best.

110
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.480
But you're like, why didn't they just do this? Or why didn't they do this?

111
00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:05.200
But maybe in the book, it, it had more tension.

112
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.801
<v 1>Or something.</v>

113
00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:10.400
What I was gonna say is the movie's not good at expressing the layers and layers

114
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.400
of fear and recognition that this dog who was your lovable pet is now

115
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:19.230
gonna kill you. Yeah. The, the it's it's too hard to do.

116
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.990
It's too hard to do in a movie. It's it's too hard to do.

117
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.190
It takes too much time. If you're reading a book, it's like what's,

118
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.350
what's the average amount of time it takes to read a,

119
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.870
a book like CJO like how many pages is CJO I'm gonna say,

120
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.590
let me guess 396 pages.

121
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.900
<v 0>309. Really. Oh maybe I'm.</v>

122
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.060
<v 1>I was off by a hundred. It's terrible percent off.</v>

123
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.260
&lt;laugh&gt; I knew I would get into the three to be honest nine. It wasn't bad.

124
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.780
<v 0>I was thinking higher. I was thinking like five be I don't know why,</v>

125
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.300
but I was thinking it was way higher. Well then.

126
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.300
<v 1>You get into like the stand, right.</v>

127
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.130
<v 0>But because I'm thinking of all those books on my mom's sh like they're, the.</v>

128
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.090
<v 1>Stand is really long. How long is the stand? Have you ever read that?</v>

129
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.290
I've never finished that. I'm not a big reader. I've read quite a bit of it.

130
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.183
And then I bail.

131
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.490
<v 0>Yeah. I don't eight hundred and twenty three, eight hundred and twenty.</v>

132
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.410
That's what I'm saying? The uncut version. So 300 more pages. Holy.

133
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.880
<v 1>You know what got me into reading though. Like that kind of story.</v>

134
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:24.680
That style book is the Hobbit. My mom or my stepdad.

135
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.840
I can't remember which one gave me the Hobbit in like the seventies. Okay.

136
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.680
And I read that and I was like, whoa, what a crazy book.

137
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.080
And then there was a movie,

138
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.440
there was like a Hobbit animated movie that came out in like the late set.

139
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.350
It's like whack old school animation.

140
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.270
We can tell people were drawing it &lt;laugh&gt;.

141
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.190
<v 0>You can see their hands. Yeah. You're like, why are we.</v>

142
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.750
<v 1>That's what got me into those kind of books though.</v>

143
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.670
<v 0>But it, I remember going through puberty,</v>

144
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:53.950
my mom gave me little women and I was like, is there a movie?

145
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.230
Is there I can't little women? Yeah. I think I did read little women.

146
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.540
There was like a box set or something. Well, when I.

147
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.900
<v 1>Was a kid, when I was stuck on the train all the time, headed into the city,</v>

148
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.100
there's no phones. You didn't have a phone.

149
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.660
So you had to read a book mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, there was no other options.

150
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.740
So it was like, for me, it was always like either Stephen King or,

151
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.890
