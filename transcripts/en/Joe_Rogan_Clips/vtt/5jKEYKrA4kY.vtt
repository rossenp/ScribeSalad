<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 2>Here's what freaked me out. And it didn't seem to bother a lot of people.</v>

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.520
The Biden administration,

4
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:13.050
the Biden administration blocked the release of the JFK papers.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.330
JFK was shot in 1963. How weird is that? They're like, Nope,

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.620
people are still alive. The pick, some people that would be are still alive.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.240
What that tells me the government killed some shady gone.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.520
That's what that tells me that doesn't tell me that the,

9
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.300
the mafia killed Kennedy or the Russians killed Kenny or the Cubans killed

10
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:37.500
Kennedy. That tells me the government probably had that

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.230
something. Yeah, they're hiding something.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.260
It's 1963. That happened four years before I was born.

13
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:50.940
It's 58 years ago. And still got to still hide it. Not yet.

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.920
Not yet. God yet. Hold it. Wait another 25 years. Unbelievable.

15
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.470
It's crazy that they could even justify that,

16
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.670
that someone could keep historical information.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.620
<v 0>That's relevant to our understanding of how the country really functioned</v>

18
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:08.730
in 1963.

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.410
They keep that from us because it must be relevant to how the country still

20
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:17.790
functions today. It must, it must have some bearing president being killed.

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.200
Yeah. And we can't know all there is to know about it. Right? What do you know?

22
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.030
You? I, yeah.

23
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.930
I want to know that more than I want to know about UFO's I wanna know.

24
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.010
What did you do? Yeah. What the did you do? Alan specter?

25
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.090
I don't even know who that is. Arlen specter. Um,

26
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.400
he was one of the people that were on both of them. Both of them.

27
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.710
He was one of the guys that was on the Warren commission report.

28
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:45.570
I think it was his idea for the, uh, believe, see if this is right.

29
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.560
I think he's the guy who came up with the idea for the single bullet theory,

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.880
which is the dumbest theory in the like you're a guy who's shot a lot of rifles.

31
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.870
When bullets hit bones, they get up. Oh yeah.

32
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.340
That bullet was pristine. And they found it in the gurney. Oh,

33
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.270
look magic on Connolly gun, governor, Texas Connolly's gurney.

34
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:10.980
They found this a magic bullet that they think did all the damage to Kennedy.

35
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:12.690
And to him went through two people,

36
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.370
broke bones and it was not mushroom doubt or anything. Not even a little.

37
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.380
You never seen it. I haven't. Oh,

38
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:22.260
you're in for a treat generally credited to him. That's what it says.

39
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.930
What's that generally credit to him is what this says.

40
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.840
I was trying to find Arlen specter, Arlen, specters, the guy.

41
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.350
He was a creep during the Bush administration. I remember like listening to him,

42
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.071
talk on TV.

43
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:34.620
And then when I found out that he was a part of the Warren commission that

44
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:38.190
actually came up with the single bullet there, I was like, oh,

45
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.020
so look at that bullet. That's it exactly like as a hunter?

46
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.350
Yeah. As a guy, who's shot bullets. When you look at that, you're like,

47
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:50.910
there is no way. And I've had arguments with people say actually,

48
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.980
that's a, that's not a good photo. If you look at it from another angle,

49
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.700
you know, you could see that it has some distortion. I'm like the up. Every.

50
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.540
<v 1>Bullet I've ever seen, that's been in an animal is mushrooms. Just,</v>

51
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.110
that's how they perform. They mushroom out. And there's a,

52
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.910
there's a fine line between basically coming apart where the damage would

53
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.110
be dissipated or, and in mushroom. Perfect.

54
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.430
None of them look like this though.

55
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.530
<v 0>Yeah. There's other photos of it where it shows that it's slightly distorted.</v>

56
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.731
Right.

57
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.000
But the re like there there's a good that somebody actually tried to say that to

58
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.610
be no, no, no. You should look at it from this angle. I was like, I'm like,

59
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.010
you don't know anything about guns.

60
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.220
You need to shut your mouth because that's something that was shot into a

61
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:40.750
swimming pool. That's what happened there. So that's what that looks like. Well,

62
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.960
look.

63
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.810
<v 1>At that. They're even worse. That was one of.</v>

64
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.260
<v 0>The bullets. So that must be one of the bullets, but that's possible.</v>

65
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.230
That's possible. But yeah, like modern bolt.

66
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:53.110
But another thing we have to think of is maybe modern technology.

67
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.960
The bullets that we have is better than the bullets they had back then,

68
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.820
but either way, there's no way here. It goes.

69
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.230
Every bullet shows signs of damage, uh, exerting force,

70
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:09.520
breaking bones, damage to the initial shooting except the magic bullet.

71
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.470
Yeah. There's no way. And they had to come up. Here's the thing about the,

72
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.050
this is the thing about the theory, by the way,

73
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.940
I have lost months of my life studying the JFK assassination.

74
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.841
I really have,

75
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:27.190
I've spent so much time reading books on the JFC JFK assassination,

76
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.560
but one of the reasons why they had to come up with this theory that this one

77
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.370
bullet did so much damage is they had to account for three gunshots.

78
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.680
And once they found out that a bullet had hit an underpass and

79
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:45.370
it had chipped the kerbstone and ricocheted up and hit this guy.

80
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.720
So the guy had to be treated at the hospital for a ricochet from the gunshot.

81
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.860
So they knew that that was one bullet that did not hit Kennedy.

82
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.020
It hit the curbs. So there's two.

83
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.770
And so one bullet blows a hole through Kennedy's head.

84
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.920
And so they had to come up with another bullet that went through his,

85
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.180
they went through his back and went into Connolly through his wrist.

86
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.870
I believe it wound up in his thigh. Yeah. This is how they,

87
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.100
they think the bullet went, which is just, and people say, no, no,

88
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:19.810
you have to take into account. The Kennedy was in an elevated position. Listen,

89
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:22.840
bullets do wacky things. When they go into animals.

90
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.150
And I was talking to a guy once that told me in the war that they

91
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:33.130
shot a guy in the head and the bullet came out of his eye going

92
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:37.990
forward. Like it ricocheted off the back of his skull and can't yeah.

93
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:38.824
He goes,

94
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.180
bullets do wild things when they hit bones and ricochet off stuff,

95
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.600
but they don't take turns. Now they don't take turns like that.

96
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.230
There's a reason why the bullet would ricochet inside someone's head and then

97
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:53.980
come out. Like the initial impact is slightly slowed down.

98
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:56.630
It bounces off the back of the skull and then comes out like,

99
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.240
you're probably clip the eyebrow or something coming in.

100
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.720
But either way they don't come out looking like that. No,

101
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.650
not after they did all that. And there was more damage.

102
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.760
There's more rather fragments inside Connolly's body,

103
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.110
more bullet fragments.

104
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:16.010
They found in colony Connolly's risk that were missing from the bullet that it

105
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.290
should have immediately discounted that bullet and said,

106
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.900
who gave you this bullet? Who the are you?

107
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.600
Where's this bullet come from for real, you're under arrest.

108
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.160
You're under arrest because I want to know where he got this bullet. And like,

109
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.610
you're, you're going to start talking. Why can't we see that information? Yeah.

110
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.380
That's in there. Yeah. Watch the entire episode for free. Only on Spotify.
