00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>But, but I was like, you know what, I'm going to burning, man.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.230
I'm going to try acid. I went with my buddy. It was my college roommate.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.220
Neither of us had done it before a guy had given it to us who I was like,

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.110
I've done this asset. I know how to do it. He's like,

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.820
I recommend even taking the Summit's acid and listening to classical music and

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:21.420
eating fruit. That was his. And I was like, all right. I was like,

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.750
I like classical music and eat fruit. And I was like,

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.410
I like classical music and I like fruit. So that was something I was like,

9
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:29.940
this sounds great. I was like,

10
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:33.300
so we're out in the desert and we eat it on our last day.

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.070
And have you been to burning man? No, I thought it was,

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.760
I was kind of blown away. I found it I've I enjoyed it very,

13
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:45.960
very much weird. I mean, it's like, but it's, I don't know.

14
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:50.100
It was like people executing, whatever they're doing incredibly well,

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.670
and there's a lot of different versions of it and stuff, but it's kind of, um,

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.860
there's a lot of pranksters there. Like there's,

17
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.500
it's actually not as like there's a hippy dippy quality to it,

18
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.790
but then there's some real people kind of with people in a fun way that I got a

19
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:07.260
kick out of, but we took the took acid at like, I dunno four,

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.530
and we start, we're driving around the desert, you know, you're,

21
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:12.870
everyone's on bikes. You're just on a bike driving around.

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.030
Did you have to wear a mask? No, the, the dust was fine. It was cool. And like,

23
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:22.950
we start kind of feeling it and it, I I've had visuals on mushrooms before,

24
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.570
but this all of a sudden, like the meltedness of everything started to set in.

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.470
And the, have you done the acid in the desert before? No, never in the desert.

26
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.910
It's a, it's a good, good place. It's a good place for it.

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.690
Just cause like visually what's happening is like, um,

28
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.880
is pretty interesting. Like we went,

29
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.350
we were driving around on bikes and we see these immediately then like some

30
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100
couple is like, can you take a picture of us as we, um,

31
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.210
like try to do a duo yoga pose with the sunset. I'm like,

32
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.350
okay, I'm trying to deal with my camera. You know what I mean? And you're like,

33
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.340
okay. I think, I, I think this is what you want, you know?

34
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.700
And then we drive away from there and there are these like porn stars who were

35
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.880
wanting pictures of that or taking pictures of themselves. And I was like,

36
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.340
we're like, you know, we're in the burning man spirit of like,

37
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.600
well give them the gift of our music. And like, they don't want, they're not,

38
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.640
they don't want, I'm not even hitting nothing. I'm just like,

39
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.370
literally like driving around. We've got our little, like, you know,

40
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.220
our little Bluetooth speaker playing classical music and they,

41
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.200
they don't give a. They don't want any of it.

42
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.570
And then we go and sit and we're just now starting to peak

43
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.890
right. At sunset in the desert. And it's like,

44
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.490
it was, it was like, oh, this feels like a,

45
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.070
some version of what heaven feels like, you know,

46
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:45.750
like where the sky that the colors in the sky are unbelievable. And,

47
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.350
and the, all of a sudden, all the desert, all the sand, you know,

48
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:53.220
this it's like this real fine alkaline dust. And it's like,

49
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.730
you feel like you're seeing some real like grid work, you know?

50
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.070
I don't know if you have that feeling where you're like, oh,

51
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.250
I can feel like I'm seeing some underlying dynamics of the

52
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.450
structural stuff.

53
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.780
<v 1>I've seen them on mushrooms. Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.650
Where it feels like you're witness to the pattern

55
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.970
of things. Like there's some sort of yeah. The structure of things. Yeah.

56
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.790
<v 0>Yeah. And that's what it felt like you were like, you're looking at this,</v>

57
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.790
like this crazy, you know, and you've got, yeah. So you're, you're seeing the,

58
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.963
the sand,

59
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.710
this very fine light sand with the really red mountains and then the blue,

60
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.930
really Chris blue sky with, with, uh, the, the white clouds on.

61
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.130
And it felt like you were like, oh, I'm seeing some structural that's going on.

62
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:43.090
It's it was quite, and we're listening to this guy, Eric cities,

63
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:47.410
like a classical musician and eating cherries, really like,

64
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.693
this is pretty sweet.

65
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.180
<v 1>That was, that's cool that you've followed it to a T you went with a fruit and.</v>

66
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.800
<v 0>Why not? Let's just have it, you know, why not? And I think classical music is,</v>

67
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.740
but it was interesting. Cause I, I didn't. So then,

68
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.240
so then the sun sets and it's like, what? Even at the height of it,

69
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.530
it didn't feel warm. Like mushrooms have felt,

70
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.360
it felt like co clinical clinical.

71
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:14.530
Exactly. That's exactly.

72
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.630
<v 1>I don't have to worry about that.</v>

73
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.880
It's very interesting that you said you took it riding bikes too.

74
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.520
Cause that's in a lot of ways in homage to Albert Hoffman,

75
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.820
that's how he found out about it. You know,

76
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:27.790
he synthesized LSD and, you know,

77
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:32.530
got it in his skin when he was working with it and then rode his bike home

78
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.150
and on the bike ride home realized, oh my God, whoa,

79
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.490
tripping balls here. Yeah.

80
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.220
<v 0>Without even knowing what tripping was. I mean, he,</v>

81
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.990
he knew something was going on.

82
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.220
<v 1>I mean, he may, I believe correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

83
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.780
but I believe the initial reason for creating

84
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.870
LSD, I think they were,

85
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.470
they were trying to come up with a drug to induce labor.

86
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.930
I'm pretty sure that was the original, I think that's what they were working on.

87
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.700
And in the process,

88
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:11.650
synthesized LSD and LSD as a compound.

89
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.020
And it's one of those unbelievably potent

90
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.330
compounds where someone, I think it was Terrence,

91
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:24.010
we kind of described it as the power to weight ratio is so

92
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.200
huge that it's like,

93
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:31.150
if you had one aunt that dismantled the statue of Liberty in 30 minutes,

94
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.890
like that's how, that's how potent LSD is.

95
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.230
<v 0>Well, I mean, I took it.</v>

96
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.730
<v 1>Actually to the empire state building.</v>

97
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.650
<v 0>I took a, I mean I T I took, uh, a responsible amount. Like I was like,</v>

98
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:45.730
I don't need to like lose it.

99
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.870
<v 1>In my mind here. I've only microdosed it I've only, well, one,</v>

100
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.860
one time I'd doubled the mic still. It was a small dose,

101
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.530
but it was enough to just say like, okay, here it is.

102
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.840
I had the synthesis of the compound with the intention of obtaining a

103
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.310
circulatory and respiratory stimulant Hoffman wrote the new substance. However,

104
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:07.040
arose, no special interest in our pharmacologics,

105
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.810
pharmacologists and physicians testing was therefore discontinued. Huh?

106
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.180
Hm. Why did I think

107
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.840
I said 25th attempt aptly named LSD 25. Not.

108
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.020
<v 0>Knowing he was not after like a psychedelic drug. No.</v>

109
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.853
<v 1>I don't believe.</v>

110
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.500
<v 0>Dosed at 4:20 PM. Y'all look at it. Look at it, go down. Look at that. Go down.</v>

111
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.800
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

112
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.980
<v 0>Yeah. He dosed himself at four 20.</v>

113
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.350
<v 1>And it was most intense from six to 8:00 PM.</v>

114
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.810
During that time he rode home on his bicycle. Fine.

115
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.200
<v 0>It's the best. It feels great. So, so we, we,</v>

116
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.280
we sort of are peaking around sunset and it's like,

117
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.440
it feels like I'm with my buddy of 20 years, I've known him since college,

118
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.380
we've gone through our lives together. And there's a thing when you eat,

119
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.580
when you trip where you're like that space-time continuum thing. There's like,

120
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:03.470
it feels less linear time where you're like,

121
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.010
I'm having thoughts that I had 20 years ago and I'm having them today.

122
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:10.040
And I'm going to have them in 20 years in like where this,

123
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:13.040
the linear nature of all of this feels a little less, you know,

124
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.010
and I'm with my buddy has been like a witness to my life, you know?

125
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.480
So we're having this great large conversation about our lives and all that and

126
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:24.710
the sun setting. It's beautiful. And then it gets dark and it's like,

127
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.140
all right, let's go watch the man burn. Now. Like, you know that at burning man,

128
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:32.810
everybody gathered 70,000 people gather,

129
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.340
you'd go to this big central area where the man who's been sitting there for

130
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:41.480
seven days is then there's like a crazy fire starter show

131
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.830
fireworks, go off.

132
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.810
And then you burn this like 30 foot man and it's dark and

133
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:50.660
it's night. And, and it's like,

134
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.140
it was the other side. It felt like heaven and hell, you know,

135
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.670
like where you're all of a sudden. And that's where I felt like it was weird.

136
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.130
Cause like that's where I felt the clinical thing where I'm like,

137
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.930
I feel sort of high, but I now feel actually quite in a weird way,

138
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.760
quite sober. And I'm,

139
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.350
I felt like I'm witnessing these things and I feel removed from them in a way

140
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:17.120
that when you're, I feel like when you're on mushrooms in some way,

141
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:22.100
you're like you feel kind of inside of the, the flow of, of, uh,

142
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.280
of nature. And, but I was also like,

143
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.770
it's the end by the time of the end of burning man.

144
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.710
Like there are people there all week and building it and putting all this stuff

145
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:32.870
together and artists that's interesting. And then like,

146
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.390
there is definitely a section of burning man,

147
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:40.270
which is just like super wealthy people showing up for like [inaudible]

148
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.750
and like to be around models who are nearly naked. And it's like,

149
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.710
and that's when,

150
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.480
and you look around and the aesthetic of burning man is like somewhere between

151
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.250
like, um, mad max game of Thrones and Tron.

152
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.390
It's somewhere in that space, which is rad.

153
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.860
But then when you're kind of on acid and you're kind of looking around and I had

154
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.120
this feeling of like, Ugh, the rich are here to collect their spoils.

155
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.900
You know what I mean? Like these.

156
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.180
<v 1>Do you think that having the great experience of seeing the sky and the,</v>

157
00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:21.390
the desert and all, all the beauty and where you're like, wow, this is amazing.

158
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.900
And then when you have something like a fire and then on top of that,

159
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:27.660
you have a giant group of people, it seemed,

160
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.450
and then you realize there's not really a lot of law enforcement here.

161
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:32.160
Like this seems like it could be completely chaotic.

162
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.610
<v 0>Yeah. It's and it is like, the fire itself is protected.</v>

163
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.050
Cause I think someone ran into the fire last year. Yeah, yeah. killed himself.

164
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.930
Jim ran right into that fire this year was like,

165
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.630
this year was pretty well regulated. Like,

166
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.740
cause we had seen a couple of nights before at sunrise, there was like,

167
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:52.020
you know, they have all this. It's what I found too.

168
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:54.600
It was like the kind of the duality of it all.

169
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.080
Like Bernie man feels very much like there's this like sacred and profane all

170
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:01.320
happening together. And it's oftentimes pretty cool.

171
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.310
And like sunrise, a couple of mornings earlier,

172
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.260
there's this like 20 foot wooden dragon fly statue that someone had

173
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:14.100
built and they are, they light it on fire, you know, they're just like,

174
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:17.430
now we're going to burn it. Like some dude had spent a year making this statue.

175
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.280
It's like, now we're going to burn it. And so there,

176
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.110
there were park Rangers all around it. And so there's no getting inside,

177
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.210
they laid it on fire and then the sun rises over to the left and then you looked

178
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.120
up, I looked up and there were like 30 people parachuting out of the sky

179
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.770
at sunrise. And you're just like, what the is going on? But it was man.

180
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.310
It was really cool. I really, I enjoyed that.

181
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.090
But by the time Saturday rolled around, you know,

182
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:49.500
there is something about fire that's very primal and you can feel like there's

183
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:54.030
like, there's some pagan quality to it all. And it's cool, but it's like,

184
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.950
you could feel like everybody's like energy kind of getting like a little

185
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:03.630
darker and more primal. And, and I hit a point where I was like, all right guys,

186
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:07.950
I gotta, I gotta get out of this, like 75. And I also had a fear of like,

187
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.600
I wasn't scared of the fire. I was scared of like, I was seated watching.

188
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:13.920
And I was like, I'm scared of a tremor.

189
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.031
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:19.410
That's what I mean by like the giant group of people and then also with a fire

191
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.850
and, and then a gathering when, when you're dealing with a big gathering,

192
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.100
there's always the potential for someone acting out,

193
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.660
whether they just need a lot of attention or they go crazy or

194
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.330
I mean, think about adverse reactions to psychedelics. Yes. And 70,000 people,

195
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:39.330
the potential for something going haywire is pretty high.

196
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.740
<v 0>Well,</v>

197
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.010
what I found interesting over the whole week was cause I was pretty skeptical.

198
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:45.990
I didn't go in, I went in being like,

199
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.530
I want to experience this thing that a lot of people have experienced.

200
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:52.830
I just want to like, know what that experience is. Um,

201
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.330
but what I've found fascinating is there's,

202
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.480
there's some law enforcement around there, some Rangers around,

203
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.610
but there's really no, it's pretty, anarchical like, there's really very little,

204
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.670
but in is in so much,

205
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.530
there's actually like some unspoken rules that basically everybody's kind of

206
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.770
following, which I found kind of fascinating where you're like,

207
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:16.390
there's no everybody's on bikes.

208
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.400
There are crazy art cars running around with like shooting fire into the

209
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:25.690
air. There's no, there seems to be no like regulatory board being like,

210
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.340
let me make sure that the,

211
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.130
your crazy 30 foot three tiered iron car is

212
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:37.810
up to. Yeah. There seems to be very little of that.

213
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.190
And yet it all seems to function pretty smoothly.

214
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.000
Like there's like some unspoken acceptance of certain rules.

215
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:48.550
I'm sure there are people freaking out. I know there are people like,

216
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.790
but it's mostly people like being like I took too much drugs and I didn't

217
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.490
hydrate. And like, they go to the medic and there,

218
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:58.720
but like weirdly I found it all operating pretty smoothly.

219
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.470
Uh, but that's when the, the, uh,

220
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.450
the acid then sort of turned a bit where I was like, this is,

221
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.630
there's some darkness here that I want to get away from.

222
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.850
<v 1>It seems like whenever you have a situation where you've got a bunch of people</v>

223
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:18.670
that want to do something outside the norm,

224
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.970
they want to get together and they want to experience something. That's just,

225
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.010
they're bored of society and this is their big break. And it seems like there's,

226
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.960
there's so much expectations and there's kind of a code that these people want

227
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.810
to follow. And that code is that, you know,

228
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.380
it's almost like a utopian vision of a better society,

229
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.210
even if it's for only a week or so. Yeah.

230
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.080
<v 0>And I think it works for a week. Like, I don't know if society,</v>

231
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.470
I don't know how a society would function in like largely lawless.

232
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.490
I mean the biggest rules are like, don't put your trash anywhere.

233
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.160
Like there's no garbage cans anywhere don't pee outside,

234
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.330
like pee in a porta-potty pee in a jug, take it back, dump it out.

235
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.460
Cause there's like, no mark, no leave. No, no mark. And it works,

236
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.740
but I guess it, it works for a week where you're like,

237
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:10.120
everybody's agreed for that week. And then you go back to your life. But like,

238
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.400
I don't know, it was, I got a kick out of it. Like there's and there's,

239
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.470
you know, there's like we there's one night, you know,

240
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.050
there are all these crazy light shows at night. It,

241
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.420
it becomes like this crazy Tron,

242
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:27.010
like light show everywhere you look at the horizon for as far as you can

243
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:31.180
see is just like people on bikes that are all lit up crazy art cars,

244
00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:34.180
crazy pieces of art that are lit up. Um,

245
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.830
and it's really wild, but like you go, you know, you ride around bikes in there.

246
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:41.140
All of a sudden we like roll up to this area where there's a,

247
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.430
like a mechanical arm holding these lights that are, um,

248
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.260
led lights that are in the S you know, in a circle and you lie below it.

249
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.990
And it's like a light, you know, but it's this like vortex light show.

250
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.470
So everybody's kind of looking up at it and it's really trippy and fun.

251
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:00.880
And your parents, I was like, whoa, it's a trippy. And I, we, I laid down,

252
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.330
I was like, this is rad. And then this dude rolls up. My friend sees us,

253
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.890
you know, those costumes of like, um, uh, those like Tyrannosaurus Rex,

254
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:12.890
like that they're inflated. And it kind of her like, you know,

255
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:16.910
you see like dudes like walk around. They're like individual size things,

256
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:18.680
but they're like, it's super weird.

257
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.840
So I look at this guy and I start cracking up and my buddy just took that

258
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.400
Tyrannosaurus Rex and walked him through the middle of everybody,

259
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:30.470
having their quiet trippy moment. You know?

260
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:33.090
So like this trend is her expression just kind of rolls through it.

261
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:38.030
And he's just like, Hey, you know, and he's just like, he was here before you,

262
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:40.880
you know? And so it's kind of fun. It's just like,

263
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.190
everybody's like having their trippy moment and then it gets up.

264
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.500
And then a minute later, they're back to the trippy moment. You know,

265
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.350
I got a real, I got a kick out of it. It was weird.
