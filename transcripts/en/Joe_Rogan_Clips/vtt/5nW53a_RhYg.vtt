<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 1>It's going to be the fun thing about this business. Like the entertainment.</v>

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:06.750
It's like, you know,

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.500
you don't know who your fans are and some of them are much cooler me rest

5
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:13.800
assured much cooler than I am. Um, I wound up,

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.160
I wound up at Janet Jackson's mansion one time in Miami beach.

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000
Cause she summoned us to the matches summoned

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.740
[inaudible] yes,

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.970
it's a show far. Really? And so we got a call from, uh,

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.900
an agent who was a mutual friend and he said, Janet is in town.

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.350
She's renting a mansion on the gorse island. Yeah. That's all.

12
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:39.930
While we're silent is where Salma glutes from cocaine Cowboys,

13
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:42.780
the Kings of Miami rented a Manchester. So that's how I knew Lucas.

14
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.230
I'm like Salma. Glute is mansion rental mansion. So she said,

15
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:49.260
she's here recording an album. She wants to meet you.

16
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
<v 0>She's a huge fan. And I was like, she,</v>

17
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.110
did she think you were the guy from the smashing pumpkins? I was like, yeah,

18
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.060
I'm the guy. I'm the one with the hair. Does she know that?

19
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.950
I'm like not Billy Corgan and who incidentally has at Billy on Twitter?

20
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.670
Was he like a investor in Twitter? Like how did he got at Billy?

21
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.200
Silly's smart. So what happens is when people go want to want to tweet at him,

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.530
they go at Billy C O R and my name,

23
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:20.190
I guess like auto-fills because they go right past at Billy,

24
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:23.640
which he has at Billy. And so I get all kinds of like,

25
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.000
when they're like upset at how he treated Daisy on wrestling on Sunday.

26
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.420
I'm like, what the is going on? Like, you're so mean to Daisy. I'm like,

27
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:35.190
what the is happening? Why, who, who do you think I am? But like,

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.690
um, but like, uh, we get, so Janet wants to, to meet you.

29
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.300
And so we come to this match and we're sitting with her manager at the

30
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.600
time, was this great, big, hilarious dude. And we're just chilling on the couch.

31
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.500
And all of a sudden he looks up and all of a sudden at the top of the stairway,

32
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.370

38
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.810
And she sits down and she is just like the sweetest,

39
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.620

40
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.600
And she goes into this story. She's like one morning,
