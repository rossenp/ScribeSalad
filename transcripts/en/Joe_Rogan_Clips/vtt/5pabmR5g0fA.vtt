00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And when you look at people that are anti-capitaist,</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.200
they're, they're really into socialism.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.720
One of the things you find is a lot of rich kids's, it's weird, right? It's,

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.110
it's weird, real weird.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.440
It's because they don't understand real struggle cuz they've grown up without

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.520
it. And they have these ideals.

7
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:20.950
Like they feel guilty because they've grown up without struggle and want to help

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.430
the world. And they think capitalism is evil and I never saw my dad.

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.710
So we need to,

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.390
we need to get all these rich people need to give that money to all these poor

11
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.710
people and we need to balance.

12
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.570
<v 1>Out income.</v>

13
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.110
You know what else they notice the people around them were all white.

14
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.220
<v 0>If people that.</v>

15
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.260
<v 1>Are into socialism, the,</v>

16
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.930
the people that are into socialism tend to be upper class, middle class,

17
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:43.210
obviously generalizing.

18
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.810
<v 0>In a big way here. Right, right. A lot of.</v>

19
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.170
<v 1>'Em. But there there's, there's some studies,</v>

20
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.930
some research that came out and it finds the overwhelming majority of socialists

21
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.930
in the United States. Yeah. You know,

22
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:56.050
they came from upper middle class to upper class families that tended to be

23
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:56.480
white.

24
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.930
<v 0>Yeah. And those are the ones that focus so hard on these social justice warrior</v>

25
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.970
issues.

26
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.840
<v 1>So you, you take a person who has been surrounded by rich white people. Yes.</v>

27
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.120
It probably got a reason to not like them &lt;laugh&gt; but then they assume all white

28
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:09.440
people are the same. And you, you end up seeing this, you know,

29
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:10.880
racialization of politics.

30
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.000
<v 0>Also, they find themselves in a position of affluence that they didn't earn.</v>

31
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.600
They wanna burn it all to the ground. Yep. You know it's.

32
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.520
<v 1>And they assume, you know, I,</v>

33
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.990
I think there's some truth in that, you know,

34
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.030
that there's people who have money,

35
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:26.910
they didn't earn and there are lechees on the system.

36
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:29.150
They make money from money. They've never done anything in their lives. Sure.

37
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.830
They're arrogant. Sure. There's a lot of people like that. Right. But you know,

38
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.030
when you then take that generalization and apply it to anyone who has money or

39
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.110
everyone and you, and you take it to a dark place. Exactly. When I,

40
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:41.110
when I first started, you know,

41
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.740
entering the public space terms of news and politics,

42
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.460
I was at occupy wall street. And before I had any notoriety,

43
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.540
I was being heralded.

44
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.660
They called me a good example of what's wrong with the system. Here's Tim pool,

45
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.300
a high school dropout mixed race guy.

46
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.380
And here he is just sleeping in a dirt park.

47
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.020
He was in his phone to tell the real stories of the world.

48
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.460
After I got featured in time magazine, what did they say? Tim pool is white.

49
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.050
And he was born with the, a silver spoon, which is not true,

50
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.570
is absolutely not true. But the, the, the socialist types,

51
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:11.730
the activists couldn't accept that I had, you know, jumped the, the,

52
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.450
the class system.

53
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.970
I guess their view of the world is rigid that the rich people keep the poor

54
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:18.050
down. There's no chance for upperward mobility. And that's not the case.

55
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.730
You know, you absolutely can become successful from, you know, humble means.

56
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.970
And.

57
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.880
<v 0>One of my favorite AOC quotes was her talking about,</v>

58
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.720
it's literally impossible to pull yourself up by your bootsraps when she used to

59
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:32.040
be a waitress. I know now she's a Congresswoman. Like, &lt;laugh&gt; like you,

60
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:35.800
can't like, it's not impossible, but it's not even,

61
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.960
that's what we need to address. It's not even the,

62
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.040
the reality is some people have a far easier path. Absolutely.

63
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.190
And some people have a far more difficult path. It's just, these are,

64
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:48.390
this is just, but you have to deal with the hand. You're given.

65
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.550
If life is a game and while I'm not saying it's a game, it is life.

66
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.630
But it's similar to a game in that you're dealt a set of cards.

67
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.400
You're dealt a set of circumstances and yes,

68
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.840
some people just get four ACEs from birth. Your,

69
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:07.440
your dad's a multi-billionaire and your whole family's always been rich and you

70
00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:10.080
never have to worry about a thing for the rest of your life. Well, guess what?

71
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.840
Those people turn out to be miserable and crazy.

72
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.320
There's some benefit in being born with a hand of cards. Absolutely. Yeah.

73
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.710
There really is a motivational benefit for sure. Gumption.

74
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.550
<v 1>Yes. You know, there's a, there's a Ted talk. There's one thing. One trait,</v>

75
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.870
one personality trait that guarantees success of all of all,

76
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:32.310
all it's not intelligence. It's not class. It's not, race's not gender unit.

77
00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:36.310
It is what perseverance, that's it? I believe that's a Ted talk on it.

78
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.700
It's it's, it's interesting. And it's true now. I think there's,

79
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:42.700
there's always gonna be certain limits based on your ability.

80
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.380
Like I'm never gonna play in the NBA, right? I'm tall enough, right.

81
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:47.860
Nowhere near as fast or can jump high enough, actually.

82
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.700
That's not track and jump free ice skateboard. But uh,

83
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.220
you take people who don't have top tier

84
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:58.780
intelligence, not the strongest, but if they work hard enough,

85
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.210
they can find their apex.

86
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:02.930
They can find that point where they're successful and they can make it right.

87
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.690
It's not true for everybody. Some people are, are, are below that, uh, that,

88
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:09.850
that threshold, no matter how hard they try, they're gonna need help.

89
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.970
<v 0>Well, I think that the problem is with any sort of generalization, you know,</v>

90
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:15.210
perseverance is the most important thing. Yes, sure.

91
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.610
But you also have to be intelligent.

92
00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:20.400
You can't be doing the same thing over and over again. I'm not gonna quit. No,

93
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:24.560
you have to be able to figure out what you're doing wrong as well as have

94
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:28.000
perseverance. Perseverance is a necessary part of the equation,

95
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.880
but there's many pieces to that equation.

96
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.920
<v 1>But, but define success in that regard, right? If, if success is, well.</v>

97
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.800
<v 0>It depends on the field that you're choosing. Right.</v>

98
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.920
<v 1>If you're not smart enough to be an asttrophysicist,</v>

99
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.630
you shouldn't be an asttrophysicist right.

100
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:42.910
If you're not tall enough to play in the NBA,

101
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:43.870
you probably can't play in the NBA.

102
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:45.630
Do you think he that's not necessarily true though. Mugsy Bowes.

103
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:47.230
That dude was amazing. He was amazing. He was.

104
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.270
<v 0>Five. Seven. Yeah. Was.</v>

105
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.190
<v 1>He? Yeah. Yeah. He did 360 dunk. He was amazing. Was he 5, 5, 5, 3 5 three.</v>

106
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.870
<v 0>Bud. Webbb that's right. That's wow. We shorter than.</v>

107
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.030
<v 1>I thought. Yeah. But you can do it. Yeah. That's amazing. That's.</v>

108
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.660
<v 0>Very rare. We about two guys, right? Two guys, guys. Exactly, exactly. I like.</v>

109
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.700
<v 1>That. Yeah. I,</v>

110
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.260
I think the average person has the potential and the capabilities of being

111
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.860
successful. Wealthy. If they want famous. I think one of the,

112
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:18.260
one of the challenges we have in our culture is how we're raising kids and what

113
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:19.980
we're, what the values we're giving them. Well.

114
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.610
<v 0>It's also what you trying to do. Like what do you look? There's a thing.</v>

115
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.210
There's a bunch of different things that you could just, you just don't have,

116
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.890
like, some people can't sing. They don't have any talent.

117
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.850
They just don't have it. Their voice sounds like.

118
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.210
But guess who else's voice sounded like, Bob Dylan, terrible voice. Yeah.

119
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.250
How does it feel me? Come on, man.

120
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.400
People love of it because there's like authenticity and passion and there's

121
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.720
something to it. Right. But he found out a way to make it work.

122
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.720
<v 1>He wouldn't win American idol. No.</v>

123
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.553
<v 0>Imagine greatest music.</v>

124
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.640
<v 1>One of the greatest musicians I've.</v>

125
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.640
<v 0>Lived &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Imagine him going like, uh, someone saying,</v>

126
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.240
what do you wanna do, man? I wanna be a singer songwriter. Okay.

127
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.400
Just without any music without any intereststrument sing, sing me a song.

128
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.753
&lt;laugh&gt;.

129
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.040
<v 1>Probably probably, well, you know, there's there, there are a lot of people,</v>

130
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.320
especially in the internet day and age that you would not expect to have made

131
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:11.200
it. Who made it.

132
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.080
<v 0>Yes. You know, that's well, you know, there's a lot. Yeah. I mean this,</v>

133
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.150
and then there's rules today that I don't think really hold true. You know,

134
00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:22.550
people say, oh, you know, you have to be good looking. You have to be thin.

135
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:25.670
Well, Adele's not thin. Yeah. She is now she's thin.

136
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.830
Now people are mad at her for being thin. Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.350
&lt;laugh&gt; but she just was talented. Just had a powerful voice or that woman,

138
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.510
Susan, whatever was her name that was on, um, America's got talent.

139
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.420
I don't know. No, it wasn't. America's got talent. An X factor, X factor factor,

140
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.180
Susan Boyle that looks wizard over here. Susan Boyle.

141
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.700
She looked like someone's Grammy. Right. And,

142
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.460
but she belted out this song that made Simon cow almost cry. Wow.

143
00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:54.940
Cause she was just talented. Just really good. You, you, you can find a thing,

144
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.420
but you know, if you're Susan Boyle and you wanna be a,

145
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.450
maybe her jokes are terrible. Maybe she would show up at open Mike night at,

146
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.650
at Sunday night at the comedy store over and over again and keep bombing.

147
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.690
And then, you know, she never would've made it. Yeah. Can't learn.

148
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.850
<v 1>Some peoples it, I think, I think if you can, if you can learn, right.</v>

149
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.670
If you can, you know,

150
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.930
one of the problems those people refuse to accept when they're wrong,

151
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.370
be self critical. Yeah.

152
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.840
<v 0>The they're not,</v>

153
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.240
they don't have an analytical perspective in terms of their own issues. They,

154
00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:27.840
they can't analyze themselves and see the flaws and be objective and

155
00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:28.390
introspective.

156
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.680
Some people just don't have that because they've been protecting themselves.

157
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.160
They have these sort of personality traits that protect themselves from

158
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.510
self-deprecation, from understanding where their flaw, when I was.

159
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.510
<v 1>A teenager, I,</v>

160
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.630
I remember reading that Michael Jordan would watch tapes of himself playing to

161
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:47.670
figure out what he did wrong. I dunno if that's true. But to me that was like,

162
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.430
if you wanna be the best like him, yes.

163
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.910
You need to actively look for what you're screwing up and call out.

164
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.430
<v 0>Immediately. Well, that's imperative for sparring. Yeah. When you're sparring,</v>

165
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.660
like we used to film a, a lot of, uh, back when I was, uh, competing,

166
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.140
we would film sparring sessions and fights particular fights,

167
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:06.620
but sparring sessions,

168
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:10.220
it was critical because you could see how you were telegraphing something and

169
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:11.780
then you got countered. You could see how,

170
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.060
and sometimes you don't think you're doing it, but then you realize like,

171
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.780
oh my God, I'm dropping my hand. Every time I'm do this.

172
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:20.210
And then you get caught crazy. Yeah. Like that's what, everything though.

173
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:20.920
It's like poker.

174
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.490
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Giving your tails away. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that's nice.</v>

175
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.290
<v 0>But I think most things you'd be better off seeing,</v>

176
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.170
like with comedy it's massive. It's gigantic.

177
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.170
Being able to visually see yourself is like primary that's number

178
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.210
one little bit, little bit less good is listening to yourself.

179
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.200
And at a certain point in time in your career,

180
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.280
you can get away with just listening in terms of like,

181
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.400
but there's a big difference between people who monitor their stuff and go over

182
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.280
it and analyze it versus people who don't. And it's just, it's,

183
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.520
it's accelerated learning.

184
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.760
It's like taking advantage of all the tools that you are given.

185
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.280
And you can apply that to anything that you're trying to do good in life.

186
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.880
If you have the time and the energy,

187
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.920
like if you're doing a job and during this job, you know,

188
00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:10.680
you just show up at work and you try to do your best.

189
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.640
Then you go home and you off and you do your stuff.

190
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.390
You'll get better at whatever you do exactly.

191
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.470
But if you go and do your job and then afterwards

192
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.230
analyze what you did pay attention to it, write things down, make a diary,

193
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.190
perhaps, or review your work and re you'll get better, faster.

194
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.310
It's a matter of how much time as long as you don't burn out.

195
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.060
<v 1>I don't take days off ever. Yeah. That's weird. I took a day off yesterday,</v>

196
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.980
had some bad sushi. &lt;laugh&gt; I here's a lesson to everybody. If, uh,

197
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.620
if I don't wanna be mean in the sushi people, they were really nice to me.

198
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:47.340
But you know, maybe,

199
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.660
maybe layoff sushi if they've been close for a month because of a pandemic and

200
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.603
well, you're driving.

201
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.220
<v 0>From the other side of the country, text me, dude.</v>

202
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.490
&lt;laugh&gt; I'll tell you the places you there's only, I,

203
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.290
I go to like four places out here for sushi and everywhere else. I'm like, Ooh,

204
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:01.010
I.

205
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.410
<v 1>Don't know. Well, so here's what I wanted to say. Right? Uh, I don't,</v>

206
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:05.570
I don't take a day off and, and a lot of people say I'm crazy.

207
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.970
And I've actually in my Monday through Friday is now double shifts every day,

208
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:11.210
then Saturday and Sunday are single shifts in terms of production.

209
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:12.610
So I do Monday through Friday,

210
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:15.810
three hours and 40 minutes about Saturday and Sunday is about an hour and 40

211
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:19.040
minutes. And, and what would I do if I wasn't working,

212
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.240
I'd be playing video games, but listen to.

213
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.073
<v 0>The numbers you just said.</v>

214
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.160
<v 1>Yeah. Three hours and 40 Monday through Friday. Yeah.</v>

215
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.000
<v 0>And then an hour and a half per weekend day. Yeah.</v>

216
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.800
That's still not a full day's work. That's still not a.

217
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.633
<v 1>Full Weeks's work that,</v>

218
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.160
so the average person an hour and a half of recording is like 10 hours of

219
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.480
research. Oh.

220
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.550
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. Well, so.</v>

221
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.670
<v 1>You working more than so it's, it's like eight hours. So, uh,</v>

222
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.190
I'm doing constant research in between fact checking.

223
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.910
And then I rec like once I get everything in line and I think I'm confident on

224
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.630
what I'm, what, you know, what I have, and, and of course, I'm right.

225
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:49.830
I'm not perfect. Then I record for about 20 minutes.

226
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.630
Then I get back to researching reading and I, you know,

227
00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:53.870
so it's it's but he's another.

228
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.830
<v 0>Benefit though. You work for yourself. Absolutely.</v>

229
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.300
You don't have some over your, your shoulder telling you what to do.

230
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.340
<v 1>I chose this though. Yeah. Right? So, so the, the couple things,</v>

231
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.180
when you brought up, you get good at whatever you, you do,

232
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:04.981
whatever it is you do.

233
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:08.020
I tell my friends every second you spend doing something as an investment to be

234
00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:09.660
into being better than better at that.

235
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.380
So if you wanna come home from work and play video games all day,

236
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:15.420
you'll be really good at video games, man. Um, maybe you start a stream.

237
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:17.340
You Twitch channel, maybe you, maybe you can make, you know,

238
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:19.370
some on E being a good personality, but you gotta earn it.

239
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.490
Or maybe there's something you wanna do that. Instead of playing video games,

240
00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:26.730
you do that. Instead for me, when I'm not working, I'm just sitting around like,

241
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:30.850
why am I not working? What, like, what am I doing? You know, I'm, it's I,

242
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.690
I ended up taking, uh, yesterday off.

243
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.530
I didn't work today cuz we're doing the show. And so I'm sitting, you know,

244
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:38.440
sitting around watching TV shows like this is awful. I can't stand.

245
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.480
I gotta read the news, man. I gotta, I gotta be in. I gotta be into it. Well,

246
00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:42.314
you're driven.

247
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.760
<v 0>That. But also you're enjoying it.</v>

248
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.480
That's the difference between someone who's working in a coal mine or someone

249
00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:52.360
who's working in a field all day picking strawberries. Yeah.

250
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.360
But they hate the job. You, I.

251
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.160
<v 1>I hear you, but you know, you know how many people have hit me up?</v>

252
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.200
You probably get something similar. Like how do I do what you do? You know,

253
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.600
when I was working for vice and I was traveling around the world, 10,

254
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:07.560
20 emails every week from young people saying, I really wanna do it. You do.

255
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:08.480
And you know what? I, you know what,

256
00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:10.440
what they would say to me when I would tell them how to do it, they would say,

257
00:12:10.441 --> 00:12:13.270
I will never do that. I, I would them. Here's what you do.

258
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.350
&lt;laugh&gt; do you have any money saved up? No. Okay. Where do you work?

259
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.030
You don't work. Get a job Starbucks. McDonald's whatever you can get.

260
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.710
Maybe you can do better than that. Save your money. Once you've saved enough,

261
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.230
find a store. You want fly there, cover it. You know what they would say? No,

262
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.070
I had one. I had there's one person that said to me,

263
00:12:32.071 --> 00:12:34.580
I wanna travel around the world role and do what you do. How do I do it? I say,

264
00:12:34.581 --> 00:12:36.540
do you have money saved up? Yes. Excellent.

265
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.380
There's a story right now going on in Turkey. All right. You gotta be secure.

266
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:45.180
You gotta be safe, but it's, inbols fairly okay. Fly there right now, film it.

267
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.060
And you know, I'll see if I can make any connections on what you find.

268
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.940
They said, well, the money I saved is for my apartment in Brooklyn.

269
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.301
And I'm like, right.

270
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:55.290
What's more important to you have in your nice Williamsburg apartment or being a

271
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.010
gen journalist traveling around the world. Well, I like my apartment. I'm like,

272
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:02.170
okay, listen. When I worked for vice, I was sleeping on a couch,

273
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.130
every dime they paid me. I put in the bank, I didn't touch it.

274
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.330
I got a job working for a, a Disney, an ABC news joint venture company.

275
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.970
After that, they paid me a bunch of money. I put 70% in the bank.

276
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:16.960
I didn't touch it. When I left, I went to a bunch of these New York,

277
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:19.400
digital companies, you know, I I'll spare them,

278
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:20.640
their names for any embarrassment.

279
00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:23.320
Many of them who have become rather worthless, they still exist.

280
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.160
And they're big. And I decided after seeing what they had to offer the bias,

281
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.600
the deception, the, the click bait driven nature of it, um, do myself.

282
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.910
And because I saved my money every step of the way I was able to do or so,

283
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.510
so then I had an apartment then I could pay for my plane ticket, you know, to,

284
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.550
to Sweden, to France, to Germany,

285
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.830
to do these stories and started building up a base within about seven or eight

286
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:47.150
months. I had gone from red to black.

287
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.590
So now all of a sudden I was no longer losing money.

288
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.390
I was making money and I'm like,

289
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.950
there it is a couple of years on ridiculous re ridiculous,

290
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.620
ridiculously successful, uh, for myself, I guess I could, you know,

291
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:01.820
it's relative, but I've got some, several employees launching new companies.

292
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.020
Well, one of the companies shattered a,

293
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.180
a fundraising record of a million bucks in a single day.

294
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.260
So that's that that's look the path for me. Isn't the path for everybody,

295
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.740
but sacrifice, you know.

296
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.341
<v 0>Well,</v>

297
00:14:13.341 --> 00:14:17.890
you're basically saying exactly what they're saying in the talk perseverance and

298
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.690
you, you embrace the grind, but.

299
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.690
<v 1>It's also, what do you really prioritize? Yeah. For.</v>

300
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.410
<v 0>Me, what are you trying to do? I Don.</v>

301
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.770
<v 1>I don't care about having an apartment. I wanna, I wanna,</v>

302
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.410
I wanna see what was going on on the ground in Istanbul. Know what it's.

303
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.130
<v 0>Also like who, who is the type of person that would chase down the stories,</v>

304
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.410
the type of person that's really gonna chase down.

305
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:38.360
The stories is persons driven to chase down stories.

306
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.720
What you're getting is questions from idiots.

307
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.520
You're getting questions from people that are like, how do I do it? Exactly.

308
00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:46.080
And then when you offer the answer, I'm not gonna do that. Right.

309
00:14:46.081 --> 00:14:47.680
But those are the people that are never gonna make it.

310
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.480
Like there's a conversation I had with a Shapi where he and, uh, Robert Kelly,

311
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.480
uh, apparently they, they thought about sponsoring a comic who's up and coming,

312
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.680
taking care of their financial needs. And you know,

313
00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:04.680
for like a year and trying to see how far they could get in their career,

314
00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.040
if they didn't have to deal with money. And I said,

315
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:10.400
that's the problem is the type of person who's going to make it.

316
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.550
It is going to make it not just in spite of the fact that they don't have any

317
00:15:14.551 --> 00:15:18.310
money, but because of the fact they don't have any money. Yeah. Those day jobs,

318
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.590
those sucky jobs that you need to have when you're struggling, those, these,

319
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.150
they motivate you. They're important. If somebody just comes along,

320
00:15:27.151 --> 00:15:30.190
gives you all the money you need for food, you're gonna half-as it.

321
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.620
And some hungry guy,

322
00:15:31.621 --> 00:15:34.980
and the other side of town is gonna take all the gigs that you would get.

323
00:15:34.981 --> 00:15:36.100
They're gonna write better jokes.

324
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.540
They're gonna be more motivated to go to open mics.

325
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:40.780
They're gonna pound the pavement harder. Well.

326
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.340
<v 1>I got a story for you. Uh, I'll try and get the details right. To my,</v>

327
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:46.260
my buddy's company. So, uh, forgive me if I'm, if I'm getting the details wrong,

328
00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:50.460
but he, he had a, um, social media management company. He started himself.

329
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.850
He knew everything, social media, Instagram, and all that.

330
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:55.530
And he started building up a client base where I'm gonna run your social media

331
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.290
for you worked like a charm, started making a ton of money,

332
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.090
getting new contracts. These companies didn know what they were doing.

333
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.850
He got to a point where I had to hire people.

334
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.050
He ended up hiring a couple college grads and he, he, he put up the a saying,

335
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:08.850
you know, college degree required. They couldn't figure anything out.

336
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.930
They kept calling him having problems, couldn't manage anything. So he fires em,

337
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.560
rehires again, more college grads. Same problem. Eventually has to fire him.

338
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.840
Then he hires because he he's running outta money. He hires to, uh, high school.

339
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.200
I think they were high school dropouts. And he was like,

340
00:16:23.201 --> 00:16:24.640
they wanted substantially less money.

341
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.000
And at this point I just couldn't find good people. They worked swimmingly.

342
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.680
It was amazing. No phone calls, no problems.

343
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.550
These were people who had worked hard,

344
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.790
saved up money in their small pumpkin hometown,

345
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.350
moved to Los Angeles to make it big. They knew what they wanted.

346
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.190
They knew what they had to do. And they said, I will find a way to do it.

347
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.990
He said, the other people are hiring were just like drones.

348
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.390
They just wanted a job. They didn't know or care what they were doing.

349
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:48.630
They didn't bother. So they didn't wanna learn.

350
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.710
But these people who were driven, viewed this as just another problem,

351
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.380
be solved on my path to success.

352
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.140
<v 0>Yeah. That's, that's the mindset. And that's the difference.</v>

353
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.300
The mindset of success is the mindset of, I will figure it out. So I.

354
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.460
<v 1>Think the, the problem is how we're raising people in this country.</v>

355
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.660
We're raising them to, uh, in certain areas to expect things,

356
00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:12.700
to be given to you. Yes. You get a participation trophy, no matter what you do,

357
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:13.770
you congratulations you. Well.

358
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.810
<v 0>This is the problem with socialism.</v>

359
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.410
And this is the problem with universal basic income. What we were talking about.

360
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.610
Yeah. Yeah. Expecting something from the government,

361
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.130
particularly without any financial feasibility. There's no,

362
00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:27.730
there's no real logic to where that money comes from. Like, show me your,

363
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.090
what the is. Right, right. What is money? You.

364
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.670
<v 1>Know? So,</v>

365
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.330
so one of the arguments I keep seeing from a lot of people who have more,

366
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.680
I didn't wanna call 'em socialists. I think they're just regular urban dwelling,

367
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.640
like liberal left type people. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, there's one viral post on,

368
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.120
uh, on red, on Reddit that said, you've got these conservatives,

369
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:48.160
or you've got these people out protesting so they can enrich their landlords and

370
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.200
the, these billionaires,

371
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:53.640
when they should be demanding that rent be waived that mortgages, you know,

372
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:57.240
evictions be canceled and that the government take care of their needs and

373
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.200
provide them with stimulus or something like that. And, um, and I,

374
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.080
I look at that, like, you, you're very clearly living in a city,

375
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.400
but what they don't understand is they say things like, you know,

376
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.430
landlord is in a job.

377
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.910
Like I I'll argue that there's a lot of the very successful landlords who make a

378
00:18:09.911 --> 00:18:13.550
ton of money and do very little, but no, that's a job. Right?

379
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.110
It's it SOS stupid to say, it's not a job.

380
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.790
It's not just that it's the money you pay in rent.

381
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.310
Can't just be wiped out because there's groundskeepers, there's maintenance,

382
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.710
there's, uh, administrative assistance.

383
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:24.430
There's taxes that have to be filed rent.

384
00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:27.790
Doesn't just go into their pocket so they can buy a boat. But they, they,

385
00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:32.740
they view it this way. And they, that money is, is what you want. That when,

386
00:18:32.741 --> 00:18:36.100
when they say these people who want the government to be reopened, you know,

387
00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:38.220
are simply trying to enrich the wealthy. It's like,

388
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.260
I think maybe they make things and they wanna keep making things they want,

389
00:18:41.261 --> 00:18:43.620
they want meaning the economy, not the government, the economy. Yeah. Sorry.

390
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.940
Yeah. Yeah. Keep mixing that up. But there's, there, there,

391
00:18:46.941 --> 00:18:49.770
there are a lot of people that don't seem to understand. I,

392
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.810
I think it's because when you live in a city everything's already there for you.

393
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.490
When I lived in New York, the Williamsburg bridge, boom, there it is.

394
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.370
I didn't see it built. I didn't pay a dime for it and I can just use it.

395
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.050
I can cross over. It's just there. And I've never had to, you know,

396
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:06.490
you never had to fight for it. So you just say, why can't I just have it?

397
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.770
You see you walk in any store and there's food. Hey, there's food easy.

398
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.080
What they don't see is the supply chain where the food is made the work that

399
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:16.680
goes into it. So they assume that money guarantees access to it,

400
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:20.680
which it doesn't. If the economy is shut down, the money, can't buy you things.

401
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.320
The value of that money starts going down.

402
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.240
If the farms can't sell any of this to anybody and start dumping. And,

403
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.240
and I think it's called following fields no longer farming,

404
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.280
then there's nothing to buy.

405
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.990
So if products aren't being made and services,

406
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:35.790
aren't being rendered because the economy is closed,

407
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.110
what is your money gonna get you at a certain point when the economy is shut

408
00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:39.944
down for too long,

409
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.910
and we're seeing all of these businesses close family businesses,

410
00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:46.230
I heard a story, terrible tragedy. Somebody killed themself because their,

411
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:49.950
their family business of seven years was shut down. That that product is gone.

412
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.500
So eventually there's no food to buy.

413
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.460
And only then will people realize that the government stimulus money has no

414
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.060
inherent value. It's it's the work we do for each other.

415
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.020
That's the argument being left out when you,

416
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:03.780
when you get a biased view on social media or when these people don't quite

417
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:04.700
understand, you know.

418
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:14.370
<v 2>I.</v>
