WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
<v 0>And this is possible. Is that why you deleted Twitter? Well.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.800
<v 1>Yeah, it's off my phone. Yes. Um, so you haven't deleted your account, have you?</v>

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.000
No, I'm still on Twitter, but I, I, I will, uh, based on this recent episode,

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.120
I will use it dntly I am.

5
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.720
<v 0>Fascinated by people and their struggles with social media. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.840
With like detaching from it,

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.350
reattaching from it getting addicted to it. I mean,

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.270
I know so many people that will look at their Twitter at like one o'clock in the

9
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:29.390
morning before they go to bed and something them off and then they can't sleep.

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.310
Yeah. Wow. Oh yeah. Well, it's really common. I, I was.

11
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.270
<v 1>Not, I, I, I don't consider myself someone who had a, a,</v>

12
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.100
a real pathology with it. I mean, I was, you know, I, I, I have, I don't know,

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.660
6,000 tweets or 7,000 tweets over the course of over the many years. Um,

14
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:50.180
so I'm not, I was not tweeting that much. I was not even looking that much.

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.060
I was, I was fairly, uh,

16
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.700
disengaged and I've never used Facebook as a, I've never,

17
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.940
I just used Facebook as kind of a publishing channel.

18
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.650
I never engaged with comments, but I was looking at enough. And it,

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.370
it was, I mean, one, it was clearly making me a worse person. I mean, I just,

20
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.610
it was, I was, I was reacting to stuff that I didn't need to react to.

21
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.770
And it was amplifying certain, uh, criticisms and, and voices,

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.570
which need not have been amplified. And in this, in this last case,

23
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.120
it just turned a, I mean, it just, it, it created a, a,

24
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.040
a huge kind of explosion in my life. It was in the middle of a vacation,

25
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.920
which I basically torpedo because of what I saw on Twitter. I mean,

26
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.000
it was just, it was like the,

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.800
the perfect infomercial for why you don't want to be engaged with.

28
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.800
<v 0>Me. Torpedtoed your are vacation. How well.</v>

29
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.030
<v 1>So I'm in the middle of like the first vacation I've taken with my family for in</v>

30
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:47.310
a very long time. It was at least a year. And wow. And we're, so I we're,

31
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.990
you know, we're on Hawaii and just like,

32
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.710
I'm supposed to put everything down to be the best father and husband I can be.

33
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:57.470
Right. And, and that was my intention. That's what was happening. Uh,

34
00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:01.590
it happened for a good solid 24 hours. &lt;laugh&gt; and,

35
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.020
and then I pick up my phone and I see that,

36
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.100
that Reza Oslan and Glen greenwa and Ezra Klein had all attacked me in the

37
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.220
space of an hour. Oh, right. No, this is like, no.

38
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.300
So this goes out to millions of people at, and is this over.

39
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.220
<v 0>That what he was asked Joe was asking about the Charles Murray thing.</v>

40
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.780
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. Well, I, truth is I can't even see what I,</v>

41
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.460
I didn't look at what greenwa had done. Um,

42
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.010
he was circulating somebody video about me, how I'm,

43
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.690
I think I'm a racist in that video re Olan blocks me.

44
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.770
So I can't even see what he attacks me by name, but he blocks me so that he,

45
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.210
so I can't even see what his, his expert that'silarious, but, uh, so I, I,

46
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.210
but I just saw the, the aftermath of that, you know, lots of stuff, you know,

47
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.650
lots of notifications coming to me with both of us tagged, um,

48
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.640
and then Ezra publish this. I mean, I suppose I should back up, uh,

49
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:50.040
however painfully to, to describe what happened here. But,

50
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.400
so I had Charles Murray on my podcast a year ago, and Charles Murray is this,

51
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.000
this, um, social scientist who, uh,

52
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.880
published the bell curve back in the nineties, which it was a,

53
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.960
a book about IQ and, and success in,

54
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.680
in Western societies like our own. And, uh, uh,

55
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.560
it's a book where he worries a lot about the cognitive stratification of

56
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:15.040
society. We have a society that is selecting more and more for a narrow band of,

57
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.030
of talents that are very well, fairly well D by what we call IQ.

58
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.070
And there is a kind of winner take all situation where people are really,

59
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.870
you know, 500 years ago, if you had a,

60
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.310
a very high IQ and you're, you're just pushing a plow next to your neighbor.

61
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.790
You had no real advantage,

62
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.350
but now you can start a hedge fund or you can start a software company.

63
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.300
And we're, we're seeing the, this, this real, uh, shocking disparity mm. In,

64
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.020
in, uh, good fortune, really. Uh, so, uh,

65
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.660
he wrote this book, it had a, a chapter on race,

66
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.020
which talked about the disparities in, in, in racial, uh, groups,

67
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.900
uh, the statistically.

68
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.340
<v 2>Observed.</v>

69
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.820
<v 1>Disparities. Right? Yeah. And, uh,</v>

70
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.810
the claim about the source of those disparities was by even the

71
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.930
standards of the time, but certainly the standards of today,

72
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.730
incredibly tepid, mealy, mouthed, just hand waving. It was not this,

73
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.050
you know, here comes the third RKE declaration of, of white supremacy. It was

74
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.800
undoubtedly, there are environmental and genetic reasons for this,

75
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.960
and we don't understand them. You know, it was just, it was just like to,

76
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:29.360
to think that as one or the other,

77
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.280
we're not in a position to know what the mix is of, of, of influences now. Um,

78
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.520
and that is, uh, virtually any honest scientists take on the matter.

79
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.550
Um, &lt;affirmative&gt; and to certainly today, I mean, that's only become more so,

80
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.390
uh, but that went off like a nuclear bomb. I mean, that was just,

81
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.670
so that was such a, um, uh, I mean, it's, it's the most,

82
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.550
um, I, so, and at the time I never read the book.

83
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.870
I just thought this had to be just racist of.

84
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.510
<v 2>Of course, Carls Murray would be vilified for.</v>

85
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.180
<v 1>For the, that observation. And he he's been vilified ever since. And ever since,</v>

86
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.100
you know, I've ignored him, wasn't he de-platformed.

87
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.380
<v 0>And assaulted recently.</v>

88
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.420
<v 1>Yeah. So that's what happened. So, so he went to Middlebury to give a talk,</v>

89
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.660
you know, 20, uh, some odd years, 25 years after he wrote this book.

90
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.260
<v 2>Oh, by the way, he's also listed by the Southern bsley law center. Oh.</v>

91
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.061
And so that, that,

92
00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:24.290
that's what contributed to the D he platforming and the violent protest against

93
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.650
him at middleburye what's.

94
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.610
<v 0>Crazy is the whole thing is a propaganda for the superiority of the Asian race.</v>

95
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.090
And everyone's missing that &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah. That's the flip side of it.

96
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.170
<v 2>Then we're talking about why it supremacy Asian Asians. Areactually the ones.</v>

97
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.250
<v 0>Far and above. I mean, that's basically what is booked proved and, you know,</v>

98
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.443
they're suing Harvard.

99
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.360
Now there's a group of Asian students that SU suing Harvard because they're

100
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:46.800
discriminated against because they're required to have higher scores. Yeah.

101
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:49.080
Because they're assumed to be smarter. Wow.

102
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:53.120
So the standards for Asian students entering it to Harvard is higher than white

103
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:53.660
people.

104
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.440
<v 1>Wow. Yes. Well, Asian privilege is a, is a big problem. &lt;laugh&gt; it's yeah. Your,</v>

105
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.080
your grandfather was working on the railroads in California as an,

106
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.720
an indenture servant. And, uh, all that privilege trickled down. There's.

107
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.640
<v 0>Obviously a lot of factors that lead to IQ to, to H IQ,</v>

108
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:12.600
but to ignore what those are, to ignore it completely to dis in the name of, in,

109
00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:15.320
in the name of ideology course yes. Only ideology.

110
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.750
And this idea that cannot look at statistics,

111
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.470
you cannot look at facts and in your conversation with Ezra,

112
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:24.990
Charles that's what or Ezra Klein rather that's what I got is that this is,

113
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.790
this is an ideological issue and that you, you,

114
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.430
it's almost like an impossible subject to breach. Yeah.

115
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:36.430
Like you can't even discuss the fact that certain races

116
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.580
demonstrate low IQ.

117
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.020
And then let's look at what could be the cause of those even discussing that

118
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.180
somehow or another is so inherently racist that it must be ignored or must be

119
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.700
silenced. And that you,

120
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.940
you must first concentrate on all the various injustices that have been done to

121
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:54.140
those people who have this lower.

122
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.380
<v 1>IQ. Yeah. Well,</v>

123
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.450
let me just take a couple of minutes to close the very various doors to hell

124
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.570
that are now a jar based on what we've just said. &lt;laugh&gt;.

125
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.970
<v 2>So you were on your holiday and you get O.</v>

126
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.410
<v 1>Let yeah. So, so, well, just a little more context. So, so yeah, as you said,</v>

127
00:07:07.411 --> 00:07:10.570
Charles Murray went to Middlebury college and was deplatformed and he was not

128
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:11.410
only deplatformed.

129
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:14.890
So the usual deplatforming with the students turning their back to the speaker

130
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.720
and shouting and not letting anything happen. But the professor who invited him,

131
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:22.480
who was a liberal professor who wanted to essentially debate him,

132
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.040
she was attacked. Yeah. When they're leaving the hall,

133
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.280
they both get physically attacked by a, a, a crowd of students. Charles was,

134
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.320
was not hurt his host.

135
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.520
This female professor got a concussion and a neck injury that,

136
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:39.950
that still persists. And this now more a year later. So like, she was,

137
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.670
I actually, I think she's a registered demodemocratdemocrat by this no doubt.

138
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.870
And, and they're driving out in an SUV where that gets, I mean, someone pulls a,

139
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.550
a stop sign out of the, the,

140
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.190
the sidewalk and has still got the concrete ball on the end of it.

141
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.710
And that this SUV gets smashed with this, you know, concrete late and stop sign.

142
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.591
I mean, this was,

143
00:07:55.591 --> 00:08:00.500
this is happening at one of the most liberal privileged colleges

144
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.420
on earth. Uh it's nuts. So anyway,

145
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.740
that was the thing that put Murray on my radar after all these many years of my

146
00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:08.980
ignoring him and I had actually,

147
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.700
and I felt guilty because I had declined to be a part of at least one project

148
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.700
because his name was attached. Right.

149
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:18.540
Because I just saw that this guy's radioactive he's, he's got some white,

150
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.450
supremac a J and, uh, I had believed the, the, the, the lies about him.

151
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.850
Uh, and then I saw this and I thought, okay,

152
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:27.850
well maybe he's the Canary in the coal mine, or,

153
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:31.090
or certainly one of the canariess in the coal mine that I had ignored where the,

154
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.330
as you say, there are, these certain topics are considered,

155
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.410
so politically fraught that you cannot discuss them no matter what is true,

156
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:41.200
mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; like, like it's just a, you know,

157
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:46.040
there has to be a firewall between your conversation about reality

158
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.760
and these sorts of facts. Uh, and so,

159
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.080
you know, so he's been, you know,

160
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:57.440
suffering from having transgresssed that boundary. And so I had him on the,

161
00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:59.360
on the podcast, uh,

162
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.520
being fairly agnostic about his,

163
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.360
his actual social policy commitments and his political, uh, concerns.

164
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.240
And just wanting to talk about, uh, you know, the,

165
00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:14.360
the facts insofar as we touched them lightly. I mean, I had zero interest in,

166
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.710
in intelligence as measured by IQ. Uh, although, I mean,

167
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:21.390
it's an interesting subject, but I hadn't, you know,

168
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:25.150
I hadn't spent much time focused on that. And I had, uh,

169
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.550
truly zero interest in establishing differences between populations with respect

170
00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:34.950
to intelligence or anything else. But I see what's coming. I see the fact that,

171
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.340
that the more we understand ourselves genetically and environmentally,

172
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.020
the more we will, if we go looking, or even if we're not looking,

173
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.220
we will discover differences between groups and the end game for

174
00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:52.460
us as a species is not to deny that those differences exist or could possibly

175
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:53.940
exist it's to

176
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.810
deny that they have real political implication. I mean, the, the,

177
00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:02.890
the political imp the, the political framework we need is a commitment to,

178
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.770
to equality across the board and a,

179
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.770
a commitment to treating individuals as individuals. There's nobody, who's a,

180
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.050
the, the average of a population is meaningless with respect to you.

181
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.840
That will always be so, and, um, and whatever, you know,

182
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.120
and whatever diversity of talents there is statistically in various populations.

183
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.800
We want societies that simply don't

184
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.840
care politically about that. I mean, that's just, it's just not what it's

185
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.370
the, our,

186
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.750
our political tolerance of one another and support of one another is not

187
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.150
predicated on denying individual differences or even statistical differences

188
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.430
across groups. It can't be because we know that there are people walking around,

189
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.670
like, uh, you know,

190
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.860
Elon Musk who gets outta bed in the every morning and does the work like 4,000

191
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:01.700
people, right. And people who just are,

192
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:06.460
are struggling to work at Starbucks and hold down a job and our

193
00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:09.580
political system, I mean, this, we,

194
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:13.860
we don't say one person is more valuable politically and socially than another,

195
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.170
even though one person's capable of doing massive things that, that, that, that,

196
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.730
uh, many, most other people aren't, it's, you know, when it comes time to,

197
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.810
to write laws and create institutions that protect that,

198
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.770
that support human flourishing, we,

199
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.250
we have to engineer tides that raise all the boats. And so, you know, and, and,

200
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:34.491
you know,

201
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:39.080
there are legitimate debates about the social policies that will do that, but,

202
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.800
and there are legitimate debates about facts.

203
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:45.720
So we can debate scientific fact and, and, you know, the, the results of,

204
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.160
you know, psychometric testing or,

205
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.560
or behavioral genetics that are relevant to this question of intelligence, uh,

206
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.760
and we can have a good faith debate about the data.

207
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.520
And then we can have a good faith debate about social policy that should follow

208
00:11:58.521 --> 00:11:59.354
from the data.

209
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.800
But what's happening on the left now is on either at either of those

210
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.920
tearss of conversation, there are just straight up allegations of, of,

211
00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:13.070
of racism that hits you. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; the moments you certain,

212
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.430
certain facts. Can I say.
