00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.730
<v 2>When you first go, I went to, so when I moved to New York,</v>

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.880
I went to Boston comedy club and I barked and handed out flyers. Oh,

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.870
did you do that? I did exactly what I did it with Pete Holmes, his show.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
I did exactly that show. So, uh, with Pete, he got me,

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.990
I moved like five months after Pete did. And he was like,

7
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.110
I'm barking at this club. And so I was like, all right, I'll go do that.

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.770
I remember just standing on the corner. It taught me to learn to like,

9
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:28.470
when I have goals and comedy, he was like learning just to have little goals.

10
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.950
Like I never set big goals. I always set just a goal that I can get.

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.090
And then I was like, I don't want to be on this corner. So it was like,

12
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:36.630
how do I get off this corner?

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.560
<v 1>And then he was like, you just want to go stand in the door? Like, I just,</v>

14
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.060
I would like at that moment,

15
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:46.500
dream of just being able to take people's tickets at the door. Right.

16
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.320
And so you're like, and you're just, you know, hand these flyers out.

17
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:52.290
People are just dropping them in front of your face. Like, no one cares, dude.

18
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:56.160
Like just throwing off. It's like 25 degrees out here, like, eh,

19
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.320
and, uh, uh, and so, but I was at Boston. So Chappelle used to always come by.

20
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.390
This is 2004 or five.

21
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.680
So Chappelle would always come by and do spots. He'd go up in front of six,

22
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:11.640
seven people. No one was there and then we'd go outside and just say, Hey,

23
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.690
Chappelle's on stage.

24
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.530
<v 0>This was when Chappelle show has already been off the air. No.</v>

25
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.380
<v 1>It's it's right before he ended it. Oh, right before it was on.</v>

26
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.730
Wow. He would come.

27
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.210
I remember him coming and having like white makeup on his neck.

28
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:29.850
Like if you played like a white person that's Chappelle's show and he would

29
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:33.690
still have it on, you know, cause he'd come from there to, uh,

30
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.680
straight to the club. And so we'd go up at Boston and we would,

31
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.340
everybody would go on stage. And I remember I'll never forget these one people,

32
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.680
they walked by and I said, Hey, Dave, Chappelle's on stage.

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.230
If y'all go watch for free, you know,

34
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.980
and Boston comedy club member had those steps and there was a window and they

35
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:53.250
go, I don't believe you. I was like, well, I'm at a comedy club.

36
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.930
So I was like, he's in there. Just go look in the window. If he's not there,

37
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:01.200
then don't go in. And they were like, no, I left.

38
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.490
I think about those people every day, they could have watched your.

39
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.550
<v 0>Belt from free those people in that 500 bucks, those 500.</v>

40
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.090
<v 1>Bucks, we bring, I bring it up to my wife every day. And those people to.</v>

41
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
<v 0>I did a Dave show when he was in New York, uh, when we did this,</v>

42
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:21.210
this fear factor episode and the way Tyrone big ones was on fear factor. And,

43
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.350
uh, it was in a warehouse in the middle of the winter, freezing cold,

44
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:29.490
no heat in the warehouse. So we had these little blast furnace, you know,

45
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.470
those things that they do on sets where.

46
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.303
<v 1>It's like.</v>

47
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.630
<v 0>Those things that are blowing hot air out. And you know,</v>

48
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.870
you just stand in front of that until it was time to do the scene and then you'd

49
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.520
go out there and do the scene and everybody would run back and stand in front of

50
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.420
the blast furnaces.

51
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.890
But he was in character the whole day as Tyrone becomes.

52
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.310
<v 1>Like.</v>

53
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.570
<v 0>He was having so much fun.</v>

54
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.680
<v 1>Yeah. He was, I mean, watching him, he would come by and you know,</v>

55
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:59.100
and he would go up for awhile. He hosted one, uh, when, uh,

56
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.440
I think it's when Boston switched to the comedy village,

57
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.830
like he was like run my buddy, Dustin Shaffer is the one that got us.

58
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:07.690
He was running the Boston at the time.

59
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.710
And then it switched to comedy village ever sold it.

60
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.700
But then Chappelle came by one night and hosted for everybody. Like all the,

61
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.620
even the open mic guys, they were going up.

62
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.740
Cause he would come up and just do whatever, obviously whatever he wanted.

63
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.870
And uh, it was and getting to see that bill Burr was a big deal for me. Uh,

64
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.090
Patrice O'Neil. I used to sit in Patrice,

65
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:31.150
his car cause he would park it out front of the Boston.

66
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.480
He couldn't park there and he'd go on stage and I would sit in his car.

67
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.410
And so if a cop came,

68
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.470
I would just drive his car around and wait until he got done. Wow.

69
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.340
I went to there.

70
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.050
I saw burn Patrice where everybody's a big deal, but they were,

71
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.660
they were big for me because when I went to New York, you know,

72
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:50.950
at that time 2005, something like that there, you know,

73
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.620
bird's just a comic that people know him in New York, but he's not,

74
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.610
he's not doing, he's not what he is now obviously. And uh,

75
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.210
so they would come by and they would run their HBO one night stands for these 30

76
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:05.530
minutes specials. And I remember a timed, Patrice is one night.

77
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.500
He didn't ask me, by the way, just like a young comic being like,

78
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.680
I'll time it for you. And then he gets off and like, this is,

79
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.230
I have no concept of being on TV.

80
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.820
I think like he has to do 30 to the Don. And I tell him afterwards, it's like,

81
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.570
that was like 34 minutes. And he just like looked at me and walked away.

82
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.580
There was no reason for me. I mean,

83
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.330
I was so embarrassed about doing it and now I know,

84
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.470
but it was like at the time I was just trying to be, uh, you know, a good comic.

85
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:35.950
And like.

86
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.460
<v 0>Did you see his, uh, the comedy central documentary they did about him?</v>

87
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.470
<v 1>I haven't watched it yet. I haven't got to watch it.</v>

88
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.730
<v 0>I haven't either. I haven't either, but I will make, make myself for sure.</v>

89
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.080
But I've seen so many of his sets. He was a guy. He was,

90
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.080
he was for sure when we grades for sure.

91
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.030
But he was maybe even more importantly, he was a cornerstone of not giving a.

92
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.420
Yeah. You know what I mean? Like you had to have a guy like that.

93
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:03.580
That was in the elite standup comics. Like

94
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.770
what the are you talking about? And you,

95
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.570
you needed a guy like that to have a great point.

96
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.540
Like really well thought out point. That was hilarious.

97
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.410
That showed you why you shouldn't care or why something was stupid. Yeah.

98
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.700
Like I remember, um, there was some controversy about, uh,

99
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.390
Opie and Anthony and he went on some show and some,

100
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:30.100
one woman was saying that certain jokes could never be funny. And you know,

101
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.140
and, and he went and said like a joke that was on that subject.

102
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.530
That was funny. And then, and he was like, look at all.

103
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.210
But this is a point that he had.

104
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.240
That's like a really good point that I stick with to this day. It's like,

105
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.150
it all comes from the same place,

106
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:50.890
whether the joke is funny or the joke is not whether it's offensive or whether

107
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:55.030
it's hilarious and non-offensive, it's coming from the same place.

108
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:59.540
You're just trying to be funny. And when you're a comic,

109
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:00.950
you understand that because like,

110
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.070
you'll say something that some people might find offensive,

111
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:07.160
but the only reason why you're saying it is not because you're trying to be

112
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.040
mean, you're saying, cause you think there's some funny in there,

113
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.940
like you're trying to find the funny and sometimes like you'll slip and it

114
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.890
doesn't doesn't work at all. And so.

115
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.800
<v 1>It's very, agreeable is not funny. Right? Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.020
And like the whole point of it is I can't agree with you.

117
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.830
Comedy is all built from, so does, if someone like, there'll be like, oh,

118
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:26.630
you're being mean to him. You're like, well, I don't know.

119
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.220
That's what comedy's mean. Sometimes it's mean, I,

120
00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:33.890
I tell a joke where I said I did something, my dad,

121
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:36.680
but I came out and I did a show. These people didn't expect a comedy.

122
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.980
So they didn't know I was a comedian. And I started telling my act,

123
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.150
they don't know what I'm doing.

124
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:44.570
So it just sounds like I'm doing a mean speech because that's what comedy is.

125
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.650
If you have no, if there's no context to it, right. Like this guy's the worst.

126
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.600
And you're like, oh, but if I, if I just told them I was the comedian,

127
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:57.800
they would be like, oh, okay. They get it. I still live to this day.

128
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:01.100
By some Patrice said it was. So I was, uh,

129
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.580
I just kind of started with a big J uh,

130
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.970
Kurt Metzker Courbet's rally. One of em, Kurt and big,

131
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
big J were to one of the comics ever saw that. I just was like,

132
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.670
really where I was like, you moved to New York and you're like, oh man,

133
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.300
this is like the real, like, these guys are like really good.

134
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.900
<v 0>Have you been paying attention? What massacres? Dealing with a Kyle Dunnigan.</v>

135
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.853
Yeah.

136
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.430
<v 1>Yeah. That scares one of the, I mean, one of the funniest guys I've ever,</v>

137
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.720
I super smart. I remember watching him, uh, at the very beginning. I, I,

138
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.770
he, he would take me down the road. We'd do like these old weird gigs.

139
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.780
And so he would just call me as opener.

140
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.820
And I'm like friends with Kurt at this point.

141
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.900
I drove him to the gig and we'd be in the elevator and he's just on the phone.

142
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.320
He was like, what's that? No, I'm sitting here with my opener. I'm like, Curt,

143
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.460
just say my buddy, like, you know, like, we're,

144
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.200
it's not like I'm opening for like, you know, Seinfeld or something. Like,

145
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:57.950
it's like, you're, you're getting paid $800 for this weekend.

146
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.720
Like he just told me that to my face. And I got him in that room though.

147
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.620
Cause he, we were, we, we shared a hotel room. That's the word,

148
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:09.770
like the gig we're doing. And he goes to put, uh, we're going to the bathroom.

149
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.590
And he's like, is this lotion? And I would always just like mess with him.

150
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.460
Or if he asked a dumb question, he goes, this is, I need lotion. As it says,

151
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:19.190
conditioner. And I go, that's it it's conditioner for your skin.

152
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.280
And I just tell him that. And then I walk in there and he's just rubbing,

153
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.170
conditioner all over his body.

154
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.170
And then we had to go do radio and we had an avenue. He was, he was he's.

155
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.210
That's why he called me opener. He's a brilliant guy.

156
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.660
<v 0>He's an odd duck. The moment I met him, the first time I met him,</v>

157
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:39.020
I met him in Montreal. Uh, Ari introduced me to him and he goes, Hey, what's up?

158
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:40.640
And then he goes, Hey, what are you doing for your hair?

159
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:45.500
Your hair's falling out. He'd do anything for it. I was like, whoa. I go,

160
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:49.520
yeah, I'm minoxidil. All kinds of. He's like, yeah, me too. It was like,

161
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.920
literally the first words out of his mouth. I guy, man, he's just a,

162
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.430
he's got an interesting way of looking at things, but he's also got a,

163
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.950
a brilliant perspective because he grew up in a cult, you know?

164
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:03.630
And because he grew up in a call, it's like,

165
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.700
he sees a lot of those same patterns in like woke thinking.

166
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.730
And he's like,

167
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.080
like where you can't question certain ideologies and he gets really angry.

168
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.530
Cause I know, I know what the this is because I grew up with this. Yeah.

169
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.290
What was he? A Jehovah's witness. Yeah. That was it. What? Right. Yeah.

170
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.490
And you know his stories about growing up as a Jehovah's witness for fun.

171
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.080
<v 1>I mean, can you imagine that coming to your door? Hey,</v>

172
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.330
what are you doing with your hair? That's the first thing he says. You're like,

173
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.193
oh.

174
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.760
<v 0>Well he's just, I dunno. I'm so happy. He's around though.</v>

175
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.850
He's made me so happy at the comedy store whenever I talk to him.

176
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.590
<v 1>Uh, unbelievable. And when I watched him at the very beginning, uh,</v>

177
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:48.240
the Patrice thing, so Jay was, we used to go to Patricia's house for, uh,

178
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.750
uh, like 4th of July or something. He always had a party at his house.

179
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.890
And so I w got invited in Jay. Uh, and then someone,

180
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.850
I got into it with someone else, one of Patricia's friends basically.

181
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:01.710
And he was like, he told Jay, Hey, Patrice,

182
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:04.260
doesn't want Nate to come to the party. And uh,

183
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.830
then Jay calls Patrice and is like, uh, well,

184
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.260
the context of this too is like, so Patrice had always asked me,

185
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:13.380
I grew up in the south. Like I grew up, you know, Christian in the south,

186
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.570
typical Southern upbringing, going to church, all this stuff.

187
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.820
So Patrice do that. And he would ask me like,

188
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:19.170
do you believe in dinosaurs and stuff?

189
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:23.100
And I would just go with what I would say, no, I believe. But like, it was,

190
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.720
you know, I was like, I don't want to just say no,

191
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.730
like I'm not going to give him what he wants. Right.

192
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.150
Cause then he would make fun of you anyway. So I would always do that.

193
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.340
And so then, uh, so Jay calls him and says, Hey, uh,

194
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.450
our other guy says that Nate can't come to your house for that party.

195
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.110
And Patrice was like, what? He goes, I didn't say that. He goes,

196
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.930
that dude doesn't believe in dinosaurs. You don't think I want that in my house.

197
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.930
I want that all over my house. He goes,

198
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.960
he could come to the party and I've lived my life by that,

199
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.680
with that I open mindness to go. If someone came up to me was like,

200
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.810
I don't believe in the moon. I'd rather talk to that guy.

201
00:10:57.811 --> 00:10:59.460
Then a guy that does believe in the moon.
