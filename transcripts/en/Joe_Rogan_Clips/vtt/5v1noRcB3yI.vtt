00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.740
<v 1>There's this weird language thing happening there with all these, like,</v>

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.900
like he called it desensitizing or sterilizing language and that's what's

4
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.060
happening. So it takes all that meaning away. Right.

5
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:18.300
So nobody knows what it means, except for the guy preaching it.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.210
So the guy doing the diversity training, I watched a diversity training.

7
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.210
Somebody sent me from their job the other day, and this woman's like,

8
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.610
just droning on. It felt like you're just getting, you know,

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.220
imagine you're at the job. Like you have to do this for work.

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
You don't want to do it. And you're just watching this webinar.

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
And this lady just, ramrodding like 12 syllable words that you she's like, okay.

12
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.660
So we have to talk about microaggressions and there are different kinds of

13
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:42.420
microaggressions or micro assaults. There are micro. And it's just like,

14
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:45.750
what the hell is this micro assault, micro insults.

15
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:49.620
And then micro Microsoft micro assault is when you don't you do it on purpose.

16
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.150
<v 2>Like, but what is a micro assault?</v>

17
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.700
<v 1>So a micro assault would be, um, you know,</v>

18
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.160
making a small, but you know,

19
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.000
racially salient comment in the presence of a person of that race.

20
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.990
So it's not even not necessarily racist. No, it's not an assault. No,

21
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:11.600
these people violence is all words and, and disagree.

22
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.350
<v 2>So micro assault can just be an insult.</v>

23
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.920
<v 1>And they're all insults micro. Everything has to just be like,</v>

24
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:21.020
words are standing in the wrong place.

25
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.640
<v 2>Oh boy, Jamie just pulled it up here. Uh microassault is an explicit racial</v>

26
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.000
derogations characterize. What is that? Whoa, look at that expression.

27
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.980
A microassault is an explicit racial derogations.

28
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.530
<v 1>So you've put somebody down on purpose. I know.</v>

29
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.450
<v 2>But that's a weird way of describing en explicit racial derogations</v>

30
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.050
plural.

31
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.160
<v 1>Yeah. Someone who reaches singular. Yeah, it doesn't sound right. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.050
Didn't editor. Derogations.

33
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.490
<v 2>Puro characterized primarily by verbal or nonverbal attack meant to hurt the</v>

34
00:01:55.491 --> 00:02:00.170
intended victim through name calling there's your hyphen avoidant behavior

35
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.490
or purposeful discriminatory actions.

36
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.440
<v 1>The hammer on that's broken all the pieces.</v>

37
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.860
<v 2>It's a mess. And that is a K zu.edu,</v>

38
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.680
reason.ksu.edu. Nice.

39
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.910
I didn't even bother like editing that at that. There's so many of these.

40
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.030
<v 3>Things that are like for education that are like this, and it's like,</v>

41
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.210
they say stuff like themself and it's just like.

42
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.240
<v 1>This is supposed to be for education. It's barely literate. What is going on?</v>

43
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.130
Well, that's a problem when you're.

44
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.790
<v 2>Using they and them as well. Right? So we're using they, them pronouns,</v>

45
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.160
which are really supposed to, I mean,

46
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.980
for the most part indicate multiple people.

47
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.370
<v 1>Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. The singular thing. Yay.</v>

48
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.410
<v 2>They, you know, so this guy w what you could say, they thought,</v>

49
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.060
or they thought they would get away with it. I mean, you could say it,

50
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.480
you could say right. But it's hard to use it that way.

51
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.490
<v 1>All the time. Right. It's hard to use it intentionally actually.</v>

52
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:59.650
It's it's it comes up naturally. Sometimes then it's fine.

53
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.950
But it's hard to use intentionally. Yeah. If a person wanted to go to the store,

54
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.340
they could go. Right. And so there's something like,

55
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.940
kind of totalitarian about making people do things like that that are difficult,

56
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:12.490
like jumping through these little hoops and then holding them to massive

57
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.180
account. And it's like, I mean, even like the black lives matter thing,

58
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.780
like black lives matter as a sentence is obvious.

59
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.450
Forcing somebody to say an obvious thing. That's a great name and argue with it.

60
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.720
You also can't argue. Cause what are you gonna matter? Of course, it's, I mean,

61
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:30.870
it's so complicated because there's like, if somebody asked me, they said, okay,

62
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.290
do you support black lives matter, James, do you support black lives matter?

63
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.780
And of course, they're gonna try to catch me on this. And it's like, which one?

64
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.570
There's at least five. I support one of them.

65
00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:43.860
And I think the other four are nuts. Right? So there's black lives matter.

66
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.960
All lower case letters is a sentence.

67
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.500
You can't disagree with it because it's obvious that black lives actually

68
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:53.010
matter. And you shouldn't be forced to say obvious things. But what that,

69
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.310
what is that? That's a, that's a call, right? They're saying, Hey look,

70
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.340
white people, people of other races,

71
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.760
we have a different experience for this society and it's bad.

72
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.520
And we need you to hear us and we want you to care.

73
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.300
And we want there to be action taken that we can work on together to figure out

74
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.370
and who couldn't support that movement.

75
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:14.640
I think everybody in the world supports that movement. But then you have the,

76
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:19.170
the official one and their websites full of like literally neo-Marxist stuff.

77
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.820
And they're like weird, like, feminist something or another like, seriously,

78
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:26.160
it's all on their, about page, on the black lives, on our website.

79
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.520
And it's like, that's a lot of baggage, man. I don't know if I'm for that.

80
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:31.650
And then you have like, the training video comes out with one saying, you know,

81
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:34.920
we're trained Marxists and they're they're, they are, they're trained activists.

82
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.370
You don't actually have to go along with all of that to agree with the sentence.

83
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.940
Right. Then you have this thing with, with white people.

84
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.950
There's like a black lives matter movement.

85
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:47.640
That's white people that are like washing black people's feet and like calling

86
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:51.210
them and apologizing and like freaking them out. And I mean,

87
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:52.140
this is actually horrible.

88
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.600
<v 2>Too. Like, it's amazing. Could you imagine.</v>

89
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.600
<v 3>What it's like being like, somebody calls you, like all your friends,</v>

90
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.290
all your white.

91
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.240
<v 1>Friends start calling you. And they're like, by the way,</v>

92
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.350
I've always kind of been raised.

93
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.140
<v 3>Like you had a relationship with that person and now.</v>

94
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.480
<v 4>It's so awkward. My favorite one was.</v>

95
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.350
<v 2>The white actors that all got together in that black one film.</v>

96
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.400
<v 3>No kidding. That was solid. Oh my gosh.</v>

97
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.870
Oh.

98
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.420
<v 4>It was ones in there that I really enjoyed. I know.</v>

99
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.260
<v 2>The problem is these haven't worked in months and they want.</v>

100
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.890
<v 1>Attention. They wanted attention and they weren't getting it. So they're like,</v>

101
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.060
I know, I know how to really choose this up in my favorite. Me, me, me, me.

102
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.300
<v 2>It's so dumb. It's so dumb. Aaron, Paul, he broke my heart.</v>

103
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.340
<v 5>Oh. I saw him in there.</v>

104
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.730
<v 2>I went through the breaking bad guy. He's a mate. I love that dude.</v>

105
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:41.880
And then I was like, bro, I wish I would've talked to you before that. I know.

106
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.700
I can tell you how, how this goes. I can tell you what happens next.

107
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.860
<v 3>Just say good man. It's like me.</v>

108
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.450
<v 2>I get to watch it. That's right. We tell you,</v>

109
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:49.950
we're going to make fun of it a lot.

110
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.060
<v 1>That's right. The. Got it. It was so funny. So then there's two more.</v>

111
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.130
We'll just drop them as whatever these, so what happened? I wanted.

112
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.260
<v 2>To get back to this. You don't mind when the,</v>

113
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.640
that piece came out and you got the award and then they found out like,

114
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.050
what was the, you said that she was.

115
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.910
<v 1>Off. It was just, I got this email from her that was like short,</v>

116
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.390
but it was like, I wouldn't really hurt that you were deceptive to me. You know,

117
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:13.900
it was kinda like.

118
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.190
<v 3>That. And I felt bad actually. Like I don't, I'm not, I didn't do it to like,</v>

119
00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:21.700
be mean to people. You did it to prove a point. Like I actually, you know.

120
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.030
<v 1>The saying, you know, you play the ball, don't play the man. Right.</v>

121
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.310
So I guess I said it backwards.

122
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:29.740
If it's the saying is don't play the man play the ball. Uh,

123
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.030
this was about ideas for me. Like that project was about the ideas.

124
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.070
It was about the scholarship. It wasn't about the people.

125
00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:40.720
And I felt like it was really unfortunate that there were people implicated in

126
00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:44.050
it. I actually did feel bad for them. And almost every case,

127
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.550
there were a couple of them that actually right.

128
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.350
me off with some of the stuff they wrote to me.

129
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:51.070
But so I didn't feel bad about them so much, but that's a human failing. I,

130
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.330
you know, I'm not a perfect person.

131
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.400
<v 2>When they you off. Cause they would, they.</v>

132
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.770
<v 1>Right. Oh, this one woman, we wrote a paper about masculinity and uh,</v>

133
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.390
Hooters. And we said that the only reason guys go there is, I mean,

134
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.310
besides the obvious wanting to Ogle chicks,

135
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.330
but the main reason was so that they could order like double meaning in the word

136
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:11.800
order, right. Order their food.

137
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.610
They can order pretty young women around that have to do what they say.

138
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.520
And you know, they can patriarchaly order taking their orders.

139
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.100
What is a pun? And uh,

140
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.270
this one woman wrote like this long review of it. And she was like,

141
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.730
this paper, it was remembered.

142
00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:33.400
It was submitted to a journal called men and masculinities.

143
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.640
It was a paper that was supposed to study the masculinity.

144
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.530
And she wrote back this paper talks about men instead of women and it victim

145
00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:44.680
blames and blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, oh, you can go to hell. You know,

146
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:47.590
basically come on. I mean,

147
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:50.410
it was aggravated also because my paper didn't get in because of that,

148
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.820
he's like, it's like,

149
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.300
why would a paper about men and masculinity have to be about the women? Oh,

150
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:59.560
because feminism, that's why. Of course. And it's like,

151
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.100
it's so annoying that it's. So that, that, that aggravated me. Um,

152
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.700
most of them rest of them were actually like really nice people.

153
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.250
<v 2>So I think your feeling is that there there's really nice</v>

154
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.040
people that get bamboozled in a really bad ideas.

155
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.110
And then when you snuck in these hoax papers

156
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.600
that you're,

157
00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:25.060
you're essentially speaking their lingo and they don't even know that they have.

158
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.893
<v 1>A link. That's right.</v>

159
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.310
And so I actually think that what we're looking at with this woke movement and,

160
00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:32.890
you know, we've kind of compared it to cult, we've kind of compared it to real.

161
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.060
I actually think it's evil.

162
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.610
And the reason is because exactly what you just said,

163
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.550
it plays on people's best nature.

164
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:44.530
It takes good people and twists them to its purpose. And that's horrible.

165
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.270
Like the whole game is to try to make you a nicer, more caring person.

166
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:53.830
So it takes your care and turns it into something literally totalitarian.

167
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:56.280
You're not allowed to disagree with anything you say,

168
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:59.190
you get branded with these horrible, you know, stigmas.

169
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.860
They try to cancel people. And it's like,

170
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.720
it's literally trying to use people's best fairest,

171
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.640
most just and caring instincts to make them program into this way of thinking.

172
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.683
There's also the.

173
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.950
<v 2>Things going on, particularly with, uh, people in their cars,</v>

174
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.170
when they have marches that they just decide to start smashing

175
00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:23.480
people's cars and doing things to people's cars,

176
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.780
whether it's because the people don't agree with what they're saying,

177
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:29.840
or they choose someone or they don't like the look of that person,

178
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.880
but they feel justified in the violently attacking them in their car.

179
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.880
Right. Because they are there to do a good.

180
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.960
<v 1>Thing. That's right. Yeah.</v>

181
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.700
The w whenever somebody is going to punish people and think it's the moral thing

182
00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:45.800
to do, that's where you've got some danger going on.

183
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.500
And the reason they do that by the way is because they think everything

184
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:50.900
happening as violence. Like if, why does Antifa, by the way,

185
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.580
it's the fourth black lives matter movement.

186
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.740
Is these Antifa agitators starting the riots.

187
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.560
Why do they feel justified in throwing a brick through a Starbucks?

188
00:09:57.561 --> 00:10:00.590
Why do they feel justified in starting yelling about targets?

189
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.150
Why does this keep happening?

190
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.150
And the reason this is going to sound absolutely insane,

191
00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:08.030
but it's actually true is that they believe that something like Starbucks has a

192
00:10:08.031 --> 00:10:10.580
big corporation. And when it comes into a neighborhood,

193
00:10:10.581 --> 00:10:13.550
it starts taking a resources, capitalist resources,

194
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:17.300
money from that neighborhood, and then dumping it into a corporation.

195
00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:19.460
And they see it as a form of violence against the neighborhood.

196
00:10:19.461 --> 00:10:23.150
So they're justified in using violence to disrupt that by throwing a brick

197
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:23.631
through the window,

198
00:10:23.631 --> 00:10:26.540
even though it's probably some franchise owners just trying to make a buck,

199
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.010
trying to have a job that runs it. That's crazy. Yeah. I mean, it's, it is,

200
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.460
that's, that's actually what the theoretical justification is with,

201
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.070
with regard to, to that aspect of the theories.

202
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.070
<v 2>People were actually doing this, know this, that, that's why they're doing it.</v>

203
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.630
Or, I mean, is this written.

204
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.120
<v 1>Anywhere? Yeah. The like the Antifa books are crazy.</v>

205
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:47.480
They talk about collection of capital, the P the, the, you know,

206
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:51.170
any kind of racist or sexist or whatever language as they want to determine it.

207
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.840
Being a form of violence, they call these things like epistemic violence.

208
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.500
In some of the literature, they call it discursive violence.

209
00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:00.950
And some of the literature, sometimes they just call it violence. In theory,

210
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.150
you know, calling somebody saying,

211
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:04.730
you're a man or a woman is called a violence of categorization.

212
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.690
So there's all these different types of violence that they're sort of marinading

213
00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:11.780
in this idea that these things that are happening the way people talk,

214
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.790
micro assault is a violence. And I mean, I even saw a thing.

215
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.790
Somebody sent me today from, uh, some university, Indiana,

216
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:23.330
maybe where the person saying that, uh, you know,

217
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.130
they were tearing down these physical monuments,

218
00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:29.600
but maybe we need to think about discursive. So verbal monuments,

219
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.980
and then in the middle of this, which is otherwise cracked, but, you know,

220
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:37.980
not violent. He actually says something to the effect of that. We,

221
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:40.820
we really need to be prepared to do violence against this violence.

222
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.140
And so they're marinading in these kinds of thoughts. So you get these like,

223
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.690
like with Antifa, what are these dudes? These dudes are like hopped up,

224
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:51.260
mostly young men trying to put out. I mean, there's some women in there too,

225
00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:51.920
of course,

226
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.440
but there's a lot of young who are like doing their young male rage and they're

227
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.610
off at society.

228
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:00.880
And they've read all these books saying how America sucks and how it hurts.

229
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.290
You know, all these, you know, poor people, it hurts, uh, you know, minorities.

230
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.730
And so on. A lot of people are feeling the sting, frankly, because the,

231
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:11.230
whatever, the Republican policies,

232
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:15.060
since Reagan have really kind of like put some squeeze on people. Well,

233
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:15.780
it's really.

234
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.470
<v 2>Amplified now because of COVID because they locked down.</v>

235
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.320
<v 1>Yeah. Exactly. And people are out of their minds are living on Twitter. Yeah.</v>

236
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.530
They're living on Twitter and also they're broke and they're exactly,

237
00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:27.090
you're losing your field justified.

238
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.730
<v 2>To loot. They feel justified to smash and Rob,</v>

239
00:12:29.731 --> 00:12:32.280
and it doesn't even have to really intellectualize it,

240
00:12:32.281 --> 00:12:34.290
or really like when the rationalizing this,

241
00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:35.910
they don't have to really make coaching points.

242
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.290
They just have to have like some iconic enemy in there. Right. We.

243
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.380
<v 1>Really should have saw target getting set on fire when target got deemed</v>

244
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:43.920
essential.

245
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.860
And the people started making a big deal about targets essential wise,

246
00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:51.540
target essential because you need to buy toilet paper. You Jesus Christ.

247
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.610
<v 2>That's right. What's weird is, um, I mean,</v>

248
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.070
it's just weird how quickly it happened.

249
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.350
<v 1>And it, it clearly.</v>

250
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.520
<v 2>Exacerbated by the lockdowns. That's right. One of the most amazing,</v>

251
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.130
like combination of events that happens in a perfect storm order.

252
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.660
<v 1>Right. And so it's okay. I'm not, let me start. Right. And this is already bad,</v>

253
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:15.750
but I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I don't actually buy into conspiracies,

254
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.080
but we are in a situation because of a lot of political currents for the last 50

255
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:23.190
years where there's a lot of billionaire philanthropist groups, right.

256
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.090
That generate a lot of money. They run a lot of think tanks. They run a lot of,

257
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:27.450
uh,

258
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.440
like policy forums and organizations and 5 0 1 C threes and so on and so forth

259
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.330
to study things and do these things,

260
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.100
the rapidity with which the materials like the,

261
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.440
the like Instagram ready tracks that you could read and the little videos,

262
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.820
the speed and that the educational curricula and the guides for here's a bunch

263
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:50.820
of resources for, for how to remake your, your business.

264
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.630
This stuff came out fast. So what I think is actually going on is, I mean,

265
00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:57.420
political operative types, wait for, I mean,

266
00:13:57.421 --> 00:13:59.520
the saying is never let a good crisis go to waste, right?

267
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.770
So they wait for a precipitating event.

268
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.020
And then they've been making easy digest materials for a long time

269
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.890
and paying people like, you know, Hey, come work for our forum.

270
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.030
What we really need to do is look at how we can get books for like anti-racist

271
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:17.130
toddler books, you know, anti racist kids.

272
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.500
And so they get people writing these books, and I think they're doing it.

273
00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:22.380
It's not like some, you know, boardroom nasty stuff.

274
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.180
And then these materials are just ready to go out fast.

275
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.910
And so this, we had, as you said, a perfect storm, COVID,

276
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.830
like codes everybody off the media has everybody off. Trump has everybody off.

277
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.620
It's like impossible to watch any of this and not be just off.

278
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.910
I have to be careful cause I actually start to get frustrated and emotional

279
00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:46.740
about it. Um, I, the, the amount of being lied to that's just so obvious,

280
00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:49.140
you know, through a lot of the news right now at these protests,

281
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:51.980
especially in riots, it was just galling. Well, the.

282
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.180
<v 2>Article that I showed you that shows that the COVID KickUp,</v>

283
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.330
the uptake in cases had nothing to do with black lives matter,

284
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.150
but plop probably had to do with people staying inside. Yeah.

285
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.660
<v 1>It's it's like gaslighting, man, but that's the craziest.</v>

286
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.170
<v 2>Gaslighting ever like, so why you making everybody stay inside then?</v>

287
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.810
Cause that means that the disease is going to get even worse. Right?

288
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:16.280
Like if we're being forced to lock in and shut down and shut and stay home,

289
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.900
that's gonna make the disease worse.

290
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.970
<v 1>Feel like which way does it go? And nobody knows. And then you live in this,</v>

291
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.590
like, I don't know what what's true about CRO COVID at all. Now it's like,

292
00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:29.230
you were allowed to go out and like groups less than 10,

293
00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:31.840
but not if you were protesting, then they could be up to a thousand or so.

294
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.490
I mean, it's like multiple thousands.

295
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.560
Like what in the world is going on once you're.

296
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.100
<v 2>Protesting and if, as long as it's a good cause everybody could die. Yeah,</v>

297
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.870
exactly. It's fine. That's because.

298
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.740
<v 1>Racism is the real virus is what they actually said. Um, well that's.</v>

299
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.880
<v 2>A real virus too, but, uh, that COVID, real. Trust me.</v>

300
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.080
It's it's I know, I know multiple people that have it right now. Okay.
