00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I got super high once. I think it was in the tank.</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.870
And when it came out, I had this idea that alien life,

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.840
if it wanted to communicate with us would come up with a way, a Lego,

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.350
a type of language that everyone could understand,

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.020
like a language that got right into your brain,

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.280
a language that instead of you having to interpret what the sounds mean and turn

7
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.820
them into words. It's some new kind of technology that allow like,

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.910
as they're making this sound, as they're putting out this signal,

9
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:37.740
it's going straight into you and you automatically understand it without

10
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.620
knowing what they're saying without having an actual, Bob said,

11
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:43.320
you guys should come to the spaceship instead of saying,

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.860
you know what it means without having hearing sound like,

13
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
you'll have to disassociate the idea of these sounds, meaning these words.

14
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:55.210
You'll just know what it means. Yeah. Oh, the movie. Yeah. That movie,

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.620
they didn't, they do it like visually was.

16
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.520
<v 1>Like, time doesn't matter. There's no sentences on memes and like.</v>

17
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.600
<v 0>Right. And it was like, they would spray black ink into the sky. Right.</v>

18
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.570
What did they do for Lang? Let me see what it looked like again. Yeah.

19
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.740
There it goes. They splayed spray black ink and it makes like weird patterns.

20
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.820
And that's how they, um, would communicate. Does that make sense? Yeah.

21
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.630
<v 2>Have you seen the new the trailer for tenant? Is that what it's called.</v>

22
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.800
<v 1>For that movie to come out for awhile? The lock down?</v>

23
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.470
<v 0>I think there's a guy named Ray Kurzweil and he's a brilliant guy who wants</v>

24
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:33.560
to live to be a thousand years old. And he's got this, um,

25
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.530
series of patents that he's come up with. I mean,

26
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:40.370
he's really like a legitimately genius guy and I got a chance to interview him

27
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:41.420
once a way back.

28
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.550
But one of the things that we talked about was he was talking about downloading

29
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:50.780
consciousness into a computer and they think that there's gonna come a point in

30
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:52.880
time where you will be terminal,

31
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:56.990
because you're going to figure out a way to take whoever Alan Makowski is and

32
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.960
put it in a computer and download it. And your material, body,

33
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.990
your physical body, your biological body won't mean anything anymore.

34
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:06.470
You're going to exist as you inside this,

35
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.440
this computer inside this thing,

36
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.690
I've always thought that that's probably what alien life is.

37
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.190
What alien life is,

38
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.280
is something that has gotten to the point where it doesn't need a physical form

39
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:21.500
anymore. Like whatever consciousness is,

40
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.400
they figured out a way to contain it and non-biological systems.

41
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.040
So they take whatever you are when you're born. And they,

42
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.350
but then the thing is like, how does that thing replicate?

43
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.740
What are they doing to make it? What are they doing? How,

44
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.740
what are they doing to make sure the power stays on? Like, what are they doing?

45
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.980
I think Cato probably squats.

46
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.580
I think life could be all kinds of shapes.

47
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.520
I think life could be like, there was some speculations.

48
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.180
The scientists were trying to figure out whether or not light could be a life

49
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:54.980
form. Like there could be forms of life that, or made entirely of light.

50
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.180
<v 2>Well everything's energy. Right?</v>

51
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.980
<v 0>I don't know if everything's energy. I don't know. I thought.</v>

52
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.230
<v 2>I'd throw that out. It makes sense. Really.</v>

53
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.940
<v 3>Lazy, but like we're made of energy, you know, um.</v>

54
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.790
<v 0>Of energy, but what,</v>

55
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.630
what do we think of as life we think of as like a frog or like a,

56
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.090
an Allie Makowski or Jamie Vernon. Yeah.

57
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.170
But it's possible that life might be like, I thought about ideas.

58
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.590
Like when you have an idea and then that idea gets in your head, like, man,

59
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:27.330
I like that idea. And then you, you start working to fulfill that idea.

60
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.060
You build a thing, like maybe you have an idea, like how to build a thing.

61
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.560
And then you build a thing. Like that's a thing that like forced you to make it.

62
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.410
It's like you had an idea that bumped jumped into your brain and then it's like,

63
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.670
listen, you need to make a canoe, like a canoe. How would I make it? You know,

64
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.880
you take a log, you're haul off the set and you roll around inside of it,

65
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.080
just go down the river.

66
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.860
And then all of a sudden this idea that pops into your head and you start doing

67
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:53.191
all the work.

68
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:57.930
Now you have a physical thing that literally allowed itself to be born by

69
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.520
getting this idea that invades your consciousness and tricks you into making

70
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:03.354
things.

71
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.750
<v 2>Doesn't that make you think that everything's already kind of decided like,</v>

72
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.720
you know, you have free will and control,

73
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:13.770
but to some extent everything's kind of already what's going to happen is going

74
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:14.604
to happen.

75
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.520
<v 0>That's not necessarily true. I think you do have free will,</v>

76
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:20.610
but I think you also, um, have determinism.

77
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.560
I think this is something that people have argued successfully where you,

78
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.570
you really have to take a step back and go, okay,

79
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:31.110
what do I think about a person's who a person is right now?

80
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.270
Like if I meet a person and uh,

81
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:37.530
I meet this woman and she saw up and she lies a lot and she likes to do drugs

82
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:40.860
and she does know what she's doing with her life. And she cries like, uh, oh,

83
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.040
get your together. Is that what you think? Like how, what,

84
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.870
what do you think when you meet a person like that,

85
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.670
do you take into consideration like, oh,

86
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:52.140
this is a person who is the granddaughter of alcoholics and it

87
00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:55.170
all boiled down to genetics and terrible.

88
00:04:55.171 --> 00:05:00.000
So all of her systems that came online when she was two and five and six,

89
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.580
they all came online. During alcoholic households,

90
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.690
people were physically abusive and you're hiding in the corner of your bedroom.

91
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:10.110
And it was all chaos and drink drinking when you're 12,

92
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.510
like when you get to that 35 year old person,

93
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.540
and they've gone through this insane pattern without any intervention, nothing,

94
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.620
nothing switched. How much of their life are they really responsible for?

95
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.530
It's a real question. It's like, who are you?

96
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.620
You are the combination of all the things that have ever happened to you,

97
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.940
your genetics, all the weird that you inherit from your parents.

98
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.000
If you inherited a lot of ideas, they think even from your parents,

99
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.420
not just like learn from them, but actually inherit these ideas.

100
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.260
And then you do the best with what you got.

101
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.740
And some peoples got is terrible.

102
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.140
<v 2>Yeah. Do you think we're living in a simulation? I'm too dumb.</v>

103
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.180
<v 3>Same to.</v>

104
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.860
<v 0>To take that into consideration, but I think it, um,</v>

105
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.320
legitimately weird does, it seems like it changes too much.

106
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.240
Like reality itself changes too much. Yeah.

107
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.340
And things come up that seem like if there was going to be a simulation,

108
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.320
this is how it would go down. Like,

109
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.580
like I remember when I first started reading about simulation theory was right

110
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:24.380
around the time where a Anthony Wiener got busted for sending

111
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:27.800
pictures of his deck. I'm like, what are the odds? Yeah. Like that seems like.

112
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.830
<v 2>It's so on the nose.</v>

113
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.590
<v 0>If your name was Wiener, you'd avoid showing people, your heart castrate.</v>

114
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.640
<v 2>Yourself. No more Wiener. But if we're going to.</v>

115
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.740
<v 0>Come up with one someday, not obviously not you and me,</v>

116
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.260
but someone really smart is going to come up with a simulation.

117
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.980
It's going to eventually get good enough where you can't tell that you're in a

118
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:51.910
simulation. That's, what's up. What's up. Is it?

119
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.230
If it isn't here, it's coming. Yeah. This took me a long time.

120
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.960
Like I had a conversation with this guy, Nick Bostrom.

121
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.820
Who's a brilliant guy who is a big proponent of

122
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.750
this concept. And he,

123
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.060
he was explaining it through like probability theory.

124
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.430
And that was a little too dumb to understand what he was saying.

125
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.940
But basically what you're saying is if you do, if,

126
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.770
if it's possible that someday someone essentially I'm paraphrasing someday,

127
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.480
we'll have a simulation. Like how, what are the odds that this is simulating?

128
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.420
It's more likely that this is a simulation.

129
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.320
<v 2>Than not. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.610
You just got to pray that whoever's doing the simulation is looking out for you.

131
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.360
<v 0>The other possibility is that we know the simulations coming.</v>

132
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.630
That's the other possibility. And that's why everybody's freaked out.

133
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.750
Everybody's freaked out because even though it's not here, it's inevitable.

134
00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:46.240
If you follow the pattern of innovation,

135
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.590
if you go from pioneers to people, live in cities,

136
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.790
to cell phones and internet and space force,

137
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.960
and you just keep going.

138
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.590
Eventually you get to a point where someone figures out how to make an

139
00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:02.260
artificial version of life, whether it's Ray Kurzweil's thing,

140
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.210
where it downloads you in your computer,

141
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.690
or there's a thing you sit and connect to. There's some,

142
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.823
someone's going to come up with something.

143
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.520
<v 2>I know that we were in the simulation when it happens or it would just like ease</v>

144
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:12.840
into.

145
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.880
<v 0>It. You don't want that. You want something where it's crazy.</v>

146
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.630
You don't even know you're in it. Like, am I, God, am I in the simulation?

147
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.430
I don't know. That's the best simulation. The best simulation is you.

148
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.880
You have no idea. You're locked completely into it.

149
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.920
So that's where our problem lies.

150
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:34.000
We don't know if that's actually going on right now. Like for Trump,

151
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.750
if somebody brought Trump aside, like sat, Trump aside said, Mr. Trump,

152
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.670
all of this seems highly unlikely. It doesn't it. Well, here's why. Yeah.

153
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.650
You are in a simulation. This simulation was started 78 years ago.

154
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.440
And this is the pattern that plays out you you're,

155
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:54.810
you're given a large amount of money to, uh, start your own businesses.

156
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.630
You're going to put your name on everything. You're going to be the best,

157
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.000
the best, the best, but you have crazy hair, but that's okay.

158
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.050
You just spray it down. You're good. You have a few flaws in your life.

159
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.970
People are mad at you though, but you gonna be the best.

160
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.120
You gonna have the best things, the biggest you of the business, you know,

161
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.750
everything's going to be amazing. And then you, you come up to them and like,

162
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.480
you wake them up and you say this, and this seems crazy.

163
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.440
It seems crazy because it is. And, uh, you, uh,

164
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.650
settled upon a very bizarre pattern in your simulation.

165
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.710
And this is how it came out. And everyone else is mad at you,

166
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:29.160
but they don't understand this. Wasn't your fault. You didn't mean to.

167
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.030
But then you think of all the things that we counted before, like poverty,

168
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.920
abuse, drug, addict, parents,

169
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:36.960
all the different things that make a person who they are. Right.

170
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.510
Those are really kind of like

171
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.860
factors in. If you had a game,

172
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.880
like if you were playing some sort of a large scale role-playing game,

173
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:49.530
you're like, what is my character going to be like, oh,

174
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:53.040
your character is a barbarian. You're in the matrix. That's three showing me.

175
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.120
<v 1>Describing, like when Morpheus talks to Neo, he was like, Hey, what do you,</v>

176
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:58.530
what do you think it is?

177
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.290
<v 0>It's scent. Yeah. It is like that. And it is essentially what it will be. If we,</v>

178
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.050
if we're, we're staying in this human form, essentially,

179
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:11.460
someone's going to figure out a way to put a helmet on you or put a spike in the

180
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:12.181
back of your head.

181
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:15.990
That like locks your central nervous system into this gigantic computer that

182
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.100
starts sending signals to your brain and tricks your brain to thinking it's

183
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:24.000
riding on a horse through the SA, the Saudi Arabian desert.

184
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.770
It's going to come. It's just whether or not it's here yet. It's going to come.

185
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.380
They're going to keep making things. If we don't blow each other up,

186
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.440
there's going to be a cell phone that lets you, see God you're going to,

187
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:38.210
you're going like call God. And God's going to be in front of you, hugging you,

188
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.063
giving you love.

189
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.280
<v 2>Psychedelics were kind of like, yeah, well that could be, we're.</v>

190
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.890
<v 0>Trying to recreate what we're trying to get to.</v>

191
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:50.120
It could be like a state that's similar to what exists already in nature.

192
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.420
Like maybe they're interconnected in some sort of a way like maybe someone will

193
00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:57.380
figure out maybe someone who is anti-drug will figure out a way to recreate

194
00:10:57.381 --> 00:11:01.610
psychedelic experiences using only technology that interfaces with your brain

195
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:02.630
and turns on those chemicals.

196
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:10.520
[inaudible].
