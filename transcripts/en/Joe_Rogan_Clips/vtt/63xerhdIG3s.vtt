00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So who makes sense to you is Bernie makes.</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.280
<v 1>Bernie is my guy. Bernie's my guy through and through. And I'll tell you why,</v>

3
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:11.100
because a, we need Medicare for all.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.240
We need to abolish student debt and that you just tax wall street gambling,

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.090
done Medicare for all cut the military budget done.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.570
I don't want to live in a country where people are rationing insulin.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.020
I don't want to live in a country where half of the GoFundMe campaigns are

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.470
because people are going to die. If they don't get donations for healthcare,

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.670
what is wrong with this country? Um, but back to Bernie, I mean,

10
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.340
you look at the last 30 years of political advocacy.

11
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.120
This is a guy who's been saying the same thing for 30 straight years.

12
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:43.740
No matter if it's veterans writes about Gulf war syndrome, um,

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.470
about just a political revolution as needed. I mean,

14
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:50.130
he's been talking about that since he won the Senate seat initially,

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.130
and you can't really say the same thing about any other candidate.

16
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:55.560
And I do like what Tulsi Gabbard is saying.

17
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.110
And I do like some of the things Elizabeth Warren saying,

18
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.380
but it seems like she's just making it up on the fly and adopting kind of Bernie

19
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.513
light policies.

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.780
And I think this is all a strategy to siphon all the delegates away from Bernie,

21
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.090
because we already know this third way.

22
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.520
Corporate wall street funded organization.

23
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.690
That's like corporate Democrats have said they want anyone, but Bernie,

24
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.450
Bernie is the biggest threat to the establishment by far.

25
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.990
<v 0>Did you see when Charlemagne called Elizabeth Warren,</v>

26
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:23.790
the original Rachel Dolezal.

27
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.240
<v 1>Uh, to her fancy, she's not, she doesn't have a chance.</v>

28
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.580
She doesn't have a chance with the Trump's.

29
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.040
All Trump has to say is Pocahontas over and over again.

30
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.160
<v 0>I say, Pocahontas is racist. Um, it's a Disney movie.</v>

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.160
How could Pocahontas be raised?

32
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.320
<v 1>Really.</v>

33
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.030
<v 0>Really screwed up. That's a big up. It's a really wound up getting the DNA test.</v>

34
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.040
I am 200 times more African than she is native American.

35
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.770
I'm 1.6% again.

36
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.360
<v 1>Oh man, that ego of these people, it's like, she's just so upset that Trump.</v>

37
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.260
Yeah. I mean, I.

38
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.280
<v 0>That's that she went and got jobs saying she was native American.</v>

39
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.970
<v 1>I mean, yeah. It's one thing to say. I have native American blood.</v>

40
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.610
It's another thing. And I don't know how much, you know,

41
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:15.180
ancestry native American ancestors she has. But I do know that she was,

42
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.020
you know, that was on like her Harvard bio and all this stuff.

43
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:21.650
And it's just like, what is going on? Well, Jamie is.

44
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.600
<v 0>James talked about it. He didn't</v>

45
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.153
[inaudible] he got into.

46
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.850
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

47
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.280
<v 0>But he thought he was a lot of people thought he was my,</v>

48
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:38.610
my wife thought she was my wife thought she was part native American.

49
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.240
So she got her DNA done. She's like, oh a bunch of liars.

50
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.940
<v 1>With Warren's more native Americans. That.</v>

51
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.820
<v 0>Was a thing. I think my wife's still more native American. She's a little bit,</v>

52
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.260
but that was a thing where people were like,

53
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.770
they wanted it to be spiritual. They would say they were part native American.

54
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.980
They wanted to be extra cool. Well, my native American blood, oh, I can,

55
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.910
I smell. And wolves are coming. You can put your ear to the ground.

56
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.830
He know what it's going to rain. Like they're more connected to nature.

57
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.290
It's like some weird thing I remember in high school,

58
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.240
like when kids wanted it to be cool,

59
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.690
they would say they were part native American. You're like, ah, wow.

60
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.200
<v 1>Native American community came out after she got the DNA test. And they said,</v>

61
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.610
this is not, this does not make you native, native as much more than like,

62
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.550
whatever percentage of your blood. I mean, native is a, you know,

63
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:29.680
it's a way of life. It's, it's a culture.

64
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.690
And they were in there and it was really kind of, um, gross.

65
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.910
That whole thing was just bizarre.

66
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.610
<v 0>It was grosses. Even after the testing,</v>

67
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.820
she was trying to use that as proof that she was correct.

68
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.020
And then people will analyze the data. Like, are you crazy? You know, small,

69
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.020
this percentages, this is an insanely small percentage.

70
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.350
But she was saying that Trump needed to give her a million dollars because of

71
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:55.060
the fact that she did take the test, like.

72
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.990
<v 1>It was insulting to the native community. It was embarrassing all around.</v>

73
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.860
And it was also just weird that she even did it at the behest of Trump. Like,

74
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.930
why did you do that? You got.

75
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.580
<v 0>Yeah, but he hadn't, she had to do it.</v>

76
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.560
Cause he kept saying it over and over and over again.

77
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.810
I feel like she's a politician.

78
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.320
And I say that in the most unflattering of terms,

79
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.860
I feel like she's one of those people that just says what needs to be said in

80
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.930
order to get away. That's what it seems like,

81
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.050
where I don't get that impression from Tulsi at all. I don't,

82
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:24.640
I don't feel like that's who she is.

83
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.800
I feel like she's a veteran who did two tours in the middle

84
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:34.420
east and who's a Congresswoman from Hawaii who really wants to do good. I mean,

85
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:38.230
I really do think that what she's, she doesn't take any corporate money. None.

86
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.820
She wants this.

87
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.290
She wants this job because she thinks she can do a better job than what has been

88
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.870
done before. And the other people that are running for it, I really believe her.

89
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.900
I mean, she's, she makes sense to me. What do you think about Bernie?

90
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.200
I like a lot of things. Bernie says, uh, you know,

91
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:55.570
one of the things interesting now that people are mad at him and he's rich,

92
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.750
right? But he made a lot of money off his book and they said,

93
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:01.840
you go write your own book, your own money.

94
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.380
I mean, there's a lot of, you know, criticisms that people lobby against him.

95
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.150
What I like about him socially is that what

96
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:16.210
he is standing for is the downtrodden.

97
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.570
He's standing for the people that are dead. Don't catch a good break.

98
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.900
When he starts talking about things like income, inequality, I always say,

99
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.980
I'm like, okay, I understand what you're doing and why you're saying you put,

100
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.700
what is the cause of income inequality? Like what, that's,

101
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:34.060
what we need to find out. We need to find out what's the cause. Like why,

102
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:37.570
why are these poor communities the way they are and why that needs to be helped?

103
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.860
That needs to be fixed. There's so much that can be done. That's not being done.

104
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:44.680
And at least he seems to be,

105
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.090
he seems to be calling out to the people that are,

106
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.420
are ignored that, you know, aren't,

107
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.240
aren't being served by wall street.

108
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.000
<v 1>Right? I mean, a big problem is when automation happened, um,</v>

109
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.860
wages stopped going up with inflation and then credit subsidized

110
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:05.660
all of the wages.

111
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.870
And that's why people are just indebted to credit credit card companies were,

112
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.560
you know, up to our ears in debt and that, and he does talk about that.

113
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.050
And he talks about the solutions to that, but you're totally right. I mean,

114
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.270
what other candidate of these 25 people are discussing

115
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.700
things that are going to reach like a populist, you know,

116
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.550
have a populous message that are reaching.

117
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.820
<v 0>Andrew Yang is I'd like what Andrew Yang saying? He, again,</v>

118
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:32.030
like Tulsi does not seem like a politician. I believe him.

119
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.600
He's an entrepreneur and a businessman and he's warning everyone. He's,

120
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.670
he's like the Paul Revere of automation. He's like, you know, look,

121
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:43.370
artificial intelligence is coming and you're going to be out of jobs.

122
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.770
The half the country is going to be out of jobs.

123
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.860
And we can actually figure out a way to get through this.

124
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.460
And there's a bridge that we can make. And through this universal income,

125
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.600
universal basic income,

126
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.440
you can develop a bridge where you can give people their basic needs, food,

127
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.600
water, shelter, give them food,

128
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.560
like make sure that no one's starving that even though people are out of jobs,

129
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.390
make sure that their needs are met.

130
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.230
So then they can go and find a way through this mess and then figure out a way

131
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:12.590
to contribute and make an income and make a, make a living and adjust.

132
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.100
But to have nothing to have nothing, like what, what is that like,

133
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.630
you can't just have people out of work because of automation and people go back

134
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:24.380
to the industrial age. Well, Hey, that happened during this and that. And yeah.

135
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.280
Okay. It did it then,

136
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:28.720
but it didn't work out well for all those people that lost those jobs back then

137
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.061
we should,

138
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:33.860
we shouldn't have to go through that massive chaotic situation again,

139
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:36.110
if there's a way to engineer a better way through it.

140
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.230
I don't know if universal basic income works. Um, you know,

141
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.470
I've talked to a lot of people that think like a novel, uh,

142
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.480
he was on my podcast recently and his perspective is it doesn't give people

143
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:50.870
meaning, and it's not a good idea cause you need a life.

144
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.020
If you want people to be happy and you want to be able to do something,

145
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.830
they need to have meaning in their time and what they do just to give people

146
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:59.450
money. It's not going to make people happy.

147
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.250
<v 1>Yeah. I think it's a band-aid. Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:05.840
I think it's a band-aid I agree with the concept that yang proposes about UBI,

149
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.291
but yeah,

150
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:10.520
I think that if we give people like healthcare and have their basic needs met,

151
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.990
then not, it's going to give them the ability in them like to maneuver,

152
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:19.160
to find their passion and to be able to have that space where they can fulfill

153
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:19.910
their lives.

154
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.700
<v 0>Yes. And I think there's a way to do both.</v>

155
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.640
There's a way to find meaning and have your needs kept. I mean,

156
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.330
the idea is that gee, you know, it's,

157
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.470
I don't think that people should get free money to the point where they could

158
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:34.350
live a, a,

159
00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:39.200
a full rich life and go on vacations and have

160
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.900
a nice car and a nice house. Never have to work again.

161
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.960
It doesn't make any sense. You should, you should contribute, right.

162
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:47.510
Everyone should contribute. But if you're in a job,

163
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:51.470
that's going to be completely annihilated by automation and artificial

164
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:54.740
intelligence. It makes sense that as a community, as a,

165
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.620
we should figure out a way to give people money so that they can have a place to

166
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.220
live and food, and then try to come up with,

167
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.540
and sort of engineer some sort of a program to help people find new ways of

168
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.200
income, new ways of making living. I don't know what that would be, you know?

169
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.230
And, and when I talked to Tulsi about that, she didn't know what that would be.

170
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:16.770
Either this idea of trying to promote new jobs. People say that we're going to,

171
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.100
we're going to create new jobs. Like I hate that expression. Like,

172
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.560
what does that mean? If there's not a job, how are you going to create?

173
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.730
<v 1>We'll look at our infrastructure. I mean, God. I mean, good God.</v>

174
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.803
We've been giving an,

175
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.100
an F like every year by the army Corps of engineers and fallen apart, dude.

176
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:34.500
I mean, look at the new deal. Look at what FDR did.

177
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:35.790
And that's what Bernie keeps saying. He's like,

178
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.720
I'm literally in stating and economic bill of rights that FDR did a hundred

179
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:40.554
years ago.

180
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.550
Why am I considered a radical extremist when I'm just trying to give people

181
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:49.050
basic economic rights and trying to propose jobs to

182
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:53.250
rebuild this country? What happened to that promise that Trump levied.
