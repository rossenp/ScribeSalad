00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So, so one of the things that, that were, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.440
key on because, uh,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.240
our fertility program is carbon and that's what feeds the soil carbon, right?

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.240
Not 10 tint and chemical fertilizer, carbon.

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.920
And so that aren't use fertilizers at all. No, no, we don't. We don't.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.570
So just manure and,

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.820
but we have a big industrial chipper.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.940
You'd love this machine. I mean, it's the ultimate, you know, boy toy,

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.840
it's 120 horsepower diesel engine that can,

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.690
that can chip 19 inch.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.310
You can take a 40 foot tree and just Huck it in there. And it just wore,

12
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.220
you know, just chips that he knows online. All right. Well, I mean, they're,

13
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.180
they're like the coolest machine that scares the out of me. All right. So, so,

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.950
but, but that's the Fargo that that's our fertilizer factory.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.830
Okay. So carbon. So,

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.760
so we integrate forest with open land and,

17
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.800
and we integrate the carbon, uh, from the forest.

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.240
So we cut junk trees, dead trees, crooked trees, weak trees,

19
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.140
and thin the forest.

20
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.760
And that enables the good trees,

21
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:25.620
the healthy trees to grow more vigorously, better reduces fire,

22
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.560
uh, potential because you're, you know, you're thinning it out,

23
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.970
taking out all the dead stuff.

24
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.640
And that then becomes our carbon base for bedding the

25
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.850
animals for, you know, and for all the composting that we do. And we do,

26
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.560
you know, mountains and mountains of compost,

27
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.630
where I'm going with this is when we talk about costs

28
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.160
right now, how much has our country spending fighting wildfires?

29
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.720
And how much are we losing fighting all these? I mean, we're in California,

30
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710
right? I mean, look at the, the devastation that fires have caused. Imagine,

31
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.690
imagine if those,

32
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:05.010
if we had thousands of

33
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.650
people with chippers,

34
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.500
thinning the forest,

35
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.740
turning them into almost park-like like they were before the Europeans came,

36
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.730
the native Americans kept them going with, you know, with fire, but there were,

37
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.230
there was megafauna here, megafauna. And so we graze through,

38
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.350
we convert a lot of it into, you know,

39
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.120
silvopasture widely spaced trees that are growing unimpeded, uh, with,

40
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:37.080
with grazing animals underneath so that there's no fire damage.

41
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:38.520
There's no buildup of fuel.

42
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.840
And suddenly we're producing our own food.

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.060
And we're eliminating the danger of wildfire with technology called chainsaws

44
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:52.650
and chippers. And that carbon becomes the fertility for the vineyards and the,

45
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.520
and the, the agricultural lands. It feeds the soil.

46
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:59.010
So now we have earthworms instead of hard soil.

47
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.920
We don't have erosion because our organic matter is up on our farm.

48
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.560
Using these principles we've gone in,

49
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.330
we've gone from 1% organic matter to over 8% organic

50
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:11.830
matter in the soil.

51
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.600
And every 1% holds another 20,000 gallons of water per acre.

52
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.630
Whoa. So, so if we,

53
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.190
so if w so,

54
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.410
and our 60 years of being there in the shadow at Polyface, um,

55
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.020
we have gone from 1% to eight, over 8%. Let's just say that's seven clicks.

56
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.880
Seven times 20 is 140,000 gallons of water per acre.

57
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.120
Now that we can hold that we couldn't hold before.

58
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.270
And it's because of the grazing,

59
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.880
the perennials and the composting,

60
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.840
that's building up the organic matter in the soil that could be done in

61
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.260
California. When you start talking about holding water,

62
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.090
it's not just about how much rainfall are we getting it's how much are we

63
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:05.620
actually holding in the sponge, uh, to reduce, you know, flooding and runoff.

64
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.380
<v 1>But things like that.</v>

65
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.970
So it sounds like your method could keep from the situation they

66
00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:13.430
find with some farms of the roading, top soil,

67
00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:16.730
where they have to constantly supplement, but how would you,

68
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.890
how do you grow enough corn? Like,

69
00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:22.730
if you want to have like those monocrop agricultural fields where you see

70
00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:26.660
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of acres of corn, just corn,

71
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.930
or just soy beans, or just alfalfa, whatever it is like,

72
00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:31.910
if you want to do those monocrop things, you,

73
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.710
how are you going to re fertilize the soil in the same manner with that?

74
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.490
You don't have.

75
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.300
<v 0>A scale.</v>

76
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.100
<v 1>You don't have them, you don't have those tomorrow.</v>

77
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.210
<v 0>Agriculture there's solutions. There's um, uh, now corn,</v>

78
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.780
corn is an amazing plant. So our soybeans, so I'm not all I'm saying,

79
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:52.190
is that right now, our corn crop, uh, in, in the U S what is it?

80
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:56.150
30% goes to, goes to alcohol for fuel. Well,

81
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.300
that takes more energy than the, uh, than the fuel we get.

82
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.100
<v 1>So ethanol ethanol.</v>

83
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.300
<v 0>We don't need.</v>

84
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.133
<v 1>That.</v>

85
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.700
Ethanol is a by-product of what we use to think that we needed ethanol.

86
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.480
<v 0>We've run out of gas. Right, right. So,</v>

87
00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:15.590
so that's not, uh, that's not necessary. Okay.

88
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.670
So that fracking.

89
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.700
<v 1>Yeah. So, so w w so that's not good either though.</v>

90
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.320
<v 0>No. So w we don't need, we don't need to grow that corn. Well, you know, um, uh,</v>

91
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.620
you know, come on electric vehicles and, and that, I mean, that's all,

92
00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:30.140
that's changing the landscape a lot, but.

93
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.450
<v 1>It isn't a lot of it for agriculture.</v>

94
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.250
<v 0>Well, yeah. So, so, so, so then the next is to feed, to feed cattle.</v>

95
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.360
So another huge percentage, like 20% goes to feed cattle,

96
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.460
and then another huge percent goes to hogs and chickens, of course, but the,

97
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.350
one of the problems with the hogs and chickens is that they are not integrated

98
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.990
with the food system. So right now, right now,

99
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.870
I'm 50, almost 50%. It's arguable.

100
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:02.810
You know who, what statistician, again, figures, lie and liars figure.

101
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:07.790
But somewhere between 40 and 50% of human edible food

102
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:12.680
on the planet is never eaten by a human it spoils it's thrown

103
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.514
away.

104
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.170
And 75% of everything that goes into landfills is biodegradable.

105
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.720
So when you start matching up the waste, the waste streams and the loss,

106
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.670
the losses in our food system and our waste streams,

107
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.860
what happens is very quickly, you start seeing that it's the segregated,

108
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.580
it's this, it's this single species, single crop,

109
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.600
single segregated notion where,

110
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.150
where it's not related, it's not symbiotic.

111
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.470
It's not synergistic that actually creates the problem.

112
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.540
A city in Belgium. This was,

113
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.770
this was articulated in pat foreman's wonderful book. The title is city chicks.

114
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.810
And she talks, she's talking about urban chickens.

115
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.750
The city in Belgium offered three chickens per household to

116
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:04.460
anybody that wanted a chicken.

117
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.510
And they had 2000 families raise their hands, says, yeah,

118
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.470
we'll take three chickens.

119
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:13.100
So they got 6,000 chickens distributed them through this, to the city.

120
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.230
And in the first month it dropped a hundred tons of food

121
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:21.050
waste to the landfill. What,

122
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.220
and so not only did they eliminate the, the landfill waste,

123
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.380
all these people now suddenly had chickens,

124
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.030
and Pat's done all the math on this and shows that if one in three households

125
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.110
had enough chickens to eat your kitchen scraps, there would not be a,

126
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.960
there would not be an egg industry in the United States.

127
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.860
It would be completely non-essential really.

128
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.680
So that's the power of integration.

129
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.970
That's the power of, of, of proximate,

130
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:52.820
of actual putting stuff close, you know?

131
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.880
So there wasn't a generic industry because everyone would be growing.

132
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.630
Everybody had their own eggs. Wow. Yeah, yeah.

133
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.380
And the landfills that landfill would get way, way less material.

134
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.330
And so, so then, so then the chickens don't need the corn from the corn fields.

135
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.130
So the fields can be turned back into Prairie to feed herbivores,

136
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.420
which now would be cows, not bison, but that's our,

137
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.910
that's our earth before of, of value.

138
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.620
And so now you're at perennials instead of annuals and perennials,

139
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:27.980
instead of annuals, perennials put energy in the soil,

140
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.620
annuals extract energy from the soil.

141
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.970
So now suddenly you're producing you're instead of producing

142
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.040
an annual fertilized with petroleum

143
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.070
to feed beef for somebody else. Instead,

144
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.340
you're not growing the corn, you don't need the tractor,

145
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.240
you don't need the petroleum, the cows fertilize it themselves.

146
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.520
And the perennial builds a soil like it did with the bison.

147
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.620
And you have the beef instead of coming out on feed lot,

148
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.070
it's coming off the Prairie like the bison did,

149
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.940
and suddenly you're building soils that are losing soil and your production

150
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.620
doesn't change one iota.

151
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.540
It doesn't take any more land to produce the beef with what I've described

152
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.210
than what it does with corn. It doesn't take any more land.

153
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.520
<v 1>Okay. So you're, you're,</v>

154
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.780
you're essentially saying that they have to convert to not just growing corn.

155
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.280
That's right. They're going to have to do a.

156
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.700
<v 0>Right that's right. Corn, corn is, I mean,</v>

157
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.430
that kind of monocrop mano speciated thing is,

158
00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:35.760
is a complete, I mean,

159
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:40.230
we S we started the interview talking about standing on nature on her neck,

160
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:42.390
you know, that is, uh,

161
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.490
a quintessential example of standing on nature's

162
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:49.680
neck. And, um, you know,

163
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.220
the reason our farm was so deteriorated when we came to it was because we're in,

164
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.090
we're in Virginia Shenandoah valley. And, um, you know,

165
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.360
that was the bread basket of the Confederacy during the civil war,

166
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:03.030
if you know your history. And, um, and,

167
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:05.310
and essentially the war was finally one when,

168
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.290
when they burned all the crops in the Shenandoah valley. And, and,

169
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.840
and during that time,

170
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.730
the valley lost somewhere between three and five feet of soil

171
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.800
during that, that time period. So the soils are worn out,

172
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.520
and then we got the westward expansion and it all moved to Ohio and Indiana.

173
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.820
And then finally the Dakotas and, you know, kept heading west. So this,

174
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:34.680
this head west head west young man head west was partly because our agriculture

175
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.370
destroyed the soils. And if we don't,

176
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:42.450
if we don't start using our agriculture to build soils,

177
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.210
we have a lot more to worry about than, uh, than a, than a COVID-19 deal.

178
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.100
A lot more to worry about.

179
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.020
If we don't figure out a way to produce food abundantly and grow soil while

180
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:55.854
we're doing it,

181
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.800
the pandemic is going to be the least of our concerns.
