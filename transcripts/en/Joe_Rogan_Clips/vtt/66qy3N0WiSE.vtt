WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.100
there was another thing that was deceptive or at least it confused

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.910
people.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.720
That's when they made them eat a bean burrito and they checked their blood.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.950
Yeah. Cloudy blood that's. That was,

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.100
I was just sitting there shaking my head going, what in the are you doing?

7
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:21.570
This has nothing to do with health.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.300
<v 1>So again, not a peer reviewed experiment,</v>

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.450
something that was or controlled study in any way,

10
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:31.080
just something that they did in the film. Um, so yeah,

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.560
th they fed the burritos, you know, with me, without me.

12
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.370
And they measured their blood afterwards. Big surprise.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.930
If the people who ate meat,

14
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:43.350
which has more fat and more saturated fat had cloudier blood, well,

15
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:44.280
that's normal.

16
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.060
That's just naturally what you would expect from the process of eating feed.

17
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.600
You will temporarily have more fat in your blood has nothing to do.

18
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.660
<v 0>With health. So what is the big question might actually go.</v>

19
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.040
<v 1>Better? Why might be better for you? And so then I went and I thought, okay,</v>

20
00:00:59.041 --> 00:00:59.221
well,

21
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:03.090
what does the peer reviewed research show about animal protein and endothelial

22
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:03.630
function?

23
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.470
Cause their claim was that eating the animal protein reduces your endothelial

24
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:11.640
functioning and it increases in inflammation. So, um,

25
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.650
this, I, there, there was one, um,

26
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.710
study that a lot of the,

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.110
there are a couple of studies that show a low carb diet,

28
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:25.830
impairs endothelial function, but they tend to be short term, like four weeks.

29
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.260
I, I looked for longer-term studies.

30
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.730
There was a 2009 study that followed subjects for 12 weeks.

31
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:36.570
And they found the low carb diet actually improved endothelial function,

32
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.610
whereas a low fat diet decreased it.

33
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.230
And then there was a 2007 study that followed subjects for a year.

34
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.530
And there was no change in endothelial function on a low carb diet.

35
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.150
We actually there's strong evidence that high blood sugar and insulin resistance

36
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.600
impair endothelial function. So, you know,

37
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:58.740
a low carb diet that would lower your blood sugar and improve insulin resistance

38
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:02.850
would be expected to improve it from that perspective. So again,

39
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.390
when you look at the actual science, the actual peer reviewed research,

40
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:08.400
you don't see that relationship that they're talking.

41
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.010
<v 0>They didn't even, I mean, when they're showing it to you,</v>

42
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:15.060
it's just scare tactics. They're not, they're not talking about what that means.

43
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.840
<v 1>Yeah. People see it and they're like, oh my God, the blood is cloud.</v>

44
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.360
Even the football players who were in the experiment, they were, they were like,

45
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.320
oh wow, I'm not going to eat my KFC or Popeye's anymore. And I'm like, well,

46
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.520
you probably shouldn't, but it's not for that reason. Right. You know.

47
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.860
<v 0>Saturated fat is the demon, right. That keeps getting addressed.</v>

48
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:36.330
Explain why saturated fat is not only healthy,

49
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.950
but probably necessary.

50
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.710
<v 1>Well, I don't know that it's necessary, but I would, I would say that, you know,</v>

51
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.980
well.

52
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.930
<v 0>I should say cholesterol is necessary. Well.</v>

53
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.990
<v 1>Cholesterol is necessary. Um,</v>

54
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.920
and our body makes it to actually most of the cholesterol that we have in our

55
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.960
body, we manufacturer, uh,

56
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.100
it doesn't come from the diet about 30% comes from the diet about 70.

57
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.480
We make it,

58
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.230
the exact ratio varies depending on the person. And you know,

59
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.990
some people are hyper responders of dietary cholesterol.

60
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.530
So they'll absorb more from food, but it's, you know,

61
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.600
it plays a vital role in the body.

62
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:18.070
There's a genetic disease called Smith Lemley opiates syndrome,

63
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:22.480
which results in severe cholesterol deficiency. And it's, it's fatal.

64
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.770
So you die with not enough cholesterol. I'm not.

65
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.520
However, one of these people on the other end of the spectrum that thinks, Hey,

66
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:34.120
if your cholesterol is four 50, don't worry. No problem. There's, you know,

67
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.700
like, you know, just write it off.

68
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.390
I think the truth is somewhere in the middle and it's biological.

69
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.140
<v 0>Variable.</v>

70
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.340
<v 1>It's variable. Yeah. And you can get, I, and I see this, I, you know,</v>

71
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.770
I've been working with patients for over 10 years.

72
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.430
I test every single person that comes through the door with a full lipid panel.

73
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.260
And I have people who are doing keto super low carb diets who have

74
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.480
totally optimal normal cholesterol.

75
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.680
And then I have people who go from eating, you know, a low,

76
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.820
moderate, fat diet to like a high fat keto or low carb diet.

77
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:11.320
And their LDL P goes up to 25 or a hundred or 3000.

78
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.140
And their LDL cholesterol goes up to 300.

79
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.600
So yeah. I mean, what I can S I think what, stepping back a little bit,

80
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.350
as we talked about this with Juul, but cholesterol for decades was,

81
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.380
is it was the boogeyman, you know,

82
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.640
you sh it was like that led to like egg white omelets and boneless,

83
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:32.830
skinless chicken breast, and, you know,

84
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.700
bagels with nothing on them when I was growing up.

85
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.290
And now even the margarine margarine. Oh my God.

86
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.940
I can't believe it's not butter.

87
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.340
<v 0>I thought it was better than butter.</v>

88
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.290
<v 1>Where it's like, rats won't even eat if you leave it out in the garage. Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.210
Um, yeah. So batteries.

90
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.980
<v 0>They won't eat margarine.</v>

91
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.340
<v 1>That's what I've heard. I've never done this experiment experiment, do it.</v>

92
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.730
Otherwise.

93
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.810
<v 0>We're pushing.</v>

94
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.740
<v 1>Out this information as well, propaganda. Um, so yeah, you know,</v>

95
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:10.720
the us quietly actually removed the limitation of dietary

96
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.840
cholesterol. They used to limit it to 300 milligrams. Um,

97
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.030
now that they don't have that anymore,

98
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.210
because the evidence didn't justify having that in the dietary guidelines,

99
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:21.460
we were the last industrialized country to do that.

100
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:26.110
Every other company country had done that years ago. Um, but because,

101
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.340
you know, the, uh, how entrenched that was in our country. And I think,

102
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.310
you know, th they don't want to lose credibility. It's like,

103
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.520
they've been saying not to do something for so long then to turn around and say,

104
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:40.530
actually, right, there's no evidence to support that. It's, it's,

105
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:41.650
it's you lose face.

106
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.990
<v 0>And when people talk about saturated fat,</v>

107
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.640
and they talk about it as being only a, a meat or animal, uh,

108
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.220
diet issue, um,

109
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.920
one thing that I always like to bring up is avocados.

110
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.820
<v 0>There's a certain amount of unsaturated fat and saturated fat.</v>

112
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.450
<v 1>Every food has all three fats in some proportion.</v>

113
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.250
So you have saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and dairy

114
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:11.990
products are actually the only category of foods that consistently have more

115
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.740
saturated fat than any other type of fat pork. For example,

116
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:20.360
often has more monounsaturated fat than saturated, and even sometimes, yeah,

117
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.223
lean beef.

118
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.240
And what's really interesting about that is that studies consistently

119
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:28.640
show that full fat dairy,

120
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:33.170
which would be like the highest saturated fat class of foods is C

121
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.180
is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, reduce risk of diabetes,

122
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.270
reduced weight, and all kinds of other improvements.

123
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.200
<v 0>Dairy is full of raw dairy, like raw milk.</v>

124
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.270
<v 1>They don't different, you know,</v>

125
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.270
they're not differentiating like that in the study, just any.

126
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.540
<v 0>At dairy. Why do you think so many people are lactose intolerant then?</v>

127
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.040
Cause it seems that that's an issue.

128
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.550
And I think I seem to have it a little bit in my nine-year-old daughter

129
00:06:58.551 --> 00:06:59.120
definitely has.

130
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.710
<v 1>Well, so it wasn't until 11 before 11,000 years,</v>

131
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:06.740
12,000 years ago, we didn't raise animals for dairy.

132
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.690
So there was no need that we only had to digest lactose while we were

133
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.870
breastfeeding. So unlike in a hunter gatherer culture,

134
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.370
as soon as you stopped breastfeeding,

135
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.170
you no longer had the need to digest lactose. And so we're,

136
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:23.630
our bodies are efficient. We stopped producing lactase,

137
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:28.010
which is the enzyme to break down lactose and for the rest of our adult life.

138
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.810
But then about 12,000 years ago, we S we started, you know,

139
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:34.040
somebody figured out, Hey,

140
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.920
let's drink some milk from that ruminate animal over there.

141
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.030
And milk dairy products, help people avoid starvation.

142
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:43.250
And there was a good source of hydration and nutrients.

143
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:48.000
And so that mutation started to spread. And now it's about one third of,

144
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:52.820
of the world has lactase persistence, which means they can digest, um,

145
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.090
lactose all the way into adulthood. And two-thirds don't,

146
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.610
and it depends a lot on your ancestry. So.

147
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.330
<v 0>So two thirds people are lactose intolerant. Wow. That's.</v>

148
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:02.990
<v 1>Interesting.</v>

149
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.700
So the people who tend to be lactose tolerant or people of European,

150
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:11.960
particularly Northern European descent, like lactase, lactose tolerance,

151
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.880
or lactase persistence approaches like 97% in Scandinavia. So Denmark,

152
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.280
Norway, Sweden, they can almost all digest milk and then east Africans.

153
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:23.240
So you have like the Messiah, you know,

154
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:27.950
people who've been raising cattle for a long time, tend to have those, um,

155
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.500
that capability. Whereas like in Asia,

156
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.540
other parts of Africa and other parts of the world, not as much.

157
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.310
<v 0>The difference, if any,</v>

158
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:42.170
does it make when it's not homogenized and pasteurized in terms of your

159
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:45.440
digestion, because for me, I don't have a problem with raw milk.

160
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.663
Milk seems to be. Yeah.

161
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.220
<v 1>Yeah. I think there is a difference. I mean,</v>

162
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:54.080
it contains enzymes in it that help you break down the lack, the lactose. Um,

163
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.240
so that make a difference. But I mean, just,

164
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.920
I would love to see research that further differentiates the health benefits of

165
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.550
dairy, according to whether it's organic or whether it's modularized or not,

166
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:08.880
and all that, but even just talking about dairy as a whole category,

167
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.040
when you had Dr. Walter Willett in there saying there's evidence of high con

168
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.850
high consumption of proteins from dairy was related to higher risk of prostate

169
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:20.880
cancer, the chain of cancer causation seems pretty clear,

170
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.780
but if you bring up a slide 44, Jamie, this,

171
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:29.460
there was a 2019 study largest review of dairy ever been done

172
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:34.020
before. It was 153 meta analysis that they reviewed.

173
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.580
So not just individual studies,

174
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:39.210
they reviewed 153 studies that were also reviewing other studies.

175
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.210
And 84% of the meta-analyses on dairy showed either no

176
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.720
association or an inverse association between Darien cancer.

177
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.130
Meaning when it's inverse,

178
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.880
it means people who ate more dairy had lower rates of cancer. Whoa.

179
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.720
So I just, it's frustrating, you know, to,

180
00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:59.790
to see someone make a claim like that.

181
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.180
And then you go and you look at the full totality of the research and you see a,

182
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.790
uh, just exhaustive study like this with 153 minute analyses

183
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.130
and 84% are showing no relationship or a beneficial

184
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:17.460
effect of dairy on cancer. Why wasn't that mentioned in the film? Well,

185
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:18.240
it's consistent.

186
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.120
<v 0>With the way the message is being distributed through the entire film. It's,</v>

187
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:25.140
it's a propaganda movie. I mean, that's essentially what it is.

188
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.140
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So it's like reefer madness.</v>

189
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.900
<v 0>For meat. I mean, it really is.</v>

190
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.660
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So it's kind of crazy.</v>
