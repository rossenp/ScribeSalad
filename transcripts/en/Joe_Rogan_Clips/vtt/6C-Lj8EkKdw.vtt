00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, so I met with, um, this gentleman,</v>

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:09.930
Sam, uh, one of the founders of Y Combinator. So Y Combinator is a,

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.450
a, um, is a contract that my friend,

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.060
the head of Dropbox use, um,

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.090
and that a lot of tech guys use and it's a standardized deal.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.280
So one of the ideas I had when I was, um, uh,

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370
as I'm in this process of innovate, I'm not in,

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
I'm not at war with the music industry, it's just it's time for us to innovate.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.250
Uh, and we need to have contracts that make sense with exactly how we sell

10
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:42.600
music. So, you know, people in every vicinity and that's like a,

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.530
every 20 years,

12
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.820
that's like the like decade is 10 of Sydney is 20.

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170
And as you see now, it's like, the world is just stopped for a second.

14
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.430
And there's an opportunity to look and say, what are the things we need?

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.710
What are the things we don't need? So I don't know if you saw,

16
00:00:58.711 --> 00:00:59.760
when I posted my contract,

17
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:04.650
I had 10 contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinths and

18
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:05.880
there's things that we don't need. Now.

19
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:10.560
I believe that the distribution partner,

20
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.620
that the label is like prince would go and say, oh,

21
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:17.430
we don't need the distribution partner. Especially if prince was, you know,

22
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.120
really alive and thriving in this internet era,

23
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
I'm the kind of person where I'm not trying to go and eliminate

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.200
anyone's job. So record labels are afraid of saying, okay,

25
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.610
we're going to hand over the distribution completely to you guys, which is,

26
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.460
you know, that's a possibility, um,

27
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.990
there's a way where both parties can be

28
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:47.700
happy and that these infrastructural partners can be of service

29
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.040
to the influencer, to the artists. Like these,

30
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.990
these deals can be flipped in a way that they're just more fair,

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.530
uh, you know, w of record. And I just let,

32
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:05.100
let me just go into this specific, um,

33
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.050
place with the record labels for a second. I know I'm talking about that.

34
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.590
<v 1>Confusing thing for people on the outside. Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.790
<v 0>So before, when I told my father, I wanted to rap,</v>

36
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.370
he was a very like,

37
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.750
leery of that idea. He said, this, this, this,

38
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:26.190
I heard this business is terrible. And you know, he's right. Like,

39
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.910
people are all seeing things that are wrong inside of contracts,

40
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.930
turning blind eyes to it. And everyone's responsible.

41
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.490
Everyone's a part of it. You know, it's like when the me too movement happened,

42
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.720
you know, it wasn't just the guys that were getting tagged and, you know,

43
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.230
some of the guys should have got hit with it. Some guys shouldn't, you know,

44
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.400
that's not what I'm here to talk about.

45
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:52.080
I'm saying that in a way everyone's responsible.

46
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.740
Everyone's a part of the problem. That's why I really loved that. Um,

47
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.560
black mirror episode, when, you know,

48
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:03.340
everyone was making comments and anyone that even made a comment, the bees,

49
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:07.150
it was about these, uh, you know, uh, mechanical bees, anyone.

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.670
And this is a spoiler alert if you haven't seen this episode,

51
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.660
but anyone who made a comment, the bees came to go get them.

52
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.830
And that's the thing about what you put in the universe. Even a thought,

53
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.380
you know, you put that thought into the,

54
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.960
it's another thing to say something negative and put that into the universe.

55
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.430
It's another thing to see someone being raped. You know,

56
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.410
that's the reason why I compare what's happening to,

57
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.010
in the music industry to me too, because artists are raped.

58
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.440
You've heard that term before. I'm not, this is not like I'm,

59
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.830
this is not like a new thing that I'm making up. The,

60
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.520
the contracts are made to rape the artist.

61
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.770
And, um, you know, I put my, like,

62
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:55.630
I think about, you know, this is like a thought right now.

63
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.840
It's like, is this a, a negative thought that I'm putting into the universe?

64
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.760
But I have to say, like, when I was going on Twitter,

65
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:05.710
I was thinking about Bruce and Brandon Lee that crossed my mind to say, I'm,

66
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.470
this is Sony. This is universal.

67
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.900
And I'm willing to put the blue paint on my face

68
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.920
and go out and do this

69
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.100
because it's the right thing to do. Like music. Like at this point,

70
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:28.210
it loses me money. It doesn't make me, it doesn't make me money. It is my,

71
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.950
my $5 billion net worth and $300 million of

72
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:34.540
cash that I see a year.

73
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.560
Music is like negative 4 million for me.

74
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.330
So these contracts from me were kind of like Wang grow and heat where this

75
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:47.860
guy had everything, but he still said, Wang, grow messed up.

76
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.700
This, this, uh, this heist that we're going to do. Like,

77
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:54.850
I look at the music industry in that music and the love of music itself.

78
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.440
But the music industry, I look at it like, wangro like, I blame,

79
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.750
you know, the loss of my mother,

80
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.940
partially on enter the entertainment industry,

81
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.830
the always fighting to, you know,

82
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:15.940
represent, you know,

83
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.930
who you are against media entertainment industry.

84
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.370
That's trying to tear down anybody. That's not, uh, going with the flow.

85
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.050
I see, you know, I've got those kinds of reasons personally.

86
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.870
Uh, but uh, vendors is mindset the Lord.

87
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:35.020
So it's not a matter of going in for revenge.

88
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.080
That's just me as a human being where I fall short. Like I'm not a monk.

89
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.130
<v 1>Can you explain what you're talking about with Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee? Like.</v>

90
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.080
<v 0>What I lost you there? Okay.</v>

91
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:47.190
So Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee were both murdered.

92
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.440
<v 1>Brandon Lee died in an accident on a movie set. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.950
But you think it was a murder? I felt that's a conspiracy. Right?

94
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.350
The conspiracy was that Chinese triad killed him the same way they killed Bruce.

95
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.540
But that's the,

96
00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:06.470
the coroner's report was that Bruce died from a reaction to

97
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.460
a medication, right?

98
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.790
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, but I think about that anytime I go to the, go to the hospital,</v>

99
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.180
I'm very, you know, I'm mindful of that stuff.

100
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.250
You think about like Bob Marley,

101
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.640
they didn't just JFK or MLK him.

102
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.700
There's like reports that it was something in his toe.

103
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.700
<v 1>Or he had cancer right there. I believe he had a skin cancer.</v>

104
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.690
<v 0>Yeah. Like, I, I went to go, uh,</v>

105
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.430
I got a shot in my, uh, in my hand cause, uh, just from texting and stuff,

106
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:38.380
my thumb was like hurt. And then I post.

107
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.300
<v 1>So much, you hurt your thumb. Absolutely.</v>

108
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.800
<v 0>Just texting way too much.</v>

109
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.630
So I post a picture of a,

110
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.760
the screen at the hospital.

111
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.400
And then I was asked to take it down by,

112
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.140
by who people just call them. I forget exactly who asked me, but it was like,

113
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.840
they get, they got to my management, they got to this. And he said,

114
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:06.130
take that picture down. Like the hospital. It was in the weirdest place,

115
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.080
you know? So what, what did they not like about the picture? Um,

116
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.700
I think it had, like,

117
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.780
it might've had some information on it that they didn't want to go out like an

118
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.660
address or something like that, or it was just like,

119
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.450
but I don't want to go down, go, go down these rabbit holes.

120
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:25.210
I'm just saying like Michael Jackson,

121
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.750
not waking up one day prince not waking up one day,

122
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.930
Bruce and Brandon Lee, Bob Marley,

123
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.270
all of these things are, have crossed my mind, you know,

124
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.980
as I'm going and saying,

125
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.060
I need to innovate what these contracts are.

126
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.390
Not just for me, but for all artists,

127
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.830
it's not about me getting my masters back. It's about,

128
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.770
it's about a freedom. And I say on a new song, I say,

129
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.790
if I would put myself in harm's way to get my masters,

130
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.290
they would put their self in harm's way to stay the master. And that's,

131
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.840
there's a complete parallel to the way the music industry works and the way

132
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.090
the world currently works and the influence that America has on

133
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.740
other countries and the way governments work, uh,

134
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.420
the influence and the way government and the way people in power and

135
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:29.470
control deal with, you know,

136
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.210
disaster relief deal, deal with Haiti, deal with, uh,

137
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.210
The Bahamas. Like where is the money going?

138
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:42.340
Why aren't things being built and this concept of

139
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:46.570
money. Right. I asked myself this, um, uh,

140
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.400
I asked him one a week ago, like how much is America in debt?

141
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.650
And they were like this many trillion. And then I asked my a question,

142
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:59.100
but the dumbest question I've ever asked myself, I said, well, you know,

143
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.510
how much does the earth cost?

144
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.230
<v 1>I think they got a bad question, but I'm not as you're at work. Yeah. What is,</v>

145
00:09:06.231 --> 00:09:08.990
what is the worst? What did all the things on earth? Yeah.

146
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.540
<v 0>And it's saying we can't buy it.</v>

147
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.690
We couldn't make enough money to buy the earth. Right?

148
00:09:14.691 --> 00:09:16.970
So that means we made money.

149
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.070
So if money is the key to all people's happiness and we'll solve

150
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:25.310
everything and everyone's doing things for money, let's just make more money,

151
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.260
but it's not about making more money. It's about keeping poor people,

152
00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:34.700
poor and rich people rich and keep up, keep keeping people in their place.

153
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.590
And right now we're experiencing the fall or Rome or the

154
00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:41.570
Titanic has now hit a glacier.

155
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.370
And there's people who would prefer to go down with the

156
00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:50.510
Titanic than to get on a lifeboat because they don't want to get sea water on

157
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:55.340
their dress or on a nice outfit that people are so programmed

158
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.520
and brainwashed into, uh,

159
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:03.350
classism and protectionism that, uh,

160
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.390
it's difficult for people to embrace innovation and

161
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:10.280
less. It has a tag on it.
