00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Not stereotyping male cheerleaders whatsoever, but.</v>

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.160
<v 1>I have a buddy who's a male cheerleader. Who's awesome.</v>

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.580
He's Chappelle's 99.9%. Sure.

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:16.230
He's straight Chappelle lazy, but he's built like a brick house too. I mean.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.030
<v 0>Collegiate cheerleaders are insane.</v>

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.860
<v 1>Yeah. But then you have to be able to flip through the air.</v>

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.890
People don't understand what cheerleading is. Right. They think of it as like,

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.610
yeah, go team. No, it's not crazy. Acrobatic.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.391
<v 0>Even in high school,</v>

10
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.780
like I was throwing girls up in the air by myself and catching them overhead,

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.340
you know, like doing like that.

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.720
<v 1>Yeah. That's what's weird. Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.080
Chappelle does the stuff where he grabs him by the feet, flips them in the air,

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.960
catches them on one. It's stupid. It's bananas.

15
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.050
Like the amount of physical power you have to have to be able to do.

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.210
<v 0>That timing. Coordination. Yeah. It's crazy.</v>

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.541
<v 1>I mean,</v>

18
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.320
you have to be a Savage to throw someone in the air and catch them with one

19
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:54.300
hand. It takes a lot of balls, a lot of power to the explosive power.

20
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.830
For sure. Most men on cheerleaders could never pull that off. No, no,

21
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.210
it's hard. And you, can you do all the flips and to backhand spread? No, no.

22
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.950
Could you do it back then? No.

23
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.820
<v 0>No, no. That's, that's actually one of the reasons why, like, so I, um,</v>

24
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.050
when I was doing it in high school,

25
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.590
like actually look to do it in college at the collegiate level. Um,

26
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.680
but tumbling was like a minimum requirement and I was like, yeah,

27
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.250
I'm a little too chunky and. So.

28
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.450
<v 1>So how did you get into power lifting and strong man?</v>

29
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.810
<v 0>So that like, honestly, totally by chance. Um,</v>

30
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.220
I was working out in my high school weight room one day after school and a

31
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:35.010
substitute teacher happened to walk by who owned a CrossFit gym.

32
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.780
And he was like, Hey, uh, you know, I, um, I'm at this CrossFit gym. Like,

33
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:41.640
you seem like you like this stuff and you're pretty strong,

34
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:44.340
like feel free to come by. So I would start,

35
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:46.950
I actually started training with him at like five o'clock in the morning before

36
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.850
school, um, would, and I found out really quickly, I sucked the CrossFit,

37
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.380
but I like to lifting heavy.

38
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.030
And this was back in 2009 and walked into the gym one morning and they were

39
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.340
like, Hey, there's a local strong man contest. Uh,

40
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.570
this Saturday we signed you up for it.

41
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.450
<v 1>So when you say you sucked at CrossFit CrossFit,</v>

42
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.470
just a bunch of Olympic lifts and different explosive exercises, I just wasn't.

43
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.303
<v 0>In shape.</v>

44
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.810
<v 1>Right. So the, the ability to do math, to do rev.</v>

45
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.260
<v 0>And the workouts. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so yeah,</v>

46
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.820
so they signed me up for my first contest.

47
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.630
I was 17 years old and had never touched an implement.

48
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.540
I had just seen it on TV. Like everybody else in world's strongest,

49
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.600
man got my kicked took last place.

50
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.340
<v 1>But you are 17. And how much lifting had you done previous to that? Maybe.</v>

51
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.610
<v 0>Maybe four or five months, really. But at that point,</v>

52
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.860
like I had hit the 500 pound deadlift.

53
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.730
<v 1>And you'd only been lifting for a couple months. I'll see,</v>

54
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:43.110
just a freak genetically.

55
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.650
<v 0>In a few lists, in a few lifts. I was good at.</v>

56
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.300
<v 1>That's a lot of weight for a few months of lifting. Um.</v>

57
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.870
<v 0>Yeah, so the contest went horrible for me,</v>

58
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.440
but I absolutely fell in love with the sport. Um,

59
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.320
ended up at Springfield college in Massachusetts and joined their powerlifting

60
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.680
team. And that's when I kind of got, you know,

61
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:08.590
more of a background in lifting proper technique and all that stuff.

62
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.850
And then did another local strong man contest where I met this guy, Matt mills,

63
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:16.570
who owns a gym, lightening fitness in Connecticut, we're at train now. And, um,

64
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.440
he was like, yeah, you know,

65
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.210
like I'm just starting to get all the strong man equipment.

66
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:22.570
You should come down. It's only about 30 minutes from their school. So I would,

67
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.780
I actually would go there every Saturday morning from when I was in college to

68
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.591
train strong man.

69
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.650
And that's when I kind of started competing in the amateur circuit. Um,

70
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.320
you know, and that's kind of led me on my trajectory to here.

71
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.230
<v 1>So you're one of those rare people that actually lives in Connecticut.</v>

72
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.980
<v 0>I live in Massachusetts, you right over the border.</v>

73
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.230
<v 1>Escape, go over there, work out real quick and then leave. Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.370
Connecticut strange. It's something it's a strange place.

75
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.920
That's a lost state. Yeah.

76
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.200
So you get into powerlifting and then what was

77
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.350
your exposure to like truck pulling and all that other crazy?

78
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.280
<v 0>Um, so really not much, you know, uh, you know,</v>

79
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:06.520
the cool thing about strong man is every contest is different that we do. No,

80
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.230
we know we never do a same, you know,

81
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.440
I've done the sport for over 10 years now and I've never done a contest where

82
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:13.720
the events have been the same in that span of time. Do.

83
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.480
<v 1>You know what it's going to be before you sign up typically?</v>

84
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.500
<v 0>So you end up, we.</v>

85
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.510
<v 1>Get about a series of lifts eight to 12.</v>

86
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.540
<v 0>Weeks notice depending on the contest. Um,</v>

87
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.890
so the gym that I was going to in Connecticut,

88
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.170
they were just starting to acquire strong man equipment.

89
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.760
So it was pretty bare bones. So like we had a steel log, you know,

90
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:37.240
for the log clean and press. They had some Atlas stones. Um,

91
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:39.910
some farmers handles a yolk and that's pretty much it.

92
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.250
And then over the years he would get more and more and more.

93
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:46.480
And now it's turned into this massive 15,000 square foot facility and the gym

94
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:48.640
owner, we call him an equipment hor because he buys some,

95
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.230
every time something new comes out, he buys it. Um, so yeah,

96
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:57.250
like my, my exposure to the equipment in the beginning was pretty minimal boat.

97
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.680
What I did to compensate for that as I just competed more.

98
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.580
So I would pretty much from Springfield, Massachusetts,

99
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:08.530
I drew a five-hour radius from where I was and any contest there was in

100
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.980
that radius I would do. Um, so in my first like three years,

101
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:15.310
I competed probably like almost 40 times. Whoa.

102
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 1>How often are these things being held.</v>

103
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.300
<v 0>At the amateur level? Pretty often, there's usually you could find, you know,</v>

104
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:27.030
I would say one or two, you know, per month in new England alone, really. Um,

105
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:31.210
and then they're all over the country. So, you know, I think the cool thing is,

106
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:33.040
you know, like I was really, like I said,

107
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.890
I took last in my first contest and that went on for a while.

108
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.480
I took dead last and like my first eight shows that I did. So, like,

109
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:42.430
I wasn't good at this thing when I started.

110
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.460
<v 1>Now, when did you start being successful?</v>

111
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.360
<v 0>20? So I went to amateur nationals actually in the 200 pound weight class.</v>

112
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.690
So I weighed in a hundred, 200 pounds in 2011.

113
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.920
That was my first time at the amateur national.

114
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:59.480
So I'd been doing it for about two years.

115
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm surprised myself and ended up taking second place in that weight class. Uh,

116
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.370
went back to the amateur nationals as a 2 31 and two 12,

117
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.330
and took second place there and then won the amateur national championship in

118
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:13.310
2013. And that's where I be, you know,

119
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.760
where I won my pro carton kind of got to that next level.

120
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.650
<v 1>It's such a difficult thing to do that I would imagine doing it 40 times a year.</v>

121
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.240
Like you're going to get injured.

122
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.070
<v 0>Luckily I didn't really, I mean, you know, I'm fortunate we're um, uh,</v>

123
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.210
so by trade and what I went to school for is I'm an athletic trainer. Um,

124
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:35.540
so sports medicine has kind of been my thing. So, you know,

125
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.990
I've been lucky enough to learn, um,

126
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.970
when I was training of when I need to back off,

127
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:44.480
when I can push a little bit harder, what needs to be taken care of, um,

128
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:47.870
and just try to be smart, you know, I mean, I'm, you know, knock on wood,

129
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.681
you know,

130
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:52.010
I've had one serious injury in the 10 years that I've been doing this and what

131
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.920
was, uh, um, it was summer of 2018.

132
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.850
I dropped 275 pound Atlas stone on my chest. Oh, so,

133
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.650
uh, tore my QL in my low back, broke three ribs. Oh, Jesus.

134
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.290
Put me out of commission for a little while. And you know, once you drop it,

135
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:11.120
where, what was it? Was that a contest? I was in second place by one point. Um,

136
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:13.160
so it was the final event of the contest and, uh,

137
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.020
I went to push the stone onto the,

138
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.590
so the thing is with me being only five 10 with the Atlas stones,

139
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:21.650
like the first box you have to put the stone on is high, you know?

140
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.180
So this was 75 inches tall. Um, you know, and I'm only five 10,

141
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.890
so it was literally like eyebrow height.

142
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.570
So I had to like press it up onto the box and uh, I thought it was up there.

143
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.310
It wasn't secured. It ended up rolling off, fell on my chest. Oh.

144
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.503
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.501
<v 0>And, uh, you know,</v>

146
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:43.970
naturally that was the first contest my mom had come seen in person in like four

147
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:48.020
years. So she was in the stands, watching it happen, kill by a Boulder. Yep.

148
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.140
Perfect timing. Yeah.

149
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.880
<v 1>So how long did it take you to recover from that?</v>

150
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.430
<v 0>Let's see, that was,</v>

151
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.420
that was in June or June or July of 2018.

152
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:03.170
And I didn't do my next contest until March of 2019. Oh, wow. Yeah,

153
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.270
it took me off for awhile. Yeah.

154
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.320
<v 1>I could have only met 275 pound stone.</v>

155
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.660
<v 0>Ball and that was the lightest one we had in the series.</v>

156
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.160
<v 1>Wow. Jesus Christ.</v>

157
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.260
So just your background in understanding athletic science or exercise science

158
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.570
allows you to know when you're being silly and when you, you know,

159
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.330
you, you're not going to be a, but you're not going to be dumb.

160
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.980
<v 0>Exactly. And I think that's where it's, that's why I've been lucky, you know,</v>

161
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.640
and kind of stayed injury free because even like to this day, like, you know,

162
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.610
so my coaches, um, you know, pretty well renounced, strong man,

163
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:45.140
Derek Poundstone, who, you know, took second place at world's strongest man. Um,

164
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.080
and he programmed some crazy for me,

165
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.390
but there are some days where I'm just like, yo dude,

166
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:52.010
this is not gonna fly today.

167
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.530
<v 1>You have a light, like what's a light day. Um.</v>

168
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.690
<v 0>You know, so like I train four days a week and I get like one,</v>

169
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:04.470
like I call him like my bro day. It's like my bench back in arms day.

170
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:06.720
Um.

171
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.260
<v 1>You know, do that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

172
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.980
<v 0>So it, it's more just like,</v>

173
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.260
cause like bench press is going to like build up your triceps.

174
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.020
It's going to build up the anterior Delt. It's going to help like bench press,

175
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.650
actually it helps your overhead lifts. And um, so I do that in that,

176
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:21.090
that's what I consider like my light day,

177
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.250
but like I'll still bench like in the mid fours.

178
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.560
<v 1>Um, so, so four days a week. Yeah. And so how do you,</v>

179
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.140
how do you structure it? Do you do every other day, do you do?

180
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.570
<v 0>Um, it all depends on the week really. So typically I try to go Tuesday,</v>

181
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:41.520
Thursday, Friday, Sunday. That's usually my, my average week. Um,

182
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:45.630
so Tuesday is like my big overhead day where I'll do a strong man movement,

183
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:50.490
overheads, like log, press, or dumbbell. Um, and then a bunch of shoulder,

184
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:54.690
overhead accessory work Thursday. My day two is my biggest day.

185
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.470
So I squat and deadlift in the same day. Um,

186
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:00.930
and that's a workout that sometimes takes four to five hours. Right?

187
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.470
<v 1>Yeah. So did you big spaces in between each workout?</v>

188
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.530
So you lift and then do you, do you have like a large.

189
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.040
<v 0>We talked about 10, 15 minutes between sets sometimes. Like, you know,</v>

190
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.070
like we're building up to the Arnold strongman classic in Columbus, Ohio,

191
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.620
this coming March. And um, you know,

192
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:18.930
we have a max deadlift coming up and you know,

193
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:23.520
I'm potentially going to be on for a 1000 pound deadlift and

194
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.630
Christ, you know,

195
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:28.170
so like to get through a deadlift workout where I'm deadlifting oh yeah.

196
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:28.800
There's me.

197
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.430
<v 1>There's huge.</v>

198
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.550
Look at the bar bending that's what's most up about it is looking at.

199
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.490
<v 0>So that was, that was 850 pounds on the, on the deadlift right there. What.</v>

200
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.380
<v 1>Does that, that dumbbell right there?</v>

201
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.130
<v 0>That Dumbo was 2 50, 2 51.</v>

202
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.660
<v 1>Arm overhead, press, Hey, that the dead lift though is,</v>

203
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.710
so what is that thing it's called a HUSA felt stone. Clara coffin.

204
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.320
<v 0>Yup. Pretty much that weighs four 50.</v>

205
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.780
<v 1>Wow. Are you wearing, uh, like a backstrap let go a bell.</v>

206
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.430
<v 0>So we're about really work does. Yeah. What does it do?</v>

207
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.170
So it helps like build intra-abdominal pressure, um,

208
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.940
but also gives just like some tactile feedback to like,

209
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:15.540
know where you need to brace. Um, so usually weightlifters,

210
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.240
like we'll put it where like we feel weakest in our core, um,

211
00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:22.770
and that's gonna help us activate those muscles to be a little bit stronger and

212
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:25.380
you know, more effectively brace to prevent injury.

213
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.610
<v 1>'Cause I never, I never understood how it protect you from a lift.</v>

214
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.060
Like if you're lifting heavy weights and you got that strap around your back.

215
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.491
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

216
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:38.970
It's not really tech it's I guess it's not really meant to like protect per se.

217
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.500
Um, more just to like help add extra support. That's the biggest thing.

218
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.520
<v 1>So it does you, you don't do heavy lifts without no.</v>

219
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.400
<v 0>No, no. I keep it on. Yeah. Whenever I'm going heavy. That's.</v>

220
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.470
<v 1>Pretty much standard for powerlifters.</v>

221
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.680
<v 0>Oh yeah. Power lifting.</v>

222
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.370
<v 2>Strong man. Yeah. We're we're all wearing like pretty heavy duty belts.</v>
