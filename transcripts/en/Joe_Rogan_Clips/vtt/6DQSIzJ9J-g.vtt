00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 2>You want to talk about little people do wanna talk about the house.</v>

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.380
<v 1>Which one's the machine house.</v>

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.570
<v 0>Oh, okay. Cause I want to talk to you about it.</v>

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.130
Cause I've been doing some research about this.

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.980
<v 1>Research. Yeah. What kind of research? Taking drugs?</v>

7
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.000
<v 0>I would never take drugs. Drugs. You know, if someone's on drugs,</v>

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.000
they say what's wrong with him? Is he on drugs? Right? Is he a drug addict?

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.630
You would never want to do that. Only crazy people do drugs. Yeah.

10
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.070
So do you think you're done more to popularize DMT than anybody else?

11
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.260
Do you think that these elves.

12
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.940
<v 1>I don't know if a real is the right word. Uh,</v>

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.860
the question is we look at consciousness and we look at, uh,

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.903
like

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.850
an intelligent entity as being in a physical carbon-based form.

16
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.260
That's in front of you that you can shake hands with or give a hug to. Right.

17
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
When you experience what happens when you take dimethyltryptamine

18
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.860
you throw all that out the window because the environment

19
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:06.270
itself is not it's it's, it's, there's,

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.910
it's not defined. It's fluid,

21
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.490
meaning that it's changing constantly,

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.260
but yet it seems far more vivid and far more real

23
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.150
than this life right now.

24
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.160
And there are these things that are there and they

25
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.690
communicate with you and they seem to be really communicating with you.

26
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.530
And they seem to also know, you know,

27
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:34.680
all of your and be able to see right through. Yes.

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.880
But they don't seem to be you. They seem to be something else. Right.

29
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.980
That's all we know.

30
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.480
<v 0>Right. But I'm asking you what you.</v>

31
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.600
<v 1>Think. But that's what I think that's all we know. There's no,</v>

32
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.900
you can't like you could say that's a well of souls.

33
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.810
That's what happens when you die. That's the afterlife.

34
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.430
That's a parallel dimension.

35
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.280
These are aliens is how they can communicate with us. They're

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.400
nonphysical life forms that exist in these realms of light.

37
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.980
We don't know. It's just, you're just guessing. Right?

38
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.821
<v 0>Well,</v>

39
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:10.740
I've been talking to people and I've been told the theory that we are 3d beings,

40
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:15.090
but they're 40 beings. So that we're 3d projections of 40 beings.

41
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.180
So when you're taking, you're breaking the veil,

42
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:20.340
you are perceiving the 40 space.

43
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.700
<v 1>Maybe, but that's all you could ever say. It's really just a, maybe,</v>

44
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.180
you know, whenever, when he said, when people say, I know what that is,

45
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:33.900
I am communicating with the afterlife or I know what that is.

46
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:37.470
These are the real aliens. This is what happens when you're sleeping.

47
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.320
And people have these alien abduction experiences.

48
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.090
What they really are having is a,

49
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.590
an indogenous DMT dump because your brain does produce DMT. Right?

50
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.900
Um, but new research is being sh is showing that it's not just the brain that

51
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:55.380
produces DMT, that it's it's these, the, it was the pineal gland.

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.230
But now they think literally the whole brain is producing it and the liver and

53
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:01.990
the lungs. So it's, it's part of the human body.

54
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:03.730
It's something that the human body makes.

55
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.400
They've been able to isolate it in specific organs.

56
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.650
But they think this really bizarre,

57
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.980
super potent psychedelic compound is everywhere.

58
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.000
And they also think it's responsible for dreaming. They think there's a,

59
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.780
an amount of it that comes out while you're sleeping while you're in heavy REM

60
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.180
sleep. This is speculative. They're trying to,

61
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.940
but the thing is there's parallels, right?

62
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.890
One of the parallels to the psychedelic states and dreams is that

63
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.010
they're very difficult to recall. They like right.

64
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.310
You wake up and it's the most vivid you come out of the experience, right?

65
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.490
It's the most vivid thing that you've ever experienced in your life.

66
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.010
And then moments later, you're like, I don't remember what happened.

67
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.330
It's just like a dream.

68
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.730
<v 0>So you've never had,</v>

69
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.310
because everyone who takes it talks about the spirit molecule, right?

70
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.950
How much it affects our understanding of reality. So on and so forth,

71
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.540
you've never had lingering effects from the DMT experience crossover into meat

72
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:56.374
space.

73
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.320
<v 1>You mean like tripping for no reason, or just.</v>

74
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.340
<v 0>Seeing the way I've been told is that like, if you're on a highway, right,</v>

75
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.990
and there's all these billboards, you don't notice what those billboards are.

76
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.470
Right. But let's suppose you're on a highway in another country and you don't

77
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.630
understand what those billboards are. If you want, if you want to.

78
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.000
Cause they're another language after you take it,

79
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.020
you are able to see those signs and perceive them and read them.

80
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.310
So that things in real life that you would previously been oblivious to you now

81
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.890
pick up on connections that you previously couldn't.

82
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.880
<v 1>Well,</v>

83
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.770
I guess you could say that any time you have a paradigm shifting moment in your

84
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.980
life where you could have this from just from a near death experience or the

85
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:37.030
loss of a loved one,

86
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:39.700
where you're forced to reevaluate everything and look at things through fresh,

87
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.863
fresh eyes,

88
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.730
that anything like that is going to force you anything that's a so

89
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.890
Titanic really bizarre and ultimately incredibly different

90
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:55.240
than your average day on this earth. This thing that changes you,

91
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.490
it's going to force you to take things in.

92
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:59.560
I would look at it that way more than I would look at it.

93
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:04.270
Like all of a sudden you can like see these billboards in another country and

94
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.450
recognize these patterns. I mean,

95
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.910
you're just probably just being more aware marijuana does that for me,

96
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:13.210
more than anything, you know, especially edible marijuana,

97
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.460
edible marijuana for me is like, uh,

98
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.630
one of the most reality

99
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.000
highlighting experiences.

100
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.790
Cause it makes me think about the buildings like this is,

101
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.280
I just take these things for granted.

102
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.460
There's a 64 story thing in front of me.

103
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.630
And there's these human catacombs and people are shedding into these tubes and

104
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.320
they'd go down through the water and it's, there's pipes everywhere with human.

105
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.030
And then there's electricity pumping through everything and everyone's got a TV

106
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.770
or a PlayStation running and we're all just juiced into this machine and yeah,

107
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.300
the matrix, I think of people as human batteries all the time.

108
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.700
I really do. I think of people as,

109
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.170
as consuming currency

110
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.090
producing batteries, like that's what we do. We're consuming things,

111
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.130
taking things in. And then we're also through our work all day long.

112
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:14.000
So many people just doing something they hate to do just to create currency and

113
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.760
then to add to the system and to purchase more things.

114
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.130
And you just see them sitting in front of the machine,

115
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.130
sitting in front the machine and they go home, sit in front of the TV,

116
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.650
sitting in front of the screen, on their car. And we're just,

117
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.670
we're constantly in this state of, of,

118
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.070
of consuming and producing, consuming and producing,

119
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.200
and then adding to this weird techno society that we live in.

120
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.130
That's all.

121
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.350
<v 0>From weed. Okay. But let me ask you another question. Okay.</v>

122
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.150
Let's suppose I drew on a piece of paper.

123
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.830
I drew you and I drew me and I drew a house. Right. And I said,

124
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.530
what is what correspond to, and you'd point to that. And you'd say, that's me.

125
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:49.940
And you point that, and you say that's malice.

126
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.170
That house has no correspondence in 3d space. It's a theoretical house. Right.

127
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.033
Okay.

128
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.120
What if some of these people that you're talking about don't exist in the 4d

129
00:06:59.121 --> 00:06:59.954
space?

130
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.430
What if they are 3d representations that don't have a representation to 40

131
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:07.760
space? Just like that 2d house? I just drew doesn't really exist.

132
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.550
<v 1>Okay. So what if they're like,</v>

133
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.100
what does that NPC.

134
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.560
<v 0>What if they literally Don have higher, higher form of existence?</v>

135
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.240
<v 1>Isn't that like your ego with.</v>

136
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.590
<v 0>You though. That's why I'm asking you.</v>

137
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.750
Because apparently when people do a lot of DMT,

138
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:27.890
they S they see things like this. Oh, do they? Yeah. That's what I'm heard. Hmm.

139
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.510
<v 1>Yeah. I've, I've met people that see things on DMT that were very,</v>

140
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:34.130
ego-driven like, uh,

141
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.780
I knew a guy who had a crazy DMT trip and he felt like he had a team

142
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.200
that was working for him in this other dementia.

143
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.900
And they were all about him and they're helping him.

144
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.560
And they're all together with him and that like, you know, his life,

145
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.100
he has destiny in his life and he has to fulfill his destiny and they're working

146
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.720
to fulfill, I'm like,

147
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:57.770
this is like some weird ego driven

148
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.490
idea of what's happening in this space. Cause he's like, sort of,

149
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.800
he's forcing whatever that experience was to fit this mold of

150
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:11.690
what he thinks of himself. And by the way, wasn't very accomplished at the time.

151
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.640
Right. So think of thinks of this as like it's, you know, delusions of grandeur.

152
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.180
Well, yeah, but this is, I think a kind of,

153
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.470
uh, some sort of a reconciliation of that.

154
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.330
Like he's sort of trying to figure out why it's not

155
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:35.570
happening the way he wants it to happen and what is, what is wrong,

156
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.580
but yet also tripping and seeing these entities and saying,

157
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.200
oh, they're all with me. They're going to help me.

158
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.560
They're they're working with me on all of my plans. And this is,

159
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.830
this is all my team and another lie. It was very strange.

160
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:53.510
So I never felt like that at all. I've I've felt every time I've done it,

161
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.500
it's like, here's all. Look at you loser. Like it,

162
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.370
like it's.

163
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.880
<v 0>Highlighted or like, you're so great. And we're so honored to be talking to you,</v>

164
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.340
Joe Rogan. It's like, do it get over yourself. No, you ain't.

165
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.590
But I thought that there are, uh,

166
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.600
that's there are some people who basically become chiropractors of reality.

167
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.290
So if he's like, you're going to help me achieve my goals and you're behind me,

168
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:20.430
that's nonsense. But if he's there to help them achieve their goals,

169
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.160
that's a whole very different perspective. Yeah, sure.

170
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.450
So like that kind of thing where like just awesome things happen to you,

171
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.890
not what you would want,

172
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.840
but you're basically an agent of bringing about positivity and

173
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.700
kindness in the world. Hmm.

174
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.080
<v 1>Yeah. Well,</v>

175
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:41.730
I think the more you can do good things,

176
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.510
right? The more you can be an agent of kindness and positivity,

177
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.910
the more you're going to literally spread out the fingers and branches

178
00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:54.120
of love. Right. And if you do do that,

179
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.730
and then you do have psychedelic experiences,

180
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.710
I would imagine if you've made a positive shift like that,

181
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.120
you,

182
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.660
your experience would be much more positive when you go into that dimension,

183
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.640
