00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Is your family in this weasel too? At the time.</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.430
<v 1>Sylvia at the time was out there with me. Yeah. She, she ate.</v>

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.070
<v 0>Weasel. She was looking at her face while she's eating weasel.</v>

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.630
<v 1>She had a good attitude about it. She just,</v>

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.390
she was pretty amazing woman in terms of, uh, taken to the Bush. She, I mean,

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.870
she was an opera singer in Berlin before she met me. She was, yeah,

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:26.800
she wasn't really. Wow. And,

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.640
and my partner, Trisha, that I've been living with the last five years,

9
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.730
she was an attorney in Boston. Why it's yeah.

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.320
<v 0>Wow. Why.</v>

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.210
<v 1>Get that? People are always telling me, like,</v>

12
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.730
you never going to find a woman to live like that out there,

13
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.440
but actually it's appealing to certain people. I think a lot of people,

14
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:46.350
that's why people watch it on TV. People want to be free. Right? Yeah.

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.210
And people want to be alive. Yeah. And a lot of people don't feel it today.

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.230
It's true. If you spend your whole life in an office or a courtroom,

17
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.600
and before that you were in school, you've never really.

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.250
<v 0>Yeah. You just feel trapped. Yeah. And the grind,</v>

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
the grind of just keep showing up at the office every day and cases are piling

20
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:14.040
up and next he knows she's living with Glen

21
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.480
by the side of the lake dodging wolves.

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.220
I get it, man. The, the appeal of it is why those shows are so successful. Yeah.

23
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.760
I mean, that shows really sucks. I had Sue Akins on the podcast before.

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.080
She's a really fascinating human to really, really enjoy talking to her.

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.820
Like what a tough broad.

26
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.890
<v 1>I'm not on the show anymore. You know, they didn't know.</v>

27
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.550
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Um, what happened with you in the show?</v>

28
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.473
Do you guys have a falling out?

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.060
<v 1>Yeah. We had a falling out. Was the falling out about,</v>

30
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.660
they never told me exactly. They just got rid of, um,

31
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.460
they renewed my contract.

32
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:55.290
We went out and filmed one episode and I never heard from him again. Really?

33
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.930
Yeah. I mean, not about working on the show anymore.

34
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.720
<v 0>You think they just decided you weren't a storyline that was as successful or</v>

35
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:04.554
is.

36
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.450
<v 1>Oh, I think I'm very popular with the fans. Every everybody that I talked to,</v>

37
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.020
I mean, the viewers.

38
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.420
<v 0>Know you are my favorite guy. I.</v>

39
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.350
<v 1>Love it because people tell me that I really made a difference in their life.</v>

40
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.780
Like they learned something, they got inspired.

41
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.810
They actually made changes in their life. And I hear this all the time.

42
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.030
Like yesterday traveling, you know,

43
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.020
I had four different people come talk to me about it. And um,

44
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.190
but I think I went about as far as I could go in this show because I was always

45
00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:36.720
pushing to tell stories or to share things that

46
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.330
didn't fit into the concept they had. When you make a TV show,

47
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:45.450
you got a concept before you find the people to put in it. Right.

48
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.060
And I mean,

49
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.220
lifeblood zero is a show about supposedly

50
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:58.200
people live in a subsistence lifestyle in the Bush and that's

51
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:01.630
part of my life, but a lot more to it. And I'm always,

52
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.100
I'm a person who's always trying to learn and grow and do new things and

53
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:09.130
expand. So, um, when they met me,

54
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.130
I fit into their show like a hand in a glove,

55
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.440
but I wanted to do more and I wanted to share more. So I get bored.

56
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.220
You know, I made, I think I'm an 85 episodes. The life blows zero.

57
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.290
I made a lot of TV. Um,

58
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.600
I wasn't satisfied just to show people what it's like to search for your food

59
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:33.520
and chop down a tree, you know, for your firewood. I wanted to do more.

60
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.180
So I was always pushing to do stories that were a little bit

61
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.120
out of the range or the scope of what they envisioned

62
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.380
for me to do in the show.

63
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.860
I wanted to fly on a little eight pound paraglider off the

64
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:52.870
top of the mountain to get back to my camp.

65
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.010
I've been dreaming about it for years. And you know, I said, Hey,

66
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.110
I'm going to do this. I'm going to paraglide off this mountain.

67
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.470
I got a lot of resistance from the producers about stories, something like that.

68
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.340
I did it, I did it. And I was like, I want to film this and that, you know, Hey,

69
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:08.590
if you guys don't want to film it, they didn't want to film it.

70
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.850
I'll get somebody else from it.

71
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.000
I am going to film this and I'm going to do this. Cause I was excited about it.

72
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.141
They put it in the show,

73
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:18.880
but I got a lot of resistance and I wanted to teach people all the time

74
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:23.110
about things. And that wasn't really the, maybe the best vehicle for it. I mean,

75
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:26.110
I had a blast doing the show and I had an awesome time.

76
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:30.280
I learned a ton of stuff about making TV, about all kinds of things.

77
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.890
And I made awesome friends, a cameraman.

78
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.570
I worked with some of the best people I've ever met in my life. And, um,

79
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.160
overall had a great experience,

80
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:43.030
but I was always pushing the limits of what they really wanted to do. I think,

81
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.930
because I wanted to make a story, for example,

82
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.610
about finding a site where stone-age people had lived those very improperly with

83
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.690
the producers, but we did it. I mean, I was just add,

84
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.070
why would that be unpopular?

85
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.770
That's so instead you look like you're just walking around,

86
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.050
you look like you're just out there exploring, walking around.

87
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:04.060
We want to see finding something to eat, go chop some,

88
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:05.860
can you test some more trees for us? I was like, no,

89
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.250
I've cut enough trees on camera. I want to do something worthwhile. You know,

90
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:11.920
I wanted to teach people things. I watch. There's all kinds of stuff out there.

91
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.500
Nature. I just wanted to climb the highest mountain anywhere around.

92
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.810
I'd never been up there. I've been looking at it for years and years.

93
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.620
Those were the kind of stories that I had to really twist people's arms to get

94
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:24.040
on the show. The fans loved them, but the producers, for some reason,

95
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.690
didn't now this.

96
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.640
<v 0>Stone age site, did you find it? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.670
<v 1>Where it was amazing. It was like, uh, maybe two.</v>

98
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.830
Uh, not that we can get to right now. Um, it was like a,

99
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.850
we made a whole story on TV about is amazing. I found, found the stumps.

100
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.930
I heard about it from somebody that had been there in the 1970s. He said,

101
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:49.930
there's a place where you can find stumps that were cut with stone ax.

102
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.520
I was like, that's totally amazing.

103
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.150
Now you gotta understand the stone ages in Alaska was we're talking like what?

104
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.170
Maybe two years ago? Maybe a a hundred, 150. Not that long ago.

105
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.210
Really. And everything's frozen eight months of the year.

106
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.870
So stumps last a long time, you know, um,

107
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.450
these stumps were old. Like you could,

108
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.480
they were still standing and you could touch them and you could knock them over.

109
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.570
They were like right on the edge. Like th they might not be there in 10 years.

110
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.620
It was amazing. But yeah, this, this, this gentleman I know, um,

111
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.440
who grew up as a little kid out there with his dad,

112
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.230
his dad was a hunting guide and they had been all over in this area.

113
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.370
And he told me that there was this place where people had camped and they had

114
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.160
found rings of stones, where they had had their skin tans.

115
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:34.610
And they found these stumps that were cut with stone axes and whatnot.

116
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.390
So we actually made a show's awesome. I went with two cameraman.

117
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:42.590
We walked for a couple days just to get there from my camp. Wow.

118
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.030
And then just going by this verbal description that he had given me,

119
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.810
I was able to locate, he told me about a game trail that,

120
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.050
and it was still there. Like th the animals are still following the same route,

121
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:57.050
you know? And he said, you get there, you, you turn this way.

122
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:59.330
You're going up in the mountains, going to be there and off to the side,

123
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:03.020
you're going to see these stumps. And sure enough, I found the stumps on camera.

124
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.220
It was amazing. Wow. I got one of them in Fairbanks. I brought down with me.

125
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.450
<v 0>So wild that it was just off of someone's description. Yeah. From the 1970s.</v>

126
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.650
Yeah.

127
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.750
<v 1>Yeah. Jack Ray. Coffee's an amazing man. He, um,</v>

128
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.200
he still lives in the Brooks range in a small village called Wiseman.

129
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.170
And he was somebody that I learned a lot from after I got to Alaska.

130
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.690
<v 0>Wiseman was on that show as well. Wasn't it?</v>

131
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.870
Didn't they do film some stuff from that part of their.

132
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.700
<v 1>Eric. Salatin,</v>

133
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.150
that's actually the only person on the show that I knew prior to the show.

134
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.680
You knew him. Eric and I had known each other for 10 years. Um,

135
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.840
I met him not long after he came to Alaska.

136
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.520
<v 0>He's another really interesting guy. He.</v>

137
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.040
<v 1>Is. Yeah. Unfortunately, uh,</v>

138
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.030
Eric and I were friends and I kind of replaced him on the show is what happened.

139
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:48.170
But, um.

140
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.010
<v 0>But you guys were gathered at the same time for a little while.</v>

141
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.520
<v 1>There was a little overlap. First was Eric was on for a year before me.</v>

142
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.690
Then they found me,

143
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.570
then we overlapped for a little while and then they got rid of Eric.

144
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.460
<v 0>So they would just get rid of you if they decided they were bored with your</v>

145
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.860
storyline. There's other people living up there like that.

146
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.940
They just find them and.

147
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.520
<v 1>Office politics, I think. And, uh,</v>

148
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.970
also just differences in creative vision. I mean,

149
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:17.480
I was not satisfied to just do the standard. I'm starving.

150
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.000
I'm looking for firewood or whatever stories over and over.

151
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:23.750
I was always trying to push it. I was doing paragliding. I was doing, um,

152
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.920
you know, just exploring, showing people where stone-age people lived,

153
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.541
climbing mountains,

154
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:32.510
just for the joy of climbing them and set up on top of philosophies about life.

155
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:33.980
Those are the kind of stories I like to do.

156
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.030
And that really wasn't the vision they had. I think that was a lot of it,

157
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:38.990
but honestly they never,

158
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.420
they didn't talk to me about it after they stopped working with me,

159
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.770
I still haven't talked to them about.

160
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.520
<v 0>So they just stopped. Yeah. They didn't call you up and say.</v>

161
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.240
<v 1>Yeah, they, they renewed my contract. Right.</v>

162
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.500
They had an option to renew for one more year. We shot one episode

163
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.170
radio silence. After five months, I sent him an email and said, Hey, what's up?

164
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.510
You guys plan on filming something or what's going on?

165
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.350
And I got about two lines back from a said story. The schedule's all full.

166
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:08.700
We don't have any plans to film with you.

167
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.100
<v 0>Wow. Yeah. That must have been weird. Okay.</v>

168
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.800
It seems like that's a lot of episodes still just sort of brush you off like

169
00:09:18.801 --> 00:09:22.460
that. Will you difficult to work with.

170
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.580
<v 1>The show producer told me a couple of years ago, he'd fire me if he could,</v>

171
00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:26.600
but he couldn't really.

172
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.740
<v 0>The, the show runner. Why, why did he say that?</v>

173
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.620
<v 1>Cause I was, first of all,</v>

174
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:37.070
I didn't work with producers in the field after the first year and a half.

175
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:38.870
I said, Hey, I can produce myself in the field.

176
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.260
I don't need to work with producers anymore. And they went along with that.

177
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.950
So I'm responsible for my own stories. As far as I'm concerned,

178
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:48.380
I'm the author of my own stories. This me and a couple of camera man.

179
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.350
And we're out there and I'm making what I consider real TV.

180
00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:54.350
I'm sharing what I want to share. Nobody's feeding me lines.

181
00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.290
Nobody's telling me what I got to do. Um, I'm producing myself,

182
00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:03.890
I'm working with awesome camera man. And we were doing incredible things.

183
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:08.330
I may whole episodes of LBZ in the field of just one care man.

184
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.420
And then we send all the footage back to LA and they work all their magic and

185
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:14.990
edit it and everything and do what they want with it. But, um, yeah,

186
00:10:14.991 --> 00:10:17.660
I've made several episodes with just me and one camera man out there,

187
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.810
but that's a lot of, uh, uh, freedom.

188
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:24.230
That's not normally given to people on reality TV from what I'm told.

189
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.210
And of course that caused some tensions.

190
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.470
<v 0>So they wanted to control you more. Oh yeah. Yeah.</v>

191
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.500
So why did he say that he would fire you if he could.

192
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.980
<v 1>Guess he didn't like the kind of stories that I was.</v>

193
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.060
<v 0>Zoned. It was really.</v>

194
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.580
<v 1>Because, uh, I, I don't remember the details of that conversation, but, um,</v>

195
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.700
there was just a general tension, a lot.

196
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.420
I got a lot of negative feedback about what I was given. Um,

197
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.200
and it was weird cause people were loving it. I mean, the.

198
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.350
<v 0>People that you had contact with on social media, man.</v>

199
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.370
<v 1>Yeah. Like, I, I wasn't,</v>

200
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.040
I didn't even have the internet when I started this show, you know, I didn't,

201
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.990
I didn't have a cell phone when I started this show.

202
00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:05.510
I just got all modern and last years, but I, yeah,

203
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:08.420
I got on Facebook and I got thousands of people, you know,

204
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.860
giving me positive feedback. And when I travel anywhere or even go to Fairbanks,

205
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:14.060
I was getting all this positive feedback.

206
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:16.520
So it seemed to me like the viewers really like what I was doing,

207
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.710
but I did get a lot of negative feedback from certain particular people making

208
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:24.890
the show that, that wasn't what they really wanted.

209
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.430
<v 0>They have a formula. Right. And the formula is survival.</v>

210
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.910
That's really the formula. It's like subsistence survival.

211
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.260
You finding enough food, the chopping wood it's really appealing.

212
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.530
It's one of the more interesting things about those kinds of shows. It's like,

213
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:43.840
what is it that's tapping in? Or what is it tapping into? What, what,

214
00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:48.650
what part of your ancient memory where this is like really exciting to people?

215
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.680
Cause I think there's a lot of folks out there, like your lawyer friend or your,

216
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.690
uh, opera friend that they just there's something about the

217
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:03.400
idea of getting away from everything and just living a way more

218
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:07.510
simple life. It's it's it seems like the antidote for them.

219
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.250
So when you watch this on television and you see these people just chopping

220
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:16.030
wood and living by the land and dealing with the dangers of living in the Bush,

221
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.510
it's like, there's something about, it's just like make you tune in every week.

222
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.060
<v 1>Yeah. And I mean, it is, it's, it's beautiful stuff to share. I, I think it's,</v>

223
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.020
it's awesome just for me. Um,

224
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.360
I don't think it's the perfect vehicle to share exactly what I want to share

225
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.310
because I want to go a little deeper.

226
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.940
I want more than, you know, like a four second soundbite.

227
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.410
And that's what I like about this show, Joe, when I discovered your show,

228
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:48.071
I was like, wow,

229
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:52.030
there are people that just sit down and have a normal conversation rather than

230
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.090
everything being chopped up and edited into little soundbite.

231
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.490
<v 0>Yeah. And you get a chance to really talk about stuff. You know,</v>

232
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:03.520
if you're sitting around just having a conversation with someone for three

233
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:06.250
hours, you get to really expand on your ideas.

234
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.670
And have you said something that you think maybe didn't say it right?

235
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:11.410
You get to say it better or, well,

236
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:15.460
what I was saying was this and you get to explain yourself and expand and really

237
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.420
get a thought across.

238
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.910
There's not a lot of places where you can do that in this world. No, no.

239
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.010
And those reality TV shows, I mean, you, your,

240
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.210
your situation sounded like it was pretty much you producing it,

241
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:31.270
which would give you as much reality as you know,

242
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.290
they left in with editing. But a lot of reality shows, you know,

243
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.780
as well as I do, they just set things up like, Hey,

244
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.110
you're going to pretend like you lost your keys in that lake. Right. You know,

245
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:45.850
like, my keys. Where's my key. And see bad acting like, oh my God. And I know,

246
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.770
I know how it works. I've done those shows before.

247
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.850
I know that there's someone who's always trying to set up these scenarios,

248
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.690
right? They're scripted. It's like sort of, non-scripted scripted.

249
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:59.920
Like they have a place to go to. They have, and you see them on these shows.

250
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.010
You can tell when people are acting, this is like a weird feeling that you get.

251
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:03.881
When you know,

252
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:08.050
this guy has opened up this storage shed before and he's opening up now. Wow.

253
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.520
What do we got here? Like, come on, man. You're a terrible actor. This is awful.

254
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.780
But there's something about these formulas of these people have created reality.

255
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:18.490
Television is a very strange animal.
