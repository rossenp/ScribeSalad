00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Irreversible damage,</v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.970
the transgender craze seducing our daughters. Boy,

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.070
that's a hot buttons object, right? That is a, this is a minefield.

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.000
It shouldn't be.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.740
<v 1>Though. No, it really shouldn't be.</v>

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.600
<v 0>No, it shouldn't be, but,</v>

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.300
so I think we should probably establish some things like upfront. Right? Um,

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.460
some people surely as adults are transgender. Of course.

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.200
Yes, of course. I interviewed a lot of them and we fully support that.

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.140
Right. Okay. I have friends.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.810
<v 2>Who fall into that category.</v>

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.320
<v 0>Your concern is about very young children.</v>

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.420
<v 2>Teenage girls has nothing to do with adults who are transgender.</v>

14
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.470
Okay. Many of whom are amazing people. They, you know,

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.450
went through mental health, you know,

16
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:56.180
therapy and they decided they made this decisions.

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.340
They suffered with discomfort in their bodies.

18
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:02.780
From the time they were young and as adults, they made a decision to transition,

19
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.850
fully support them has nothing to do with my book.

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.710
<v 0>What did, what, what was the motivation to write this book?</v>

21
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:13.940
And if it's about teenagers, why is there a very young girl on the cover?

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.400
Well, the cover.

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.770
<v 1>It looks like a little girl. Right?</v>

24
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.710
<v 2>But it does. I mean, I, obviously I didn't do the cover, but I think,</v>

25
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.920
I think the cover is very good because I think it's supposed to evoke what we've

26
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:28.580
lost in our a whole generation. Well, yeah.

27
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.230
She's I assume her uterus infertility is yeah.

28
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.830
Oh, infertility. Yeah. That's what, that's what happens. I mean,

29
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.800
I involved in this, this wasn't a personal issue for me. In fact,

30
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.920
it was an issue originally. I thought I was going to avoid, um,

31
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.910
a reader wrote to me,

32
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.580
I write most often for the wall street journal and a reader wrote to me and she

33
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:49.640
said, listen, I've tried to get every mainstream journalist to pick this up.

34
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.130
No one will touch it. But my daughter got caught up in this.

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.070
All of a sudden she went off to college. All of a sudden with her friends,

36
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:57.500
she had a lot of mental health issues, anxiety, depression,

37
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.710
and all of a sudden with her group of friends, they all decided they're trans.

38
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.180
And she went on hormones.

39
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.600
And this is happening to parents all across the country, teenage girls,

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.550
all of a sudden deciding what their friends,

41
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.790
they're trans wanting surgeries and hormones and getting them.

42
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.700
And at first I thought I don't need this.

43
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.910
And so I tried to get another journalist to take it up a real investigative

44
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:19.880
reporter. I'm not, I'm an, I'm an opinion journalist usually, you know,

45
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.880
that's what I've done. And I couldn't get someone to take it up.

46
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.540
<v 0>Because it's such a minefield because.</v>

47
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.660
<v 2>Yeah, because it's a minefield because for some reason,</v>

48
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:34.070
the activists who are not representative of transgender

49
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.960
adults that I've met at all,

50
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.150
but the activists had convinced the world that because, you know, they,

51
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.080
they, you know, object to anyone's transition being questioned.

52
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.380
We can't talk about a mental health issue facing teenage girls.

53
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.320
<v 0>Now I've heard, um,</v>

54
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.630
there's an issue with some teenage girls who are on the spectrum,

55
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.300
who wind up getting sort roped into this idea that that's,

56
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.330
what's wrong with them. Is that one of the things you cover in your book? Yeah.

57
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.530
Yeah.

58
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.400
<v 2>I, I actually don't deal with that specifically very much.</v>

59
00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:12.990
And the reason is that's a whole book in of itself because a lot of it is true

60
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:16.260
that a lot of girls who are high functioning, autistic,

61
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.330
and I did interview some experts in autism.

62
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.820
And that's when I realized that's a book of its own,

63
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.720
which is that a lot of girls who are high functioning, autistic, you know,

64
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:29.100
they tend to fixate and they ha they are particularly susceptible to

65
00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:33.360
fixating on the idea that they might be a boy when it's introduced to them.

66
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.950
So, uh, yeah,

67
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:37.770
I know exactly what you're talking about and there they are one part of this

68
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:38.880
phenomenon, but there are big.

69
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.870
<v 0>So the teenage girl part, so this is you're,</v>

70
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.490
you're talking about teenage girls that are susceptible to influence,

71
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.030
or are you talking about teenage girls that are confused? Like why,

72
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.990
why are there so many teenage girls that are going in this direction? Like,

73
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:55.980
what do you think is happening?

74
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.980
<v 2>These are the same girls that would have been anorexic.</v>

75
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.190
They would have been Billy. And they would have been their high anxiety,

76
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:04.740
very precocious girls, but they don't really fit in.

77
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.990
They come to high school and they don't have friends.

78
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:09.960
They don't have a click for them. And they're so smart.

79
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:12.510
And they're so lonely because they're on the internet all the time.

80
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:15.510
And they're with mom all the time and they don't fit in at school.

81
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.910
And this is a way to exp understand their, just their, their pain,

82
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:22.530
that they're really feeling they're in pain,

83
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.830
but they decide that their problem is that they're supposed to be a boy.

84
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.540
And the fix is testosterone.

85
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.920
<v 0>So you heard of this problem,</v>

86
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.460
you knew of people that their children were going through this.

87
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.750
And how long did it take you before you decided to commit to pen to paper on

88
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:40.830
this? So.

89
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.050
<v 2>I spent, uh, maybe a month or so,</v>

90
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:45.960
just hearing the reports of the parents and reading the original study.

91
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:50.070
There's an original study that the book is, you know, John jumps off from,

92
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.490
which is the Lisa Littman paper at brown university should public health

93
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:56.760
researcher who looked into this. And she found that there was all of a sudden,

94
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:01.320
this huge epidemic in America, um, of teenage girls,

95
00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:05.300
deciding they were trans with their friends after social media merging and,

96
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:07.140
and pushing for hormones and surgeries.

97
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.250
<v 0>Have you had a conversation about this with someone who's a trans activist that</v>

98
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:13.980
says, well, maybe what's really going on. I mean,

99
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.280
I'm just taking the argument of it may be what's going on.

100
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:20.640
Is there are a lot of trans women and there would be more,

101
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.030
or there's a lot of women who would turn trans, become a man.

102
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.160
There would be more, but they'd never had had that door open to them before.

103
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.380
And that maybe there's more trans people than we think.

104
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.980
<v 2>Amazing. Amazing. So it's a great point. And I thought about it cause I've,</v>

105
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.200
I've, you know, I tried to look, I'm a journalist.

106
00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:40.050
I like to look at ideas in both sides. I didn't have, like,

107
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:42.810
I did not have a dog in this race. So let me tell you three reasons.

108
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:45.990
I don't think that's compelling. Number one, when,

109
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.820
when Lisa Littman looked at the prevalence rate,

110
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.630
she found that it's 70 times what we would expect within a friend group,

111
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.320
which means it's highly concentrated in groups of friends,

112
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.410
but there's two other reasons.

113
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.920
So we wouldn't expect that if it were randomly distributed among the population,

114
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.770
but there are two other reasons. I don't think that's right. Number one,

115
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.520
if we're just reverting to normal, now that there's greater society,

116
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.350
societal acceptance, right?

117
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:13.010
We're just saying that we're just avoiding reverting to a normal base rate of

118
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:14.240
transgender women.

119
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.720
Where at why are where all the women in their forties and sixties coming out as

120
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.300
trans, they should be coming out. Now's their time now,

121
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.720
is there a moment we should see tons of women in their forties and sixties and

122
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.640
so on coming out as transgender,

123
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.150
but we're not seeing that we're seeing the same population that gets involved in

124
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:33.530
cutting demonic, possession, witchcraft, anorexia, Ballymun,

125
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:37.670
convinces themselves. There's a problem. And, and there's one anyway,

126
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.500
there's there's one last reason is that suicide rates are going up.

127
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.420
But if these women who were living under a prior, you know, supposedly these,

128
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:48.500
all these transgender,

129
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:51.980
these real transgender people who are living under a more repressive regime and

130
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:53.810
are now just finding themselves this,

131
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:57.110
you would think the suicide rate would be going down with greater acceptance.

132
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.650
<v 0>So when you're saying suicide rates are going up,</v>

133
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.220
you mean suicide rates with teens who turned trans both.

134
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.240
<v 2>With the rate of trans of suicide among this populate. First of all,</v>

135
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:09.820
among girls in general is extraordinarily high.

136
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.170
This is just one part of the mental health crisis they're in. And second of all,

137
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:16.330
we know that the rate that these, these kids,

138
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.810
that these trans identified kids have very high rates of suicide,

139
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:24.070
suicidal ideation, it's, it's really, you know, an area of real concern.

140
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.260
<v 0>Well, there's definitely an area of real concern as well with, um, social media.</v>

141
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.710
Did you read Jonathan Heights' book, the coddling of the American mind,

142
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.820
and it was on.

143
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.680
<v 2>Your show that I really like this light bulb went on when I rewatched</v>

144
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:41.560
it, because he talked about exactly this,

145
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:46.240
he connects it to social media and he talked about on your show, the huge rates,

146
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:48.340
we're seeing an anxiety, depression.

147
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.060
<v 3>All along these same girls and.</v>

148
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.301
<v 2>You know,</v>

149
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:55.330
putting it together with Lisa Littman's research and the other investigation I'd

150
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:55.990
done.

151
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.800
I think it's really pretty clear that one more manifestation of these girls who

152
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.860
were we know are involved in a lot of cutting and all kinds of self harm.

153
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.110
This is one form of self harm for them.

154
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.030
<v 0>So there are chill.</v>

155
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.230
So let's essentially say there's young teenagers that are

156
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:15.970
confused and they're looking for something that makes them

157
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:19.660
feel whole or something that makes them feel normal or something that gives them

158
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:22.870
some sort of an escape from this [inaudible] that they suffer from.

159
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.910
And you're thinking that turning trans is one of those

160
00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:30.130
pathways that they gravitate towards,

161
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.670
but it might not necessarily be a good idea for them. Yeah, that's.

162
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.181
<v 2>Exactly right.</v>

163
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:38.050
If these girls were transitioning to boys and they were living great lives and

164
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:41.710
their mental health was great, like it is for so many transgender adults,

165
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.500
I wouldn't have written this book. That's a great story.

166
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.730
<v 0>Great. For so many transgender adults. Cause even in transgender adults,</v>

167
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.080
the suicide rates very high.

168
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.560
<v 2>There's no question. And that's, you know, that's a separate issue,</v>

169
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:56.940
but I do think that I, yeah, I agree. I think that there are,

170
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.570
I personally believe that there are transgender adults who've been helped by

171
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.750
transition, but these girls are not being helped by transition.

172
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.110
Just universally, I think, as a population. Yeah. I mean, that's,

173
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.510
that's what Lisa sta Lisa Littman study showed,

174
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:12.210
but also through my investigation, you know, I hear from,

175
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.590
I interview a lot of parents. I also interviewed transgender youth and they,

176
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.140
you know, they'll tell you, they're, anxiety's a mess.

177
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.620
Their depression's a mess, transitions, not cheering. These girls,

178
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:24.840
they drop out of school, they cut off their families.

179
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.790
They're not living a great life.

180
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.060
<v 0>It's, it's such a strange call, right? I mean, strange.</v>

181
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.230
I don't mean strange in a negative way. I mean, it's,

182
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.490
you're dealing with hormones in a human body. Like you're,

183
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:44.840
you're taking a woman and you're injecting hormones into her body.

184
00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:49.430
And you're saying that these exogenous hormones are what's going to fix her.

185
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.200
And I never, I never understand that. Like if, uh,

186
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.540
if this is my argument about this, like how do we know,

187
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.430
how do you know that that's, what's going to do it? And when you are doing that,

188
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.850
what damage is being done? So it's one thing.

189
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:07.580
If someone's a twenty-five year old woman and they say,

190
00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:11.120
I have always wanted to be a man. And I think I'm a man. I think I was,

191
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.650
I think I'm born in the wrong body,

192
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.190
but when you're going through this developmental cycle from

193
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.600
17, 18, 19 20, there is a lot of chaos,

194
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.810
a lot of hormonal chaos. There's a lot of confusion.

195
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.790
I don't think there's anything specifically that you could point to that could

196
00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:32.330
say some sort of an intervention chemically, some sort of a,

197
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.440
if you just step in now and start injecting this body with male hormones is

198
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:40.430
going to fix all your problems. But yet it's really popular to do that. It's.

199
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.970
<v 2>Really popular. These girls are getting it on their own diagnosis.</v>

200
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.730
So they're just going in and self-diagnosing nobody questions. It.

201
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.120
We now have informed consent, which means you walk into planned parenthood,

202
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.570
you sign a waiver, you decide you have gender dysphoria.

203
00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:56.810
You walk out that day with testosterone, planned parenthood is doing this.

204
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.640
It's one of the biggest distributors.

205
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.810
<v 0>So you don't have to have some sort of a long,</v>

206
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.290
some transitional therapy session with.

207
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.140
<v 2>You can get your breasts removed with no therapist's note.</v>

208
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.953
<v 4>Whoa.</v>

209
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.970
<v 0>Yeah. So you could be a confused 18 year old girl and</v>

210
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.770
walk into a planned parenthood. Self-diagnosing with no therapy at all.

211
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.700
And they'll prescribe tech testosterone, and you can get your breast removed.

212
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.020
Absolutely. You sign a form.

213
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.790
<v 2>You cannot even get your breast removed at planned parenthood.</v>

214
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.040
<v 1>Though. Sorry. Yeah. You can also.</v>

215
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.240
<v 2>Get your breast removed from yes. Surgeon, surgeons. Some,</v>

216
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.610
some of them require a therapist note. I interviewed them in my book,

217
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:44.020
some who do not. And, and you know, there are, you know, both kinds, Jesus.

218
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.730
<v 0>A big decision, right? That's a decision that you can't really come back from.</v>

219
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.880
What, what did the surge have you talked to about this? What do they think?

220
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.310
They think that obviously we're generalizing, right? So.

221
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.540
<v 2>They think a couple of things. I mean,</v>

222
00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:02.730
obviously there are a lot of surgeons who refuse to do it.

223
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.870
So I interviewed them as well.

224
00:12:03.871 --> 00:12:06.330
They say you don't destroy the biological function.

225
00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:10.350
Like I didn't become a doctor to destroy someone's biological function for,

226
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.860
you know, something that they've decided they have without even, you know,

227
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.820
any oversight or, but, but the ones who do it say, look,

228
00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:22.080
this population is really desperate for surgery. It's a civil rights issue.

229
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.630
I, you know, if I'm, you know, I'm,

230
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.040
I'm giving them what they w w what will seem to bring them comfort seems to

231
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:32.250
bring them comfort. The problem is that there's no, like,

232
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.820
follow up to see how their mental health is afterwards. The.

233
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.090
<v 0>Surgeon is basically a mechanic, right. They just remove the tires.</v>

234
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.040
We'll send you on your way. Yeah. The problem.

235
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.510
<v 2>Is we're not cars. Right? It's all connected. So unfortunately,</v>

236
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.230
very often the mental health deteriorate. I mean, I talked to one young woman,

237
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.600
Desmond, who's amazing. And she, uh, she decided in high school, she was trans.

238
00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:58.860
She got celebrated everywhere. Her teachers, her therapist told her. Yeah,

239
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:02.640
you're definitely a man. You're supposed to be a man. Affirmed her everywhere.

240
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:06.510
She went, she got on testosterone and it caused uterine cramping,

241
00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:11.010
which can happen. Um, it's one of the many bad side effects with testosterone.

242
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.230
She had to have a hysterectomy. So at 21,

243
00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:18.150
she wakes up with a hysterectomy and she realized this whole thing had been a

244
00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:22.770
giant mistake. Her mental health had not improved at all. And this was a huge,

245
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.040
like mistake and path she had gone on. And all of a sudden,

246
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:29.070
she didn't know what to do. There was no one cheering her on anymore.

247
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.110
<v 0>Why do you think people get cheered on for this decision?</v>

248
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.940
<v 2>I think in America,</v>

249
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:39.630
we have a weakness for anything that gets clogged in civil rights.

250
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.880
And part of that is very noble and good.

251
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.770
Obviously the civil rights movement was extremely important in our country and,

252
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.810
and, and extremely, you know, valuable, um, and valorous. But,

253
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.740
but now anything that gets called a civil rights issue, you can't question.

254
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.280
So I interview parents and they'll tell me they're almost all politically

255
00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:02.490
progressive. Okay. Most of the parents would call me or politically progressive.

256
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:06.570
And I interviewed almost 5,000 of them now. And they'll tell me, like,

257
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:11.070
I support LGBTQ, but I really, I'm not sure this is right for my daughter.

258
00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:14.880
Like I don't, I don't think she's really gender dysphoric. She's getting worse.

259
00:14:14.881 --> 00:14:16.950
Like what is going on here? And I'll say to them,

260
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.550
would you take away her binder? You know, binders that compression garment,

261
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:23.250
they wear it, a flatten, their breasts. And they'll say to me, oh,

262
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:27.570
I can't do that. I mean, I, you know, I support LGBTQ and whatnot.

263
00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:29.430
And I'll say to her, you know, sometimes I'll say to them,

264
00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:33.540
would you give her cigarettes? Why don't you give her cigarettes? Cause,

265
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.560
cause a binder will deform breast tissue. It can cause rib cracking.

266
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:40.320
It can cause shortness of breath, you know.

267
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.230
<v 0>I'm not, I wasn't aware of these binders. So this is something that,</v>

268
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:43.950
of course it.

269
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.200
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. Right. So it makes them look like a man.</v>

270
00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:49.560
So it's got a squash and if you're, you know, a big breasted woman,

271
00:14:49.561 --> 00:14:50.850
it's going to squash even harder.

272
00:14:50.851 --> 00:14:54.140
I it's going to really try to flatten you to give you the physique, you know,

273
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:55.430
the appearance of a male physique,

274
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.640
but it's just an appearance thing or is it so that's just an appearance thing.

275
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:02.240
They usually 16 year old girls don't usually go straight to top surgery.

276
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:04.540
They start with a binder. Okay.
