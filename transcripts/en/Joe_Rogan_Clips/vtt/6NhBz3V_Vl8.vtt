00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 1>Experience. Like some animals don't see. Good at all. It pigs don't see.</v>

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:09.750
Good at all. Yeah. You just freeze on a pig. They don't know what the going on.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.590
For sure.

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.130
<v 0>Eagle Eagle out like little mice in the Eagles have the best probably site.</v>

6
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.040
Yeah. They can see from, from miles and miles a mile.

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.350
<v 1>My friend from Alaska, he goes halibut fish all the time. He said,</v>

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.550
you're pulling a fish up and Eagle can see it miles away.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.820
<v 0>That's it? That that's some dinosaur.</v>

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.720
That's how you know dinosaur is at play is smiles. What?

11
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:34.860
Grizzly can find an elk carcass when it's underwater and polar bears can smell a

12
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:36.270
seal through three feet of ice.

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.110
three feet of ice.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.170
<v 1>Oh my God. That's.</v>

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.920
<v 0>Insane.</v>

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.430
<v 1>Three feet of ice dye is a monster.</v>

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.040
Imagine if you were in a big concrete building,

18
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.740
it's three feet thick and there's a bear on the outside.

19
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.400
If that was a monster movie, Blake, this is insane. This monster.

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.190
<v 0>This monster, no I'm here. Like you'd be two.</v>

21
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.480
<v 1>Kids right there.</v>

22
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.270
Their parents have already been killed and there's was just breathing.

23
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.240
Like don't worry. We're safe. Is concretes three feet thick.

24
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.370
There's no way he could smell us. And it's outside.

25
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.710
I smell.

26
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.203
<v 0>Oh, he talks to.</v>

27
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.200
<v 1>W just wanting three.</v>

28
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.340
<v 0>18 Miles and of smell.</v>

29
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.010
Three feet of smell through eyes.

30
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.400
<v 1>Did you ever see the video where the BBC reporter gets inside a box,</v>

31
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.530
like a plexiglass box and they put them around polar bears and the polar

32
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.800
bear tries to eat them. And the polar bears trying to eat him through this box,

33
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.950
trying to figure out how to get to him. Cause it knows he's in this box.

34
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.740
It is terrible.

35
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.240
<v 0>Why would you ever bro.</v>

36
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.770
<v 1>In this guy's got cameras on him the whole time. SHA SHA SHA in his pants.</v>

37
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.870
She has Dooky and left him bright fill in those drawers son. How strong.

38
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.840
<v 0>Is that? That thing has to be indestructible. They're so.</v>

39
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.750
<v 1>Big. They're so big. And we've been,</v>

40
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.250
we've been really over. Just let it, let that run. Jamie.

41
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.230
We've been really over with Klondike bars and Coca-Cola

42
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.371
making them look sweet.

43
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:19.290
We have a super distorted perception of this predatory killing machine that

44
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.420
eats its babies, bro, bro.

45
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:26.280
These things are ruthless. Look there that cleanup crew,

46
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:30.750
they're there to make sure there's so few resources up there in the wild that

47
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:34.080
this giant behemoth of a bear exists.

48
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:36.240
So he could just Jack everything,

49
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.140
just Jack everything and keep the populations nice and low. Look at that. He's.

50
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.273
<v 0>In right in there.</v>

51
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.720
<v 1>I'm not a biologist. So he knows it's in there. He's just trying to get at it.</v>

52
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:47.760
He's biting it. God.

53
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.710
<v 0>Dude. it up.</v>

54
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.790
<v 1>Look at this man. It's pressing on it. That's glass, man. If you're crazy,</v>

55
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.624
you're dead.

56
00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.620
<v 0>Teeth through it. When it's opening.</v>

57
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.450
<v 1>Its mouth, that's a Monster's mouth.</v>

58
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 0>Would I look like drunk at a McDonald's at the four in the morning trying to get</v>

59
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.680
food to the drive-through.

60
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.320
<v 1>This poor guy he's it's behind him. He's like, but the camera is this world.</v>

61
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.330
<v 0>Shaking, shaking the out of it. Of course.</v>

62
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.620
<v 1>It is. Why would he be so convinced that that, that thing would survive.</v>

63
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.930
<v 0>It'd be so dope if it just kind of, how.</v>

64
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.800
<v 1>Do they rescue this cat? This dude? Yeah. How do they get him out of there?</v>

65
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.580
Like who's who's like how long does it take to get them out of there? They got.

66
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.900
<v 0>To find a way to distract this bear.</v>

67
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.330
<v 1>Walked away. Come on.</v>

68
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.450
<v 0>Yeah, it's got, it's got to get frustrated at some point like does look it out.</v>

69
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.160
He goes, does. How did they.

70
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.880
<v 1>Test that box? What if that guy hated him? The guy who made the box. Oh,</v>

71
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:44.410
this guy's going to climb out. I'm out. I'm free. We've got a prize.

72
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.070
Oh the bear. Yeah. Like let's pretend the bears right here. Right next to him.

73
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.270
That thing could run 35 miles an hour. outta here.

74
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.490
Here's how fast the bear run. They're insane, dude. They run like that on ice.

75
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.060
That's things. Just digging with their claws.

76
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.310
<v 0>I like how they pre kind of pretended like that was a totally safe,</v>

77
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.340
normal experiment for him to do. Like he got out like no big deal, man.

78
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.490
You know, polar bears. Ironically are black underneath all that white furry.

79
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.870
You know that? Right? It's clear those.

80
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.800
<v 1>Clearer. Is that just.</v>

81
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.570
<v 0>A clear black it's black skin now?</v>

82
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.330
<v 1>Yeah. The skin's black. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Well,</v>

83
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.600
you got to imagine that people get snow tan. Right? You get snow blind.

84
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.420
No blind is the sun beating off the snow.

85
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.160
Like people get burned like really bad. Oh yeah. You.

86
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.160
<v 0>Go skiing without shilling. You a polar.</v>

87
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.630
<v 1>Bear. It looks no, that's a black bear bro.</v>

88
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.100
<v 0>Polar bear without.</v>

89
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.470
<v 1>Here. Yeah, but it's not look at the hair around its face.</v>

90
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.070
See how it's all black. I guarantee that's a black bear. Also.

91
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.860
It just doesn't look big enough. What does a bear?

92
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.700
<v 0>Maybe it's just another.</v>

93
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.110
<v 1>One. It's got mains, but you see how it has the hair on the top of its heads,</v>

94
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.850
black at the sink.

95
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.180
I think someone just wrote that and it doesn't mean that it's.

96
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.190
<v 0>Correct, but they are they're dark. But underneath all that,</v>

97
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.210
they are really dark.

98
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.900
<v 1>It's way. Hey, maybe when they get means their hair on their head gets black.</v>

99
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:59.740
Who the knows who go to that mangers? Weird.

100
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.950
<v 0>That's fair. I mean, I've looked, I've seen this before.</v>

101
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:04.450
I guess I got typed in polar bear.

102
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.410
<v 1>Yeah. Well I would imagine pulling.</v>

103
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.310
<v 0>Up there. No for.</v>

104
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.200
<v 1>They're the most terrifying because of the.</v>

105
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.221
<v 0>Well they're right there.</v>

106
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:15.220
Jamie top the top fourth picture is them spreading the hair apart. Right? They,

107
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.930
you see the skin there. There. Yeah.

108
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.370
<v 1>Yeah. So there you go. Oh, perfect. Yeah. And see how the hair looks white,</v>

109
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:24.070
but it's actually, they say it's like more of like a clear color.

110
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.720
<v 0>Wow. That's crazy to me.</v>

111
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.490
<v 1>Yeah. Like not technically white.</v>

112
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.920
<v 0>Right? No it's yeah, it does. It does. It looks translucent.</v>

113
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.330
Translucent almost right.

114
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.430
<v 1>Well what an amazing animal man.</v>

115
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.260
Unbelievable imagined that thing lives in this place where there's no vegetables

116
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:42.430
at all. Nope, but it got so big. It evolved to get that big.

117
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.970
<v 0>Dude just meet tons and tons and tons of me.</v>

118
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.363
<v 1>Uh,</v>

119
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.170
like a hole through ice to get to you to just chew through the ice.

120
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.490
It'll do whatever it can to gets you right there.

121
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 0>It's so nice that they're so far away. They swim.</v>

122
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.360
<v 1>You know, they jump in the water and swim comes from six miles.</v>

123
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.670
<v 0>An hour, bro. And for how long can they swim?</v>

124
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.130
I wonder how long they can stay in the waterfall. Cause they.

125
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.590
<v 1>Is that knots. And why do we need knots?</v>

126
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.120
<v 0>Boat boat. People love.</v>

127
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.780
<v 1>That with boat people. Hey, it's six fathoms. Hey. Face.</v>

128
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.633
How many feet?

129
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.680
5.2 knots 5.2 knots is a mile six miles an hour,

130
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.470
six miles an hour is 5.2 nuts. My boat goes five.

131
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.660
<v 0>Knots.</v>

132
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.570
<v 1>You want to make it slower? That's so confusing. Why would they do that?</v>

133
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:34.670
When they could just do miles an hour? What is not.

134
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.740
<v 0>Around before miles an hour,</v>

135
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.450
kilometers kilometers were also before miles an hour. Was it?

136
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.630
<v 1>It was five kilometers with a metric system. And that would, that was later.</v>

137
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.300
<v 0>No, no nuts or kilometers.</v>

138
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.720
<v 1>Really smart people are like, why the are they talking</v>

139
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.600
about kilometers?

140
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.160
<v 0>Some engineers like, God.</v>

141
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.930
<v 1>What will we just talking about? Bears? Oh, polar bears. Yeah man.</v>

142
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.820
There was not some, there were some article about polar bears. Uh, you know,

143
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.420
when, whenever we say that polar bear populations are threatened,

144
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.700
they definitely are in certain spots.

145
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.990
But the places where polar bears occupy is enormous. It's huge.

146
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.060
And in some areas there's a lot of them.

147
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.170
And we have this non nuanced way of looking at polar bears.

148
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.130
So people would get really mad if like they found that these Inuits were killing

149
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:28.964
polar bears.

150
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.930
But sometimes these folks are living in places where polar bears are entering

151
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:36.620
their villages and they they're super dangerous killing their babies.

152
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.640
<v 0>They'll kill people.</v>

153
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.930
<v 1>They will straight up kill people. You know, there's a comic. Who's a, um,</v>

154
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.740
he's uh, also a veterinarian. Kevin

155
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.920
he's a vet. Yeah. He's um, he's a guy who performed in Denver.

156
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.490
I met him in Denver. I was working with them. Oh, whoa.

157
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.640
<v 0>Yeah. He's he's famous in Denver Fitzgerald. He has a TV show out there.</v>

158
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.590
<v 1>Where Fitzgerald sales going to say Fitzgerald,</v>

159
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:02.830
but I thought it was wrong because my friend Dave Fitzgerald,

160
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.540
that was just talking about.

161
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.090
<v 0>Long white hair. Yeah.</v>

162
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.590
<v 1>He told me that polar bears out of the womb are like predator.</v>

163
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.990
You know like the movie predator, like out of the wound,

164
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.590
they're just trying to bite and kill out of the womb. Dope out of the womb.

165
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.550
They just come out and I was like, well, it makes sense. Right?

166
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.650
If you stop and think about what their life is,

167
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.730
everything is just white and frozen.

168
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.680
And occasionally catch something slipping.

169
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.810
They occasionally get someone who's sunning themselves and you get to them

170
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:34.070
before they can get away.

171
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:38.600
And you could dive in the water and grab a foot and drag them back up survival

172
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.450
man, the darkest store that I've ever heard. I don't know if this is true,

173
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:43.430
but let's pretend it is. Yeah, fine.

174
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.290
Was there was some sort of an expedition and there a boat hit some ice.

175
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.060
And so their boat started sinking and they had a real problem because the next

176
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:56.430
boat was hours away. So they call in and may day for the next boat.

177
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.130
And they climb out of the boat in time before it sinks.

178
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.460
And then they get to an ice shelter, like a, an ice raft,

179
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.780
a nice island island and the distance.

180
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.660
They see a polar bear Huck and it's many,

181
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:13.210
many ice land bridges or whatever. The photo.

182
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.503
<v 0>Island.</v>

183
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.870
<v 1>Away I steps, but it keeps jumping in the water and getting closer.</v>

184
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.860
It's trying to figure out what the they are. And then finally it gets to them,

185
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.280
finds out what they are. It's in the ice island next to them,

186
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.120
jumps in the water, pops up, grabs one guy.

187
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.410
There's nothing anybody can do about it. takes him, kills him,

188
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.540
drags him in the water. Again,

189
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.960
goes back on the other ice islands just starts eating them and.

190
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.040
<v 0>They're just chilling, watching.</v>

191
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.390
<v 1>It. They're one ice island away hoping that he doesn't stay hungry after he eats</v>

192
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.560
their friend. What.

193
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.520
<v 0>Was your least favorite friend?</v>

194
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.410
<v 1>And the boat comes and rescues.</v>

195
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.280
<v 0>Oh me, dude. And they had to watch their friend get eaten alive. Their friend.</v>

196
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.990
<v 1>Got eaten alive and he died. Probably.</v>

197
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.970
<v 0>He probably, he probably ate him in front of them. He probably did.</v>

198
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.810
He probably took it so they could see it. He didn't care. Yeah.

199
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:01.720
That's what I mean. Like he'll eat.

200
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.830
<v 1>When you eat a clam that you're eating in front of other clans. Depends.</v>

201
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.240
<v 0>On who I'm in front of. No, I'm sure he I'm sure the bear ate it to know.</v>

202
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.970
They want to heap. I'm saying he kept an eye on them. Yes.

203
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.990
It's like you're next dude.

204
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.560
<v 1>Well, he probably knows that they're there. If this isn't enough,</v>

205
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.070
you mean maybe the guy's like a small guy.

206
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.370
<v 0>What do you do? You just sit there and watch it. You jump in the water.</v>

207
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.000
What do you, what are you?

208
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.780
<v 1>I do. You can't swim away. You'll freeze to death. If you get in that water,</v>

209
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:30.180
you just have to sit there up the fact that if it chooses to kill you,

210
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:33.570
that's your time. There's nothing else you can do. You can't fight it off. Okay.

211
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.300
<v 0>Punch my buddy and knock them out. So it's easier than, you know what I mean?</v>

212
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.583
Knock them out.

213
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.390
<v 1>Here. Huh? Do you have to think about how much you love.</v>

214
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.320
<v 0>Your friends? Oh my God.</v>

215
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:42.210
There's so many people had knocked out Lee for bears to eat.

216
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.740
<v 1>There's yeah. There's a lot of people.</v>

217
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.990
<v 0>Most of them, most of my friends on.</v>

218
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.540
<v 1>But what it is is just it's it's inescapable</v>

219
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.310
the power that it has.
