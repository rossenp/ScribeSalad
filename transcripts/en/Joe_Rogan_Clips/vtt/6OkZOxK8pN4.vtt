00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 0>Did you ever light up someone with that physical video of me?</v>

2
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.520
When I was 19 from a TaeKwonDo tournament, making a guy fly through the air.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.050
Yeah. Yeah. Jamie. Oh my God. Easy. Okay.

4
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:18.000
Now here it is right here.

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.990
Are you kidding me, man? That was,

6
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.480
that was perfect. And he just sailed through the air.

7
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.690
Like that's terrible. It's not good. God, you got to pick your knee up.

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.960
Nope. See, it's not bad, but you have an inherent flaw in your technique.

9
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.300
That probably was never, never explained to you.

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.530
This is what I do for 49 million. Ain't bad. It's pretty good.

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.220
It's not right. I wouldn't want to get hit by that. Don't throw the,

12
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:52.530
kick it to your knees up high. Lift your knee up way high.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.850
Pass your waist and then throw the kick. Yes, me up first.

14
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.060
And then don't look over your stomach. Look over your shoulder.

15
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.220
Yeah, but knee first here. Hold on. I left right from here. Watch.

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.940
Oh son, Danielle, even,

17
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400
even in the check Norris blush you lift your knee up

18
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.150
and then kick watch one, two. Okay. Ready?

19
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.500
I'm not mad at Joe's form at all. No, dude.

20
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.770
I'd love to see our actual TaeKwonDo match, shrink Callan and relevant.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.070
That's better. I would just stare at their asses.

22
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.860
<v 1>And then they had these little microphones. Right? So with, yeah,</v>

23
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.740
I don't know about fast. There was like, it was five guys,

24
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:39.400
four or five guys and they start fighting on the guide and I knocked out

25
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.190
constantly because he would wake up. Right.

26
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.670
And everything went good and went good. And, but then I started realizing,

27
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:49.330
wait a minute, this, these guys are going to come back up all the time.

28
00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:51.160
You know, this is going to come to an end.

29
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.143
They're going to get the hell out of here.

30
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.180
<v 0>So just knocking them down. So you're hitting them. They're falling down,</v>

31
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.530
everyone that's coming at. You you're knocking down.

32
00:01:56.531 --> 00:01:57.910
But you're realizing you got to get out of.

33
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.470
<v 1>I had to get out of there. They looked at me at L stepped back a wall.</v>

34
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.790
They can see I'm visitors. Right. But behind me is the whole police force.

35
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.470
<v 0>On its.</v>

36
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.240
<v 1>Side because there were windows. So they, uh, they throw me in jail.</v>

37
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.740
And uh, because apparently one of those monitors was a cop and yeah.

38
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.250
And I knocked him out. Of course also, but he never told me that he was a guard,

39
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
but I was, I wouldn't have done that anyway. We're there. And this is also,

40
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:27.790
this is actually a funny story because before this all happened,

41
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:31.300
I'm talking to my wife and I'm already tanked. Right. And she says,

42
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.150
where are you laughing? Where you have so much fun. I said, honey, I'm drunk.

43
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.750
I'm having a lot of fun. She's no, your dad with two Swedish blonde girls. Huh?

44
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.940
I said, don't worry about it. You know me, if I'm drunk, you know,

45
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.140
I don't care about anything, especially not that I just want to have fun.

46
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.880
So after two days they allow me to get my first phone call and um,

47
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.150
I'm calling my wife and she's freaking out. I said, honey, you gotta be okay,

48
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:53.200
relax, relax. I say,

49
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.360
I got some good and some bad news for you want to hear first?

50
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.010
She's the good news. I said, I didn't to sweetest.

51
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.790
He says, the bad news is I'm in jail. You're going to hate me for this story.

52
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.470
Because every time, you know, just so funny, I think that's a hell of a story.

53
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.013
You got.

54
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.600
<v 2>He looks at his reading role. She call her names and he goes,</v>

55
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.900
come on, dude. Who the? Who the hell is this kid. Is this kid?

56
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.310
And uh, as me coach, he's like, that's your name?

57
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.370
He's like, I'm not saying that. Cause my whole full name is Kamari. Dean Kamara,

58
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.120
Dean Kamara, Dean. And he's like, I'm not going to say that. Like,

59
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.770
[inaudible], I'm going to call you Marty. So, you know, for him to bring it out

60
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.770
, I thought it was silly. But you know, these fans, fans wanna, they cause

61
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.770
 Ben is a representative of the trolls. Like most of the trolls look like Ben

62
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.603
asker. If I could give you any advice, that's hilarious.

63
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.250
<v 3>If you look at them from a skillset,</v>

64
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.470
Ben's not even worth waking up before like 10:00 AM in the morning.

65
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.700
But I don't like this dude, man, before my alarm goes off, I'm already awake.

66
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.330
I want to break his face, man. I want to break his rib cage.

67
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.670
And I don't want to knock them out early on. I don't.

68
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.620
I just want to hurt towards you that guy, man,

69
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:22.510
if I get the chance to torture him 14 minutes and 50 seconds before I stop

70
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.720
him, that's what I'm going to do, man. You know, I just,

71
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.430
I don't like to dude at all met him a long time ago. He's a break, man.

72
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.660
I don't like him. There's not too many people that I genuinely dislike.

73
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.494
He's one of them.

74
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.000
<v 2>Bread is in the building and these guys just flat.</v>

75
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.880
How did that seem come to play where you were with Hicks and Gracie?

76
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.490
<v 4>Oh, cause I, cause I was, I studied at Quito when I was in college. Um,</v>

77
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.500
but because my interest in that for years when we went to Rio

78
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:08.980
Rio and I had been working on the script of that movie and stuff and I was like,

79
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.510
I was really interested in this idea that banner is

80
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.870
desperate for control, right? That he desperately,

81
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:20.800
desperately needs to control his heart rate, his breathing.

82
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.140
That it's a massive liability in his mind if he can't control his

83
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.400
emotions and his adrenaline. And I was like, well, who in the world?

84
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.510
And I had seen the videos of him. I'd never met him or any of them,

85
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:36.550
but I'd seen the videos of him doing the, um,

86
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.630
amazing stuff with his stomach and the breathing. And I was like,

87
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.540
and I just was like, we have to end. And everyone was like, who's that?

88
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.680
I was like, I was like, I was like Philistines, you're all Philistines.

89
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.590
I was like, and I was like, find me Hickson,

90
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:55.060
Gracie and ask him if he'll do a scene with me in the movie being the guy who's

91
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:58.880
training banner to like calm himself. And he was there and he did,

92
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.040
and he did it with us and it was like, I was like.

93
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.770
<v 5>So that's S that's a very essential thing which sometimes sleep through people's</v>

94
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:11.630
fingers and, and the priorities in the daily, you know, in the, the payments.

95
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:15.380
And I put you in a role where, uh, I feel like,

96
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.560
um, if you tell me in the past, what's the core edge,

97
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.030
what's the opposite of courage.

98
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.680
I want to say cowardness because either you tough enough to,

99
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:29.390
to challenge and to fight or to, or,

100
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.130
and then you will call her then you chicken out.

101
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:35.990
So that's in the past was like the, the, the, the opposite of, of,

102
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.610
of courage is very hard to measure this in those days.

103
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.050
And I believe the opposite of quarters should they is conformity, you know,

104
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.490
as people get conformed, oh, I don't like my wife the way I used to, like,

105
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.840
but I'm never going to divorce because I'm afraid to lose my house or the

106
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.410
situation is so established. So I going to keep, so I don't like this job,

107
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.670
but I'm going to keep here because better than his. So in, in, in other hands,

108
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.480
if you, if you get caught on that kind of compromise to, to maintain,

109
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.580
because you will, you afraid to risk,

110
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.110
that's keep you like one step behind from you. Follow your heart,

111
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.560
follow your ambition. You sure. 18 years old, you don't think twice.

112
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:18.230
And the guy said, Hey, let's go to Australia. You think, okay, let's go, boom.

113
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.170
But when you're 52 sales trial and what are they going to do there,

114
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:25.850
maybe I'm going to, so it's different, you know, and that's kind of,

115
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.180
yeah. So that's kind of pretty much where keep you from be at your

116
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:36.890
best, because if you willing to sacrifice,

117
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.640
if you willing to, to broke new, new challenges,

118
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:44.080
if you really chew you in stage of liveliness and,

119
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:48.980
and excitement and unpredictability, who make you feel like you in heaven?

120
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.950
<v 6>Well, I write a, I write letters to everyone.</v>

121
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.100
That's close to me before we fight. Really? Yeah.

122
00:07:55.101 --> 00:08:00.050
And every time I come back alive in the fight, I burn them all. Wow.

123
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.700
So literally I'm training the three months that I'm training for a fight

124
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.190
I'm literally training not to die.

125
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.950
And if you knew there was a possibly you're going to die in this certain era,

126
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.300
most people would avoid it, but we have to do we,

127
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.630
I have to walk there and my own will and the stress level for me. I mean,

128
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:23.960
I wish I could just take it lighter and say, it's a sport. I mean,

129
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.630
every time I fought after I fought, win or lose, I always felt like.

130
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.070
And I still over I'm alive because I was willing to die in the fight. You know.

131
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.061
<v 0>You know,</v>

132
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:36.680
you were on death's door and recover from it and then put yourself back in

133
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:37.514
risk.

134
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.280
<v 7>Yep. I mean, yeah. Saying it like that. It, it, it there's no,</v>

135
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.500
there's no justifying that other than I was in this sport that,

136
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.980
that I really wanted to, to, to be in and stay in. And, uh,

137
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:56.910
and after the disease I wanted to go back to, and that was the,

138
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.210
that was the landscape. And so you viewed it, you thought, okay, um,

139
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.830
this is not ideal, but you asked the question,

140
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.910
what am I really, you know, having, knowing my health history, right.

141
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.670
With cancer, with all the,

142
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:15.510
all that I went through is going back to my sport and taking EPO a risk

143
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.350
to that, to that, you know, to my, to, to my disease or to my health.

144
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.180
Um, and I, and the answer to that, obviously my answer to myself was no.

145
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.000
<v 8>Joe, without a shadow of a doubt,</v>

146
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.860
none whatsoever. Death is not the end.

147
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.660
You don't think so. I know. I know too. How do you know? Cause I've been dead,

148
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.830
right? Yes. I've been dead. What about that experience?

149
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.170
Cemented it in your head? Um,

150
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.370
when I w like I said, it was the most peaceful,

151
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.400
um, and, and I don't feel like it was the most peace,

152
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.380
most restful most I was, I woke up laughing.

153
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.380
I was, yeah. Yeah. My house.

154
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.480
I was overjoyed. Yeah. You still think about it. Nah, see,

155
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.100
cause what happened to me was I woke up in the hospital and had emergency heart

156
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:20.580
surgery, like 98. So it was like, I was like, oh, I'm done smoking.

157
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.590
What happened was I went to bed was time. I'm real tired. I'm not feeling good.

158
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:30.480
Went to sleep and woke up in Cedars, like after surgery,

159
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.890
you know, it was my extreme fortune to live in a neighborhood, uh, that w the,

160
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.300
the, the closest hospital was Cedar Sinai. And that it was, it was, you know,

161
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:42.780
also my, uh, Irish luck that, uh,

162
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.270
the best heart surgeon in the world who Dr. William Trento wa who's chief

163
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:49.590
of heart surgery over there.

164
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:53.040
I think maybe even of all surgery saw my case and told somebody else that you

165
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:56.760
can't do that. I have to do that. And what I have in there now is a St.

166
00:10:56.761 --> 00:11:01.470
Jude's heart valve. It's a titanium heart valve. Like I took like a watch, man,

167
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.980
when you want to hear, hold on, get real sensitive on this mug right here.

168
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.720
<v 9>Oh my God. Holy.</v>

169
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.130
<v 10>Oh, wow. But then my brother says, this thing probably define my life.</v>

170
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.990
My brother goes, uh, he died screaming and I go,

171
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.640
what, what? And he goes, he, he died screaming. And I was like, w I mean,

172
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.030
as is that a figure of speech? And he goes, no, he literally,

173
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:34.350
he died screaming and you could see, my brother was haunted by it.

174
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.310
And my father wasn't like, I wouldn't say he was a Butch man or strong man,

175
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:40.920
but he wasn't a soft man moneys judge in the imagination.

176
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.400
And I never heard him get real loud or anything like that.

177
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:48.810
And the notion of my father dying, screaming changed my life. Cause I was like,

178
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.710
even a good man in this world. He played a game. He played straight.

179
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.300
He played by the rules. You do everything you're supposed to,

180
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.760
you're gonna die screaming. And at that point I was like,

181
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:02.050
there's no point in not trying to accomplish every stupid

182
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.540
dream. I've got chase it all down.

183
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.880
Chasing whimsy is what I've been doing for the last few years.

184
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.300
But chase it all and do it all. Cause we're all gonna die screaming.
