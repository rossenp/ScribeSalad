<v 1>The, and the other thing is like, you're going to become a conservative.</v>

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:07.740
Well then, well then, okay, now you're tribal key.

4
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.320
Can't you just be someone who's politically homeless. Like,

5
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:14.730
why do you have to be on this other side now? Now you have to like, you know,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.740
say I'm a God fearing Christian. And Donald Trump was brought here by Jesus,

7
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:23.760
man. I met Trump this past weekend where this man has regular sized hands.

8
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.710
By the way, they're not tiny. The media they're full of.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.530
You sure he wasn't wearing a fake hands. He might've been wearing fake hands.

10
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.390
He's a clever fellow slapstick putting on his fake hair at the UFC.

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.090
What was he like came over to me when I was working,

12
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:39.570
I had my headphones on and I said, Hey, how you doing, man? Nice to meet.

13
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.404
You shook his hand.

14
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.010
<v 0>And uh, got a video of it. It's kind of hilarious.</v>

15
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.550
He's like you do tremendous job. Amazing job. Good job.

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.760
And then he said to Daniel Cormier was next to me who was a former light

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.680
heavyweight champion and the former heavyweight champion. He goes,

18
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:54.330
I do not want to fight this guy. I didn't know

19
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.540
I was president. I should've got a selfie with him.

20
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.740
I should have missed opportunity. We're going to do it was weird.

21
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.110
It was very weird when he walked in, though, I'm telling you, man,

22
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.010
they cheered the out of him. Oh, he is like a, um,

23
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.870
