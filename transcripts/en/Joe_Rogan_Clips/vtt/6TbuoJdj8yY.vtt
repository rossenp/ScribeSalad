00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.590
When you have these people that are working for the Russians or even people that

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.330
are working on the left that are trying. I mean,

4
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:14.220
if there really is someone that's doing that to the Donald subreddit on Reddit,

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.720
what do you do? If you're in a free speech, you're supposed to allow that,

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:18.960
right.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.190
<v 1>You could just create a metric. Oh. You know, or,</v>

8
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:25.140
or some sort of mechanism that red flags and account publicly.

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.050
<v 0>But I think this is where it gets slippery. Right.</v>

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.760
Because then you're talking about an algorithm you're talking about manipulating

11
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:33.480
search results.

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.280
<v 1>You're talking about not that route, what.</v>

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.470
<v 0>I'm saying is not that rubbed, but this is where it goes. Right.</v>

14
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:42.000
If you just keep managing the content, instead of like someone like, like gab,

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.690
where they just let the content flow free. Yeah. But obviously you go there.

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.690
There's a lot of dumpster fires. Madison. I chaos.

17
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.770
<v 1>Oh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. Nothing's going to be perfect. Right. You know?</v>

18
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.480
Um, I think whenever you see a bad that's good, right?

19
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.840
Oh yeah. Uh, bad is a, uh,

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.830
a portal to good. It is, uh,

21
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.840
an opportunity to fix something because at some point

22
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.730
that problem was going to emerge. Right. It just emerged now. So it's like,

23
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.580
oh wow, okay. Here's this problem. The solution,

24
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.520
every problem lies within a problem. So technically there is no problem.

25
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.220
So let's just go ahead and solve this problem and move on to the next one,

26
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:27.660
you know, but I love problems. I love solving problems. I think it's really fun.

27
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.170
Uh, so when I see a problem, I go, Hm, okay. Let's, let's think about this.

28
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.240
And sometimes it's not a one person job, you know,

29
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:36.060
it's a whole committee and a whole bunch of minds have to get together.

30
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.570
So when I look at the conservative community, I think about like, you know,

31
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:40.950
aren't, you have all these minds,

32
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.630
but are your minds working to complain or your mind's working to solve the

33
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.590
problem. And it seems like the minds aren't working to solve the problem,

34
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.650
their work in a complaint. Right? So for example, um,

35
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.660
during the early 20th century or early 19 hundreds is do with this newspaper

36
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
super popular in New York. And, uh, he puts some, uh,

37
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.300
inflammatory things about a certain family in New York city. And, uh,

38
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.450
all the department stores boycott the newspapers. He has no advertises.

39
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.820
So they did that to put them out of business.

40
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.950
And his gentlemen takes the space and gives it to the proletariat

41
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.130
or the, you know, small business guys in the area.

42
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.160
And he gives them full front page ads, right.

43
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:25.440
Stuff that the department stores couldn't buy.

44
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.320
And then what happened was after the,

45
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:31.560
the newspaper got a circuit latent length that the department stores department

46
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:34.920
stores came back and they said, yo, alright, all right, fine, fine.

47
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.610
We'll we'll pay, we'll come back. And he said, no, I'll need you anymore.

48
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.550
You know, I have people that can do this. I can do this with the people.

49
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.970
And his newspaper was successful until the day he died.

50
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.050
So when I look at that example that was able to thrive in 19, uh, you know,

51
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.590
20th, something new in 1910. And whenever it was, I look at it and I'm like,

52
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.270
if this guy just stood on his laurels and didn't bow,

53
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.830
you know, then why we do it as a nation or as a team, you know? Um,

54
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.330
I think it's very possible to, uh, so for example, like when we look at gap,

55
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.340
right, there's a new competitor. I'm not going to mention the name,

56
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.780
but it's like they,

57
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.310
whoever was the establishment created this alternative platform to compete with

58
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.930
gap. In other words.

59
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.070
<v 0>You don't wanna mention.</v>

60
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.880
<v 1>The name now, screw them really? Yeah. Puck them. Um, what's bad about them.</v>

61
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.660
They're establishment, right? Oh, so, so when I look at it, so.

62
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.390
<v 0>Establishment has created another free speech platform.</v>

63
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.620
<v 1>Allegedly, allegedly,</v>

64
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.230
they're just going to collect the data on these people and then, you know,

65
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:36.100
sell it off. What makes you think that intuition, uh, you know,

66
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.750
Hoteps have been told you, you know.

67
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.120
<v 0>You should make a shirt that should be a shirt. Oh, we got a shirt.</v>

68
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.343
Hoteps has been told you.

69
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.240
<v 1>Oh yeah, I'll go to this. I show every Thursday, 8:00 PM. Eastern time.</v>

70
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.580
Um, so yeah. Um, you know, uh, I can, I can kind of,

71
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.430
I've been calling a lot of these shots and a lot of these things and you know,

72
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.240
it's just certain things that, you know, I'm a tech startup founder. Right,

73
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:01.660
right.

74
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.950
So it's certain things I can see within a business that the average person can't

75
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:08.350
see. And I'm like, God, that doesn't make sense. That doesn't look right.

76
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.500
And then when you see, uh, you know, as a tech startup,

77
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.140
it's really hard to get going right at first. But when you see like MSNBC, dah,

78
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.830
dah, dah, and it's just like, how'd you get all these coverage that fast?

79
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.410
Who do you know? You know what I mean?

80
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.040
And then you start seeing the influencers that are going over there and pushing

81
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.290
them like, oh, these are all established. I see what's going on.

82
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.520
What you didn't want.

83
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.960
You didn't want an alternative platform that you didn't

84
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:35.794
control.

85
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.760
<v 0>Mm. Okay. So they creating an alternative platform that they can control.</v>

86
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.150
They can control air quotes alternative. Correct? Yeah. Well,

87
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.040
I think the writing is on the wall. Right?

88
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.540
If they look at the there's only one Twitter, there's only one Instagram,

89
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.030
there's only one YouTube and those are giant.

90
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.410
And Facebook is basically the only thing like that. Right. I mean,

91
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.160
there's really no competitor to Facebook. And in, in that space.

92
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.430
<v 1>I mean, this is four of them. They're all trash. Let's be honest.</v>

93
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.540
Oh my goodness. This all.

94
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.070
<v 0>Trash Hotep is going off.</v>

95
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.880
<v 1>Facebook, trash. I've been saying that for like the past decade.</v>

96
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.900
Facebook's trash. I stopped using Facebook a decade ago. Right. If I used it,

97
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:15.940
it was just like forced, you know what? I use it as a.

98
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.390
<v 0>Publishing outlet when I put tour dates or something like that,</v>

99
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:20.260
I put it on Facebook.

100
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.070
<v 1>Right, exactly. Yeah. So, you know, I can, I can respect that.</v>

101
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.300
I don't use Instagram.

102
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:28.240
I lifted months ago when Farah Kanca kicked off the platform,

103
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.670
a bunch of conservatives got kicked off the platform and the guy I don't need

104
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.270
this neither. So I left and also to keep your account just in.

105
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.103
<v 0>Case. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

106
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.990
<v 1>Yeah. It's bookmarked. Um, you know, I got to automate a bot.</v>

107
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.220
I'm going to set up and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know,

108
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.240
F these platforms, we don't need them. They're not that great.

109
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.620
If you look at the story on Instagram, Instagram was a, uh,

110
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.940
a lucky project. It was serendipitous, right? Basically what happened was, uh,

111
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.350
some kids built a project. It was called Instagram.

112
00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:59.150
They were working on a whole bunch of other things.

113
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.090
Some popular kids started using a platform.

114
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.870
It blew up and then they pass it on to Facebook from the very inception. I said,

115
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:10.850
this is a very trash prod product. It's just horrible. Horribly curated. Right.

116
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.950
It's so horribly curated that Facebook can't even monetize a platform properly.

117
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.480
Right. But that's a whole nother story.

118
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.640
But the platform itself and its functionality is stupid. It's just.

119
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.750
<v 0>Popular. Well, you know,</v>

120
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:28.700
what's weird is like replying to people and reading replies. Like what,

121
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:30.290
in the comments like you can't even keep up with.

122
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.140
<v 1>No, no. And you can't get all your notifications,</v>

123
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.350
the notifications aren't curated properly. It's just, it's like,

124
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:39.350
as if they don't care, right. They don't care. Right.

125
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.690
<v 0>I don't care. Or is it that it got so big,</v>

126
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:45.570
so quick and it's stuck in this format. You'd have to kind of reformat.

127
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.630
<v 1>They don't care. No, thanks. So they don't care. They don't care.</v>

128
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.670
If you, if you want to build a product for your user,

129
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.000
you can do that. If you want to build a product for advertisers,

130
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.180
you can do that. They built the product for advertisers. And now for users,

131
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.500
if they build it for users,

132
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.770
you and I will be able to have a conversation on them. Well, is it.

133
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.990
<v 0>Originally, wasn't it text America? Was that the same thing was text America.</v>

134
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.520
The original one.

135
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.670
That's the one where I have the picture of the prostitute and the bathroom.

136
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.350
<v 2>You mean like where you would text something to.</v>

137
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.240
<v 0>You send a photo, you send a photo in a text, but it wasn't like,</v>

138
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.180
I go up to an internet website. It would be like.

139
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.000
<v 2>On a site, like imagery or something. Not like a feed where people would.</v>

140
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.390
<v 0>Follow you. Like that was it. No, there was a thing that you would follow.</v>

141
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.960
That's where that picture came.

142
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.411
<v 2>From. I know that,</v>

143
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.810
but I didn't remember it being like a website or anything like that. That.

144
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.700
<v 0>Was back when there was no applications. Ma'am.</v>

145
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.290
Cause I took that from a flip phone.

146
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.560
<v 2>Deal. That's the difference? It's not a phone, like a smartphone.</v>

147
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.420
<v 0>Yeah. There was no smartphones back then.</v>

148
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.240
And then you would have to go to a website to see all your photos.

149
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.770
So like you have a young Jamie page on text America and all the pictures that

150
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:49.850
you would take in the.

151
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.540
<v 2>Photos on Instagram. A lot of people were, you'd be like, as a photographer,</v>

152
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:57.530
you'd be kinda like, on. If you weren't taking it with your iPhone only Mike,

153
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:01.430
and you were uploading DSLR photos. You'd be like, oh, you're cheating.

154
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.293
Look at you.

155
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.930
<v 0>Right. But now it filters. Like some of these girls who look like cartoons,</v>

156
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.040
they didn't even look like humans.

157
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.250
<v 1>Um, I, you know, it comes down to is like, you know, I wish I could hone us.</v>

158
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:13.010
Right. So, you know, a lot of people told me and I was like, yo,

159
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:15.170
you missing out on a lot of money on Facebook.

160
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:17.720
You missed out on a lot of Instagram money on Instagram.

161
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.900
My homie's a millionaire off of Instagram and Facebook advertising.

162
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.300
And he talking about, and I'm like, I'm not in this for money, bro.

163
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.080
I got a message to get across and I can't get it across on these platforms.

164
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.430
They suck. Right.

165
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.400
But are you going to have the kahunas to come and say,

166
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.660
I'm choosing my laurels over. I'm choosing my morals over the money.

167
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.110
Cause there's a lot of people out here that are on the Facebook platform,

168
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:42.860
just for money.

169
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.150
I spoke to a conservative influencer and a

170
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.180
brother basically said, I'm trying to feed my daughter,

171
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.620
but the stuff he's putting out on Facebook, he doesn't believe in.

172
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.680
So.

173
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.020
<v 0>He's just doing it for profits, doing it for profit. Ooh.</v>

174
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.180
That's where it gets weird. Right? He says,

175
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:02.010
then people are not going to believe you. Once you say, well,

176
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:03.840
I was doing that for money, but now I'm telling you the truth.

177
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.290
<v 1>I'm talking about this. These are the people that everybody believes.</v>

178
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.260
These are the ones that have captured a large audience.

179
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.590
I mean, talking about, you know, type of money you can pull in on, on Facebook.

180
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.770
But you know, he literally says, you know, I'll go on Twitter.

181
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:24.030
I'll make one tweet and it'll get like 2000 retweets. And then, you know, uh,

182
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.210
you know, you know, it's, his brain just blows up like that.

183
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.900
But it's because he, he knows the buzzwords, right?

184
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.350
He knows what to say to get the people going. I'll go that route.

185
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.290
You know what I mean? If I don't like Facebook, I'm not going to use it.

186
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:39.810
If I don't like Facebook, I'm not gonna use Instagram. You know,

187
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.510
I'm just gonna stick with what I like. I liked Twitter.

188
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:45.630
And I told people in 2009, when I go now I'm Twitter. You know,

189
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.190
I deal in marketing.

190
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:50.780
So I always say focus on one channel when it comes to social media,

191
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.250
just one channel, unless you have the staff to manage.

192
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.290
<v 0>Well, Twitter is how I found out about you.</v>

193
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.300
And that's all I found out about your videos.

194
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.300
And I found out if what you're going to watch your videos. And if,

195
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.350
if that didn't exist in the, the portal for the video,

196
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.420
you're putting your videos on YouTube, right? I mean, what,

197
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.970
how else would someone get their message out? If you, if you,

198
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.940
if you think that these platforms are all trashed, if they didn't exist,

199
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:13.080
I wouldn't find out about you.

200
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.250
<v 1>Great. Twitter's great. Remember, I've never mentioned Twitter.</v>

201
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.180
<v 0>You said all of them are trash, but all of them, except that's.</v>

202
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.030
<v 1>What Twitter. Twitter is my baby, man. I love Twitter. That's what he.</v>

203
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.200
<v 0>Likes so much about Twitter. It's.</v>

204
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.560
<v 1>Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's a perfect platform to crowdsource information.</v>

205
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:34.800
Number one, right? Um, like you said, without Twitter,

206
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.210
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

207
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.180
I could've never got you on Facebook or Instagram that would've never happened.

208
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.630
<v 0>Maybe Instagram, some of a friend, most of it is like, Hey,</v>

209
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.390
one of my friends says, check out this guy, this guy is cool.

210
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:47.820
This guy's interesting. Right. Maybe you should talk to this guy. Okay.

211
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.080
That's how it usually happens.

212
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.300
And then I'll go to your page and I checked it out and I saw a lot of

213
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:54.510
interesting conversations you were having and saw some videos.

214
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.460
<v 1>Well, the thing is Instagram. Doesn't allow you to see in my heart,</v>

215
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.700
they don't allow you to see in the soul Twitter.

216
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.440
I can really connect with people. How.

217
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.700
<v 0>Come you can't do that in Instagram?</v>

218
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.980
<v 1>The algorithm, man, you know you.</v>

219
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.450
<v 0>Oh you mean because it hides stuff and stuff. Once you develop a good following,</v>

220
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:14.880
it doesn't really matter. People who go to your page, like, how will it look.

221
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.620
<v 1>For you? But how often can you post.</v>

222
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.400
<v 0>On Instagram? How often can you post with, well,</v>

223
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:22.710
you can't do it like Twitter where you can just do it every couple of minutes.

224
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:23.520
You see what I'm saying?

225
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.230
<v 1>So if I wanted to,</v>

226
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.910
I could go from deep to where my middle-aged white women at, right.

227
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.400
In 15 minutes time, you know, I can take you deep and then I can make you laugh.

228
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.410
You know what I mean? And I can share, you know,

229
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:38.850
something else I could share my video.

230
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.940
<v 0>And you can have photos on Twitter, just like you could have on Instagram.</v>

231
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.650
I want it to go live.

232
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.810
<v 1>And, and, and, and so Twitter is great.</v>

233
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.860
How they curate the live feature.

234
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.600
It lands at the top of your phone on mobile. Right? It's beautiful. Like,

235
00:11:54.601 --> 00:11:57.310
like they, like, they get product, you know,

236
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:59.050
I don't feel like Instagram gets product.
