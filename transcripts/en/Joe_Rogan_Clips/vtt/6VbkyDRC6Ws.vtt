00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What was your first gig? Like what was the first,</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.760
first professional gig that you got, where it was like, holy,

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.410
I'm getting paid to do makeup.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.790
<v 1>Well, I mean, the first time I ever got paid, actually you did.</v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.200
I think I did a makeup for a stage actor who wanted to be old

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.940
and I charged him $75 and,

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.070
um, which was, you know, more money than I ever gotten from anything before.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.470
Like I said, I just came up with a number in your head. Yeah. Well,

9
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:35.290
I kind of somehow figured it out, but, uh, anyways, I,

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.400
I did these pieces for him and, uh,

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.560
he lived off that Pasadena freeway. That one, it has a weird right ankle.

12
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.780
Uh off-ramps you know,

13
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.930
and my dad drove me there cause they couldn't and I didn't drive at the time.

14
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:49.590
And,

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.570
and he actually had a makeup kit and had some hair pieces in and a bunch of

16
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:56.340
stuff. And he said, you know,

17
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.880
I will trade you this instead of giving you the $75,

18
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.940
I'll give you this makeup case and with full of this stuff. And I was like,

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.640
yeah, that's really cool. You know, but my dad wanted to teach me, you know,

20
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.730
responsibilities and stuff. And this was around the time I, I,

21
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.500
I think I was like 16 and was going to try to drive and he goes a year.

22
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.951
Uh,

23
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.130
my insurance is going to go up and what you have to do is you have to get that

24
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.360
money and you have to give me the money to, for the rate of the insurance.

25
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.450
That's going up. It's was like, oh man, I really want this makeup kit. But,

26
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.350
but I mean, I had amazing parents who, I mean, I wouldn't have been,

27
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.900
I wouldn't be who I am if it wasn't for them. I mean, that's cool.

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.640
They supported me at my crazy decision to make monsters for a

29
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:39.810
living. Well, they must've.

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.760
<v 0>Been so happy when it paid off though. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.650
<v 1>I was glad that they lived long enough to see that.</v>

32
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.910
And I got to bring my parents to the Oscars a few times and, and uh, you know,

33
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.360
they were, they were very proud and, and, uh, and you know,

34
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:55.260
it was funny cause I mean, I had like my mom's brother and my uncle would,

35
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.940
you know, say stuff like, you know,

36
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.900
when is Ricky gonna stop doing this silly stuff and do something he can make a

37
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.450
living at, you know, and what is he going to grow up? But yeah,

38
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.630
all those people, but you know, my dad basically never grew up in,

39
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:08.910
I knew I never was going to, you know, what was your dad?

40
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.100
What'd he do for a living? He did a bunch of different things.

41
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:14.730
He was a high school dropout because he had to help his family.

42
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.290
His mother and father had, you know,

43
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.330
paid bills and he had a variety of not very good jobs.

44
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.190
He worked at Sears as a sales man. He drove a truck, he did stuff,

45
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.420
but he was always,

46
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.890
he was very creative and it was kind of held down in his lifetime. You know,

47
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:31.470
don't do that. You can't run, you know, do something, you can make a living.

48
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.640
And because of that, I benefited from that. He supported the creativity.

49
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.870
And when I, um, I think it was a sophomore in high school,

50
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.660
he decided he wanted to try to make a living as an artist.

51
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.030
And we lived on my mom's bank teller salary for a number of years.

52
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:53.010
He hardly made any money at all. Um, but he was happy, you know? And,

53
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.720
and he, uh, because I mean, like I said, he,

54
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.680
he supported my creativity and he was really my first teacher. He,

55
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.150
he shot showed me what you could do with pain.

56
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.960
He knew a little bit about sculpture, you know, uh, he,

57
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.080
he was also a fan of monster movies, you know, and he, you know, he saw,

58
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.990
you know, the Frederick March, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde when it came out,

59
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.910
you know, and told me all about it.

60
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.210
And that was a movie that they didn't have on TV that I really wanted to see,

61
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.560
you know, and he said, uh, when he saw it in the theaters, you know,

62
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.200
he wouldn't have had to hide his eyes or high by the seat, you know,

63
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:27.010
and I so wanted to see that. And, and he also said, you know, war of the worlds,

64
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.240
the George Powell, that was so cool and the sound effects were great.

65
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.160
And that was never on either in, when I was in the seventh grade,

66
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:38.290
I think it was, I, uh,

67
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.070
decided to get on the student council for the main reason.

68
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:46.270
This was my plan was I suggested that we could raise money for the school by

69
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:49.810
having showing movies after school, we could rent 16 Miller movies,

70
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.420
16 millimeter movies and show them and charge admission.

71
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.350
And I basically just went through all the movies. I hadn't seen that.

72
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:58.200
I wanted to see and got those, you know,

73
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.670
and there were maybe four or five people that showed up to see him,

74
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:01.504
but I was happy.

75
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.860
<v 0>That's awesome. What was the first film that you did special?</v>

76
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.230
<v 1>First film was a film called the Octo man.</v>

77
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.940
And it's kind of a cult classic because it's such a crappy movie. You know,

78
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.820
it was shot in 10 days, uh, at it all at Bronson canyon, uh, in,

79
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:21.490
in Griffith park when there was a night. Uh, see,

80
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:25.570
I graduated from high school in 1969 and I went to two years to a junior

81
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:29.710
college, uh, 69, 70, 71, uh, I guess it was.

82
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.700
<v 0>And you went from that to star wars only like five or six years later, right?</v>

83
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.110
<v 1>Yeah. Something like that. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. And king Kong and</v>

84
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.543
[inaudible], I didn't design, oh my goodness.

85
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.703
<v 0>Look at that.</v>

86
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.290
<v 1>But I mean, this was, I was a full-time student.</v>

87
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.520
I had six weeks and like, uh,

88
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:54.700
I think a thousand dollars to make this suit. And, uh, so I,

89
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.760
after school, uh, I, and I got my, a friend,

90
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.150
the very first job I ever had actually this and this again happened because of

91
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:05.800
my dad when he was a truck driver, uh, delivering plumbing supplies. Uh,

92
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.450
he went to the wrong building in the building he went into was called Chloe

93
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:14.380
productions and they made Gumby and David and Goliath stop motion animation,

94
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.120
which I did stop motion as well, big Ray Harryhausen fan, you know? Um,

95
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.040
and for some reason I grew up in Covina, which is east of LA,

96
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.420
like 30 or 40 miles. And wasn't in there wasn't anything film related out there,

97
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:31.390
but for some reason Clarkies was out there. Um,

98
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.620
I think because it was cheaper rent and he,

99
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.830
I was my, on my quarter a week allowance.

100
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.990
When I found a place I could buy rubber, it was like eight,

101
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.200
almost $9 for a quarter rubber. And, you know,

102
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.740
it took me a lot of weeks in a lot of more lines and a lot of stuff to save up

103
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:52.390
that money. And I said, I need to, I need a job. So I, I didn't have a car.

104
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.600
We only had one car in the family. And, you know, I went to any place.

105
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:59.510
I could walk to a supermarkets, you know, bus, boys, all that stuff.

106
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.990
Nobody wanted me. And, um, my dad said, oh,

107
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:05.930
I remember this place and did stop motion and you'd stop motion, you know,

108
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.560
maybe. So I went there with my box of stuff, you know, and,

109
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.430
and it was summer vacation between my junior and senior year of high school.

110
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.990
And they said, start tomorrow, uh, got paid minimum wage, which I think was,

111
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.600
you know, a dollar twenty-five or something at the time.

112
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.770
But that place was like a magnet for any weird kid or any kid.

113
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.120
It was like a stop motion fan,

114
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.420
any stop motion person would show up there at one point or another.

115
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.290
And I met this guy named Doug Beswick, who was a few years older than me.

116
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.190
And we became again, fast friends, you know, he read famous monsters.

117
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:41.630
He was a Ray Harryhausen fan. And Doug, uh, when I did this, this, uh,

118
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.370
Octa manned film, Doug had a, uh,

119
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.360
a little workshop and we did it in his workshop and we did it together. Wow.

120
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.410
But yeah, it was a,

121
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.460
it was a real introduction to the film industry because it was the very first

122
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:57.020
days filming, filming in Bronson canyon, Griffith park. Uh, we show up,

123
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.010
we went and Doug's 57 Chevy. It had Okta man in the backseat, you know, and,

124
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.900
and we show up there and looking around and there's nobody there. And I go,

125
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:10.820
what the hell? You know? So, and this is before cell phones and all that. Uh,

126
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.090
so we'd have to go. We went back down the hill, down Bronson canyon to it.

127
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:17.360
Like there was a market there and I got a pay phone called the production

128
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:21.140
office. And it was like, oh yeah. W uh, we pushed one day.

129
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.640
We just forgot to tell you, you know, it's like a movie called the Octa man.

130
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.120
You forgot to tell the people who were making the up demand,

131
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.790
the title character of the movie that you weren't filming.

132
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.000
And it was also, I mean, they,

133
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.130
that's a perfect introduction to the movie industry though. Oh, it was. And,

134
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:41.330
and I learned that, that, you know, you can't believe anything. They tell you,

135
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.510
you know, I mean, th it was designed by somebody else. And, uh,

136
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.220
I got this job handed down through people I met at cloggy. So, uh,

137
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.820
it was going to be stop motion. At one point,

138
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.430
they decided that was too expensive. They're going to make a suit.

139
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.970
And first thing I did was a little maquette and, uh, um,

140
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.020
a little what MCAT has a small sculpture of the design, but I said,

141
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.120
there's cause he had, they,

142
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:05.840
they tried to figure out how they could do eight tentacles on a man and his feet

143
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:10.250
kind of like turned into tentacles and it kind of split off and to a back

144
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:12.740
technical. But I said, I think they look like elf shoes and it,

145
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.570
and it was not a good way for me to join the two things together. And it's like,

146
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:18.530
kid, don't worry about it.

147
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.930
There's only going to be one shot of the Okta man in the movie where you

148
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:24.710
actually see it. The rest of the time is just gonna be a shadow or a glimpse,

149
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.930
you know, but we'll have a money shot where you can, you know,

150
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:31.910
make sure it looks great. The movie starts out with a closeup of his feet,

151
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.940
you know, basically, you know, uh, and you know, it was,

152
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.320
it was a real introduction to, I,

153
00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:41.060
I thought it was going to be like working on eight millimeter,

154
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.250
millimeter movies like I did as a kid, you know,

155
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:47.510
everybody just jumps in and we're making a movie, let's do it. Right? Yeah.

156
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.570
Wasn't that the DP, the director of photography,

157
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.830
because I had long hair and Doug had long hair, he called us the girls.

158
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.940
This was at a time when long hair was, you know,

159
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.350
we'll get the girls to get their silly monster suit out, you know? Um,

160
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.960
uh, but we, there was a,

161
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.540
if you can believe this there's the Octa man was written by the guy that

162
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.990
was the writer of creature and black lagoon. And he also wrote,

163
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.690
it came from outer space. Ah,

164
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.950
so it was basically those two scripts combined with Evolut, uh, with, uh,

165
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.360
ecology thrown in. Uh, and he,

166
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.420
we, you know, it was like, there's this day where instead of in, you know,

167
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:34.110
in the creature, they, they put a log across the lagoon and they can't get out.

168
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.651
You know, here,

169
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:38.010
it was a log across the street and they're driving it away to go Winnebago and

170
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.220
they can't get out. They get out to try to get the log out and they,

171
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.540
they opened the Winnebago door and the Okta man's in there and he knocks a guy

172
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:47.490
down and then they supposed to the other,

173
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:49.980
guy's supposed to pick up a log and throw it to the Octa man and uncle,

174
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:53.400
you know, where's the prop log that we're going to use. And, and, uh,

175
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.550
and you know, he goes, what's that, it's that? And I go, that's,

176
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.830
it's a tree limb. You know, I got it.

177
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.470
That's going to hurt the guy in the suit and it's going to hurt the suit,

178
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.470
you know? And I go, and we were going to rehearse this, right? He goes, no,

179
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:06.930
we don't have time to rehearse it. And I go, what, oh, when he,

180
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.150
the document's supposed to bend over and pick up the pier, Angela,

181
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.200
who was the female lead,

182
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:14.460
who killed herself after this movie can tell you how good the movie was.

183
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.670
You know? Um, I said, when he goes to pick her up, let's cut there.

184
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:19.110
Because if you cut,

185
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:21.630
I can wrap the tentacles around her and I'll look more like he's holding her.

186
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.380
You know? So anyways, they started filming without rehearsing.

187
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.380
Octa man opens the door and knocks a guy down,

188
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.400
guy picks up a log throws at the Octa. Man hits him, rips the suit.

189
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.700
He goes walking over and he's virtually blind.

190
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.980
He's looking out of two little holes out this far away. You know,

191
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.040
it was a real claustrophobic suit. The poor guy, Reed, Morgan,

192
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:43.230
who play the document was great to deal with,

193
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.070
but it was very hard suit to where he goes to pick up here. Angelie,

194
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.930
nobody says cut. So he picks her up.

195
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.740
So walking around the guy who knocked on the ground is laying on the ground

196
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:57.690
spread Eagle. He ends up stepping right on his nuts, oh, falls over backwards,

197
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:01.470
throws pure up against the Winnebago, oh,

198
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.410
she's crying and says he wants her mother, the other guy's holding her nuts.

199
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.820
The guy broke his hand cause a log fell on his hand and everybody's screaming.

200
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:13.590
I'm going to hit my soup. And we lost a day out of our 10 day shooting schedule.

201
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.250
So Harry Essex, who was the director and writer, uh,

202
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.480
was tearing pages out of the script. Like, we don't need this,

203
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:22.560
we don't need this. We don't need this.

204
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.950
And then when they tried to make a movie out of it, it made no sense. I mean,

205
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.830
I think the first 20 minutes are stocked footage. If you know,

206
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:30.750
in the beginning there was nothing. And then, you know,

207
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.540
then there was slime and then, you know, the whole, I can't wait to watch.

208
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.100
There's a, I think it's in public domain now. I think it's on YouTube,

209
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.530
but there's a, Blu-ray out of it as well.

210
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.270
<v 0>I might have to fire up a joint wash that one. Now, when you went,</v>

211
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.300
when you look back on that, you mean it's gotta be kind of,

212
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.050
even though it sounds like a, it seems like it's kind of a fond memory as well,

213
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.420
because that where it started, it was,

214
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.440
you got to see how much nonsense there is in the movie industry,

215
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:02.170
but you also got a chance to get going. Yeah.

216
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.450
<v 1>And, and I got, you know, we,</v>

217
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.850
we came up with a way to do this because we couldn't,

218
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.180
it's a foam rubber suit in former brands to be baked in an oven.

219
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.910
We didn't have a big oven. We didn't have the means. So we,

220
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.350
we came up with a clever solution and that's what I had to do so many times in

221
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:20.920
films do things that people hadn't done before on a budget and schedule,

222
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:23.710
you know, and, and try to figure out. And that's part of the fun,

223
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.990
but what was cool about the Optima and the male lead was Kerwin Matthews who was

224
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:30.610
Sinbad in the four, just in bed.

225
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.650
And I get a Ray Harryhausen film and I was big fan of, you know, so, uh,

226
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.540
one of the first things I had to do,

227
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:40.660
there's a scene where the document's technical supposed to creep through this

228
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:45.010
cave opening. And they basically wadded up some tarpaper.

229
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:48.700
And I stood behind the tar paper and Bronson caves and stuck my hand in this

230
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.960
technical and did this. And when Kerwin walked by, I said,

231
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.080
super dynamo nation, which is what Ray, Harry has his technique.

232
00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.220
He called for a few films. And he said, oh, you know about that. You know?

233
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:01.570
So I thought that was really cool.
