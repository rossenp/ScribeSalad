00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 3>I didn't even want SNL. I didn't want us to know, uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:10.230
you and I both know that was a, nobody came at it going,

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.110
that's the greatest gig. It's very rarely people.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.760
<v 1>They come out of it. Like they weren't fight it. Absolutely.</v>

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.370
Like they just got out of a bar fight.

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.463
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.760
<v 1>That's how Phil Hartman was.</v>

9
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.280
When I first started working with Phil Hartman in 94,

10
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.650
he had just left SNL and he,

11
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.480
it took a while for him to be comfortable around us. Like the news radio people,

12
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.900
the actors were super friendly. Everybody liked to get hammered.

13
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.890
That was like the big thing we would get blasted drunk. Yeah.

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.290
But we were all like, really,

15
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.010
like in terms of like actors genuinely supportive,

16
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.230
like Dave Foley was the most supportive guy ever.

17
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.480
Like he was always writing jokes for you.

18
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.510
He was always like rewriting scenes for you. Like Jim munch,

19
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.930
come in and say this instead. Or, and he would write like really great lines.

20
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.090
But Phil was like, he look, he was in a competition at first.

21
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.400
He thought like everybody was going to be competitive. Then he,

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.360
once he relaxed Phillips smoke weed. And once he relaxed relax, he's like,

23
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.390
you know, going over there, it was like, everybody was like doggy dog.

24
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.670
And everybody's at each other's throats. It's.

25
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
<v 0>Doggy dog it's and there's no rhyme or reason there's no rhyme or reason.</v>

26
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.430
It's just like politics. In other words, I can't help with Congress.

27
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.740
What bill they're going to pass. Even they know,

28
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.240
even they know this is going to work.

29
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.770
<v 1>Nope. Same kind of stuff.</v>

30
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.590
It's the same exact thing you're fighting to get your bits on. Right.

31
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.840
You're fighting to get your pieces on. You're fighting to get your,

32
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.520
your little sketches on E.

33
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680
<v 0>Yeah. And the worst, the worst part is, you know,</v>

34
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:42.390
something's going to work and you have someone come to you towards the end.

35
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:46.920
It made me such a dark human being. Cause I I'm the Hey man,

36
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.630
let's all, let's all be team. And I used to,

37
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.010
when I, when I worked with hats, I said, let's look at this roster.

38
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.190
Holy crap. Let's see who goes in the Boston comedy club.

39
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.410
Let's just buy a script and put everyone in it and let them

40
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:08.250
play to their strength. Wow. You know this one. And I'm like,

41
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.990
I wish I had the business smarts to go back and do that

42
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.140
because you're, it would have been,

43
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.460
it would have been so much fun. I mean, maybe it would have been disaster.

44
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:23.120
Maybe this guy, maybe I want to end up getting leather pants.

45
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.770
I got my white lion leather pants,

46
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.160
but it makes you so,

47
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.060
you know, I, I don't want to rehash.

48
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.170
<v 1>The memory. Never got bitter, but you understood that bitterness is an option.</v>

49
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.970
<v 0>Correct? And I started smoking intense amount of pot. Yeah. Just a number of.</v>

50
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.390
<v 1>I remember when he told me he quit and he's like, dude, I'm hearing voices.</v>

51
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:49.740
I think the government's following. You went so far. I went.

52
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.790
<v 0>Too far.</v>

53
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.010
<v 1>I let Jim quit. And then I talked to you all. He might've went into never,</v>

54
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.620
never land. He went, he went, he went into the land of no return. Well,

55
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.530
when you start thinking that the government is watching, you know.

56
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.700
<v 0>The stop nonstop they're on me. Cause they know, I think by myself,</v>

57
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.890
it's like the scene in Goodfellas. Like God it.

58
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.960
<v 1>Hell it got love that scene.</v>

59
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.240
<v 0>But um, I will say this. Um, yeah,</v>

60
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.133
I have.

61
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.850
<v 1>Have you returned to the fold?</v>

62
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.840
<v 0>I haven't returned the way I have in the past, but a little bit.</v>

63
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.770
But I have, I have, uh, you will never see me.

64
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.290
It's very private.

65
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.070
<v 1>You have your private weed smoker. Yeah. How's that?</v>

66
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.541
<v 0>Uh, in other words,</v>

67
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:40.420
I don't do it with people anymore because it keeps the paranoia way.

68
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.270
Cause I don't trust anyone. I don't trust anyone.

69
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.370
I still don't and I haven't smoked, smoked. I like,

70
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.263
I went down,

71
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.370
I went out to Colorado in the five little milligrams, the $10.

72
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.910
<v 1>And nice those little edibles fives. Nice.</v>

73
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.630
<v 0>Yeah. And then have like a martini.</v>

74
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.960
<v 1>Martini, extra dirty.</v>

75
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.490
<v 0>Not too dirty. I like a dirty, I like it. I like it. Not crazy dirty,</v>

76
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.020
but a little dirty little dirt.

77
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.450
<v 1>I liked that olive juice. It's.</v>

78
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.230
<v 0>Delicious. I do too. So here's what happened, my wife.</v>

79
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.220
This is why, this is why my wife's a powerhouse. She,

80
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.010
when you find someone that don't give a about the industry and they only care

81
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:31.330
about you, it's very hard. As,

82
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:36.130
as an artist that's chasing a star does you're always chasing the star and

83
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:40.150
you're always chasing the mansion. She would go on their forgets. She's like,

84
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.700
why don't you just quit? Like I seriously, are you stupid? You don't quit.

85
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.650
Santa live the hell is she? And she's like, look at you. You come home,

86
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.180
you miserable. They control everything. They steal your ideas.

87
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.400
This one stole. I saw my own two eyes. How they treated you in this particular.

88
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.560
<v 1>Here we go. I'll give you a show. You don't want to get high first. No.</v>

89
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.870
<v 0>Let's go take a pee break. Let's taken for you right now.</v>

90
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.860
Here's and again, I've released all this, you know,

91
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.920
I got a strong moral backbone. I'm good.

92
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.510
So no, I don't have any bad feelings. So what happened was,

93
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:27.290
and I'm not going to put out, I don't want to hash names and all that,

94
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:29.090
but what would happen is something like this,

95
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.860
you're writing a sketch and then one of the head writers

96
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.210
would come in in the doorway and go, Hey,

97
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.880
I see you're writing a sketch about blah, blah, blah.

98
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.910
Cause we have the main server and we check everyone's sketches.

99
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.040
I've just wanted to let you know, I'm writing the same thing. He goes,

100
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.500
you can continue yours, but you know,

101
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.390
I'm in the room with Lauren. I'm just, oh yeah.

102
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.823
So.

103
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.750
<v 1>This is that. So they would go onto the server.</v>

104
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:02.450
They would see the sketches that you're riding. And then.

105
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.030
<v 0>And then there was, then there was times where</v>

106
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.110
a cast member would come in and look at,

107
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.760
look at my board and go, oh,

108
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.020
what does that mean? I go, oh, that's, that's a, that's a sketch.

109
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.150
And I know so-and-so's come in.

110
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.760
And I know the ratings are going to be high that week.

111
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:25.970
So I'm waiting to bring my ACE stuff for that.

112
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.850
Everyone's going to come out their fangs out when this one's on.

113
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.070
So I'm going to save that sketch for when they're on.

114
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.140
And then this person would ask me, oh my God, what exactly? I said, well,

115
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:42.170
I'm going to take it out of its element. You know,

116
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.260
like back then it was like patchy. And I'm like,

117
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.820
pesky is going to read to children about Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer and

118
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:53.030
tell, explain why his nose is red. And the big joke is,

119
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.750
cause he's a rat and I compare it to a whole neighborhood. Yeah, he's a rat.

120
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.100
That's why his nose is red.

121
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.340
And when you got up and so he ended up beating certain kids and blah blah,

122
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.040
the next week,

123
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.000
the whole room is set and,

124
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.990
and you sit in there and then this person, you know, Lauren goes,

125
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.480
[inaudible] was Scarface reading to school,

126
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:22.440
children Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer. And you go, you, you,

127
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.900
you and you look, you see there, their eyes are down, you know,

128
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:30.320
what's going on? You know what have you can say.

129
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.153
<v 1>Anything.</v>

130
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.120
<v 0>Well, when you say something,</v>

131
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:39.770
which I eventually did tude, I think I may be. And I,

132
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.820
I want to challenge all SNL cast and writers.

133
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.470
I may be the last one that threatened violence I was in.

134
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.360
I was in a room with one of the guys and I literally said,

135
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.553
I will not.

136
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.610
<v 2>You're T down your throat. You mother.</v>

137
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.830
If you don't be here, get the out. You don't on my.

138
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.143
Cause you don't want to.

139
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.870
<v 0>Well. And I was, and I told him, I said, I'm knocking the fond,</v>

140
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:14.200
knock his teeth down. And still I'm not, I'm not from the right and world.

141
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.070
So that's where that plays brought me. Wow.

142
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:23.020
And so in that particular instance was, see, now I'm getting all over.

143
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.440
<v 1>That's gotta be coming from the top down because the, when,</v>

144
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:30.790
when I got alone with Phillip, Phil and I became close and you know,

145
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.270
we would hang out together, especially in his, his dress room,

146
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.900
he had a nice dress room, had it all set up, had a guitar,

147
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.570
was looking at his aviation books and. And, and he would, uh,

148
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:42.910
we would talk about his time there. And he's like,

149
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.930
it just made me that's bitter and angry. Yeah.

150
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.980
But it seems like it's always been that way. That it's been from the top down.

151
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:51.880
And.

152
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.910
<v 0>And this particular is 95 to 98.</v>

153
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.610
So you were on right after field left. Yeah, because I was with Phil in 94.

154
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.700
And so when that person did that,

155
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.280
I then went up to them and I waited and I was like, you.

156
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.380
He goes, I didn't know. I didn't take it. Now.

157
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:18.120
This one also is getting more airtime because they're in with this specific head

158
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:23.010
writer. Oh. And then the head writer comes to me. Hey man,

159
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:27.060
leave him alone. I go, Hey man, stop him from stealing.

160
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.590
Well, you know, I don't care what he does.

161
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:36.360
Just leave him alone during my sketches, like why you do so you're, you're,

162
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.910
it's like you're in high school. And so yeah. It's,

163
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.430
it's it makes you,

164
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.020
and then I remember doing something where I played

165
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.940
a drunk guy and I didn't know exactly how to do, but I,

166
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.720
I always wanted to be another foster Brooks. So long story short,

167
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.470
I wanted to do another foster Brooks type thing. So I did the character.

168
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:01.410
I'm not a great writer. I'm not a good writer at all. Um,

169
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.500
but like I'll come up to character and try to eat.

170
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.020
And if we could put it in somewhere great.

171
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.040
And I remember the writer coming up saying, yeah, Lauren,

172
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:15.990
doesn't like drunks because you know the past and John

173
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:19.470
and blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, oh, okay. And then two weeks later,

174
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.230
John Belushi, I mean, yeah, I guess that's what he meant.

175
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.640
And then two weeks later, it's the drunk character.

176
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.220
Like what dude, what the F

177
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.140
it just it's little things that mind screw you like that.

178
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.620
So by the time the big,

179
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.820
the big finale was towards the end. You know, someone told me,

180
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.660
you know what Sandler did. Sandlin went through this.

181
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:48.060
Everyone went through this comedians, go through this.

182
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.460
What you gotta do is get on the update and you gotta get in the, uh,

183
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.120
do everything can to go in the update and everything can opening monologue

184
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.150
because the head writers can't mess with you. He goes, that's,

185
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.820
that's not really that department crazy.

186
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.620
That that's something that you have to think about.

187
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.560
So then that's why I started doing, if you notice in 98,

188
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.910
I started getting more monologues. And then even there, they were like,

189
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:16.290
we got this. And then it was a final monologue.

190
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:17.670
It was Matthew Broderick.

191
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.760
And it was when Matthew Broderick was on and he couldn't get

192
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:26.340
through some of the sketches I was doing with him. He started laughing.

193
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.190
And so when we went to, he really wanted to do this monologue with me.

194
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.180
And this one, these, these particular head writers were like, no,

195
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:39.840
we're not doing it. Although Matthew was like, I want to do gyms.

196
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.940
I want to do Jimmy Tracy's. And there was two,

197
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.570
three sketches we had together. And he laughed during the dress.

198
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.810
Like he couldn't keep a straight face. And then I remember the head,

199
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.420
this particular rider, a problem with, I never pried stint,

200
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.610
like whatever you had a hard-on for me, whatever. I can't, I don't,

201
00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:03.370
I don't understand ego. You gotta, ego is what it is. And he said, um, yeah,

202
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:05.920
it's too bad. He laughed because now we don't know for work.

203
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:08.830
So that's going to be cut. And this cut and you listen,

204
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:12.190
we filmed the monologue. It worked,

205
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:14.590
but we're going to go at my monologue during the air show.

206
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.530
I was like, you know, man, I'm going to talk to Lauren. He goes, no, you're not.

207
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.360
I said, no, I'm, I'm talking to Lauren now.

208
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.150
I'm not afraid to talk to Lauren anymore. Cause that's another thing.

209
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.290
It's I get all that. I talk to president dojo, president. They put this.

210
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.230
<v 1>So that he would say, no, you're not going to talk to Lauren.</v>

211
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.290
<v 0>We'll talk to him. But no, we'll both. Go talk to him.</v>

212
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.790
And then that's I knew right from that minute I was done.

213
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.770
I knew it was done. And then that summer, this guy named Gary Considine,

214
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.840
he ran the tonight show and he said, Chamath what happened.

215
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.710
I said, what's the matter he goes so-and-so and so-and-so are,

216
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.200
are really same year out. No, really?

217
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.140
I go, well, I'll tell you what, I don't want to be there anymore.

218
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.030
My wife's like, just please quit. She has, you said in your life,

219
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:08.860
if any job,

220
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.660
no matter how much money it paid makes you a miserable human being and changes

221
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:17.680
the person. You are, you weren't going to work there. Look at you.

222
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.690
You angry all the time. You smoke pot all the time to numb yourself.

223
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.240
You're not Jim anymore. Where's the goofy, uplifting gym.

224
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.070
And I wanted it to like show stupid, but.

225
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:40.960
<v 1>But she was so smart. She.</v>

226
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.690
<v 0>Was so smart. And it was the greatest.</v>

227
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:48.460
And I give Lauren a lot of credit because Lauren said to

228
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:51.190
me, um, Jim,

229
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.960
you're too nice for this business. And he said,

230
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.020
which I'll never forget was a couple of things Lauren said,

231
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:03.670
and I never blamed Lauren. I always really admired Lauren. I said,

232
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.860
uh, oh, he goes, and if you ever want more than to do something,

233
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:10.840
I'm your producer, our producer for you,

234
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.980
which I never took that opportunity up,

235
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.350
but I'll never forget when he said that to me.

236
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:21.580
So I was very thankful that he was understanding. And let me go.
