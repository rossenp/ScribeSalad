00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 1>Experience. Look at where they were in 2014.</v>

3
00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:06.680
Look where they are now with faking the Chris Cuomo thing. They've they've,

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.440
that's it's.

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.200
<v 0>Natural. You think, you think that's his idea? The, the Chris Cuomo thing is,</v>

6
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:10.320
oh.

7
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.840
<v 1>No, pretty gross. Did you, did you hear what he said on his radio show? No.</v>

8
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.120
What he said, he said, I don't find value in what I do. I think it's ridiculous.

9
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.000
<v 0>He said, I don't like what I do for a living. I don't.</v>

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.390
<v 1>Like my occupation, I think, you know,</v>

11
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.630
and then he said something to the effect of,

12
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.350
I'll never beat them in reference to like hand and, uh,

13
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:29.550
Maddow or something like that. I think he beat them in ratings. Yeah.

14
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:31.790
In ratings. Oh, he's their biggest show. He is.

15
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.310
I'm pretty sure Cuomo's their biggest show. Yeah.

16
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.390
<v 0>He's the only one that seems to be a man.</v>

17
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.310
<v 1>And he doesn't crack a million in the ratings. Really? Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:42.260
It's like eight and I think it's like hundred to 900. I think he,

19
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:44.780
he periodically might, the ratings might be going up. I could be wrong. So, uh,

20
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:47.620
check the latest stats. But I here's what I think he had. But I think the,

21
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:51.820
the CEO producers went to him and said, look, man, you, you, you got this thing.

22
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.180
Like we should, we should, we should run with it. Let's like go to your house.

23
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:57.260
We'll film it. We'll make it this big deal. You think so?

24
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.060
And I think it wasn't that bad. I think he had mild symptoms. Look,

25
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:03.130
the dude went out, the guy left his home. He.

26
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.490
<v 0>Was, when he was talking about the, the issues he was having,</v>

27
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.010
he was, he seemed normal. Right?

28
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.530
Like here's what I would expect from someone who was as sick as he seemed to be.

29
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.650
I don't feel that good, but Hey, I'm one of the lucky ones.

30
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.650
<v 1>No, he seemed.</v>

31
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.290
<v 0>Totally normal. Yeah. That's what I would expect.</v>

32
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.600
He's saying he's sh shivering so hard. He's chipping his teeth seems ridiculous.

33
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.440
<v 1>Yeah. It doesn't.</v>

34
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.600
<v 0>Seem, I'm not gonna, I don't know.</v>

35
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.320
I mean maybe when it is nighttime and you're tired,

36
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.200
cuz one of the things I remember, um,

37
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.920
last time I was sick was quite a while ago. At the end of the night,

38
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.800
I'd be like really achy cuz I was tired and I was, as I was tired,

39
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.070
my immune system would be depleted and then I would feel the effects of the cold

40
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.550
more. And then you wake up in the morning. You feel a lot better. Maybe he pops.

41
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.150
<v 1>On ibuprofen. I know he was taking Tylenol. So you're not.</v>

42
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.030
<v 0>Supposed to take ibuprofen for this for some reason.</v>

43
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.150
<v 1>Well he said, I think.</v>

44
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.671
<v 0>He was taking Tylenol.</v>

45
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:55.550
Well my friend Michael yo said that he was told to take ibuprofen.

46
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:58.110
And when he did it, made it way worse. Oh wow. Yeah.

47
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.470
<v 1>Well, so, so here's here's what can I say? I'm not gonna accuse the guy.</v>

48
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.700
A lot of people are he never even got sick? I don't think that's the case. He.

49
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.660
<v 0>Probably got sick. He tested positive, but I think he,</v>

50
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:11.620
it seemed fairly mild in comparison to other people like Michael yo,

51
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.100
when I talked to him, well, first of all, when he was doing a video,

52
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.860
talking about recovering from, it was coughing. Even in the video,

53
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.340
he was coughing when he was talking about, on Instagram thinking everybody.

54
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.290
But he had a bad case of it where he got pneumonia and it was rough.

55
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.170
And you know, Michael's a healthy guy. So that was disturbing to me.

56
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:35.330
But the Chris Cuomo version of coronavirus didn't seem that scary. The dude.

57
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.210
<v 1>Wasn't quarantined. Okay. He, he went out to some property,</v>

58
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:40.130
30 minutes from his home, presumably with his family,

59
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.090
he was witnessed by somebody else. You're.

60
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.923
<v 0>Not supposed to do that. Right?</v>

61
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.520
<v 1>You no, you're not. I mean, it's not just that,</v>

62
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:47.840
but on CNN they said he was locked down. Right.

63
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:50.120
They did this whole reveal where he comes outta the basement. Exactly.

64
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:51.720
Instead of been waiting for this was a lot also.

65
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.600
<v 0>Do a TikTok dance with his daughter or something. Oh, I don't know about that.</v>

66
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.553
I think he did.

67
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.680
<v 1>But I think the reason he went on his show complaining was because the was.</v>

68
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.480
<v 0>Coming. The producers told him to, to do this fake thing. Oh.</v>

69
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.560
And he didn't wanna do it about the tracking. The COVID tracking the, the.

70
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.760
<v 2>Which is just, it sounds scary to me. Yeah. Get the outta that's some NSA.</v>

71
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.640
That's really scary. They're.

72
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.190
<v 0>Gonna keep going.</v>

73
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.800
This is what things do they like if it's your job to try to do something like

74
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.710
this, to try implement something where you can get people to agree to tracking.

75
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.990
If it's your job to do that, you're gonna keep going. Yes you are. Once if,

76
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:28.950
once you get that tracking, then you're gonna want some new.

77
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.150
Then you want cameras in front of people's houses to see if they really are

78
00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:34.350
quarantining. You know, they're doing that in China. Yes.

79
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.390
This guy just got back from a trip in China.

80
00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:39.820
They give him a 14 day quarantine and they put a can hammer right in front of

81
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.220
his door. That's weird. He's like, whoa,

82
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.740
like you're not going anywhere for 14 days. And we're watching you. It's also.

83
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.540
<v 2>Strange for people in politics to encourage society, to snitch on people.</v>

84
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.700
That's weird. That's a level of, of tracking's.

85
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.580
<v 0>That's our main.</v>

86
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.540
<v 2>I know. But don't you think that's weird and wrong.</v>

87
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.890
<v 0>It's weird in and wrong,</v>

88
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.370
but it's even worse if you're offering rewards' that's if you're saying,

89
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.250
if you're saying you usually SNIS get stitches,

90
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.970
but this all the good reward you guys.

91
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.290
<v 2>Are gonna get riches. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

92
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.763
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

93
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.770
<v 2>You know what it is, Joe? Honestly, it's, it's a behavior change.</v>

94
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.360
It's a weird step towards this tracking system.

95
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.560
That's going to be implemented that. Right. They're starting to be like, oh,

96
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.440
it's okay. We're going to reinforce you guys being stitches. It's it's snitches.

97
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:32.240
It's fine. Here's a little treat for you.

98
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:36.080
Here's 500 bucks for letting me know that Karen was out not doing the proper

99
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.000
protocol.

100
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.160
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; meanwhile, there's there have been that many deaths,</v>

101
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.030
like relative of Lee to what they thought they were going to be.

102
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.550
And so that means it's a success.

103
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.950
So that means the way it's being implemented so far has been a success.

104
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.230
Like you're getting it more aggressive with it. Even though the line is,

105
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.870
are way lower than we thought they were going to be. What are we doing, George?

106
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.550
We're doing the right thing. Understand that. It's hard for people. If just,

107
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.940
you know, keep an eye on each other. Don't let people do stupid.

108
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.300
You shouldn't have parties,

109
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.140
but you also shouldn't give people rewards to snitch. No, that's not.

110
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.140
Don't have a house. I saw a house party the other day where people had masks on.

111
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.100
So someone put it up on their Instagram. I'm like, this is,

112
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.260
it might have been little Duval. Little Duval has the best.

113
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.940
He's the best Instagram follow out there. It's so good. It's so good.

114
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.450
And he posts all day. He's just getting high posted. &lt;laugh&gt; we'll do all.

115
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.610
He posted the funniest, but he.

116
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.450
<v 2>Really does. That house party was packed.</v>

117
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.330
<v 0>Yeah. It was a, it was a packed house party.</v>

118
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.370
I think it said something like if these people ain't dead in 14 days,

119
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.370
I'm gonna go out. &lt;laugh&gt;.

120
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.370
<v 3>When I first looked at this and I heard about Wuhan and I heard that there was</v>

121
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.480
a, I don't say not a weapons lab maybe, but maybe it's a weapons lab. Um,

122
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.080
but at least a lab doing research in infectious diseases,

123
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.560
a couple miles from these wet markets where they're saying that this thing broke

124
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.480
out. Um,

125
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.520
there are cases in the former Soviet union of them doing these,

126
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.920
this research into infectious diseases and weaponizing it and then having it get

127
00:06:02.921 --> 00:06:05.880
out because the protocols weren't followed or whatever else and kills a few

128
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:10.000
people and they hush hush it cuz it's uh, 1960 something or 1970 something. Uh,

129
00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:12.760
so there is precedent and it wouldn't be beyond the,

130
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:14.400
beyond the pale to think that, oh,

131
00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:17.150
someone was doing some sort of research and it doesn't even have to be

132
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.910
weaponization. It can just be, they're just studying this infectious disease,

133
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.030
not even weaponizing it and someone contracts it somehow in that lab

134
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.310
and then brings it outside.

135
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.790
<v 0>Yeah. That's the controversial theory. So here's the thing.</v>

136
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.030
The controversial experiments in Wuhan lab suspected of starting the coronavirus

137
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.260
pandemic and says the case against a Wuhan lab. And so, uh,

138
00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:42.700
it says why the Wuhan lab remains a suspect in the coronavirus investigation.

139
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.020
I mean, it's really likely that we never really will know. Right.

140
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.140
But they most certainly were working on viruses similar to this one right there.

141
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.620
The.

142
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.540
<v 4>End of this article says there's another one called uh,</v>

143
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.730
rat R ATG, which is very, very similar to the SARS.

144
00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.650
COVID two one that we're experiencing now. Oh terrific.

145
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.690
They share 96% of the same genetic material.

146
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.730
<v 0>Yeah. Wow. It's not to be the most similar to the SARS. COVID two, uh,</v>

147
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:15.770
of any known virus, the two share 96% of their genetic material, that 4% gap,

148
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.200
but still be a formidable gap for animal passage. Research says Ralph Barrack,

149
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.880
virologist, university of North Carolina,

150
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.640
probably in bed with the Russians mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who collaborated &lt;laugh&gt;

151
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.840
like when you found out that a Harvard guy got arrested that uh,

152
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.880
cuz he was uh, taking money from Russia or excuse me,

153
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:36.600
taking money from China cuz he was uh, doing something with them. Yeah.

154
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.950
I mean it's real spooky. What's really spooky.

155
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.870
The world health organization is essentially in bed with, with China. Yeah.

156
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.030
And they're not giving us a hundred percent clear detailed information.

157
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:50.710
Everything gets filtered down through the Chinese propaganda system. Oh sure,

158
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.150
sure. Very.

159
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.070
<v 3>Dangerous. And they also were exceedingly, we, we don't own the numbers. Right.</v>

160
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:55.950
And we can't trust China,

161
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.380
but it seems like they were a little more prepared for, for this than we were,

162
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.540
uh, with as far as testing kids goes and all that.

163
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.260
So if you're doing re if there's a lab where you're doing research similar to

164
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:10.580
this close by there there's a history, uh, of other countries,

165
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:13.780
maybe even China too, of doing research into infectious diseases,

166
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:15.820
not following protocols that we would here in the United States.

167
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:16.400
They're not all as,

168
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.500
as safe as they are shocker here in the United States where we're doing this

169
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.090
same type of research, then it gets out and then they just happen to have, uh,

170
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.490
a lot of these kits ready to go for testing. Um, I don't.

171
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.130
<v 5>Know, but again, what else are you gonna do? So,</v>

172
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.050
so tiger king killed some time and then the aftermath of tiger king killed some

173
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:39.050
more time, but then we still got like six more weeks. So what do we do now?

174
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.120
<v 0>I think we're supposed to be May 15th, right?</v>

175
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.760
May fifteenth's gonna end that's the.

176
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.720
<v 5>Yeah, I think that's the latest projected date, but.</v>

177
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.160
<v 0>The governor just stopped people from going to the parks and beaches. Well,</v>

178
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.480
that was a new, uh, thing today. Yeah.

179
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.640
<v 5>I think, you know, you know what it is, this is my theory.</v>

180
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.400
Like we can't have nice things, you know, whenever they give us something nice,

181
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.800
we don't, you know, like a little kid up nice and they break it. So it's like,

182
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.360
okay, we're gonna let you go to the beach. It's like, no,

183
00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:07.920
you're not supposed to be playing volleyball and laying like,

184
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.280
like just you're supposed to keep moving. Right.

185
00:09:10.281 --> 00:09:13.840
You're supposed to like walk or ride a bike or right. Go surf or this.

186
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.830
But you weren't, it's supposed to just mingle gathering groups.

187
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.670
And of course we're gathering groups with party and they're like, all right, no,

188
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.510
you can't, you don't have to had had.

189
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.071
<v 0>Specific rules.</v>

190
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:26.510
Like you weren't allowed to stay put like you couldn't lean on things.

191
00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:27.350
Couldn't sit down.

192
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.030
<v 5>Right. Cause you go walk around. I was riding, I rode,</v>

193
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.110
I rode my motorcycle along PCH.

194
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.500
And you would people they'd park their car along PCH. Right.

195
00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:42.460
And they'd sit on the car and kinda like look at the beach and stuff like,

196
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.780
and so I guess you,

197
00:09:43.781 --> 00:09:48.540
each one of them had a car's distance between them cuz you

198
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:49.580
you're sitting on your car,

199
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.620
the next person sitting on their car mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

200
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.540
But then I passed this, um, Neptune's net,

201
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:57.090
which is like a big motorcycle hang out.

202
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.810
And there were maybe 20 bikes in a row parked and the guys

203
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.650
were all just kind of hanging out and it was like, no man, like that,

204
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.330
you can't do that. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like a,

205
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.050
motorcycle's the ultimate social distancing vehicle. Right?

206
00:10:12.051 --> 00:10:15.210
You're you're by yourself, you wearing a jacket, gloves, a helmet.

207
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.280
You're not reading on anybody. Yeah. But when you stop,

208
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.720
you can't just all hang out like normal, you know? And that,

209
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.440
that was the part that, uh, that I think that that's where they're like, no,

210
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:31.560
we're not gonna do it. Cuz I think, you know, this Georgia and Florida,

211
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.960
whatever. It's like, they're like the experiment man. They're like, all right.

212
00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:38.790
Yeah. Let's let them get out and then let's wait two weeks and see what happens.

213
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.390
Yeah.

214
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.390
<v 0>Exactly. You know, that's exactly what it's like.</v>
