00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.600
<v 0>So for you now,</v>

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.840
you got the title and there is talk about you fighting for the

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.520
Bantom white title against champion TJ DHA. What are your thoughts? Like where,

4
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.320
where are you at right now? Like what do you, what.

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.760
<v 1>Are your goals? It's, it's a beautiful time to be, uh, to be the champ. &lt;laugh&gt;,</v>

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.830
&lt;laugh&gt;, there's, uh, there's, there's tons of tons of options show.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.630
<v 0>You know, where's your contract at right now?</v>

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.710
<v 1>Well, uh, I have, I still have about seven fights left, you know, but I'm gonna,</v>

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.590
we're gonna renegotiate cause I, I think more likely thatt fight might,

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.910
might happen. Gotta happen. That TJG fight might happen if, you know, if,

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.590
if it's gonna be a done win with, uh,

12
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.830
with the flyway division mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, I think,

13
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.740
I think the cats out the I can, you know, Dana had,

14
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.140
had mentioned that to me and said, Hey, you know, we, we,

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.100
we wanna take you up on that offer. You are challenging to go up against TJ,

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.580
but this is what, this is where the company's been thinking about for a while.

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.380
<v 0>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and TJ's down for it too.</v>

18
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.380
<v 1>I, I don't think so. I think TJ wants to come down to 25 and, uh, I think,</v>

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.090
I think that's kind of like, like the delay level point.

20
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.810
<v 0>Yeah. Now, would you rather fight him at 35?</v>

21
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.290
So you can get an additional title or would you rather fight him at 35 because

22
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.930
you don't have to cut weight or what's.

23
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.010
<v 1>Your thought about? I don't, I like both ideas.</v>

24
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.170
I actually kind of left it off to him. I says, I don't know,

25
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:17.850
but I wanna fight you, man. I said, I wanna fight TJ. I want,

26
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.530
I want to go out to the next best thing and that's, I think that's him,

27
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.310
you know, I think.

28
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.240
<v 0>So. You don't mind fighting him at 25 or 35?</v>

29
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.200
<v 1>I don't. That makes.</v>

30
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.040
<v 0>It easier. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.400
<v 1>That's that definitely makes it easier. Yeah. I'm just like, Hey, let's,</v>

32
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:30.800
let's do that 25. Let's do that 35, but let's uh, let's fight, man.

33
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.920
<v 0>That's what your, your mind is right now. That's your number one goal.</v>

34
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.800
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And, and I, I believe TJ wants to fight me too. I think, uh,</v>

35
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.640
I think, you know, beating Dimitri, I think that kind of,

36
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.350
that's gonna help his name, you know, you know, let's for, I guess for both,

37
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.390
you can say, you know? Yeah.

38
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.290
<v 0>So, uh,</v>

39
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.630
but now that Demetrius has left a division and gone off to one FC to get.

40
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.983
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

41
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.910
<v 0>BCO. Where, um, where do you think the division is right now? I mean,</v>

42
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.300
um, is that one reason, like if you won at 35 and won the title of five,

43
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:07.060
would you consider dropping the 25 pound title and competing at 35?

44
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:08.620
Or would you rather stay at 25?

45
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.820
<v 1>Uh, I would, I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind dabbling in both. I mean,</v>

46
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:15.660
I know that's, uh, that's kind of, that's kind of broad, but you know,

47
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.340
at one point you do get tired of cutting weight mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I'm

48
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.740
kind of, uh, eating. What do you weigh right now? I'm I'm probably about,

49
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.610
probably about 50, 50. Yeah.

50
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.930
<v 0>One and, uh, I mean, losing 15 pounds is way better than losing 25 pounds.</v>

51
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.800
&lt;laugh&gt;.

52
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.730
<v 1>Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a little, I'm, I'm a little bigger now. Uh, because of,</v>

53
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:37.450
because of that reason, I might, I might have to fight at, uh,

54
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.210
at Bantom some kind of, uh, I think more like it might happen at ban way.

55
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.120
<v 2>What's what don't know is that actually Henry almost fought TJ when he</v>

56
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.880
was the champ. When Henry Barrow didn't make weight, his first fight in the UFC,

57
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.000
he didn't make weight, but two hours later, Henry Barrow didn't make,

58
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.840
make weight. And they were looking for somebody to go up and fight.

59
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.680
TJ me when Joe Soto fought him, when Joe Soto fought him,

60
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.960
Henry was the number one option,

61
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.080
but Henry had already declined. Uh, he said he wasn't fighting JSON. And,

62
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.600
but now here we are three years later back now he's got the tent,

63
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.870
he's got the belt. TJ came back and won the belt. Let's do it.

64
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.710
These guys been beefing for, uh, for a long time.

65
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.070
So that's ever since the first day he ever came into the UFC,

66
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:30.030
him and TJ have been at it. And then on the ultimate fighter, ultimate fighter,

67
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:33.390
24, they had, uh, Dwayne bang was the coach.

68
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.470
There was like a little beef with Henry and, uh, Ben Vita, his team, Ben Avita,

69
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.860
his coach coach. So it kind of goes way back mm-hmm.

70
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.900
<v 1>So there's, there's a bit of animosity too, on top of everything.</v>

71
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.740
<v 0>Now you're a very goal-oriented guy. Do you,</v>

72
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.940
do you have your career mapped out in terms of like when you would like to get

73
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.933
outta the game?

74
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.100
<v 1>I do. I do. And I think about it a lot, cuz man, I I'll be honest with you, Joe.</v>

75
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.850
I've, uh, I've accomplished sure. Everything I've ever wanted to, uh, you know,

76
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.730
in, in my career, like I've always, I had, I had three goals and I was just,

77
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.690
you know, my number one goal was just to be a good person.

78
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.570
My good father seemed a good husband. And then after that,

79
00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:14.810
was it be an Olympic champ and then, and then, and then eventually UFC champ.

80
00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:17.650
So everything's kind of, uh, I I've,

81
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:22.400
I've done everything in that I've ever kind of set my mind to, you know,

82
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.520
those are the two biggest, the two man thing anybody could ever do. And uh,

83
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.880
I don't see myself fighting for more than, for more than maybe three to four.

84
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.713
<v 0>Years.</v>

85
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.800
The only other sequence you really are in this rare space where you

86
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.830
have the possibility of being considered one of the greatest combats board

87
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:43.310
athletes of all time. I mean, you're already in the mix, right?

88
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:47.550
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Olympic gold medalist, UFC champion. I mean, you,

89
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.630
you have this very rare opportunity for incredible greatness.

90
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.693
Yeah.

91
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.590
<v 1>I think for the most part, I mean, I like to eventually, I mean, I,</v>

92
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.380
I do a lot of motivational speaking. Uh, I've been doing that for a, a, a while.

93
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.900
Joe spoke in front of like the biggest, the biggest companies in the world.

94
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.860
I mean the Coca Cola, like the T Meritrade, uh,

95
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.140
Proctor and gallery billion dollar company, I just got sound by Kroger. Um, and,

96
00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:13.860
and they kind of, you know, they use me for,

97
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.220
for that reason and I really enjoy doing that, you know,

98
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.620
and plus you get paid &lt;laugh&gt;.

99
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.490
<v 0>And you don't have to get leg kicked.</v>

100
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.331
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.770
You don't have to get leg kicked and hit that nerve and do the drunken monkey.

102
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.450
Yeah. You don't gotta do all that. And, and it's just cool.

103
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:33.730
It's just cool to kind of share the, the, you know, the whole underdo story.

104
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.250
<v 0>I love that people do do that. The companies have the, the,</v>

105
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.210
the mindset of bringing in champions mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and people that are

106
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:44.840
extraordinary, what ever they do. And speaking to these, you know,

107
00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:46.960
these people that work for them and explaining like what,

108
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.400
I mean that motivation is gigantic.

109
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.520
Motivation is such a huge source of fuel for people in all walks of

110
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.960
life. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

111
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:58.120
to have a guy like you come in and talk to a company,

112
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.440
could have a really big impact on their creativity on,

113
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.320
on how they pursue goals on all, all kinds of different things.

114
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.680
<v 1>Yeah. So that that's, so anyways, that's kind of where I kind of,</v>

115
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.960
I can see my life kind of heading to now, you know, eventually I don't think, I,

116
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.360
I don't think, I, I think I'll always be a fan of the sport,

117
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.830
but I don't think I'll be involved in,

118
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.750
in either wrestling or fighters as much as.

119
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.590
<v 0>I think I would not as a coach, not as, no.</v>

120
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.270
<v 1>No, no. It's too hard, Joe, like, look at all these, these coaches it's,</v>

121
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:28.470
it's a relationship. Yeah. You know, being a coach is you're,

122
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.510
you're in a relationship with, uh, with your athletes.

123
00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:34.110
Sometimes you go through these breakups and sometimes the athletes don't give

124
00:06:34.111 --> 00:06:36.870
you what they want to give you. And then it's just, uh, it's a headache at, uh,

125
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.420
yeah. And I see that with, I see that with a lot of, you know,

126
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.900
I see that with him and I'm just like, man,

127
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.700
I don't know if I want those stress levels. It's a lot of stress.

128
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.860
<v 0>Well, for a guy like you, you, you get across a guy like Henry,</v>

129
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.540
you hit the gold mine,

130
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.620
but you could get across a guy who is a really talented guy. That's a flake.

131
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.330
And to, to me personally, there's plenty of those. But to me,

132
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.890
as an analyst, as someone who watches fights,

133
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.130
they're the most frustrating cuz there's some guys that I see and I go,

134
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.130
God that good. He's got the potential.

135
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:13.130
Like they can do things inside the octagon. They do things like,

136
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:14.810
I'll see guys in the gym, like,

137
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:17.730
I'll go to a gym and watch guys train and see the guy. And I go,

138
00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:21.400
if could put it together like this in the cage,

139
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.800
the way you see when he's sparring, like some people are just artists,

140
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.120
but the anxiety of competition and,

141
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.480
and all the factors that come involved, the discipline, the consistency,

142
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.040
all the things that makes someone a great fighter. Sometimes there's so much,

143
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.430
so many different things that make someone a great fighter that wind up them up

144
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.310
when, when they, they actually go to compete though,

145
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.830
the recklessness and impulsiveness that actually makes them good.

146
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.310
Also can wind up tanking them if they don't sort of forge it with, with,

147
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.390
with some sort of like severe discipline.

148
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.300
<v 1>Yeah. There, there has to be a training of the mind to, and,</v>

149
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.740
and I think that's where people are skipping and uh, you know,

150
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.700
I think that's, that's where you have to understand like the philosophy up here.

151
00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:13.100
Like you have to, you have to be right up top. You have, have to be right.

152
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.420
You have to be, you have to be literally,

153
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:17.500
you have to understand and know who you are as a fighter,

154
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.690
as a person mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, uh, you know, to kinda,

155
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.650
to be stable enough to perform at when it really matters. Yeah. You know,

156
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.650
and if you don't have that, you can be as talented and as gifted as you want.

157
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.490
You'll you'll never make it. And then we see those all the time. Like,

158
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:39.970
I'd see guys in practice matter, they would tear me up and they came to competi.

159
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.200
They would just roll, roll over like Phish. It's weird. Right? Yeah. It's crazy.

160
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.213
I'm like, huh?

161
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

162
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.280
It's weird as you're coming up and you see those guys mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and

163
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.880
you, you realize like, man, there's, there's something missing and then you,

164
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.600
you, you you're terrified. You're gonna see that in yourself.

165
00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.080
<v 1>And I think it's the embracement of embracing pressure. Mm it's.</v>

166
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.640
Something that you don't neglect. It's something that you don't shy away from.

167
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:06.560
It's something that you don't allow dam to damage you, but it's an embracement.

168
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.680
It's a, it's just like, Hey, bring it, man. Bring it. Cuz that's what it is,

169
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:12.040
Joe. It's the pressure that people feel, the reason why they.

170
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.800
<v 0>Can't perform. It's what makes champions.</v>

171
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.430
I remember when TJ DHA first fought he and morale. Um,

172
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.270
when he got into that octagon dude, he looked like he was sparring.

173
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.590
He was loose as a goose. Yeah. And, and I, and I saw him, I'm like,

174
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.950
look how loose TJ is. Like, this is a world title fight.

175
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.470
And he's switching stances and giving him looks and he looks fantastic.

176
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.710
He just looked loose and then boom, he hits him with that big overhand. Right.

177
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:37.780
And so, you know, he Morales getting up. Yeah. I mean,

178
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.500
and that was what TJ thrives on that kind of pressure.

179
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.460
He lives for that kind of pressure. Just like you do. Yeah.

180
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.460
Which is why I want five.

181
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.860
<v 1>Let's do it. I want his head on a, I want his head. I want his head on a spike.</v>

182
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.260
&lt;laugh&gt; I want, I wanna,

183
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.930
I wanna make some snake shoes outta attitude, man. &lt;laugh&gt; snake skin.

184
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.530
I want snake. Skin shoes, maybe suit. Think you might be big enough for me.

185
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.810
Yeah. What, what a.
