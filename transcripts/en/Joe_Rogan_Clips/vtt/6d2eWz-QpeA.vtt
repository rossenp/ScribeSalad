00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>I'm shooting three gigs and I go in a night, that's a lot of driving says,</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:04.494
you get

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.260
[inaudible], You know, get killed, look killing someone. It was crazy

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.260
. Rhode Island was always fun. And then when

5
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.260
 Kennison, w w w when I first met Kennison out

6
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.260
 at the store, I said, oh my God, it was like a rebel

7
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.260
. I'd never seen anything. And I've seen everybody. And I said, this is so I call him 

8
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.260
and I go, you got to see this guy. He's nuts, man

9
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.260
. It's unbelief. He's like this preacher who does comedy, that's insane. And so,

10
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.093
uh,  we bring him to Boston and.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.860
<v 1>And nix is the first star fight. I ended up firing him after the first show,</v>

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.940
why he, he showed up all up and you know,

13
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.470
I got him some blow and he went on stage and he just,

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.190
he was doing like new material. And I said, Sam,

15
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:52.680
is there any way you could do your HBO? He goes, no.

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.590
<v 0>Bro. That's been done. That's been done. And I go, well.</v>

17
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.320
<v 1>I got to let you go. He goes, I figured that.</v>

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.130
Then I got him a gig at the connection. Then he got fired for a minute.

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.820
<v 0>Then you had him a place in Malden. He got five.</v>

20
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.420
Then he shows up at stitches at my gig. And he comes walking in and like,

21
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.860
oh Sam, man, I can't lose this gig. This is my, this is my big money gig.

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630
Do you trust me? Do you trust the base? They trust the piece. Freak me out.

23
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.620
So let's just tell me, you know,

24
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:24.510
you saw him on the HBO Saturday night live is one of the

25
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.340
best I've ever seen. Sam comes, snuffled it out. What half a bottle of away,

26
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.590
chugs it down burps and says someone's me tonight. And from then on,

27
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.280
he just found the room that, and by the end of the night,

28
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.270
they had hired him to come back to do the backroom at the paradise and it was

29
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:46.340
off and running. But oh my gosh, this is like 86. Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.460
<v 0>So we're in New York and we're doing Caroline site. And I mean, everybody who's,</v>

32
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:55.890
everybody comes out to see the show. It's unbelievable.

33
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.340
And they're going to do a rolling stone.

34
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:03.030
He's on the cover of rolling stone and he's supposed to do to today's show.

35
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.350
And so he,

36
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.120
he flies in every girl that's ever broke up with them and puts them all up in

37
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:12.450
the same hotel, different floors. I go, oh my.

38
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.890
<v 1>God, genius.</v>

39
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.143
<v 0>You missed that</v>

40
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.441
crazy.

41
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:24.360
So I told the story more than the small group of

42
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:29.190
people, but we're in the room and I'm lying on the side of the

43
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:32.640
bed, brothers bill, his mom's dead. Sam's passed up the chair.

44
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.040
We've been gone for days. And uh, Sam's mother goes, Lenny,

45
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.930
you got to get Sam up. It's got a today show. And I got today show that's huge,

46
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.920
man. We can't blow this up.

47
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.810
And it was just at the point where he didn't care what anybody thought. So, uh,

48
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.480
I said, Sam, Sam, get up, get up. You got to do it.

49
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.850
She mother want you to do it. This is big. It's great for your career.

50
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.000
And we turn on the TV and he's putting on his money.

51
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.300
He's put on a scope and this challenge, it takes off. And we also,

52
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.630
we watch it explodes. He goes, I will.

53
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.500
There's high well there's everyone back to bed.

54
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.830
It's mothers just go home. And then the phone rings. I just,

55
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:16.520
today show we won't be using Sam.

56
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.710
<v 2>Oh my God, I will. I will.</v>

57
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.523
[inaudible].

58
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.680
<v 0>He goes, you know, he goes, that was a horrible thing to happen, you know,</v>

59
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:30.820
to lose all those Astros. But you know, I guess she was a teacher, you know,

60
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.690
I forget her name. And he goes,

61
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.360
and the kids were in the classroom and they're all watching.

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.100
Anyone wants a cookie, this cake it's right after that. I mean, you know,

63
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.680
but he was, he was fearless. Fearless.

64
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.500
<v 2>Yeah. He was, you know, I don't know if you know the story about him,</v>

65
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:50.110
but his brother bill wrote that book, brother, Sam.

66
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.280
And he talked about how Sam got hit by a car. When he was a little kid,

67
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.550
he was a normal kid and he gets this horrible head injury.

68
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.260
And then all of a sudden was fearless. Like that happened to Roseanne.

69
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.490
And that happened to him. Same exact story hit by a car. I didn't know.

70
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.390
One personality changes a hundred percent becomes a totally different

71
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:13.660
personality and becomes his wild reckless person.

72
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.420
A habit of both of them. Listen, you know.

73
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.340
<v 0>All these Elisa is documentaries about him and stuff.</v>

74
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.850
And I see people that were on the peripheral edges. I mean,

75
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.720
I was with him for a few years. I mean, bringing him to the bar.

76
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.650
We brought them to Boston when he wasn't making a lot of money and might pay him

77
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.590
and he loved it and we became real good friends.

78
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.050
And it was a,

79
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.180
it was just a time in life that I never saw anything like that when

80
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.520
he'd break into the preacher thing with his little feet dancing.

81
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.470
And so one night we were up, he started canceling,

82
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.490
missing gigs and he missed the university of Arizona. And uh,

83
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.420
his, his manager goes and he had a big time managing or they had just got him,

84
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.720
you know, the cover of rolling stone, all that stuff. And he goes, Lenny,

85
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.870
you got to get him to show them all your open a front. I said, okay.

86
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.510
So Sam goes, come on, we'll go back to the place.

87
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.040
And we're doing massive amounts of blown.

88
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.810
And I've gotten up to go to the bathroom.

89
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.170
He's never gets up to go to the bathroom. It was just,

90
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.940
I smashed up with Tampa and we're doing a show.

91
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:25.240
It was the year that Tampa lost every game, the professional football team.

92
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.970
And they came in and some big offensive climate, biggest guys I've ever seen.

93
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.160
Can we meet Sam, Sam, these guys want to meet you.

94
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.970
And one of them breaks out a little bloated. Sam goes, blows away.

95
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:38.170
And it wo it takes out a bag, puts it down, not doing a rush,

96
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.200
you and walks out. And they look at him like, yeah, he's not human.

97
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.250
So we'd go back to a place. And now it's free.

98
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.630
And the monitor is forward them on.

99
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.330
It was supposed to take a seven o'clock flight. And he said, yeah,

100
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.430
but I've got to make that flight. It's eight o'clock flight.

101
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.600
It's only an hour out of, you know, LA to Arizona that right. So,

102
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.650
so 10 o'clock the, uh, manager shows up and let me go say, man,

103
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.070
this is not good, but this is a makeup show. You,

104
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.500
you didn't shellfish and makeup show it. It's sold out. He goes, uh,

105
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.730
take language in and I'll be, I'll follow up. So we're in the,

106
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.880
we're in the plane. And he says, how much time he got done? I said, well,

107
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:18.530
how much do you need? He goes, well, you know, until he gets it. So I go on,

108
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:23.060
I'm supposed to 20 I'm I'm at about 54 and I'm gone, man, I'm on.

109
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.640
And I'm holding them off your Sam seven. I go hold him.

110
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.480
And I look over and he's on an oxygen tank with a mask.

111
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.270
And it's the big Cody premium deadlift that dad bring up.

112
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.570
I bring them on and the place goes crazy. Crazy, crazy, crazy.

113
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.950
And afterwards, we go to some strip club, right? And so we're in it.

114
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:48.170
Everyone's wild, man. He's a big star. You know what I mean?

115
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:49.004
People can't pollute.

116
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.370
So sitting on the strip has come over and he's throwing money around him and

117
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.970
someone throws a can of beer and he goes, that's it. He goes,

118
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.400
you guys want to make more money in the night. Then you make it a month.

119
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.293
Come with me.

120
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.840
And we go about eight of them come and we get in a limo and we go back to the

121
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:05.450
hotel and we're up. They'll tell them, well, minds are drinking to me.

122
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.060
And he goes, Lenny. He goes, I know you're married. He goes,

123
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.790
but in about five minutes, things are going to change.

124
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.580
You might want to go. He says, because once you open the store,

125
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.780
you'll never be able to close it again. And I said, I thought my S alright,

126
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.750
okay. And so I left and I went back to my room,

127
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.110
get back an extra cookie from the DoubleTree, by my room.

128
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.120
So the next morning I get up and I go over to the room and I open it up

129
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.660
and it's destroyed in his blood everywhere.

130
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.510
Sitting around crying, crying, Sam.

131
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.610
Oh, it was horrible. I said,

132
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.410
this. So I, I get a cab. I go to the airport and I fly back.

133
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.300
And to this day, I never know what happened. It was one guy magic.

134
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.720
I mean, if you haven't listened to his magic, fine, because I want to know what,

135
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.520
but it looked like it looked like a bomb. What? I've was broken.

136
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.560
All of them. I mean, like I trashed place, but like dangerously, trashed and,

137
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:13.970
and blood and still, still blow left. And oh, it was, I don't know.

138
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.080
<v 2>What happened at night. You know,</v>

139
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:20.000
mark Marin was hanging out with him back in the day when mark was a doorman at

140
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:22.730
the comic store. And he's a young kid. Yeah.

141
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.830
He did so much Coke with Kinison that he heard voices for a year.

142
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.090
Wow. His head was broken. He heard voices in his head for a year.

143
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:35.420
And that's when he sobered up. He came to Boston. Well, right after that,

144
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.200
that's when I met him. I met Marin in 88 when he had just,

145
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.460
just was trying to get his brain back online. Yeah. He was fried,

146
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.710
cooked his brain. It was just up for days.

147
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.730
<v 0>We're in Boston. And we, I think we do stitches and we closed. I said, come on,</v>

148
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:56.580
we'll go over to Lansdowne street. Cause a buddy Vassar's running that.

149
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:59.790
So now we're drinking bottles of champagne. Like it's gone as it goes,

150
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.210
that's it, man. It's enough. We got to go. So we'll even sham.

151
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.790
Cause where are we going now? I don't know, man. It's this?

152
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.240
There's no bars open. It's after two, he goes, you got to know a place to go.

153
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.180
Most of the places I know that they're folded up.

154
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.840
They've been shut down and he goes, wait a minute. He goes,

155
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.220
the limo we had the other night had. And he goes, yeah, call the limo.

156
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.670
So they call it a limo. It comes fully stocked. What am I? He goes,

157
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.000
never run the rush to buy my ball. And we've been drinking it,

158
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.430
pray it bread. That shot happened to him. You know? It was just, it was insane.

159
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.780
Just not human.

160
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.590
<v 2>He's a wild. That's for sure. He changed comedy. He really did.</v>

161
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.120
He changed what comedy was. It became something like before him,

162
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.780
it was people telling jokes, but he was so outrageous.

163
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:49.920
And when he did that HBO special, that one that he did from the Roxy on sunset,

164
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.310
I was there. Yeah. That special changed comedy.

165
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.140
Like it changed people's idea.

166
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.870
Like when he did that joke about the homosexual necrophilia.

167
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.450
<v 0>[Inaudible] so, I mean, it's just,</v>

168
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.540
there's still one night I go in and the cops,

169
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.050
the cops left Sam and there was like about seven squad guys up in front of the

170
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.680
comedies. Don't go, oh, Sam, you go. And they're all aligned to what?

171
00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:20.130
The steps involved. They're all watching him and he's bombing. You know? I mean,

172
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.450
it kinda goes, yeah. It's people don't seem to like me. I said,

173
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.270
I want you to be fair. You know, when you go home tonight,

174
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.520
I want you to take a piece of paper, a napkin, something, anything.

175
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.220
And I want you to write on it. Someone in your life that's passed, you know,

176
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.770
a brother or sister or mother, the sacred dead.

177
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.460
I want you to take that home and I want you to get home and I want you to wipe

178
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.930
you off the flying. It was

179
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.620
so fun. And everywhere we went,

180
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.220
he would leave like 20 or 30 tickets for the cops in that town,

181
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.780
wherever we were. And the cops would always show up. Oh, that's awesome. I,

182
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.610
so one night we're up at Mitzi's and he's up there jamming with Eric

183
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:04.770
Clapton, Phil Collins.

184
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.940
I forget who the other guy was and they're on the porch and he's got the cottage

185
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:12.900
and walking it out. Right. And I'm going, I can't play, but I'm going,

186
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:17.640
this is insane. And so the cops come and he goes, let me take care of it.

187
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:21.300
So I go up and it's like three, four cars, the lights go on. I go, what's up?

188
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.640
I say, Hey, you gotta cut it down. I said, oh man,

189
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.680
you're not completely Eric Clapton sign. Anyway,

190
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.360
Phil Collins that jam out salmon exam. Can we meet? So I go down,

191
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:32.130
I go Sam, the cop says, okay,

192
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:35.670
but you've got to come up and take a picture with him and you, I should Sam.

193
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:38.850
I said a closing it down. So it goes up and they have Polaroids.

194
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:41.100
That's when they had the Polaroid cameras out and they took,

195
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.800
Paul had me taking the Polaroids of Sam and the cops.

196
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.160
But what I'd love to see those pictures, but it was,

197
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.600
you never know who's going to come over there.

198
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.330
You never know who's going to come over. That was just incredible.

199
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.590
<v 2>He's the example that I give to comics of a guy who was at one</v>

200
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.830
point in time, one of the best ever. Oh yeah.

201
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.700
But then dropped off hard. Like he dropped off in a big way.

202
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.270
Just stop writing too much partying. His brother talked about it in the book.

203
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.860
He just it's what can happen? Like can't you,

204
00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:15.850
you got to respect this thing. And he was just all about the ride.

205
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:20.470
And then also he became very, very famous, probably too famous, you know?

206
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.260
<v 0>Well, we we've been doing the Outlaws of comedy at the dunes.</v>

207
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:26.800
That's how long ago now? And uh,

208
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.480
he had driven out with Tomayo to my Iowa Suki. And uh,

209
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.350
I got a call early in the morning. Lenny, Lenny, come quick, Sam dead. I go,

210
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:39.430
what? So I go over to, uh, to Caesar's palace.

211
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.420
They had a beer and I can't wait to get my ticket, take the champagne thing,

212
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.440
take it out and pour water on Villa and smile pushed me out away and said,

213
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.940
she goes, welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond, Sam,

214
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.230
whatever. Say that.

215
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.240
<v 2>You never seen that.</v>

216
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.410
<v 0>Every morning. Tomorrow, tomorrow. I mean, she was so funny, man. You know,</v>

217
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.170
she was, I really enjoyed her and she was sweet. I worked with her.

218
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.210
I used to work with, at the store a lot, you know, I don't,

219
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.820
I don't know if she's, she's still doing comedy. I don't know.

220
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.810
<v 2>I haven't seen her ever.</v>

221
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.280
<v 0>She was, oh, she did this. She came up, you know, and your country, you say,</v>

222
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.820
I walk miles to school in the snow and my country.

223
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.530
You drop a atomic bomb on us.

224
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.600
Crazy. Yeah. Funny, funny, funny stuff, man. But he was, oh,

225
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.640
first time I ever did ecstasy. It was,

226
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.900
they were closing the club that he started at in Austin, Texas,

227
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.910
I guess we're all going raw laptop. We're all going. So, uh, he, he,

228
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.260
he drove, I think he drove, I flew down. I flew,

229
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.000
I met him and someone comes in and says, Hey man, you gotta try this.

230
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.410
What is ecstasy? He goes, yeah, man, give me, give me all your guns.

231
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.000
How much that like give me all you got. So we got we're all on ecstasy.

232
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:55.090
I never did an extra month and was sitting on a couch with drag him into a book

233
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.940
and he starts to float away. Right.

234
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.960
So there's so I reach over and I bring them down. I said, what the?

235
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.890
You quit touching salmon. I only show Sam goes, thank you, Lenny,

236
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.170
for bringing me back.
