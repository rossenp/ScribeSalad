00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Was such a crazy for. I was.</v>

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.320
<v 1>Gonna bring this up. I'm glad you brought that up. So remember the, uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.830
everybody's talking about this week in the fight where the Drysdale,

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.280
they was telling them to stop the fight. And he was like, Drysdale is like,

5
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.440
just trying to be a coach, try to keep it going or whatever. And there's,

6
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.460
a lot of people are saying,

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.010
if the fighter says he doesn't want to do it anymore,

8
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:25.920
whatever that Simon Marcus fight after three rounds. Now I didn't,

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.050
wasn't begging my coach to stop it, but I did not want to go another round.

10
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.320
And I was like, oh, did I win? And like,

11
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.280
I think you're gonna have to do one more. And I'm like, I can't do one more.

12
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:36.440
I don't want to do one more. I can't do one. One of my coaches like,

13
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.650
you can do it one more round. Then we do it.

14
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.200
Boom. Nope. That's not the punch. A lot of fighters experienced that.

15
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.950
And it's the coach's job, I think, to keep them to try to keep them going.

16
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.390
So I'm on the lawn Drysdale side on that, but ultimately he didn't fight anyway.

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.350
They stopped it. Right?

18
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.180
<v 0>Yeah. Well ultimately he did, but it was, um, very, very controversial,</v>

19
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:03.020
but I, I get Drysdale position and listen, in retrospect,

20
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.610
like after the conversation is over, yeah.

21
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.430
Maybe you should have called it when the guy said call it.

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.230
But in the moment he doesn't know that he can't talk the guy into fighting and

23
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:13.160
then maybe the guy wins.

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.480
Like you don't know what a person's psychological mindset is like,

25
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.010
unless you train with that person. Right.

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.700
And there are some people that you can talk into performing better. Right.

27
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.480
That said he took a lot of punishment that second round. Right.

28
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.290
Maybe he knew something. Maybe, maybe it was a good thing to stop.

29
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.450
There's some times when your body's just broken.

30
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.320
There's some times when you shouldn't go on and this debate,

31
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:39.440
I think is very healthy. The debate of whether or not the coach was right.

32
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.050
Or whether or not the guy was right. Ultimately the guy's right.

33
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.280
Cause he can't go on. So he doesn't, he, he, he quits and he's, you know,

34
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.290
that's his decision. What, he only,

35
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.630
only he knows what was going on with his body.

36
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.170
You remember when Gerald McClellan got criticized for taking a knee against

37
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.200
natural Ben? I don't know if you remember it,

38
00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:01.610
but it was a that's the fight that put Joe McClellan in a coma

39
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.180
and severely handicapped him,

40
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.190
Gerald McClellan at the time was a assassin man. He was so scary,

41
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.400
but he was another guy that cut way too much weight. He cut a lot of weight,

42
00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:15.920
man. It was hard for him. He was really big.

43
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.940
And so when he would get into the F I forget if he's fought 1 68,

44
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.710
I think he was fighting a Roy Jones, his division. He's a 1 68 or 1 75. Get,

45
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.040
pull up Gerald McClellan versus Nigel Benn.

46
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.330
This was the dark destroyer. Cause Nigel Benn. It was a wild fight too.

47
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.710
Nigel's got crazy dreadlocks.

48
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.130
And Jeremy McLellan knocked him through the ropes in the first round because he

49
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:39.710
was smashed people. He would just smashed people. Right. He was such a,

50
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.440
it was a Cronk guy, right? So he fought like a crank.

51
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:46.910
I just move in forward behind the jab. Big right hands, just nasty,

52
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:48.920
vicious puncher. Well,

53
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.570
Nigel Benn gets up and he makes it through the round and,

54
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.110
and then turns into a war.

55
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.830
And then Gerald McClellan starts getting tired and then they clash heads.

56
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030
And then Nigel hits him with a couple of punches late in the fight.

57
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.510
And when Nigel Benn hit him, see like this was early on. I mean,

58
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:07.390
this is like this go a little earlier than this.

59
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.060
So we could see this combination, but this was Gerald McClellan.

60
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.970
And everybody was like real keen on him fighting Roy Jones, Jr.

61
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
This was when Roy Jones was in his prime. And this was like,

62
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.950
the big challenge was Gerald McClellan, Roy Jones, Jr.

63
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.620
Everybody was thinking that was eventually going to have to happen because

64
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.520
Gerald was just smashing people. And Nigel Benn was tough, man.

65
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.810
tough. But look at this boom, boom, boom. He's like, he's out man.

66
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.950
And he falls through the ropes. You could see he's like really out of it,

67
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.540
but so tough.

68
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.530
And so conditioned that he makes it back like that barely can get through the

69
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.020
ropes. Got a lot of seconds there though. Right?

70
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.610
That's probably more than 10 seconds. So anywhere. And look at the referee.

71
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:53.260
There's more seconds and Gerald's still teeing off on him and Nigel survives.

72
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.260
It doesn't seem like he's going to survive, but he survives.

73
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.250
So then late in the fight, Nigel's making a comeback.

74
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.840
So scooch way ahead here.

75
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.060
And when Nigel starts teeing off on Gerald and Gerald's punches are coming

76
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:11.680
real slow and he's getting tired and Nigel starts connecting. And I mean,

77
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:16.390
the crowd is going bananas. It is a wild fight. And at one point in time,

78
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.580
they head butt and then Nigel hits him with some punches and McClellan takes a

79
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:24.280
knee. And everybody's like, I can't believe that she's going to quit.

80
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.143
He's going to quit.

81
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.840
And then he goes through his corner and then he slumps and goes unconscious.

82
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.060
Like he knew something was wrong. And any,

83
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.000
anybody that criticizes in the moment, you know, they were saying,

84
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:37.390
I can't believe he's doing this. I can't believe he's, he just going to quit.

85
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.610
But he knew something was really off. Only the fighter knows. I mean,

86
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.760
maybe it's psychological, but maybe something's wrong, man.

87
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:47.860
Maybe he can't think maybe his brain is just.

88
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.910
Maybe knows he's not going to be able to punch. Right. Maybe knows there it is.

89
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.680
So he goes down and just decides to stay down. He's like,

90
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:59.950
something was really wrong. He's like out of it.

91
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.610
Hmm. And you see, this is, I mean, Jared, he just looks,

92
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.020
it looks wrong. Something looks wrong, you know, he's hurt bad.

93
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.870
And Nigel Benn is moving in for the kill.

94
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.520
And he drops him there with an upper cut.

95
00:05:16.521 --> 00:05:20.210
And this is where he quits seat and hell. This is where like you see him,

96
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.570
he's struggling, man. But if I remember correctly,

97
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:26.780
the commentators were shocked that he decided to stay down,

98
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.960
he's quit. So they set it that way. And you know, I think they were, you know,

99
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:39.500
expressing some shock that he quit and pretty pumped that Nigel Benn beat him,

100
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.680
but they didn't know, you know,

101
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.900
and Gerald McClellan that injury scared the out of everybody because he was, uh,

102
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.700
you know, one of the golden guys,

103
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:52.340
he was one of the guys that everybody was excited about. It was like,

104
00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:56.420
if that happened today, you know, to, uh, uh,

105
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.250
Ryan or someone like that, you know, someone who's, uh, you know,

106
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:05.780
real exciting up and coming dude, someone who's, um, you know,

107
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.410
Canelo, like if Canelo just, I guess canal was a bigger star than Gerald,

108
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.980
but when someone who's of that nature,

109
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.830
like an elite super elite fighter, uh,

110
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:19.490
winds up going into a coma like that, that's terrifying.

111
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.990
<v 1>And he came out of it. Okay. No, no, he didn't die. No, he's all up.</v>

112
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.850
<v 0>He can't see. And um, you know, there's been some videos of, uh, Roy Jones Jr.</v>

113
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.660
Visiting them.

114
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.430
But apparently that was responsible for Roy Jones kind of altering his style and

115
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.220
uh, being very safety first and really, yeah.

116
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.210
And just thinking about eventually, you know, getting out of the sport,

117
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:44.240
which is ironic, right. Because he wound up fighting later and later and later,

118
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.460
and it was like, I mean, it has last fight just a couple of years ago.
