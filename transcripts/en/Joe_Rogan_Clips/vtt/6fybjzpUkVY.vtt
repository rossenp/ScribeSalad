00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.300
As say this man and psych that it's the story.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.830
You're just putting a story together. And I don't, I don't think, you know,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.790
w without, without the stories, what do you talk about?

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.360
What do you talk about, you know, w what is,

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.950
what is the interesting side of conference conversation.

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.970
<v 1>About your growth or your.</v>

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.330
<v 0>Journey? If it's, if it's, if it's just the easiest,</v>

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.140
I just took the highway and got off of the exit and right there,

10
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:37.250
the exit I found the gold, everybody else did know what his dad was rich,

11
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:40.100
and I have a trust fund, and I never have to work out. What, what is the,

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.420
what is the interesting side to that? Like, I don't there's no,

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.550
there is no bonus in that, like, yeah.

14
00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:51.850
I just broke my back. Right? The,

15
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:56.810
the dopest thing for me about doing that was not being able

16
00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:01.100
to walk, but then being told that if I'm patient,

17
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.930
I can recover fully. I can get back to myself in me,

18
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.730
instantly thinking in my head,

19
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.060
I can actually be better than what I was.

20
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.550
If he's telling me I can get back to a hundred percent, I'm going to be better.

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.960
So the game is to clicked on, all right, tomorrow we start, we play.

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.633
<v 1>New level.</v>

23
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.050
<v 0>I can't walk. God. Here we go. Can't wipe my.</v>

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm not getting, they say, I can't get in the gym. PT is some weird.

25
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.110
I'm just taking two steps on a Bussa ball. And I'm all right.

26
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.550
This is a little discouraging,

27
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.250
but I know they said I'm supposed to do it three days.

28
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:40.970
I'm going to listen to them. But on those other, all those other four days,

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.360
is there anything else that I can do to be working on Kevin?

30
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.070
You can strengthen your lungs. Aren't working with your breathing.

31
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.700
Here's a breathing machine. Okay. What about my, my hands? Is there any way?

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.960
My sense is tennis ball. Can I be squeezing? Should I be doing anything? No,

33
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:56.930
we don't have anything like that. We don't recommend it.

34
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.570
So if I found something and I researched,

35
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.010
if it's just motor skills and working on, is that fine? Yeah, that's fine.

36
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.880
But you know, we it's it's, it's okay. If that's what you want to do. Okay.

37
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.550
I saw that. Yeah. I'm not getting the same.

38
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.610
The doctors are just telling me to stop that I need to now stay within those

39
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.410
lines. I'm gonna find out the things that I can do.

40
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.260
Cause I'm playing a game now. I'm never going to overexert myself,

41
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.100
but the game has to be better. How do I be better than what I was?

42
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.420
Because if I do that, oh for me. I just beat me.

43
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.800
Yeah. Yeah. This ain't about nobody else. I don't give a about nobody else.

44
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.570
Beat me. If I can keep beating myself, pause.

45
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.190
If I can keep doing that,

46
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.290
then that means that I'm in a battle with the only person that

47
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.550
makes sense.

48
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.220
I'm in a battle with the only person that I really want to

49
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.440
beat. And that's me. I don't care about anybody else.

50
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.850
I have no worry or gripe about the next man or woman's.

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.850
<v 1>Or, or, or, or, or their level.</v>

52
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.640
<v 0>Of success. That's not what, I'm what I'm up against.</v>

53
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.130
If I can continue to outdo me from the day before

54
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.060
then I'm then I'm ahead and I'm ahead. And that's, that's what I,

55
00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:19.710
that's the new found the new found energy that I got out of life.

56
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:23.460
Now, you know, I'm on this amazing Rocky story.

57
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:27.540
What my son is in my head, nobody else is watching this movie,

58
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:31.590
but me it's in my head. This is Rocky. This is the comeback.

59
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.370
This is exactly what I saw moving. I'm gonna come back better than ever.

60
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:38.880
I'm going to be 41. My body's going to be ripped up.

61
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.260
I'm I might be about 8% body fat. And then, and then I'm ready.

62
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.950
Ready for what Kevin know. Right.

63
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.280
I'll be better than you were before. I don't know. But that's,

64
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.750
that's what I want. I want that day to be like, yeah. Now what?

65
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.370
And then I figure out what I figured out. What that, what is that? Yeah. Well.

66
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.800
<v 2>Tell me when you got injured. What,</v>

67
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.080
what you were explaining it to me before the podcast,

68
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:07.500
but I want to talk too much about it. Cause I wanted to hear it now.

69
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.490
W w so everybody could hear it. What, what exactly was the injury?

70
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.290
<v 0>I, I fractured, so I fractured my, my spine.</v>

71
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.393
Right?

72
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.380
And it's from my it's either from my T 10 to my L one from my [inaudible]

73
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.090
whatever order that goes in. So I, how many fractures is, I mean,

74
00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:29.610
that's that. That's just spine. That's about.

75
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.530
<v 2>So you're fractured, basically everything. I.</v>

76
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.790
<v 0>Mean, you got like this much space and my back. So you got to think,</v>

77
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:39.330
first of all, I'm already small, right? So does this practically my whole back,

78
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:41.340
if you look at this right here, if you look at this,

79
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.450
this is a fragment my whole back. So all of this fractured and what,

80
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.460
what happens is they had to fuse my

81
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:51.294
spine. So.

82
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.670
<v 2>Do they have to remove the discs in between?</v>

83
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.870
<v 0>They basically had to fix so,</v>

84
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.820
so the bones were where it's fractured.

85
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:03.420
Basically your spine is now out of whack, right? The, the,

86
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.870
the things that keep your spine connected and that allow you,

87
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.270
the flexibility are out of whack.

88
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.410
I got pieces of those bone fragments that are out of place out. So,

89
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.740
so they got, they got to fuse that back together.

90
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.540
<v 2>So I got it, the disc material out and compress it and then screw them all.</v>

91
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.430
So it's the bone, all one piece? No.

92
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.150
<v 0>I, I think, um, I think I'm one. I don't, I don't know about the disc.</v>

93
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.850
I don't know. I don't have that answer. That's a,

94
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.320
that's a little too technical for me.

95
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:32.880
And I should know that because it was my body.

96
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.210
But what I do know is that this thing that's,

97
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.680
my spine has eight screws and these eight screws

98
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.940
now hold it together. So through this time of healing,

99
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.550
because I now have metal in my back,

100
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.050
it was about getting your back to be comfortable with the metal,

101
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.100
but also back to a normal level of flexibility.

102
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.080
So where people up when you get this type of energy and you stay still,

103
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.490
you allow that metal to get stiff. You don't, you don't, you're not moving it.

104
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.870
So, so now your movements become robotic with it. So,

105
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.340
because as soon as I got out the hospital, I started,

106
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.140
I didn't have days off. As soon as I got out,

107
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.720
I started physical therapy. I did not wait. I didn't, I got off medication.

108
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.250
I said, I'm not taking off meds. You know, my dad was on drugs. I was like,

109
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:30.090
I'm not around that. So I dealt with the pain, but I say,

110
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:34.930
I got to start now because every day to that weight makes it harder

111
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.030
to go. So, because I was, you know, back and forth side to side,

112
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.650
doing all of those things, I got, I got my body to get accustomed to it.

113
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.410
And I got flexibilities. So now when you see me working out,

114
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.600
it looks as if I'm back and 98% back to myself right now.

115
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.610
But the work that I put into my core and my upper body

116
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.560
over the years are what saved me. Sign of God, of course,

117
00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:06.310
in that situation. Because, you know, I want to tell us people just for,

118
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.330
just for you to know this health and wellness is so much bigger

119
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.370
than what you may think it is taking care of your body.

120
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.020
You don't know when all of that stuff comes into play and adds up

121
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.250
correctly. You know, the, the human body has amazing recovery.

122
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:28.930
The ability to snap back and go back to what it once was the body

123
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.900
muscle memory, all of that stuff plays a major factor.

124
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.480
So my healing

125
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.960
was a lot faster because of the years of work that I put into

126
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.790
it before. Now,

127
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.590
if I had enough and I didn't have that core, well, I'll be paralyzed.

128
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.700
I'd be paralyzed. I mean, it set up, you're literally talking about this much.

129
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.380
Doctor looked me in the eyes. You're lucky to be walking. You're this much.

130
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.460
If your core wasn't in the shape that it was.

131
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.650
And if you didn't have the strength to take whatever that impact was and

132
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:09.910
stay, you would have been snapped and you'll never be walking again.

133
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.740
So that instantly, thank God I go, you know what,

134
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.620
thank God for my trainer who jumped in into my life at a certain time and

135
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.420
change my way of thanking boss, Ronald boss, Everline and you know,

136
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:29.200
we've been rocking for seven years and, and the,

137
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.300
we have four years before, of every day, every day.

138
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.260
So now I'm like you, you're not wasting your time ever.

139
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:40.270
So when those people say, what are you working out for?

140
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.420
What are you getting shaved for? Why are you going every day?

141
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.030
You don't know when you're going to need to tap into all the little work that

142
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:49.630
you've done. You don't.

143
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.880
<v 1>Know. You don't know if you'll ever need.</v>

144
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.240
<v 0>It, but to just know that you've taken care of yourself,</v>

145
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.160
to know that you've given yourself a chance to

146
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.500
not only survive, but perform.

147
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.570
You've given yourself a chance to perform at a high level and day to day by

148
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:14.490
taking care of your engine. This is, this is my machine.

149
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.800
So I'm taking care of the engine, just like any car oil changes, just like,

150
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.830
you know, you your brakes, your, your, your tires, the rotors, all of that.

151
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.150
You taken care of that. So that was a great ride.

152
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:31.980
Every time you got to do the same with your body, don't ignore that. People,

153
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:36.510
you know, we, we dropping like flies right now. Heart attack, strokes, you know,

154
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.280
uh, kidney failure. You got people with diabetes, you got people getting,

155
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.380
uh, legs, arms cut off from bad eating from,

156
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.030
from bad eating over the course of years. Take that serious.

157
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.620
Don't wait till the end. That's serious. That's not,

158
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.760
that's not a joke. So when I look at people dying around me,

159
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.550
we have no control over when a day is going to come,

160
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.620
but I'm going to try to help amplify my time here as much as I can.

161
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.700
<v 2>That's the big one, right? Amplify your time. You have energy,</v>

162
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.040
you have a different kind of energy than someone who's unhealthy.

163
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.460
You have the ability to push forward. You have the ability to get done.

164
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:19.010
You have more enthusiasm because your body feels good.

165
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.340
You're recovering from your, your back injury. Look.

166
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.950
How long ago was the injury? How long ago was the crash now?

167
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.270
<v 0>September. So what does that, September, October, November, December, January,</v>

168
00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:33.080
February, March, April was his may. Yeah. So only eight months.

169
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.050
It's about to be June is about to be nine. I'm going to get into nine.

170
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.690
And you said you like 98%, 98%.

171
00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:42.950
I'm down to probably 10% body fat right now.

172
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.520
<v 2>And as far as like movement, you can basically do everything.</v>

173
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.760
<v 0>And don't everything. Wow. Doing everything I'm up to running again.</v>

174
00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:53.990
I'm probably at, I'm probably a three.

175
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:57.230
I can go three and a half miles straight before. I'm like, oh,

176
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.330
the back starts to bother me before I get tight.

177
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.340
<v 2>What are you doing for the bag? Are you doing yoga?</v>

178
00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:02.570
Are you doing what kind of exercise?

179
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.640
<v 0>Physical therapy, you know, as random shout out to Dr. Pet, um, you know,</v>

180
00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:11.540
I make sure that getting the massages, uh, getting the work done,

181
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.290
because I'm doing so much within working out.

182
00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:19.910
I don't want to not take care of that as well. So from heating it from,

183
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.880
you know, treatment, uh, just,

184
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:26.390
just literally doing things to make sure that I'm,

185
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.200
I'm constantly working on those muscles and not forgetting them.

186
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:33.650
I'm getting older. I don't want to act like that's not the case,

187
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.630
or that's not a reality. I'm 40 now.

188
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.830
So how do I take care of this machine? So at 50,

189
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.430
I'm not moving as if I'm 70, you know? Um,

190
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.200
I would say that's been, that's been a great adjustment,

191
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.970
but one that's really made me feel better like stretching.

192
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.311
You know, I didn't,

193
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:59.200
I didn't understand the importance of stretching of actually resting.

194
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.760
You know, I was gotta get it. Let's go, let's go time weights, hit it,

195
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.450
clanging and banging baby clanging and banging. But now, you know,

196
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:11.740
make sure you get your rest time so that you can come back and give the energy,

197
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:15.490
your cardio changes, roll machines. I'm on,

198
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:20.010
I'm on a bike, you know, um, um, um, Pelotonia and I'm,

199
00:12:20.011 --> 00:12:22.300
I'm hydro and I'm running.

200
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:26.560
So the workouts change and you become more consistent,

201
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.560
uh, with your system, with my new system. So I think by July,

202
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.340
July, my, my goal is for my 41st birthday,

203
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:40.210
that's July six to be around eight,

204
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.380
eight and a half percent body fat at the age 41.

205
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.560
<v 2>So it's all about body. It's all about looking good with the body fat.</v>

206
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.520
<v 0>For me, for me, the body fat means that I've just been super focused.</v>

207
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.530
Like I eat,

208
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.920
I don't want people to think that I don't eat I'm I'm not a foodie though.

209
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:00.790
So it doesn't really count, but you know, I'm not on some strict, crazy diet.

210
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:03.850
You're not a foodie Lord, you don't enjoy, like, I'm not a foodie, man.

211
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:08.590
I don't know. I don't eat red meat. I really no red meat. No, no fish,

212
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.280
no seafood. Uh, I'm a, I'm a plant-based eater.

213
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.300
Everything's plant, uh, I'll go chicken every once in a while.

214
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.950
I'll dabble into my chicken. And that's what,

215
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.390
that's what people don't understand.

216
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.310
I don't think people really get that or understand that it's like, um,

217
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.290
just because you make the decision to go and try plant-based doesn't mean that

218
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:32.140
you have to engulf in that world, learn it,

219
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.150
understand it and see if there's benefits that work for you. And.

220
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.750
<v 2>You gotta be open to making adjustments to do, you know, CT Fletcher.</v>

221
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.840
<v 0>I do know of him. I don't know him, but I know of.</v>

222
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.980
<v 2>Him loved. I got to death</v>

223
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.830
as motivational as anybody that's ever lived. He had a heart attack. Um,

224
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.340
he had his heart replaced, got a new heart and he,

225
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.820
I don't think he's confirmed it, but he believes it's an Asian woman.

226
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.250
And I don't know if that's how he feels,

227
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.520
or like he's had some weird feelings about having this other person's heart

228
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:06.240
inside of his body. And, uh, he went a hundred percent plant based,

229
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.800
just changed. Everything,

230
00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:11.790
changed his entire diet and puts all these videos up about his heart came from

231
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:14.400
an Asian, believes his heart came from an Asian woman.

232
00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:17.040
I don't think he's confirmed that because I don't think they tell you,

233
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.870
but I think he's, he, he.

234
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.970
<v 0>Just, you want to know? Do you want to know?</v>

235
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.570
<v 2>Yeah. I'd kind of want to know. Yeah. Maybe he knows now. He didn't.</v>

236
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:28.050
I don't believe he knew last time I saw him in here, but you know,

237
00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:31.560
the first time I met him, I mean, he's a powerful guy, you know,

238
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.200
it's still your set. Like, he's that guy.

239
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.360
And he's just always this like booming voice and just

240
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.230
gigantic muscles and he's all drive and go.

241
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.580
And then when his heart failed and then he had to have his heart replaced,

242
00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:51.120
I saw him about a year later and he had this remarkable,

243
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.800
calm that had come over him. He was just like, it's different person,

244
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:59.660
very loving and embracing and had all this happiness and all this joy and all

245
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:03.500
this appreciation. And now all he needs is plants. I mean, he's a,

246
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.030
and he swears by it, that light for him. That's that's the way to go. No,

247
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:10.200
I'm talking about that light. Yeah. Salt and light.

248
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.050
<v 0>When you come close to that light. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

249
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.020
And it's in that light that I'm talking about is death.

250
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.770
If you come close to that light,

251
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.750
when you do,

252
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.250
and if you are fortunate enough to come back from that light,

253
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.020
you value life differently. You can't. There, there,

254
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.820
there are no bad days for me. There are no bad days for me.

255
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:38.640
I, my,

256
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.210
my biggest cry in life came from the first day that I came home from the

257
00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:46.000
hospital because I never,

258
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.770
I never had to see that house again. Like there was, there was an option, right?

259
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.360
I mean, never seen that home again.

260
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.660
There was an option of me never walking on their driveway. Again,

261
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.820
there was an option of me never seeing my wife and my kids

262
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.500
again, like the biggest. And I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't like a,

263
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.790
like a buildup cry. It was pull up,

264
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.740
get out feet, touched the ground. What the just came over me.

265
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.223
<v 1>Boo-hoo.</v>

266
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.460
<v 0>Like, what the? What just happened? By the way,</v>

267
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.510
a painful cry. Because my back, my back was up. Right?

268
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.910
So I'm crying hard and I'm in pain.

269
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.590
But the realization of none of this has to be,

270
00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:37.450
you're not in control, right? Hey, Kevin, you're not in control,

271
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:42.310
buddy. You thought you were, you move for a minute. Like, nah,

272
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:45.880
I got this. I'm gonna do that. Don't worry about it. I got it. We'll be good.

273
00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:49.240
I'm gonna make sure it happens as if you were in control.

274
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.500
That's what it is. It's literally that yeah.

275
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.470
At any decision at any given time,

276
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.250
it can be over and it's not until you get close to that light that you truly

277
00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:04.900
respect that. I respect that there are no bad days. Amen. Miss me with any.

278
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.280
<v 1>Yeah. I'm smiling because I have no.</v>

279
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.140
<v 0>Reason to be angry because I don't have to be.</v>

280
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.820
<v 2>You appreciate that sunshine. Cause you've been in the pouring.</v>

281
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.410
<v 0>Rain, man. Hey, Hey, that's a. Yes.</v>

282
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.370
Yeah. So when you talk about CT Fletcher and you talk about,

283
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.560
you know what, man, I've, I've been on the other side. He's he's been,

284
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:33.500
yeah, let's go. And that's great.

285
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.350
That doesn't mean it is that he doesn't still have that,

286
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:40.430
but now there's a different energy and a different level of relaxation that can

287
00:17:40.431 --> 00:17:44.420
come because I know how fortunate I am to be taking these steps.

288
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.040
<v 2>Yeah. It's not just a theory. Like every day really, truly is a gift.</v>

289
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.620
She's and you take it for granted. It's real. You take it.

290
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.850
<v 0>For granted, man. I'm gonna tell you not being able to wipe my</v>

291
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.520
changed everything.

292
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.930
<v 2>You got one of them, but days in your house,</v>

293
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:02.580
you pressed the button and I couldn't even.

294
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.480
<v 0>Do that. Really? I couldn't do that. I'm talking.</v>

295
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.630
You, you take it for granted.

296
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.140
You take it for granted, man. All of this,

297
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.430
all of this conversation is clapping is easy. Oh, Hey,

298
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.990
Camair all this here. You just, you just think it's okay.

299
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.300
You go, go through, go through a situation where it's calm.

300
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.050
<v 2>How long did it take before you could start walking again,</v>

301
00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:32.540
normal or semi normal.

302
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.841
<v 0>Allied in a hospital.</v>

303
00:18:35.841 --> 00:18:40.340
Because I didn't want them to know that that I was having pain because I thought

304
00:18:40.341 --> 00:18:44.780
that they were going to stop me from letting me continue to try my walks.

305
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.040
Um,

306
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.990
it was like day seven and the hospital and I

307
00:18:50.991 --> 00:18:54.620
had the Walker and it was slow walks, but I was dragging,

308
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.083
it was upper body.

309
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.520
And I was masking it as if I was feet. Right.

310
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.080
Because I didn't want to stop trying like, that was my, that was my,

311
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.610
that was my, my, my, my goal.

312
00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:15.560
Get my drive for anything was those that half hour or 40 where I

313
00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:19.820
could get up and go walk because I was just laying in the bed

314
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.070
all day and you know, God blessed me and my wife and my kids.

315
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.630
There was there's times like if this is the remote control

316
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.720
and I'm in the bed and I just want to get to the control. Well,

317
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.800
I can't get to it. If, if,

318
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:43.280
if you didn't position a control down here by my

319
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:47.900
hands so I could get it. This here throws my whole eye.

320
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:53.480
So now I can't press the button to corners. And every second is, babe,

321
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.650
can you, can you grab the control for me have do one.

322
00:19:57.651 --> 00:20:01.010
It was a time where my son, my son was like, it.

323
00:20:01.011 --> 00:20:04.640
My son just slept in the bed with me, my son. He was like, I'm here.

324
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:06.770
That I'm up. My son didn't want to go to school.

325
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:09.200
My daughter didn't want to go to school. They didn't wanna leave my side.

326
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:12.230
They stayed there. And middle of the night, if they heard,

327
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.910
they heard me. You all right, dad, what you want? They were up.

328
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.410
My son doubled his nurse. My daughter doubled his nurse,

329
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.820
Nico doubled as it, uh, you know, they, they were there.

330
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:30.350
My brother came and that's when the

331
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.190
that's when the care about what was important,

332
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.740
really changed the that I thought was important.

333
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.020
The things that you think are important,

334
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.110
you get to looking around at a hospital, almost four walls.

335
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.720
None of that that you think is important. It's in there.

336
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.850
It's one of these people, none that other was in there. None of it,

337
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.520
none of it was in there.

338
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.140
<v 2>It's also got to make you feel great. That there's that much love, you know,</v>

339
00:20:55.141 --> 00:20:56.040
that they cared about you that.

340
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.370
<v 0>Way. That's what gets you. That's what gets you through it? Yeah.</v>

341
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.660
So those little steps that I was taking, you know, the,

342
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.610
the discomfort of not being able to do the love and energy

343
00:21:08.611 --> 00:21:10.110
made me go, it's going to be all right.

344
00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:12.930
I'm going to get there because you definitely feel defeated for a little bit.

345
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.710
<v 2>And so how long before you were walking without a Walker?</v>

346
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:20.400
Um.

347
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:20.880
<v 3>I'll stubborn.</v>

348
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.320
<v 0>Man. So probably two and a half weeks. Two to two and a half weeks.</v>

349
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.030
I should of had the Walker though. Wow. I should've had the Walker, but it was,

350
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:35.430
um, I'm giving the perception that it's, that it's better than what it is.

351
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.050
And I had the back brace on you fake it till you make it. It was, I definitely,

352
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.760
I definitely, I definitely was was, Hey,

353
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.490
smiling. What's up? Y'all good morning,

354
00:21:47.491 --> 00:21:51.540
everybody given this perception of over told me he went to visit you. Yeah.

355
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.100
<v 2>And he said, he goes, see the guy's already walking around. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

356
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.970
I had given.

357
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.820
<v 0>A perception because you don't, I don't want you to, to,</v>

358
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.990
to worry. Yeah, I got it's me. Yeah, let me, I'm going through it.

359
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.710
I'm gonna figure it out. I don't want that worry placed on anybody else.

360
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.160
I told you I stopped taking meds. So every night was a,

361
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.140
was a horrible night.

362
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.100
<v 2>So much better for you though. Just accept that pain. Every night.</v>

363
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.240
I did that with my knee surgery and it's obviously a much less painful thing,

364
00:22:24.241 --> 00:22:25.780
but I was like, I,

365
00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:30.180
I took that once for one of my knee surgeries one day and I was like this,

366
00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:31.014
I feel so.

367
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.380
<v 0>Good. Stupid. I slobbered on myself. That's when I said no, no,</v>

368
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.790
I was talking to a piece.

369
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.680
<v 4>Of slack. I was by myself.</v>

370
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.190
<v 2>Alone in my apartment. And I was thinking, this was, you know,</v>

371
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.920
back when I lived in New York and I was like, I'm not doing this again.

372
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.840
This is one day. I'd rather,

373
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.880
I'd rather be in searing pain and have my senses than to be stupid.

374
00:22:50.881 --> 00:22:55.140
I felt so dumb. Dumb, dumb, uh, yeah,

375
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:56.303
at the same.

376
00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.320
<v 5>Me, I'm not.</v>

377
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.710
<v 2>In to escape. I don't want to escape. I want to dig deep. Not that bad. Yeah.</v>

378
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.730
I'd rather just feel the pain. I'm not looking for that bad. It's a sensation.

379
00:23:05.731 --> 00:23:07.860
It's a terrible sensation. But I know what it is.

380
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.190
This is letting me know that there's a problem. And we'll fix that problem.

381
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:11.940
Actually.

382
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.360
<v 0>I don't like the look that comes with being high. Yeah.</v>

383
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.340
Like when I see what people look like that I don't like that. Look

384
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.670
[inaudible] no, that's, that's, I'm talking about this here.

385
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.180
That when you don't know what you hear, you,

386
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.260
you don't know what's going on with your hands. I don't like that.

387
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.200
I don't want to look. I don't want to look like that. Is.

388
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.030
<v 2>There struggled to find time like to manage the time between work</v>

389
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.100
and family relationships after.

390
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.530
<v 0>That accident? No.</v>

391
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.720
I know that I an accident accident was the best eye opening

392
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.780
experience ever. You know what I mean? It it's,

393
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.790
I was married to my career, dating my family.

394
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.690
Hmm. Right. Like, um, um,

395
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.800
I'm all about this work and all about this hustle. Granted,

396
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.380
there's nothing wrong with that. It's a good thing.

397
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.680
But after a certain point,

398
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.780
you gotta prioritize accordingly. Yeah.

399
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.530
When you get to a certain point where the decisions that can be made are a

400
00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:23.170
little more controlled and you have the,

401
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.350
to maneuver differently because of the success that you've obtained,

402
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.110
make those adjustments and make those adjustments. I was still hustle, hustle,

403
00:24:32.111 --> 00:24:35.800
hustle, granted. Great dad. Um, we're doing stuff. I'm home.

404
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.030
I'm getting back home,

405
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.220
but my in and outs three days and I'm out two days,

406
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:44.080
three days, I'm out. I gotta go film the movie.

407
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.800
Y'all come down for the weekends. All right. I see you guys. We'll eat dinner.

408
00:24:47.801 --> 00:24:50.490
We'll do stuff. And it's great. Crammed it all in. All right.

409
00:24:50.491 --> 00:24:53.770
Y'all got to go on working and it's not bad,

410
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.830
but now, all right.

411
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.330
I'll film a movie after I'm done filming a movie while I got,

412
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.920
I need to take 30 days is off. I need to take 40 days off.

413
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.630
I should remain a fam. Now a you go tour.

414
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.370
It was just bough year and a half. We out four days out of the week.

415
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.400
I'm out year and a half. I got to get it. Well,

416
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.630
now let's go a month and a half. I stopped for three weeks.

417
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.310
I'm with the fam. So I still have three days a week that I was here.

418
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.610
But then I'm a stop for three weeks. This dedicated time.

419
00:25:30.611 --> 00:25:34.060
Don't nobody do anything with me or talk to me. I'm um,

420
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.640
I'm home now,

421
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.970
my office hours in that office,

422
00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:44.950
when we open office open at nine I'm there eight, you know,

423
00:25:44.951 --> 00:25:48.550
there's a chance that I may be in that office till six.

424
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.100
Now, yo, no matter what guys that Dan office has to in at like three,

425
00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.630
I gotta be home for dinner. I got dinner with the fam.

426
00:25:58.631 --> 00:26:01.090
My priorities have changed,

427
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.350
but it brings me back to the decisions that you're now

428
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.360
able to make based off of life's

429
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.540
circumstances, life's lessons.

430
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.880
So because of all of the that I went through,

431
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.310
because of the things that I now got to see because of that hospital room and

432
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:25.810
those four walls and me seeing my family and what that love did for me and to

433
00:26:25.811 --> 00:26:29.560
me, or I'll be damned if I look past that,

434
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:35.470
I'll be damned if I not do what I'm supposed to do and give that the same amount

435
00:26:35.471 --> 00:26:39.970
of attention in return because my eyes got open. Is that why that happened?

436
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.070
What are you saying to me? Was that supposed? What,

437
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.990
okay, I'm going to assume. I'm going to assume.

438
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.820
And I'm going to look at the signs that are clearly being given and I'm going to

439
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:56.970
try my best to do my part. I'm going to try my best to grow.

440
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:02.970
So my time now is, is so valuable.

441
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.940
But the priority within my time are making sure that the people

442
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:13.890
that I love and that love me have some time when it's all said

443
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:16.800
and done, I want to know that I made those adjustments.

444
00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:20.220
I want to know that I did my part. You achieve that balance.

445
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.980
<v 1>Absolutely. Yeah, but it was learned. It.</v>

446
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.810
<v 0>Was learned. Now this is information. Yes. It's information.</v>

447
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:32.820
And there's one side of information that I had, which was go get it. I'm out.

448
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.050
I'm out. I got to go get it. I ain't got time to stay in there, man. It's to do,

449
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.490
which I still do. Do, I don't want to make it seem like that isn't in me,

450
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.360
but there's a balance. There's now a balance. That's.

451
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.590
<v 2>The trickiest in life. Yeah. It's to find that balance, find a balance,</v>

452
00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:54.790
not just be a Savage out there, grinding and attacking all day.

453
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.150
But to have that balance and appreciate, especially appreciate family, right?

454
00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.370
<v 0>It's it's, it's something that I've,</v>

455
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.490
that I've had to learn and that I'm still learning.

456
00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.180
It's not something that I've knocked out the park completely yet because it's a

457
00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:11.050
growing, it's a living. Yeah. You just,

458
00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.890
you gotta just keep being a sponge and being willing to

459
00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.800
grow. Okay.
