00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 2>I was watching that documentary on one of my flights recently about the, uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.040
the Chinese exclusion act.

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.080
I've seen that document what's that there was this whole act in the, uh, they,

5
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:14.960
they were showing about like the first Chinese guy that came to America.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.200
And I think it was in the, uh, 17 hundreds. He came over,

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.030
then he proved to be a good worker. And eventually by the 18 hundreds,

8
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:28.110
there was like 60,000 Chinese people. And then for some reason,

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.470
America had a problem with them and they, they had this exclusion act too.

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.830
Um, they'd even allowed black people to be free and black people to vote,

11
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.670
but the Chinese were considered less than human couldn't.

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.300
This is the 18 hundreds. So this when.

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.940
<v 0>1882. Yeah. So this, when they were working on the railroads.</v>

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.860
<v 1>Lot, yeah. Then they let them come in and work on the railroad,</v>

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.460
but they wouldn't allow them become citizens.

16
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.900
<v 0>Bro. You ever see photos of Chinese people working on the railroads.</v>

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.020
They're some of the bleakest photos.

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.980
<v 1>And they all had their hair back.</v>

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.780
Like their foreheads were huge for some of their way they would pull their hair

20
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:00.130
back.

21
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.010
<v 0>They probably didn't want their hair to get stuck on the.</v>

22
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.130
<v 1>Track. That sounds about right. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.970
<v 0>Imagine train comes by and catches you by the hair.</v>

24
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.890
<v 1>Oh yeah. They, they, uh, they used them pretty badly.</v>

25
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.410
<v 0>It's a horrific story. It's but the, the photos, we, I was watching that, uh,</v>

26
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.050
Hulu, uh docu-series Sasquatch and, uh,

27
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.210
it was talking a lot about, you know,

28
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.240
like the people that they used to to make the railroads and

29
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.120
to, to, uh, mine and the people that, that used to, uh,

30
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.960
chop to cut down the trees up in the Pacific Northwest and uh, up in,

31
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.480
uh, yeah, Northern California. Yeah. With the, yeah.

32
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:38.680
There's these photos that they,

33
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.430
they showed of these Chinese folks that were working on those railroads.

34
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:45.390
And it's so depressing, man. Yeah.

35
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.223
<v 1>They were treated like.</v>

36
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.150
<v 0>And there's just no hope you're not getting outta that.</v>

37
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:53.470
There's no upward mobility. There's no nothing. There's no future. Yeah.

38
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:54.510
There's uh, no promise.

39
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.350
<v 1>Yeah. And then they weren't allowing them to become us citizens,</v>

40
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.790
even if they were born here, you know.

41
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.750
<v 0>It's crazy. Even today, like in Harvard,</v>

42
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.020
it's were difficult for Asian people to get in than anybody else. Really. Yeah.

43
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.340
There's a lawsuit about it right now. Yeah.

44
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.620
Apparently they have so many Asian folks that, uh,

45
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:19.420
were getting into Harvard that they decided to specifically tailor

46
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:24.170
their tests to make it more difficult or their requirements or what they a uh,

47
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.090
what they, what, see, I don't wanna this up because, uh,

48
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:31.850
Andrew Yang's people were the ones who were talking to me about it.

49
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.810
One of the guys who came last time when Andrew Yang was here, nice guy,

50
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:35.400
that Andrew Yang.

51
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.233
<v 1>He's a great guy.</v>

52
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.210
<v 0>Yeah. He's.</v>

53
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.090
<v 1>A great guy. I hope he runs again.</v>

54
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.010
<v 0>Well, he is gonna run for mayor of, um, of New York city.</v>

55
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:47.040
He's running right now. And Tim and this other gentleman who was, uh,

56
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.520
I forget what he did, but this other guy carries a gun.

57
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.720
And he's talking about like ramping up police presence. And, uh,

58
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.000
he's a black guy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

59
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.320
and a lot of people are behind him and they think like,

60
00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:02.920
this is what we need to turn the city around.

61
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.600
Like they need to respect law and order. Right.

62
00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:07.480
And they need to do something about the crime.

63
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.120
And there's a shooting spree in times square. There they.

64
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.000
<v 1>A four year old got shot. A woman in her daughter. It's crazy.</v>

65
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.160
<v 0>So here it is. Yeah. America's kills court rules.</v>

66
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:19.790
Harvard doesn't discriminate against Asian American applicants. Oh, okay.

67
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.950
So this is federal appeals court in Boston is ruled Harvard doesn't

68
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.590
intentionally discriminate against Asian American applicants.

69
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.270
What is the argument? Cuz the,

70
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.750
there was a lot of Asian people that were insisting that that was the case said

71
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.470
the statistical evidence did not show that Harvard intentionally discriminated

72
00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:40.700
against Asian Americans student for fair admissions and advocacy

73
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.260
advocacy group. Uh,

74
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:48.100
first file its lawsuit in 2014 saying it's Harvard that Harvard's raced based

75
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.740
considerations for applicants discriminated against Asian American students in

76
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:54.380
process today's decision. Once again,

77
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.100
finds that Harvard's admission policies were consistent with Supreme court,

78
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.130
pres Supreme court and lawfully appropriately pursue Harvard's efforts to create

79
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.490
a diverse campus that promotes learning and encourages mutual respect and

80
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:10.850
understanding our community. It was like, what is the argument though?

81
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.290
Opponents for ending race based considerations at us,

82
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.730
universities were unfazed by Thursday decision to plan to bring the case to the

83
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:21.480
Supreme court. So what does it say? What is the question? Okay.

84
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:25.800
The question of how much race should be a factor in college applications is a

85
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.720
hotly contested.

86
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.720
One president Trump's administration has challenged college on using race in

87
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.080
admission policies, claiming such practices violate federal law. Last month,

88
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.320
the department of justice filed a lawsuit against Yale university saying it's

89
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.230
Paul violate the civil rights act of 1964.

90
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.750
Yale has said the lawsuit is baseless.

91
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.470
What is school's admissions rules though? That's what I'm confused with.

92
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.550
<v 1>Well, so does that mean, uh, external Chinese people or Chinese Americans?</v>

93
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.110
<v 0>Um, I think, I, I just think just Asian period. Well, when they do race,</v>

94
00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:03.340
they don't, they don't only want African Americans.

95
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.540
<v 1>I mean, I'm Asian, you know what I mean? Right. So, I mean, it's vague, right.</v>

96
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.260
But I mean, I could understand you're.

97
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.780
<v 0>Can you're Canadian. It cancels everything out. It's true. It's true. Uh,</v>

98
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:16.140
what is the race-based admission policy though?

99
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:20.300
That makes them say that they discriminated? Does it say,

100
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.410
see if you can find, oh, look, they've tried to pop up a, your.

101
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.930
See if you can find what the argument is that Harvard does

102
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:34.370
discriminate against Asians. But these guys that were with Andrew Yang, uh,

103
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.690
they believed pretty strongly that that's what Harvard was doing.

104
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.291
<v 1>I mean, you know,</v>

105
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:42.800
there's a lot of those admissions tests that are raced racial biased,

106
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.000
according to how you grew up and what you know, you know,

107
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.840
so I think what they tried to do is make it the person who wrote the test or

108
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.440
whatever wrote it from their perspective, we need.

109
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.960
<v 0>To fix society so that you never have to think about that at all. You know,</v>

110
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.473
oh, here it goes

111
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.000
in the lawsuit plaintiffs claim that Harvard imposes a soft racial quota,

112
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.080
which keeps the number of Asian Americans artificially low.

113
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.560
The low percentage of Asians admitted to Harvard plaintiffs may maintained a

114
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:19.310
suspiciously similar year after or despite dramatic increases in the number of

115
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:22.430
Asian American applicants and the size of the am, uh,

116
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.310
Asian American population during the lawsuit,

117
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.190
the plaintiffs gained access to Harvard's individualized admission files from

118
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:33.670
2014 to 19 and aggregate data from 2000 to

119
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:34.504
2019.

120
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.260
The plaintiffs also interviewed and deposed numerous Harvard officials from

121
00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:38.840
those sources,

122
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.660
the plaintiffs revealed that Harvard emissions officers consistently rated Asian

123
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.620
American applicants as a group lower than others on traits

124
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.140
like positive personality, likability, courage, wow.

125
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.250
Kindness, and being widely respected the.

126
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.610
Just think about what that says. They,

127
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.770
they rate you on positive personality,

128
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.330
like ability, courage, kindness,

129
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.410
and being widely respected. Those are so vague.

130
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.410
<v 1>Well, I mean, you know, different,</v>

131
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.360
different nationalities have different personalities, you know,

132
00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:20.760
different races have different ways of dealing with things.

133
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.560
And what may be considered offensive to one is not to the other, you know, or,

134
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.040
or likable to me is not likable to.

135
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.873
<v 0>You for sure.</v>

136
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.600
But look at it says here Asian-American scored higher than applicants of any

137
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:36.440
other racial or ethnic group on other admissions measures,

138
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.990
like test scores, gray and extracurricular activities.

139
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.350
But the student's personal rating significantly dragged down their admissions

140
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:49.870
chances. Wow. That's weird, man. That's I mean,

141
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.190
I guess you would have to talk to someone from Harvard and get them drunk and

142
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:58.830
say, what's really going on. Why do you have this likability, courage, kindness,

143
00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:01.980
and be wildly respect. And what is a positive personality?

144
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.980
You have to be positive. What if you're like, God, I suck,

145
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.860
but you work really hard. Like that's a negative personality, but yeah.

146
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.540
You know, like you're, maybe you have a negative opinion of yourself,

147
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.180
but you work really.

148
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:12.790
<v 1>Hard.</v>

149
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.020
Maybe that's why you work hard because you don't think of yourself for a it's.

150
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.420
<v 0>Weird man. Harvard's admission staff testified.</v>

151
00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:23.170
They did not believe that different racial groups have better personal qualities

152
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:25.050
than others. But nevertheless,

153
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.290
Asian applicants as a racial group receive consistently weaker personal scores

154
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.370
over the period surveyed and Harvard admissions officers rated Asian Americans

155
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:39.290
with the worst personal qualities of any racial group. Wow.

156
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.080
African Americans on the other hand consistently scored the lo the lowest on

157
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.600
academic rating, but the highest on the personal rating, you know,

158
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:53.160
what personal rating that like makes me think about like that whole,

159
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.040
the, the Chinese social score system. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.240
I don't about that. I don't like that. That's a very weird thing.
