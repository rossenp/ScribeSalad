00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.280
<v 2>There's no part of the mainstream that looks at all credible to me anymore.</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.360
<v 1>Well, it's real wacky now, right? And here's a,</v>

4
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:14.360
here's a wacky one where the New York times, um, is they, the,

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.960
their debunking,

6
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.030
this idea that the Wuhan lab may have been the source of

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.390
COVID when they're like, when all these different people are talking about it,

8
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.750
we've been on this for forever. We have been on it forever.

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.510
What it's it's extraordinary is the,

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.070
the New York times is still saying debunked claims with

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.230
no evidence whatsoever, you know,

12
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.950
saga and jet from the rising in the hill had this whole piece about it on his,

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.940
I love what they're doing. They're the best. They're the.

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.380
<v 0>Best got two channels. Have you been on either?</v>

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.540
<v 1>Well, I've, I've only had him on here and crystal together, but what I.</v>

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.060
<v 0>Like about, but that was what you guys did right. At the beginning of that,</v>

17
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:56.220
where they explained what happens. I didn't mean to cut you off that's okay. Um,

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.940
what happens in the cycle when your team wins and your team loses and how,

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.490
but they've both broken out of that and they're on that away. Yes.

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.290
That was there. What we, that was 10 minutes. Yeah.

21
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:06.930
That I needed to hear that you,

22
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.010
I thought you broke new three of you guys broke really new ground.

23
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:10.770
They're what we.

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.603
<v 1>Need. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.570
There's a reasonable person on the left and a reasonable person on the right.

26
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.850
And they're both committed to honesty above. All right.

27
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:20.330
They might have different philosophical.

28
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.120
<v 0>Spective, crystals towards saga because she's seeing yes.</v>

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.400
The rot on the left. Yes. What my hope is is that she's going to be,

30
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.553
um,

31
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.840
a credible progressive who's rejecting all this nonsense progressivism.

32
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.320
<v 1>Yeah. I think, I think you're right. She's very smart.</v>

33
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.280
And so is he and the two of 'em together. Wonderful.

34
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.480
What were you gonna say before I cut off? What I was gonna say,

35
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.550
say is they were talking about how the New York times is,

36
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.710
is talking about this de I forget who they were quoting, who, who was, uh,

37
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.670
entertaining this idea red, is that what the CDX CDC guy that's right.

38
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:59.270
The CDC guy that he was, uh, entertaining this idea, this, uh,

39
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.860
this debunked idea of this from a lab, but it's not debunked.

40
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.500
Not only is it not debunked, it's more possible than ever.

41
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:11.940
But the problem is the idea was originally associated with Donald Trump.

42
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.740
So these at the New York times still have it in their head that they can't

43
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.500
admit.

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.420
<v 0>I don't know that that's, what's going on general. What do you think it is?</v>

45
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.980
Well, that what they, do's a weird move.

46
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.090
<v 1>We should tell people exactly what it, what they're saying. Okay. The, the,</v>

47
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.970
the former head of the CDC is saying that it's more probable

48
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.490
than not. He's not saying it's absolute.

49
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.930
He's saying it's more probable than not that it escaped from a lab. Right.

50
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.970
And he details it. And he actually predates it. He goes pre uh, you know,

51
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:45.520
he goes like deep into, in October.

52
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.720
He believes it might have emanated around that time started spreading. They,

53
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.160
the reason why is, and it all makes total sense. This is an, a,

54
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.720
a very unusual laboratory.

55
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.800
The laboratory had been cited in 2018 for safety protocol violations.

56
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.600
The laboratory works on the exact same kinds of

57
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.840
coronaviruses that cause this worldwide prep pandemic on bats,

58
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:10.880
they work on bat. Yep.

59
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.960
Coronaviruses and this is one of two level four labs that are in this area.

60
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.841
So this,

61
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.710
this whole thing is so it's so much more likely that it emanated from the lab.

62
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.910
But the problem is the,

63
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.630
the narrative was Donald Trump is racist. Donald Trump calls it,

64
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.590
the China virus. Donald Trump says it came from a lab.

65
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190
It can't have come from a lab. Cause Donald Trump's always wrong.

66
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.910
<v 0>That's one possibility. I'm worried about something beyond that.</v>

67
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.963
What are you worried about?

68
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.100
The way that they make this move is that they anonymize the lab leak

69
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.260
hypothesis with a synthetic virus engineered from scratch.

70
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.780
So in other words, the idea of like maybe somebody growing, uh,

71
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.380
horseshoe back coronavirus in human lung tissue to Excel,

72
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.050
accelerate natural selection. Cause like, we don't know how to engineer it,

73
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:04.850
but if you let, if you let natural selection engineer it,

74
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.690
you can accelerate that. Right. So instead of saying, um,

75
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.930
we don't know what to make of accelerated natural selection in a lab leaking.

76
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.610
They try to make this move, which is like, you know,

77
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:21.880
there's no sign that this was engineered in a lab. And you're like, okay,

78
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.560
well you changed what the hypothesis is in order to say what you're saying to

79
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.960
protect your future credibility.

80
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.040
And the thing that I'm really freaking out about, you've been talking about it.

81
00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:31.761
Brett's been talking about,

82
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:34.400
I've been talking about all sorts of people have been talking about this one for

83
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:35.234
a year.

84
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.360
I increasingly think that none of these organizations think that they owe us

85
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.470
kind of truth, that when they get caught, it's just like, yeah,

86
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:47.990
of course we had to say that, like what? Yeah. You know,

87
00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:51.910
like this time magazine article about, of course we fortified the election,

88
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.670
you, you what? Oh yeah, we fortified it. Oh, I,

89
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.430
Trump was right about a conspiracy, like in.

90
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.380
<v 1>The article quoting that, who were they quoting? That said they,</v>

91
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.573
they fortified the.

92
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.030
<v 0>Election.</v>

93
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.780
There was apparently some entire group under one guy with hundreds of

94
00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:13.620
activists who told their people don't riot in the streets have a dance

95
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:18.540
party. Instead I would highly recommend time magazine.

96
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.860
I read the, I.

97
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.210
<v 1>Read the, the, the blurb about the fortifying and I was like, Hmm. Yeah,</v>

98
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:27.570
that's a disturbing quote. But what does it mean? What do, what are they trying.

99
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.890
<v 0>To what they mean, what their, the claim of the article is.</v>

100
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.170
We went right up to the door, Medling with the election,

101
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.450
but all we cared about was free and fair. And we had a huge conspiracy.

102
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.160
So Donald Trump wasn't wrong. There was a huge conspiracy,

103
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.480
but we are so committed to democracy that even though we hate Donald Trump with

104
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.200
the passion that, you know, won't let go 24 7, uh,

105
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.200
we still would never do anything against an election.

106
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.360
<v 1>The problem is with a guy like Trump, you can almost justify some that's.</v>

107
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.353
I.

108
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.080
<v 0>If you claim that you're, you have to fight all enemies, foreign and domestic,</v>

109
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.920
and you claim that he's a Russian asset.

110
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.800
You're pretty much saying that you have to do something drastic. Yeah.

111
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.400
And so the number of things that people claim is what the problem is because

112
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:15.360
they're not all compatible and,

113
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.190
and what I'm trying to get it more broadly is over and over.

114
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.230
I see the same move, which is deny, deny, deny we get caught. Yeah.

115
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.430
Limited hangout. Yeah, we did that.

116
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.430
That's the kind of stuff we do because we have to do it. But I don't.

117
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.830
<v 1>Think they're saying they got caught.</v>

118
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.670
I think they're saying that what we did was make sure the election was fair.

119
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.523
It was.

120
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.620
<v 0>I think the concept of a limited did hang out where you know,</v>

121
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:40.740
that something is too big to hold back.

122
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.460
So you push a part of it into the public. Not all of it. That's the limited.

123
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.900
And you let the public think, okay,

124
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:48.940
well now you know the truth and it stops there.

125
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.980
And then they stop asking questions because they've got a new toy to play with.
