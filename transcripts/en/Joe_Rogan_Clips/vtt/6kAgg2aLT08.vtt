WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.200
<v 0>Bit, and, and I know from the, uh, tank, from the isolation tank,</v>

2
00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:06.640
that it's a great way of absorbing magnesium through the eepsso salts. Oh.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 1>Into your muscle. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.920
<v 0>Hmm. Through your, through your skin. Hmm. You know,</v>

5
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:11.880
because eepssom salt is so high in magnesium.

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.143
<v 1>Yeah. Right.</v>

7
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.240
<v 0>And the tank is a thousand pounds of eepssom salts. Isn't it? That's.</v>

8
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.910
<v 1>Crazy to make your skin like nice when you do it smooth.</v>

9
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.950
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;. Yeah. Yeah. It just feels good too. But it's a,</v>

10
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.390
it feels really the tank. Have you done it yet?

11
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.390
<v 1>I did it once, um, in San Francisco. And.</v>

12
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.430
<v 0>You could do it anytime you want, if you wanna come here. It really, yeah.</v>

13
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.070
<v 1>You guys were it't. I think it was really something wasn't right.</v>

14
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.340
Because I could feel like the temperature of the water was off, was all off.

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.060
And I, I did enjoy what I, what, I mean, it was nice.

16
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.260
So at first I got in and they had some music playing music and then the music

17
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.660
went away. Oh. To sort of.

18
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.740
<v 0>Relax you at first.</v>

19
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.220
<v 1>Yeah. Um, but uh, I did, I was like,</v>

20
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.860
sort of in my head a bit, you know, and that, but I didn't,

21
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:01.850
but I kept feeling the water and I thought, I didn't, like,

22
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:03.170
I was like sensory deprived.

23
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.410
<v 0>Are you ever here other than like, when you come down to do the podcast?</v>

24
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.930
<v 1>Um, yeah, I do. I do. I'm coming back in November. Anytime.</v>

25
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.090
<v 0>You're here, just let me know in advance and we'll open it up.</v>

26
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:16.610
And this tank here is the best the float lab,

27
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.610
or if you want to go to the place in Venice,

28
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.530
but the one you can do here is so easy and it's got a shower in there and

29
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:22.360
everything. Yeah. That would be.

30
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.760
<v 1>Cool. And you can, I would like to try it again. Yeah. Time. I mean,</v>

31
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:26.000
there are studies showing, you know,

32
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.600
meditation and all that stuff is really important for mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I

33
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.600
think it's an important, you know, one, one of the, you know,

34
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.440
of many components and like healthy aging, healthy brain aging,

35
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.560
lowering stress and stuff. Um, so I would, I definitely like to.

36
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.280
<v 0>I, I get outta that thing. I feel great. I'll I'll come.</v>

37
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:44.190
Do you do it frequently? Still? Yeah. Yeah. It's right here. You know, so I'll,

38
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:46.310
I'll come down here early in the morning and do it sometimes.

39
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.870
<v 1>How long do you have to stay in there? To really?</v>

40
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.990
<v 0>I I'd like at least an hour, but I really like to do two hours.</v>

41
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.790
Two hours for me is a sweet spot.

42
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.190
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when I come out after two hours, I'm just like,

43
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.110
so chill out relaxed or, yeah, it's almost like during sober October,

44
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:02.350
it's like cheating, cuz you're basically getting high in there.

45
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.820
<v 1>It, are you doing it during sober worked October? Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.260
<v 0>Okay. I mean, it's not, you're not taking in a drug,</v>

47
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.740
but you're so chilled out, you know,

48
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.300
and you do have a weird psychedelic state that you achieve when you're,

49
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.780
it's like a very extreme form of meditation in a lot of ways,

50
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:21.340
because of the fact that you're not feeling your body at all and it's,

51
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.850
you're only experiencing, whatever's going,

52
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.250
it's like your brain detached from all the input of the body.

53
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.370
<v 1>Some of those ex some of those studies that have been done on like longterm</v>

54
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:35.570
meditators or even just people that haven't meditated mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and

55
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:39.250
then they're put in like some like eight week trial of meditation and how those

56
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:42.050
like immediately all these changes in brain activities,

57
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.240
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; start to happen. Yeah. That are, you know,

58
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:48.880
basically in line with good brain aging and improved, you know,

59
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:52.800
all sorts of measure, measures of improved, uh, cognitive function and stuff.

60
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.280
Mm it's super interesting. Yeah. It would be really interesting to see like,

61
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.813
you know, what,

62
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.600
how that differs from meditation's one thing I have a hard time with like I.

63
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.920
<v 0>Real it's well, meditation in conjunction with the tank,</v>

64
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.560
I think is really the key. I,

65
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.440
I think the tank allows you to achieve a state of physical your,

66
00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:14.320
your physical body, not being or not. I,

67
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.760
I, you don't ever completely eliminate the sensory input,

68
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.270
but you diminish it so significantly that that environment is not available

69
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.350
anywhere else on earth, where you're floating. So you don't feel your body,

70
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.870
your water is the, the temperature of your skin.

71
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.830
The air is the same temperature as the water.

72
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.310
And you feel you just flying through infinity you're in total darkness,

73
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.390
total silence. Yeah.

74
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 1>I didn't feel that way. I, I, I mean, I did, it was a little, little relaxed,</v>

75
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:41.820
but I didn't feel like I was like flying through. And.

76
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.540
<v 0>If they have cheaper tanks, that's,</v>

77
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.780
that's part of the problem is some of the tanks. I.

78
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.820
<v 1>Could feel the water the entire time. Yeah. There.</v>

79
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.740
<v 0>It's probably either too cold. Or' too hot.</v>

80
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.700
<v 1>It should be. Do you feel like your brain is like, uh,</v>

81
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.420
in the now when you're doing it, is that something.

82
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.060
<v 0>I feel like my brain is, has way more resource, race,</v>

83
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.410
way more resources available to it. So like,

84
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.090
if you and I were having this conversation and we didn't have the headphones on

85
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.690
and there was a Jack hammer next to us, it would be really distracting.

86
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:11.290
You'd wanna get away from that Jack hammer. Like,

87
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:13.010
let's go talk over here until you'd want,

88
00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:15.050
you'd want to get away as far as you could from,

89
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.650
but everything is a distraction. Like these, this seat on my butt is a,

90
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.880
the shoes on my feet or something. I'm thinking about the watch on my hand,

91
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.120
there's all these different things that are distracting you.

92
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.360
But when you get in that tank, there's none of those things. You're,

93
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.640
you're just, you settle in. And once you settle in,

94
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:37.120
you touch each side so that you can, you know, cuz you get in the waters,

95
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:39.720
like a few whip, ripples and little, little waves,

96
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.630
and then you touch each side. So you calm everything down.

97
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.990
And then I sink into the water and then I take some deep breaths and then I

98
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.470
slowly bring my arms in the middle and then I chill out and I've done it so many

99
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:56.550
times my body goes, okay, here we go again. Like, it's not like, whoa,

100
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:00.270
what is this? This is so weird. I've done it so many times.

101
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.940
My body gets into that state very quickly.

102
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.940
But if I take time off and I do sometimes I'll take weeks or even a month off.

103
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.060
And then it's a little more weird at first like, oh, we're doing this again. Oh,

104
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:13.060
I haven't done this in a while.

105
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.700
But when I do it consistently on a regular basis, two, three times a week,

106
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.900
then I could just sink right into it. I wonder if.

107
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.210
<v 1>It would be any therapeutic benefit to people with like sensory gating</v>

108
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.490
disorders, sensory gating disorders. Yeah. We're you know, in other words,

109
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.210
like you were mentioning all the senses,

110
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:31.530
other sensory things that are happening, you know, there's auditory,

111
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.330
there's smell, there's visual. I mean,

112
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:36.610
these things are our brains inputting it at all times. I mean,

113
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:39.210
there's stuff going on, but we're able to kind of filter it out and like,

114
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.290
you and I are having this conversation,

115
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:41.890
Jamie's been sitting over the whole time and like,

116
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.720
I really haven't paid much attention. I pay attention to &lt;laugh&gt;.

117
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.560
But some people like, particularly schizophrenic people with schizophrenia,

118
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.360
they can't, they don't filter that out. And so right. Like they get overload,

119
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:55.320
like it's like an overload it's called sensory overload.

120
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.160
And so they oftentimes like, can't go into like a room with a lot of people.

121
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.560
They don't wanna like go off and, you know, with, you know,

122
00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:05.680
by themselves or whatever. So I wonder if there's any sort of, uh,

123
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.240
benefit for like doing something like that, where you're, where you're not,

124
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.213
you know,

125
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.600
the sensory inputs kind of like if you could kind of train your brain a little

126
00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:15.000
bit. Mm. I don't know. I.

127
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.030
<v 0>Don't know. I just, I find that for me,</v>

128
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.990
it helps me think way clearer.

129
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.670
Cause I feel like I have more brain available to access.

130
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.510
I feel like if you were trying to say something that was very,

131
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.230
very complicated and you were trying to explain something that required a lot of

132
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:35.550
the resources of your brain. If there was a lot of noise around you,

133
00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:38.220
you wouldn't be able to do it, but there's a lot of noise. You're like,

134
00:06:38.221 --> 00:06:40.660
you want to eat? Let's go eat. And you're like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

135
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.700
some Jack camera. I'm hungry. You want to eat? Yeah, let's go eat.

136
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.780
Like you could be able to communicate something very simple.

137
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.100
But if you were trying to explain the various mechanisms,

138
00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:53.780
of&lt;inaudible&gt; things. Yeah. I should really try this. Yeah. Because I think I,

139
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.380
cause I go.

140
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.420
<v 1>Through like this, I also sometimes use this sauna for that where I'll like,</v>

141
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.210
&lt;affirmative&gt; have something like prepared. I used to actually,

142
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.570
before giving a presentation,

143
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.490
I would go in the sauna and I would go through it in my head. Mm. You know?

144
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:09.770
So it's like, you know, that was something that, that I used to do a lot.

145
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.170
<v 0>Right. Cause the sauna, there's nothing in there. Just you yeah.</v>

146
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:17.490
Sitting there and it gives you that unusual environment of just silence. It.

147
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 1>Really helps. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

148
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.280
So it's kind of interesting that you mentioned that with the.

149
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.040
<v 0>Yeah. That's a step toward, but I think the, the float tank is the ultimate.</v>

150
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.040
And right now there's a really interesting podcast that's available. Um,

151
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.720
I I've talked about this podcast before stuff to blow your mind. They have a,

152
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.270
an episode right now this week that is about John, on Lilly,

153
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.110
who was the psychedelic pioneer who created the, uh, sensory deprivation tank.

154
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.430
And he also is a pioneer in interspecies communication, figured out,

155
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.530
um,

156
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.390
how to communicate with dolphins and did a bunch of weird psychedelic research

157
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:58.990
with dolphins. There it is from the vault, John C Lilly. He, uh, really amazed,

158
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.380
amazing guy who, uh, uh, I mean, if you go,

159
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.980
they go deep into the history of his, his career too,

160
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:11.980
which is just very varied, really strange guy. But I think his,

161
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.820
his great contribution is not just understanding the sentinchent nature

162
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.770
of dolphins and how incredibly complex their life languages and how smart they

163
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:23.930
are. But also the sensory deprivation tank, which I,

164
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.410
I think is it's one of the most underutilized tools for consciousness,

165
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.290
for exploring consciousness and just for relaxation. And for me,

166
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.850
for examining ideas, if I have an idea, like I used to do,

167
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.410
I used to do a lot of jujitsu in there.

168
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.760
Like I would go into the tank and I would removes cuz when you're,

169
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:45.920
when you're completely out, I would, I would drill moves in my head.

170
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.440
Like as if I was doing them, I would like clench hook, roll, talk,

171
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.880
grab sink. I would do all these different things in my head to practicing it.

172
00:08:55.881 --> 00:08:56.960
Yeah. And I would allow,

173
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.800
I would do that to get me to this like relaxation state and I,

174
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.800
or I would go over a joke that I'm struggling with or a comedy bit. I'm like,

175
00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:08.880
what is a better way to say this? How's, what's the best way to get this across.

176
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.080
Now I'm saying it this way, but it's uh,

177
00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:15.550
offensive or it's blunt and it's not the funny, like I'm, I'm,

178
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.870
I'm taking a shortcut maybe I'd about, and then I would go over it in my head.

179
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.670
And then eventually once I would do that,

180
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.670
I would get to this relaxation point where then I could just concentrate only on

181
00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:28.450
breathing.

182
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.030
So after I've like worked out all the things that are bugging me and sometimes

183
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:35.540
it would be like a seminar on my life. I'd get it in there.

184
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.140
And then as soon as I close the tank door and lay down,

185
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.420
I take a few deep breath and then I'd be like, okay, so here's, what's wrong.

186
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.740
face. You're doing too much of this clean your office. You know, how come you,

187
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.660
uh, you only get eight outta 10 things done in your to-do list.

188
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.780
That's bothering you. You know, you need to spend an hour a day just doing this.

189
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.610
And instead of drinking coffee and looking at your phone before you work out,

190
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.770
just work out,

191
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.810
just get in there and get your you're wasting 20 minutes doing that,

192
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.730
that 20 minutes, you could have been done 20 minutes earlier.

193
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.770
And then you wouldn't have to rush over here to do the podcast. And,

194
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.650
and it's like, it starts sort of giving me almost like a subconscious,

195
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.320
uh, renovation, you know, like, just so just sort of like, cuz okay,

196
00:10:20.321 --> 00:10:24.120
like this is this, all this stuff in your subconscious is disturbing you.

197
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.360
And here's why it's disturbing you cuz you've got all this clutter.

198
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.680
So let's clean this up, clean it up, get it together.

199
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.080
And it's been responsible for, I think a lot of my focus and discipline,

200
00:10:35.081 --> 00:10:39.670
like understanding the significance of that focus and discipline.

201
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.630
And it's not just like to be a tough guy or to just go out there and kick.

202
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.310
It's it's more like to, to absolve yourself of brain clutter.

203
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.310
That's.

204
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.590
<v 1>Pretty awesome that introspection you're talking about. Yeah.</v>

205
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.190
I think a lot of people could use more of that, including myself. I mean,

206
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.053
it's certainly.

207
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.580
<v 0>Think all of us, I think all of us,</v>

208
00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:02.820
really anyone listening to this and I think there's probably one in San Diego.

209
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.140
So if there's a tank place in San Diego, reach out to Dr. Rhonda,

210
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:08.500
Patrick &lt;laugh&gt; and uh,

211
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.220
I'm sure that there's a place you could use that's down there. That's.

212
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.420
<v 1>Near you. I mean, I certainly use other things like, uh,</v>

213
00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:16.860
extra running long runs. Sure. Do that. Do something similar in that zone,

214
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.530
the zone. Yeah, just sort of, but uh,

215
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:21.410
what you're describing sounds kind of like next level.

216
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.770
<v 0>A lot of people get it from swimming as well, swimming. Yeah.</v>

217
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:28.450
This's just like kinda repetitive just yeah. That repetitive thing.

218
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.130
And then you're sort of managing the motion of your body and then once you get

219
00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:33.251
in,

220
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:37.130
it's almost like a mantra you're managing the motion of your body and then the

221
00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:39.240
breathing. And then once you, you get it all synced up.

222
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.520
If you're in good enough shape that it's not like a Titanic struggle with every,

223
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.440
every lap or every stroke of your arms,

224
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.400
you can get into this sort of meditative state that a lot of people achieve with

225
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:51.234
running or,

226
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.640
or even with just like sitting there and breathing like a lot of people get.

227
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.040
<v 1>That. Yeah. I have a difficult time doing that, but uh, yeah, it's hard. Yeah.</v>

228
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.360
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; is it it funny that it would be hard to sit still? It is.</v>

229
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.080
<v 1>It is funny. Um, there's actually like the, the,</v>

230
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.680
some of the other interesting stuff is just doing that. Sit there,

231
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.030
sit still and breathe changes like the,

232
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.910
the activation of enzymes and stuff.

233
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.630
Liketamase the enzyme that rebuilds tillamome. Yeah.

234
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.430
It literally activates tilamase so, so fascinating.

235
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:23.470
How just like certain things like,

236
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:28.230
like I wouldn't imagine doing that would actually, you know, changetamerase.

237
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.830
<v 0>Yeah. The body's just never ending puzzle. It really is.</v>

238
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.950
And whenever I talk to you,

239
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.740
you a more and more sort of aware of that because there's so many different

240
00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:39.660
things and so many different mechanisms in,

241
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:43.940
in terms of nutrition and nutritional absorption that I just I'm so ignorant of.

242
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:46.100
And so I hear all these things and I'm like, I'm trying to,

243
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.860
trying to get a map of the territory.

244
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.300
<v 1>I, yeah, I'm also, there's so many things I'm ignorant of as well.</v>

245
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.810
<v 0>But I feel like every time I talk,</v>

246
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.450
it's like someone's breaking out a little napkin and going, yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:01.810
And then you take a right here and you go there and I go, all right.

248
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.890
But it's not a real map. Like the,

249
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.610
the map of the whole thing escapes me. It's too big. It is.

250
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:13.410
It's too big. It's and it's too complex and I'll listen to this podcast again,

251
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.000
like, I'll listen to all the things you, you said again,

252
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:18.640
and I'll try to take notes maybe tomorrow or the next day.

253
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.520
But then my stupid brain will like, it'll like leak half of it'll leak out.

254
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.920
It's like, I'm trying to hold water in my fingers. It's like, I got it.

255
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.760
I've got some water. It's a dripping down my wrists. It's so hard.

256
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.590
It's so hard to get a, a real understanding of this stuff.
