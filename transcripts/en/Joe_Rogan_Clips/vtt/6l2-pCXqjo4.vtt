1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How long have you been teaching this for this class?</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.330
Yeah, such wildness.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.340
<v 1>That's another one. That's a post-tenure. Uh, but it's, um,</v>

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.350
probably been about seven or eight years. Yeah.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.670
<v 0>So how much the, this is a really important question. Like as a professor,</v>

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.000
what is it like pre tenure and post tenure?

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.440
Because it seems to be a night and day difference in terms of freedom and right.

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.570
<v 1>I, I overplay that event.</v>

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.600
<v 0>But everyone does not you everyone, I guess.</v>

10
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.270
<v 1>Yeah. It's a strange, a whole, um, uh, organization,</v>

11
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:39.350
you know, and, and logic, the higher education I'm opposed to tenure.

12
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.230
I think it's. Yeah. Um, absolutely.

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.590
<v 0>Texts, intellectual freedom. No, anyway.</v>

14
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.220
<v 1>I mean, I'm thinking there was a time in which we might make that argument, but,</v>

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.810
um, you know, uh, I don't know who else has tenure, um,

16
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.370
when other professions it's a good question. It's not insane.

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.350
It's like not the real world. And, um.

18
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.080
<v 0>Do you think it's in some ways, um,</v>

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.860
not good because then the,

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.470
almost like you, if the, the intellectual version of being born wealthy,

21
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.700
like you, uh you're you're you have no worries. And so you,

22
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:19.190
you almost become spoiled.

23
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.760
<v 1>Yeah. No, well, yes, absolutely. I mean, you know, there, there,</v>

24
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:26.120
there are arguments that after, um,

25
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.620
some faculty get tenure or they shut down or they really aren't doing as much

26
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.740
research anymore and there isn't that drive. Right. I mean,

27
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.690
it's a whole tiered system, so you move,

28
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:40.100
you get tenure when you move from assistant to associate professor and then,

29
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.540
you know, what you want to get to is full professor. Right. Right. And again,

30
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.100
that's the sort of that, just a different, um, um, place in the hierarchy. Yeah.

31
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.850
<v 0>And what is that again? It's all the papers. You write books, you publish.</v>

32
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.690
<v 1>I mean, yeah, my humanities, it's getting a couple books out there.</v>

33
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.710
Um, but, but yeah, I mean, I,

34
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.660
I can't deny that I felt much freer

35
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.370
after I got, uh, after I, uh, got tenure to, uh,

36
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.380
explore, um, topics that I would be more hesitant to explore.

37
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.810
<v 0>Which topics in particular drugs, drugs.</v>

38
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.250
<v 1>For sure. Drugs. Um, as, again, as a, as a, as a research area, full,</v>

39
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.290
full force, you know, kind of go into it again, because there's a,

40
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.270
um, legitimate purpose to, um, a scholarly study of,

41
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.870
of the connections between religion and drugs. It's, uh,

42
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.430
luckily I'm not the only one who was pursuing this, but, um, but it's,

43
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.250
it's, uh, I, I believe, um,

44
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.510
there are a lot of interesting connections that haven't been made,

45
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.440
especially in, in contemporary American society. The other,

46
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.240
the other drug that I'm particularly interested in and seems to, um,

47
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.790
get a lot of response is that I also include pharmaceuticals and

48
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.620
prescription psychoactive drugs as a part of the drugs and

49
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.470
religion connection. And, um,

50
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.850
so looking at the pharmaceutical industry and pills is, um,

51
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.830
sort of religious objects and structures and cultures really,

52
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.320
uh, how so? Well, um.

53
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.420
<v 0>Like anti-anxiety medication.</v>

54
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.200
<v 1>Or, yeah, I mean, that is just a kind of, you know, it's ritualized.</v>

55
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:28.930
So you put it, you know, you, you've got to make sure, you know,

56
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:31.240
you take it and take it when you're supposed to take it.

57
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.040
You put faith in this little magic pill that is effective and can,

58
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.030
um, bring you to a better place. Um,

59
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.620
it has importance in terms of community and who you are

60
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:48.100
connected with and how the drug allows you to,

61
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.980
to have certain kinds of community. Um,

62
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.370
so a lot of this is obviously kind of a message.

63
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.160
Do you see the messages in pharmaceutical commercials,

64
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.450
which are for me dripping with kind of religious sentiments and sensibilities,

65
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.410
you can be saved, you know, where you saved you're well,

66
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.840
you're saved with a pill.

67
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.330
<v 0>So this is a subject in particular that like pre-tenure would be,</v>

68
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:13.950
you'd have to be walking on eggshells.

69
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.650
<v 1>Um, again, drugs more generally. I would, I would, I w yeah,</v>

70
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:24.630
I would not be necessarily going there, but, you know, I mean, I'm not sure.

71
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.860
<v 0>Do other professors share your perspective on tenure that that's kind of</v>

72
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:32.430
nonsense, um, or? I should say.

73
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.010
<v 1>I would say, um, yeah, there are some, but, um, I honestly enjoy it though.</v>

74
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.700
I think most people would like to keep it and think it serves some function in

75
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:45.720
terms of, as you're saying, sort of, um, sort of legit legitimacy of,

76
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:46.554
of academic.

77
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.200
<v 0>Some people are internally motivated.</v>

78
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.460
Some people are motivated just by, um, whatever drives them,

79
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.010
but whatever intellectual curiosity, they're their goals, whatever it is,

80
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.320
it has nothing to do with, um,

81
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.550
financial stability or job stability, but not, not,

82
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.460
not most. Yeah. Most people,

83
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.350
if you give them 100% job security, they're going to get fat.

84
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.890
<v 1>Yeah. I'm afraid. I, uh,</v>

85
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.390
I would agree. Absolutely. It's weird. And, and you're right.

86
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:25.710
Some people are just, um, you know, just motivated. They want to succeed and,

87
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.390
and pursue, um, their interests sort of,

88
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:35.200
no matter what. Um, and, and there are certainly a number of,

89
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.580
of scholars who are like, that sure would make their way to the top.

90
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.600
<v 0>Path is what interests them. Right. The, the, the, the destination.</v>

91
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.880
<v 1>Right, exactly. I think that's exactly right. And, um, you know,</v>

92
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.660
but as I sort of joked earlier, I joke that I, you know,

93
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.260
this is called a work and I don't feel I really work. Right. I have a great,

94
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:58.040
great job. I just, I love I do well, you nailed.

95
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.740
<v 0>It. Right. You figured out what actually interests you.</v>

96
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.060
And for some people that what you do would be work, but not for you.

97
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.630
<v 1>Well, right. Exactly. I mean, again,</v>

98
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.200
I'm very fortunate that especially being at Emory, um,

99
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.910
so it's, it's a different kind of, um, professional life that I, again,

100
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.780
it's just, I've been really fortunate and, uh, it wasn't planned, you know,

101
00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:23.620
I was a up. And, uh, as I write about in this new book, you know,

102
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.480
don't think about death, which is a memoir on mortality. Um,

103
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.460
I was directionless and just around at high school and getting high and

104
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.860
taking all kinds of drugs. How dare you. Yeah.

105
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.110
Can you believe that in the San Fernando Valley.

106
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.030
<v 0>That's weird. You were doing that in the San Fernando Valley. No one does that.</v>

107
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.550
<v 1>No, you must have been a rebel. Yeah. Right.</v>

108
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.550
Conformity, but, Oh my God, what part of the Valley did you live in? Van Nuys.

109
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.240
Oh.

110
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.040
<v 0>Okay. Our old studio was in Woodland Hills.</v>

111
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.910
<v 1>Right. And, and, and on one of your guys grew up in the Valley,</v>

112
00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.773
so I got shorter.

113
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.780
<v 0>Yeah. Was fun. I used to work out in van Nuys. It's where the Benny,</v>

114
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:05.830
the jets jet center was. Oh, right, right. No, that was funny. Well, famous.

115
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:09.280
Kickbox one of the first places I came to when I came to California,

116
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.580
couldn't wait to go to the Jetstar because you had heard about it. Oh my God.

117
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:16.420
It was legendary. Benny Markita is like a legendary kickboxer, uh,

118
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.020
in the early days of kickboxing. And he came out of Los Angeles.

119
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.730
<v 1>Yeah. It's so funny.</v>

120
00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:24.970
How many people come out of San Fernando Valley are connected? I mean,

121
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.380
that's like, it's not that funny. Well, a lot of people out there. Yeah. Well,

122
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.790
but in any case, I was, uh, I was on a different path and luckily came around.

123
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.460
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

124
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.610
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

125
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:45.010
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

126
00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:48.730
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

127
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.720
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

128
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.550
That's all we're asking you just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.

129
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:01.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>
