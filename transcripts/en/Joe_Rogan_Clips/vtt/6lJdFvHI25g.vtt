00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.260
when he said, yay. Yeah, I think it could be there. What does that mean?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.650
Are you coming or not? I think so. Like the things like you.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.640

7
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.490
He was driving to know wherever the was he driving? Where is it?

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.720
<v 0>The driving. If he's not doing a podcast today, he doesn't have to do.</v>

9
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.150
And I don't think he's doing a podcast today. Right? He's got.

10
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.110
<v 1>How many podcasts does he have now? 1, 2 80 podcasts.</v>

11
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.010
There was a time where we had lost a lot. We had, we had like a lot and like,

12
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.590
one of them was like the intellectual one. And I was like, Hey man,

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.670
drop that one.

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.410
<v 0>Yeah. What'd they call it, um, mixed mental arts.</v>

15
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.420
<v 1>Dude, mixed mental arts.</v>

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.390
How many episodes? However many episodes or where they were. That was that many,

17
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.180
too many, too many. That many too many conversations weren't.

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.140
<v 0>Bad. But the title.</v>

19
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.720
<v 1>Had to go. I don't know. I never, I never listened possible. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.700
<v 0>Impossible. You can't do mixed mental. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.060
Something like that. It might've been worse than that. I might be blacking out.

22
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.923
I think.

23
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.833
<v 1>That's over.</v>

24
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.380
<v 0>He's the only guy I know with the TV show, that's hoping it gets.</v>

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.200
<v 1>Canceled so funny. He's like, I can't do this.</v>

26
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.120
<v 0>I don't want to do this anymore. I'm like I told.</v>

27
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.390
<v 1>You,</v>

28
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.280
he sent me a video of a few weeks ago and he was like work my whole life as an

29
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:35.611
actor.

30
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:40.140
He had on like a iron man thing and had like a thing that was blinking because

31
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.500
he was dressed for the scene. And he was like, this is my life man.

32
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.150
And it was a raw, let me see if I got finally, he was like, Hey.

33
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.580
<v 0>It's so boring. He goes, the people are great. I love working with these people.</v>

34
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:57.720
Thing is so boring and it takes so much time. I'd rather just to stand up.

35
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.520
<v 1>The thing is, is just here. It is. Do you have it? Your airdrop on?</v>

36
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:07.170
I can send it to you so you can play it. Who knows what he says?

37
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:10.320
If it's okay. We can cut it out if it's bad.

38
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.300
<v 0>Well, is he saying something bad? And I don't think.</v>

39
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.150
<v 1>He gets in trouble for it. I don't think so. Um,</v>

40
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.210

49
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.710
And a few of them had never seen me do stand up.

50
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.260
And we were at dinner and I was like, I gotta leave guys. I gotta,

51
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.570
I gotta set at the comedy at the comedy store. And they were like, oh,

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.800
I gotta get there early because I, you know, I don't wanna be late for the spot.

54
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:01.510
But as long as you get there by whatever, nine 30, come on by. And they're like,

60
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.520
So I get on stage, do my set. And I'm like, oh, it's cool. My friends are here,

61
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.540
you know, get off stage. And I say, Hey, what'd you see my friends?

62
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.280
And they said they never came. And I said, what? So I called will Sasso.

63
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.860
And I was like, Hey, will, did you guys come? And he was like, Brian said,

64
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.230
you were going to the improv instead. And I said, what?

65
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.900
<v 0>And I called his he's at the improv.</v>

66
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.350
<v 1>So, you know, Brian. So that's how I know you're good friends with Brian.</v>

67
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.570
So I called Brian and I'm. I'm like, these wanted to,

68
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.970
why would you do this? They wanted to see me. They'd never seen me do stand up.

69
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.550
Like, it's fun for me. Like, it's fun for me to do it for them.

70
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.910
It's fun for them to see. And I call Brian, I'm ready to get heated at them.

71
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.000
Just be like, what? Cause this had to set at the improv. Ain't even mention.

72
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.560
He probably forgot. And they were like, where are you? He's like,

73
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:59.740
come on to the improv. Right? So he stole the time from me. Right.

74
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.710
So I call him and I'm heated. I'm going to yell at him. Right.

75
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.820
And he picks up the phone and before I can even talk, he says,

76
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.890
you ruined the night. And I said, what?

77
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.330
And he said, we're at, we're at the improv to come on over. And I was like, you.

78
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.550
And he was like, nah, they don't want to watch you. They're going to watch me.

79
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.460
I had to respect it. Do you know what I mean?

80
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.450
<v 0>Well, that's a good approach. If you're going to do something like that,</v>

81
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.380
just go on the offensive right away. It's a great, yeah. You don't,

82
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.610
you don't want to be, oh.

83
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.410
<v 1>We didn't know in the NIST. Oh, whoops. You got to love a man.</v>

84
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.240
You got to love him. That guy is just a mile a minute. And he is insane. He's.

85
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.140
<v 0>But he's way more calm now than when he was younger.</v>

86
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.830
When he was like 30 years old. Couldn't imagine he would,

87
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.300
he always had these girls that were useless. They were,

88
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.080
they were like runaways and they were stealing from him. They were,

89
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.070
they would stay in his house. It was like some new girls stay in his house.

90
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:06.730
I'm like, what are you doing? What are you doing? He was always a mess. So, uh,

91
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.320
one time, uh, I remember, uh, he came over to my house and uh,

92
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.340
we're gonna have dinner and we're going to watch something like a fight or

93
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.050
something. He came over my house.

94
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.590
He was over my house for 10 minutes and he goes, um,

95
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.730
I got a party I have to go to, but I'll be back a little later.

96
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.200
I'm like, what are you doing? You came over for 10 minutes.

97
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.110
Did you tell two different people that you're going over your head?

98
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.820
Of course he did. I might've. I go, well just tell them to go off. Yeah.

99
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.601
But it was like,

100
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:41.920
I think it was like something where I was like some producer guy who was hoping

101
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:43.480
was going to like put him in something.

102
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:45.820
And he was literally over my house for 10 minutes.

103
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.800
<v 1>Unbelievable. This guy, pray this, play.</v>

104
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.633
<v 0>This.</v>

105
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.630
<v 1>Look at him. Look at him.</v>

106
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.250
<v 0>The reason that I love acting, I stay on set for 12 hours, but it's worth it.</v>

107
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.900
It's worth it because I get to wear

108
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.820
shoot. You know what? It looks like pauses. You know what? He looks like.

109
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.650
Who's that old Ian McClellan from the X-Men we played

110
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.390
Magneto. You'll get, get a photo of Ian McClellan as Magneto.

111
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.200
That's how, by the way.

112
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.870
<v 1>How does he look gay? Or then he had a McKellan and the thing.</v>

113
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.320
<v 0>He does look gay or he looks he's gay. Isn't he? He's real gay.</v>

114
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.510
And he's real old. And Brian looks older and.

115
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.480

<v 0>He'll keep me in it. I need an image quickly.</v>

117
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.100
<v 1>Oh wow. Oh, a hundred percent right there. Right there. Right there. That's it.</v>

118
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.880
That's Carolyn. That's younger. Straight or Calen. Yeah. It's younger.

119
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.880
<v 0>And less gay. Look at that. Go back to Callan. Thank you.</v>

120
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.783
Nailed it.

121
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.230
<v 1>That's McKellen. Look at the whole,</v>

122
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.310
looking at each other for when he comes in here.

123
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.490
<v 0>10 Minutes. When he gets here.</v>

124
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.870
<v 1>That's the look of Ian. Hasn't been like, how are you.</v>

125
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.470
<v 0>Please? Please? Don't goes this.</v>

126
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.560
I want to be able to pull it up immediately and just say Kalin.

127
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.060
Guess what we were talking about.

128
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.450
<v 1>I love making fun of friends, man.</v>

129
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.280
<v 0>Older than that guy. How's he look.</v>

130
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.770
<v 1>Lighter or some? The lighting.</v>

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.480
is he here? Yeah, he's here. What is he doing outside?

133
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.690
Do you want me to tell him? He's probably talking to the seals. Let me grab him.

134
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.200
He gets to the security guys and he starts telling war stories. Come on.

135
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:34.010
You're boring. What are you telling those guys? You mind shut the door, bro.

136
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.370
Oh dude. What are we live in? your dad getting here.

137
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:40.310
We're talking about one American news network. Let me ask you a question.

138
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.510
Talking about my dad was toast for the past 45 minutes was explaining China to

139
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:46.070

<v 0>I liked the haircut. Look good.</v>

142
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:56.190
This is how we always should have been shot bullying.

143
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.520
<v 1>How did you know? How did you not know? But how old are you?</v>

144
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.370
<v 0>You're done. You need to see something. I'm in my I'm in my forties.</v>

145
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.030
There you go. Older and gayer than Ian McClellan. He's.

146
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.070

00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.540
You listen to look older and was holding water.

150
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.510
I'd eaten a lot of cheese probably tonight. You look like though.

151
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.410
<v 1>Maybe looking at you and he's saying, how are you older and gayer than me?</v>

152
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.830
<v 0>He's biting his lower lip. Thinking to suck in your car. He's doing well.</v>

153
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:33.860
I met him, my young man. And when he went backstage,

154
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:37.440
I was in college and I met him after a one man, Shakespeare show you shake.

155
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.290
<v 1>Tears, right? This story ends in tears. This story is in tears.</v>

156
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.940
<v 0>Listen, I want to say one thing before we start anything, please. Okay, cool.</v>

157
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:50.900
And this is important. Okay. I just want to say, please,

158
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.170
don't be here. You're not going to be. I'm not going to be.

159
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.190
I just want to say this is from the heart. Um, so I'm being nice.

160
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.880
<v 1>Because it sounds like you're setting something up to be backwards here.</v>

161
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.350
This is your special, it remains my specialist.

162
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.370
<v 0>So to me, it's just so satisfying to watch my students.</v>

163
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.370
<v 1>Well, I don't see how this is not going to be showcased.</v>

164
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.570
<v 0>So it just in the sense that my, my comedy child, if you will,</v>

165
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.110
in a way, because you used open for me.

166
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.270
And so to watch you watch me and then to take me and then to even expand

167
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.710
it. Not, not to deepen it, but to, to broaden it, you know?

168
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.880
<v 1>Okay. So you say it I'm like McDonald's is what you're saying? You said that?</v>

169
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.450
<v 0>No. No. And that's, and it's good to see who you are. Right?</v>

170
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:41.460
So Europe pop comic, right?

171
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.620
Who has to keep reinventing himself now you're 40 and now we got it right now.

172
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.480
We've got to deepen things and that's where I'm going to help.

173
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.790
<v 1>Okay. Okay. And how are you going to help me? What's what?</v>

174
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:52.920
How are you going to help me? Magneto is.

175
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.760
<v 0>Yeah, we're going to start with the helmet and then you're going to take,</v>

176
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.700
we're going to sit down and I'm going to give you a reading list.

177
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.960
<v 1>Are you dressed like a mannequin? You are dressed like a J crew mannequin.</v>

178
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.570
You shop at J crew.

179
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.010
Like it's 2001st I like those shirts. I do too.

180
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.540
But looking at you, you can't tell.

181
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.510
<v 0>Us Jim's pers they make nice shirts. Now that you weren't a white.</v>

182
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.740
<v 1>Beater underneath. No way. Peter underneath,</v>

183
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.030
like you're in a play from the forties, dude. What the is wrong with you, dude?

184
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:26.910
Why do you have.

185
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.320
<v 0>He's retired. He's my torso. Warm out. Hold on. What's the temperature.</v>

186
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:33.600
[inaudible].

187
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.610
<v 1>Unbelievable, dude. Have you ever worn a color?</v>

188
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.930
Have you ever worn a color besides earth tones? Brian, it's 80 degrees.

189
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.190
<v 0>Believable, Joe, listen, it keeps my lower, my Keats, my lower back,</v>

190
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.090
my mid body warm. So if I have to generate torque, I've got to throw a kick,

191
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.580
got a throat. I'm not going to twist my back. So my backstage,

192
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.990
you should never kick anybody.

193
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.790
<v 1>I saw your kicks. First of.</v>

194
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.290
<v 0>All, I want to say this. You're welcome.</v>

195
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.580
<v 1>On what? How about this? Your welcome. Nope. Nobody's.</v>

196
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.600
<v 0>Special coming out. How many wife beaters.</v>

197
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.400
<v 1>You own? That's what he wears underneath. He wears underneath. You know why?</v>

198
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:09.450
Because your wife is smart and fashionable, but you dude, you look like you.

199
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.210
If you take off that shirt, you have a wife beater on bro.

200
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.390
You have an actual wife or my wife beater. My one should talk.

201
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.660
<v 0>It's like, you already look like a wife beater. Don't wear one.</v>

202
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:20.430
<v 1>To me.</v>
