00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.530
Do do you think that first of all, we,

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.850
we had to do something to stop the spread of COVID-19.

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.100
Do you.

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.660
<v 1>Agree? Yes, I agree. But hold on, we haven't have to bail anybody out.</v>

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.930
We have a problem at the deal. You have to deal with our issues. Peter,

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.680
we have a.

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.200
<v 0>Problem listening to each other.</v>

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.880
Let me explain it to the people that are listening. We're on Skype.

10
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.310
And unfortunately, when you talk and I talk,

11
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:32.180
we can't kind of hear each other and you're not wearing headphones.

12
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:33.020
So it's weird.

13
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.180
<v 1>I got an earpiece. Okay.</v>

14
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.630
<v 0>Okay. But there's a little bit of a delay. So just let me it's.</v>

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.570
This is one of the reasons why I stress it so much better to do these things in

16
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:44.450
person. And I understand that it's impossible for you to do that right now,

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.370
when you have a situation like COVID-19 and these medical experts

18
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.900
say, Hey, we've got to do something. We've got to shut down.

19
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.090
Most of what we do, we've got to shut down a lot of businesses.

20
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.610
We've got to shut down schools and make things remotely.

21
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.570
There's going to be a situation where there's going to be a lot of people that

22
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:10.040
are not going to be able to work, but we want to keep these businesses alive.

23
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.990
This is a very unique situation,

24
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.190
and this is not like any situation we've ever faced in my lifetime.

25
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.890
What do you think could have been done?

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.090
That would have been a better solution than what the government did in terms of

27
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:27.020
bailouts, in terms of telling people to stay home? Like what could have been.

28
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.910
<v 1>Done? Yeah. Well, first of all,</v>

29
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:32.900
you have to remember that the government doesn't have any money, right?

30
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.900
The government only has money. It tastes for the people one way or another,

31
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.610
right? Grover Cleveland, who was a president in the late 19th century,

32
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:42.380
he was quoted. He had a good quote. He said,

33
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.650
while the people must support the government,

34
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.340
the government should never support the people. And so I agree.

35
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.320
Let's say we have to shut down the economy temporarily and people should

36
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:56.270
have enough savings to weather.

37
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:59.810
The storm businesses should have enough savings to weather.

38
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:03.320
The storm like they did in 1940 average,

39
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:07.700
Americans had lots of money in the bank. They weren't loaded up with debt.

40
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.160
They didn't have credit card debt. They didn't have student loans.

41
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.380
They didn't have car loans. They weren't,

42
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.460
they were solving even after a great depression, they were solving.

43
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.750
We lived in a bubble economy. Everybody was paycheck to paycheck.

44
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.750
Nobody had anything, businesses couldn't survive.

45
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:26.810
If their revenue stopped workers, couldn't pay their rent.

46
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.490
If they didn't get their salary, that's not right. That's,

47
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:33.020
that's part of the bubble, right?

48
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:37.010
So the fact that we were so ill prepared for a rainy day is because we had no

49
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.460
rainy day fund. We should have been able to deal with this on our own.

50
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.980
Right now, we're not getting a freebie from the government.

51
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.710
We're governed as Peter.

52
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.000
<v 0>We're at now. We,</v>

53
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.050
we basically locked down somewhere around March

54
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.560
we're we're four and a half months in or four months in now that's a long

55
00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:01.900
rainy day. Four months is a third of a year.

56
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.910
There's very few human beings that have enough money to last four

57
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.170
months. I'm sure you do. And I do. But most folks out there listening,

58
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.640
don't have enough money to live and feed their families and pay their mortgage

59
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:19.780
or pay their rent and pay their car payments for four months.

60
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.880
That's a long time.

61
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.280
<v 1>Right?</v>

62
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.200
But they're going to end up suffering much more in a year or two

63
00:03:28.201 --> 00:03:32.790
or three as a result of the massive inflation that has been unleashed

64
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.100
to finance all the bailouts and the stimulus. You agree that it's.

65
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.600
<v 0>A good idea to do something, just to keep everyone alive,</v>

66
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.070
just to keep businesses alive, just to keep people in their homes,

67
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.970
just to keep well.

68
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.830
<v 1>First of all, first of all,</v>

69
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.300
a lot of the businesses should have failed even before. I mean,

70
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.580
the fed has been keeping a lot of businesses, afloat.

71
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.800
They should have failed years ago, Don let's talk.

72
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:01.890
Maybe COVID would have been the final nail in their coffins.

73
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.940
And now they've got another lifeline, but these businesses are damaging.

74
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:06.600
The economy,

75
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.480
see businesses that are not profitable in a free market should shut down because

76
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.990
they're squandering pause.

77
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.140
<v 0>You let's talk about my business. I'm in the business of comedy.</v>

78
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.090
Comedy clubs are suffering terribly right now because it's very few states that

79
00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:25.380
are allowing people to go out, wear masks, socially distance,

80
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:27.900
and go to comedy clubs. LA is not allowing any of that.

81
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:30.930
And they haven't since March the comedy store,

82
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:33.660
which is my home has been shut down. Since March,

83
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.770
all these clubs have been shut down all across the country through no fault of

84
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:38.604
their own.

85
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 1>It doesn't, but it does not mind that it's not their fault.</v>

86
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.510
I understand that reality, but it's not like they've done anything wrong.

87
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.240
It's the state of California.

88
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.720
If the state of California is going to order businesses shut down.

89
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.280
And then the state of California wants to provide some kind of economic loop

90
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:58.410
relief, let California do it.

91
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.510
And let tack California impose higher taxes on whoever they think should fund

92
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.080
it.

93
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.010
We can't just use the federal reserve as a piggy bank that the federal reserve

94
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.460
cure is going to do more damage than the coronavirus disease.

95
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.320
And I think if the states knew that they would have to bear the economic

96
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:18.420
consequences of their own decision-making,

97
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.800
they would do a better cost benefit analysis on what they shut down and how they

98
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:26.640
do it. Right? Right. Now, every state is like, oh, let's shut everything down.

99
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.710
And the federal government's going to bail everybody out.

100
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.690
So we don't care if we put people out of work,

101
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.200
because they're going to get these enhanced benefits from the U S government.

102
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.321
Oh,

103
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.890
we don't care if we shut down businesses because they're going to get these PPP

104
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:42.630
grants from the government. But if the federal government let every state know,

105
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:44.250
look, you make a decision. This,

106
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.820
you handle this the way you want and you pay for it, right?

107
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.900
So you do a cost benefit analysis because thinking that everything is free,

108
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.000
that is the problem. We are doing so much damage to the economy. People,

109
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.950
no idea. We are going to get such a massive economic collapse,

110
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.870
far worse than what I thought was coming. You know,

111
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.960
when I did your show last few times, this is going to be much worse.

112
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.010
We are compounding the mistakes of the past with much bigger mistakes. I mean,

113
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.620
if you think it's bad now with the civil unrest,

114
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.020
it's going to get a lot worse when there's nothing.

115
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.880
There's no food when we run out of stuff. Can I pause.

116
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.520
<v 0>You? Yeah. Last time you were on,</v>

117
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.930
you were predicting the bubble of commercial real estate

118
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.700
and a lot of other issues. What,

119
00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:33.670
what do you think is different about that situation now and how,

120
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.850
how much does that compound, what we're dealing with currently?

121
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.010
<v 1>Well, obviously the Corona virus has made</v>

122
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.310
the problem worse for commercial real estate. I mean,

123
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:48.190
commercial real estate is going to get killed for so many reasons,

124
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.550
but it was in trouble I think before COVID, but COVID again,

125
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:56.380
just accelerated the process, but obviously, uh, if you are a retailer,

126
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.950
you know, no one's coming into your store, your restaurant, if you're,

127
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.960
if you've got a gym, if you've got a movie theater,

128
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.920
so you're not collecting any rent, so you want to default.

129
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.330
And so now your landlord's not getting paid and he might have a mortgage.

130
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:12.580
And now he can't pay because he's not getting rent.

131
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.600
You've got all these office buildings where a lot of offices now,

132
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.020
like my company, almost all my people are working from home now. I mean,

133
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.580
I've got some people that come into the office,

134
00:07:21.581 --> 00:07:23.020
but I got a lot of people working from home.

135
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.480
And so a lot of companies are thinking, Hey,

136
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:27.730
I don't need all this commercial space.

137
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:30.850
I don't need as big an office anymore because more of my people are working from

138
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:34.900
home. So now you have pressure on the rent. And so that was already happening.

139
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:38.110
You know, you had, we worked that blew up and they had, you know, they had a,

140
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.270
you know, rented all this space that was now, you know,

141
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:41.770
on the market for sublease.

142
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.400
But all this was inflated by the fed keeping interest rates,

143
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:50.260
artificially low there, prop up these bubbles made that real estate bubble very,

144
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:54.610
very big. And so now it's going to be far more disruptive when it pops,

145
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.450
but it's got a pop, you know, trying to prevent bubbles from deflating,

146
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:01.510
by trying to blow more air into them, just makes it worse.

147
00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:03.730
Maybe you delay the day of reckoning a little bit,

148
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.620
but you make the day of reckoning,

149
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:08.650
much worse because now you have additional mistakes that you need to reckon

150
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.030
with. I understand.

151
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.880
<v 0>So it's essentially like a pull off the band-aid situation and we,</v>

152
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.950
we, we have to have a healing moment.

153
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.460
You have to let things collapse that need to collapse.

154
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:25.960
That should have been done a long time ago because of

155
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:26.794
mismanagement.

156
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.121
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:31.960
And you have to understand that we're ripping the bandaid off a wound that the

158
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:36.220
government inflicted us with in the first place. Yes. Hey, it's a free market.

159
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:38.410
Never would have screwed us, screwed us up this much.

160
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.610
It was government interference in the free market. That's why, you know,

161
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:46.450
capitalism gets a bad name. You know, that's why, you know, we talk about on,

162
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.680
uh,

163
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.650
on one of these earlier podcasts about when I went to occupy wall street years

164
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:55.300
ago, and I went down as Makati park because you had all these young protestors

165
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.670
who were blaming wall street for the bailouts and for the financial crisis.

166
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.630
And I would say, no, it's not wall street that took the bailouts blame,

167
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:06.600
the government for providing the bailouts for making them available,

168
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.230
blame the federal reserve for funding all this and inflating the bubble. Yes.

169
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.370
But you know, the interesting thing, if I try to do that today,

170
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:16.350
if I tried to go to one of these protests,

171
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.450
one of these black lives matter protests or any of these,

172
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.570
you think they'd be civil. You think I could do that?

173
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:25.440
You think I could walk into a crowd of hundreds of people and take the opposite

174
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:28.740
position and walk out of there, you know, escape.

175
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.190
They would beat you to death a hundred percent. Yeah. So, I mean,

176
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:35.730
it certainly shows you the loss of civility. It just, you know, 10 years.

177
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.090
<v 0>It's not just a loss of civility.</v>

178
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:42.740
It's a loss of opportunity and the loss of a faith

179
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.760
in the system and the future. If we stay on the same path,

180
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.840
that's part of the problem.

181
00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:52.640
It's people don't believe that if we keep going the way we're going,

182
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.560
that things will work out in an, in an equitable,

183
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.500
fair and balanced way. And that's where.

184
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.260
<v 1>The young people today, the point I wanted to make though, too,</v>

185
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:07.820
when I went back to America in 1940 was to show that

186
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.570
the American middle class, you know, was real strong.

187
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.050
They could afford to pay for world war II and for,

188
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.270
and to provide for their own families. You know,

189
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.760
because now they keep comparing world war II.

190
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.400
Now because we're running up as much debt. Now,

191
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.530
as we ran up during world war II,

192
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.640
but we had the capacity to pay it back back then, that was the point.

193
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.020
The debt went way down.

194
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:33.860
Debt to GDP went way down in the decades after world war II,

195
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.750
because Americans had the capacity to pay back what they borrowed to fight the

196
00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:42.950
war. We don't have that capacity now. I mean, the debt's never going to go down.

197
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.090
The debt is going to keep on rising and rising and rising until the dollar

198
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:50.690
implodes. See that is the real crisis that we're headed for.

199
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.060
It's going to be a collapse in the value of the dollar,

200
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.100
because right now we're printing money, right? And,

201
00:10:56.101 --> 00:11:00.110
and the government is sending it out and people are able to buy stuff with it,

202
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.190
right?

203
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.110
But that's going to come to an end because the world is no longer going

204
00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:09.320
to accept us dollars as the reserve currency, see,

205
00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:13.610
that's the unique privilege that we've enjoyed for several generations now.

206
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.670
And that we've abused to the point where we're going to lose it.

207
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.480
See right now we're able to print money. And we use that money.

208
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:24.140
We print to buy all sorts of stuff that the rest of the world produces that we

209
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:28.520
didn't have to produce ourselves. But producing goods requires capital.

210
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.880
It requires labor. It requires land. It requires real resources,

211
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.180
but we get all this stuff for free. We just create money and here you go.

212
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.470
And they send us stuff. And then to make it even better for us,

213
00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:42.470
they take the money that we send them the paper and they loan it right back to

214
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:45.140
us. At very low rates of interest, they buy our bonds.

215
00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:46.550
They buy our mortgage backed securities.

216
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.030
So Americans get to spend all this borrowed money that they didn't save.

217
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.580
We get to consume all this stuff that we didn't produce.

218
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.990
And we have an artificially elevated standard of living.

219
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:57.100
We live beyond our means.

220
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.970
That's going to come to an end because foreigners are going to realize that

221
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:02.410
we're never going to stop printing money.

222
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:04.750
That the deficits are never going to be brought under control.

223
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.680
That we're going to have QE infinity, 0% interest rates in perpetuity.

224
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.750
And then they're not going to want the dollar anymore.

225
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.080
And then the dollar is going to crash and we're not going to be able to import

226
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:14.980
anything anymore.

227
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.770
And the only things we're going to be able to buy is this stuff.

228
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:20.320
We make ourselves, except we don't make much stuff anymore.

229
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.600
So prices are going to go through the roof.

230
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.910
That is the real economic consequences.

231
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:28.660
And so it's not going to matter that the government sends you a stimulus check.

232
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.220
If you can't buy anything with it,

233
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.770
because the government can't create purchasing power,

234
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.330
they can print all the money they want.

235
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.060
But none of that printed money adds any purchasing power.

236
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.480
They don't grow any food. They don't produce any products, nothing.

237
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:42.780
They just print money. Right. But.

238
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.690
<v 0>There is. If, if the government gives money to people,</v>

239
00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:48.750
they will be able to buy things. And people still are making things.

240
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.870
<v 1>But now, but when the dollars value collapses,</v>

241
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:58.520
see you can't keep printing trillions and trillions of dollars and expect the

242
00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:02.630
dollars not to lose purchasing power. Right? Right. Because paper money,

243
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.670
all that does is that, um, allows us to divvy up what we produce.

244
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.540
Right? You have all these Americans now who used to be working,

245
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.720
doing something right. They were helping to produce a product.

246
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.350
They were providing a service. And now they're just at home collecting a check,

247
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.210
right? So they're getting money for nothing.

248
00:13:20.211 --> 00:13:22.100
They didn't put anything into the pot,

249
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.160
but now they want to take out of the pot with their money. Well,

250
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.630
there's nothing in the pot, right?

251
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.990
So now the prices of everything in that pot have to go up because there's no,

252
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.450
there's no extra stuff. There's just more buying Peter Aslan. What's been, I'm.

253
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.950
<v 0>Sorry. As, as an economic expert, what would you have done differently?</v>

254
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.260
If you could have advised this government and we were let's,

255
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:46.840
let's go back to March when everything was shutting down,

256
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.330
what would you have have advised differently?

257
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.820
<v 1>Again, first of all, I would allow,</v>

258
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.500
I would allow the states to be responsible for their own policy. So you,

259
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.640
you decide what you want to do in your own state, as far as, you know,

260
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.650
what you want, what businesses you want to close, you know, what,

261
00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:05.770
what you want to do and, and you pay for it.

262
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.700
And if you think that certain businesses or individuals need to get money,

263
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.700
then the state will provide it based on local taxpayers.

264
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.930
But what I would have done on the federal level is I would have dramatically cut

265
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.150
government spending, you know,

266
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.010
even after COVID-19 because government spending is a drain on the

267
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:26.710
private sector, it's a drag on the economy.

268
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.670
It's the government taking resources away from the private sector where they

269
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:34.450
would be used efficiently and squatter them in the public sector.

270
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.390
So can I pause you for a second? It's a burden. Can I pause you?

271
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.980
I would have lightened the burden. What.

272
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.980
<v 0>Would you, you have? What will you have when you say lighten the burden,</v>

273
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.380
what would you have cut? And how would you do that?

274
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.500
When you think about all the different aspects of the government that are

275
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.010
essential, things that need to be in place, what would you.

276
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.450
<v 1>Have done? Most of, most of the government money is,</v>

277
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.220
is transfer payments where the government takes money from one person and gives

278
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:00.410
it to somebody else. I mean, the government shouldn't be doing that.

279
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:02.270
That's not why we have a government in America.

280
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.960
Government is here to secure our rights, protect our property, not steal.

281
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.410
<v 0>It. Can you explain that? What do you mean by transfer payments?</v>

282
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.521
<v 1>Well,</v>

283
00:15:09.521 --> 00:15:13.420
that's when the government takes money from one person through taxation and just

284
00:15:13.421 --> 00:15:15.640
hands it to somebody else or now through inflation,

285
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.390
the government just prints money and gives it to people that it thinks needs it,

286
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.290
but that's not what government, but let's look at the PPP. Okay. Let's,

287
00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:25.420
let's look at that. Or the cares act. Right? Okay.

288
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.740
Look at all the damage that the cares act did to the economy.

289
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.120
So first of all,

290
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.570
let's look at the payroll protection plan that everybody wants to brag about.

291
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:39.130
Right? What a complete fraud. This was. I said from day one,

292
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.040
this would be a assessed pool of fraud. You know,

293
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:46.630
we found out last week that there were 600 approximately

294
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.660
hedge funds, private equity funds,

295
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.380
asset management companies that got PPP loans.

296
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.840
And they're not even loans because you don't have to pay them back.

297
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.670
So it's free money. Right?

298
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.060
And I could have gotten one of those loans if I wanted to,

299
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.200
I just didn't want to lie to qualify. Apparently, could you stop at 600?

300
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:06.760
Can you suffer that?

301
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.330
<v 0>Most people don't know that these hedge funds got this money.</v>

302
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.460
Most people think this money went out to American businesses to keep these

303
00:16:15.461 --> 00:16:19.600
businesses from collapsing because we need restaurants. We need, you know,

304
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:21.400
movie theaters and all these,

305
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.260
all these various American businesses that we assume this money

306
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:29.230
went to prevent from collapsing. Explain that.

307
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.040
<v 1>Please. Yeah. Well, you didn't have to. All you had to do is apply.</v>

308
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.270
And according to the small business administration, as long as the,

309
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.940
the money you asked for was less than 2 million,

310
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.030
they didn't ask any questions because in theory,

311
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.400
you are supposed to need the money, right?

312
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.140
You were supposed to have some disruption.

313
00:16:47.141 --> 00:16:50.410
Like if you ran a restaurant and your restaurant is shut down,

314
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.080
you don't have any revenue. There's nobody eating in your restaurant.

315
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.530
So you have no money coming in. So how do you pay your waiters?

316
00:16:56.531 --> 00:16:59.350
How do you pay your, your, your, your busboys? You have no money.

317
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.840
So the government was like, oh, we'll give you some money.

318
00:17:01.841 --> 00:17:03.670
As long as you don't fire your workers,

319
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.990
we'll give you some money to pay your workers. But a company like mine, right?

320
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.590
My, my, I have two or three companies that I could have taken money from.

321
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:14.290
And I didn't, but you look at my, like my asset management company,

322
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.670
your Pacific asset management, I'm making more money now than I was before.

323
00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:19.420
COVID.

324
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.680
And I assume that that's the case with most firms that are in my industry.

325
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.430
Can you speak to us? Our revenue was never shut down. How's that possible?

326
00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:28.360
How are you making more money?

327
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.370
Because all I and do is charge fees to manage people's money.

328
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.300
I didn't stop managing their money because of COVID. I mean,

329
00:17:37.301 --> 00:17:40.900
we just keep on managing it and we keep on billing for our feeds. We bill,

330
00:17:40.901 --> 00:17:43.120
every quarter, we weren't even shut down.

331
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.540
Even in Puerto Rico where they were shutting down everything. I mean,

332
00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:50.220
I was considered an essential business financial services. So I, I, you know, I,

333
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.840
people can come to my office,

334
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.400
even though I let a lot of them work from home and remember all of our

335
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:59.910
customers, they talked to us on the phone. So when I want to talk to a customer,

336
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.520
the customer doesn't drive down to my office. You know,

337
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:06.330
they just call me on the phone and so get there's no Facebook contact.

338
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.240
So there isn't any disruption.

339
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.330
All of the revenues that the hedge funds were getting at the asset management

340
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:15.000
companies, all that revenue continued unabated,

341
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.180
not a single job was in jeopardy, right?

342
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.130
All these companies that got government money,

343
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:23.550
see that the government wants to pretend that these loans saved jobs.

344
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:27.090
They didn't say these jobs, these jobs were never in jeopardy of being lost.

345
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.660
So all that happened is that it's a windfall, the asset management companies,

346
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.320
the hedge funds,

347
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.190
they got extra money from the government to make their profits even bigger on

348
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.130
opera. The fact that the federal reserve printed all this money,

349
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.450
which inflated asset prices, we charge fees on those assets. And so,

350
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:47.450
as the fed inflates assets, wall street has inflated fees. We make more money.

351
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.400
It was a double bailout for a lot of these wall street firms.

352
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.930
So that was one of the frauds.

353
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.120
But even in the case where the government is actually giving companies,

354
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.580
giving money to companies that need it right,

355
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:03.810
that otherwise would have fired their workers. Look, we don't know,

356
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.790
you know what the future demand for restaurants and bars and theaters is going

357
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:09.600
to be.

358
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.290
I personally believe that demand is going to be diminished for a long time.

359
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.090
It's not just a temporary thing.

360
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.150
I don't think it's going to come back to the way it was.

361
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.760
Especially since the way it was, was a bubble. See,

362
00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:22.260
that's what people don't get. They say,

363
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:26.400
we want to go back to the way it was before. COVID we can't reflate that bubble.

364
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.030
We have to start spending less. We have to save more.

365
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.500
And that means we can't go out. As often. We need to build up our savings again,

366
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.280
because we've depleted it. So there's going to be less demand for restaurants.

367
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.680
There's going to be less demand for a lot of things.

368
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.850
We have to let these companies downsize. Look at the airlines.

369
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.280
Americans are going to be flying less.

370
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:51.900
There's no question in my mind that domestic air travel is going to be down for

371
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:54.930
many, many years, even after COVID is, is cured.

372
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.800
So the airlines have to shrink. They have to lay people off.

373
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.290
They have to be profitable. They have to, you know,

374
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.880
effectively utilize resources.

375
00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:07.410
So to the extent that the government prevents businesses from laying off

376
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:09.120
workers, that really should be laid off.

377
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.420
They ultimately compromise the viability of those businesses.

378
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.470
And in the long run,

379
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.740
they may end up putting people out of business that would have stayed in

380
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:17.880
business. Maybe they, you know,

381
00:20:17.881 --> 00:20:22.050
maybe somebody had a hundred employees and maybe they could have downsized to 30

382
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:24.930
employees. And at least those 30 employees would have a job.

383
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.860
But instead they keep those employees on the payroll for long enough to the

384
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:30.720
point where the whole company has to go out of business.

385
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:31.860
And now everybody loses their job.

386
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.680
<v 0>Now, when you, when you say hedge funds were able to receive PPE,</v>

387
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.120
and you're saying that they did so while they were still earning profits and

388
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.210
there wasn't any diminishment of their income,

389
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.030
why were they able to receive PP PPP?

390
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.860
<v 1>Well, that's the problem with government programs. There's always fraud.</v>

391
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.260
Like whenever the government is giving out free money,

392
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.900
people try to qualify for it. Now, you know,

393
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:59.770
you can read the fine print that I know a lot of other people could say, Hey,

394
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:00.700
you know, Peter has said,

395
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.850
as long as your business was affected by COVID and look, yes,

396
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:05.590
my business was affected. I mean,

397
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:09.400
people worked at home that used to work in the office, but you had to,

398
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.230
you had a basically testify or certify that the money was necessary to

399
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:19.180
support the ongoing operations of your business, which for most of these firms,

400
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:23.050
it wasn't. And you also had to say that you had no other source of capital,

401
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.590
which again, people were lying, but the government basically said,

402
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:30.310
if you ask for less than $2 million, we're going to look the other way.

403
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.270
We're not going to vet these loans, but hold on, hold on. These loans,

404
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.270
did they actually say that they're non-recourse, there's no collateral.

405
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.520
So a lot of businesses that were going to fail anyway,

406
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.730
and that we're going to lay off all their workers, took the money.

407
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.800
They're still gonna lay off all their workers,

408
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.920
but now they're not going to have to pay the money back because they're going to

409
00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:50.920
bankrupt their business. And once your business is bankrupt,

410
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.540
even though you fire all your workers,

411
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.330
you're under no obligation to repay the loan. Okay.

412
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.650
<v 0>Did they actually say that if you asked for less than $2 million,</v>

413
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.810
we're going to look the other way? Like w where are you taking this?

414
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.400
<v 1>From that,</v>

415
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:07.140
what it says is we'll assume that you're filing an

416
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.570
honest claim, right? Because they're saying that if you,

417
00:22:09.571 --> 00:22:11.790
if you ask for more than $2 million,

418
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.880
we're going to vet the claim and we're going to take a look at your situation,

419
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.200
but it sat on the small business administration that we'll just assume you're

420
00:22:19.201 --> 00:22:22.890
being honest, right? So if you ask for less than 2 million,

421
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:24.990
we'll assume you're being honest. Well, the minute they say, oh,

422
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.850
I'm going to lie. That's the problem.

423
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.690
So many people like whenever the government has a program that gets abused.

424
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.390
That's part of the problem with government spending, right?

425
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:37.470
Everybody tries to qualify, like, just like the unemployment benefits,

426
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.550
this crazy, uh, deal with the, um, uh,

427
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.020
enhanced unemployment benefits.

428
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:48.030
You have a lot of people now who are being paid twice as much not to work

429
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.530
as they were earning when they were working.

430
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.340
Now you create that kind of incentive. You have a lot of people. Now,

431
00:22:53.341 --> 00:22:56.610
the last thing they want is to go back to work because they're making so much

432
00:22:56.611 --> 00:22:59.190
more money, not working than they were. They were working.

433
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.810
And most of these people, if you have a job where you're making, you know, 10,

434
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.150
$15 an hour, $20 an hour, chances are you don't love your job. I mean,

435
00:23:09.151 --> 00:23:11.610
you're not working because you enjoy what you're doing.

436
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.300
You're working because you need the money. You need to pay the bills. Well,

437
00:23:15.301 --> 00:23:19.530
if you can make the same amount of money or more without working, I mean,

438
00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.390
who's not going to go for that. I mean,

439
00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:24.390
I don't blame anybody for not wanting to work.

440
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.820
If the government is paying you more, not to work,

441
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.360
that what your boss was paying you to work. And of course, you know,

442
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.570
there's more than just working. You have to get up early in the morning,

443
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.100
you gotta fight traffic. You know, you, you know, you, you got other expenses.

444
00:23:38.101 --> 00:23:42.090
Maybe you got to put your kids in daycare. You know, you gotta, you know,

445
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.310
laundry, you know, dry, clean your clothes. Women,

446
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.420
women could spend hour in the morning doing their hair, doing makeup.

447
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.810
They don't get paid for that, but they got to do all that, you know,

448
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.130
and add all that to commute time. I mean, so there's a big cost of working.

449
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:57.950
And then of course you give up all your leisure. When you're at work,

450
00:23:57.951 --> 00:23:58.880
you can't have fun.

451
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.810
The government now has created a situation where people are getting paid to have

452
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:05.330
fun. So, I mean, how do you end that?

453
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.320
What politician is now going to take this away? Okay.
