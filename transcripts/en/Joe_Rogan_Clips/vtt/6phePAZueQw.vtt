00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.760
<v 1>What is disturbing both of you most about what's going on right now?</v>

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.000
<v 2>Well, I think we'd love to see a third way.</v>

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.480
So they're the pre-moderns as it were, who have very traditionalist,

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.313
conservative.

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.190
<v 1>To get approach, try to the sucker up close to you. Sorry. Sorry about that.</v>

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.070
No worries. Yeah.

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.890
<v 2>Perfect. The,</v>

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.350
the pre-moderns who have a very traditional conservative approach to gender

10
00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:29.550
roles, to sex, to relationship. And, uh,

11
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.630
there are a lot of us in the modern world who would reject a lot of that.

12
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.230
And then there, there are the post-moderns who wanna throw out everything,

13
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.860
wanna throw out everything that evolution handed us, you, and in the meantime,

14
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.460
pretend that it didn't happen, right?

15
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.580
Pretend that it's not even based on reality. And there is a there's a third way.

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.620
And, you know, maybe we need to call it modern as opposed to pre or post-modern,

17
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.100
but, uh, there's, there's a third way to navigate what evolutionary is,

18
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:56.860
what evolution has given us, what we can change,

19
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:01.420
what we can't change and how to actually recover some of,

20
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.750
you know,

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.530
the sexiness and sex and the love and love and the romance and romance, and,

22
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.690
you know, understand that human beings are what we are from not just

23
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.243
a hundred years back,

24
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.090
but 1,010 thousand and a hundred million years back we've had sex.

25
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.810
<v 1>Since you both taught at a university level,</v>

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.000
you you've been around these students and you you've seen this sort of

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.600
post-modernist movement gain steam. What,

28
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.520
what do you think is the cause of it? Like what,

29
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:37.040
what is the reason why people are projecting this sort of

30
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:41.040
distorted idea that there's no differences between men and women and that all

31
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.110
the differences in the genders or all it's all propaganda or cultural or.

32
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.030
<v 3>So I,</v>

33
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.870
I think it actually arises from a relatively simple

34
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.790
cause that we all detect there's something not right about what we've been

35
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:57.610
taught.

36
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.270
We detect there's something not right about the way civilization is structured.

37
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.220
We can tell that there's nobody really at the helm and you have a lot of people

38
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.780
who are faced with some issue that to them is incredibly glaring.

39
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:14.180
Something that just absolutely needs to be solved.

40
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:16.380
And so what they do is they look at that issue and they say,

41
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:17.214
what would we have to,

42
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.780
what would we have to say in order for that issue to be fully addressed?

43
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.330
And the problem is that we're dealing with a complex system.

44
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.970
And if you optimize for any one solution,

45
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.490
you cause a catastrophe across all of the other things that it's connected to.

46
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.890
And if you're not focused on those unintended consequences,

47
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.250
you tend not to understand why people are resistant to your solution.

48
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.223
So for example,

49
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.560
let's deal with the transgender issue for the transgender

50
00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:50.880
community. And I don't, you know, this is not a monolith, the community.

51
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.640
I actually know quite a number of people within it who have a heterodox

52
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.200
position, but in general,

53
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.120
there's a sense that it is disrespectful,

54
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.360
not to simply recognize anybody who has decided to transition as a

55
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.120
full fledged member of the sex to which they have moved.

56
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.440
That seems right. And if you are focused on, uh,

57
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.400
the humanitarian side of the question, maybe it even is right,

58
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.990
but the problem is,

59
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.870
if you say a person who identifies as a particular

60
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.070
sex is that sex suddenly you've actually caused a whole bunch

61
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.670
of consequences that you weren't thinking of over in a biology class, over,

62
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.950
uh, in the prison system. I mean, is it true that somebody who says that they,

63
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.060
our female gets to go to a women's prison? Do we want to put, uh,

64
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.180
violent sex offenders in a women's prison because they declare themselves to be

65
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.014
female.

66
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.180
So not tracking the consequences that were not in your view when you

67
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:59.970
decided on a particular solution is the reason that so many people have signed

68
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.770
up for these really absurd notions.

69
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.130
And part of what I hope we will get to today is that

70
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.053
there is a,

71
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.650
a principle at the core of understanding all complex adaptive systems,

72
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.890
and it is diminishing returns and diminishing returns sounds kind of arcane. Uh,

73
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.720
it has too close an association with economics where it was first outlined.

74
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.240
Um, but the message of diminishing returns is that you can very often

75
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.840
get 90% of a solution that you want and not disrupt other

76
00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:36.960
things unduly.

77
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.870
But if you say I want a hundred percent of the solution to this problem, 'em,

78
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.150
you'll cause a catastrophe.

79
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.950
So getting people to realize don't shoot for the utopia in which the problem

80
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.550
you're talking about is 100% solved. If you can accept a 90% solution,

81
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.550
then you can have a whole bunch of other things that you don't even realize

82
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:55.870
you're using in.

83
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.590
<v 1>Defensive people. That would try to go for a hundred percent though. Isn't it?</v>

84
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.140
One of those things where like you, if you would negotiate, you would,

85
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.420
if you want a hundred dollars, you ask for 150.

86
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.820
<v 3>Unfortunately. I mean, I think you're identifying something,</v>

87
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:13.060
correct that in part, the positions that we hear, um,

88
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.260
being deployed are not an honest reflection of the beliefs of many

89
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:21.810
of the people who are espousing them. They're a negotiating to acting,

90
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.250
but we can't do that with biology. You can't negotiate with biology.

91
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.850
Biology is what it is.

92
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.530
And then we can talk about which parts of it are amenable to being changed.

93
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.970
And as Heather pointed out,

94
00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:39.770
we're not advocating for a return to some traditional way of interacting between

95
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.680
the sexes. We're advocating for a, uh, an enlightened way that, uh,

96
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:48.680
takes advantage of the freedoms. We have that our ancestors didn't and, um,

97
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:52.120
tries to navigate the hazards that we're stuck with. Um,

98
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.760
so you can't, you can't, uh, negotiate with biology.

99
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.880
You're really ought to listen to what it is that nature is telling you,

100
00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:05.720
and then say, all right, what does that leave open? Where can we shift things?

101
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.520
But if you're gonna require that we lie about what's true, biologically,

102
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.560
in order to navigate to a solution, I guarantee you,

103
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.120
it will be unstable in the end. Yeah.

104
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.430
<v 2>The, the Zeit guys to begun to such nonsense as</v>

105
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.310
chromosomes exist on a continuum, you know,

106
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:23.750
there are X chroromosomes and they are Y chromosomes. I haven't heard that one.

107
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.230
Um, one of our children just heard that at his school.

108
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.830
<v 1>What did they mean by, on a continuum.</v>

109
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 2>Who even knows? I.</v>

110
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.630
<v 3>I don't think they meant anything.</v>

111
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.420
I think what they intended to do was carve out freedom from a BI ological

112
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.780
truth. Mmhmm. And so if you say ch chromosomes are on a continuum,

113
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.340
then it's very hard to disagree with that because it doesn't mean anything that

114
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.780
we can unpack. Well.

115
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.420
<v 2>I would say it's actually really easy to disagree with it and say, no, you know,</v>

116
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.940
gamades, aren't on a continuum. Sperm is sperm and eggs or eggs. Sorry,

117
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.820
discreete two of 'em right. Chromosomes also not on a continuum,

118
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.370
at least in mammals sex. Yeah. A continuum.

119
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.850
Their intersex is real, but it's strongly bimodal, right?

120
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:07.850
There's there are males and there are females and there are a few people it's

121
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.150
rare,

122
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.050
but real that there are intermediate phenotypes and gender is even

123
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:15.290
more of a continuum, but still strongly bimodal.

124
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.080
<v 1>Have you folks heard about that new crayfish that there battling in Europe,</v>

125
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.360
there's a giant crayfish in Europe, that's female and female only,

126
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.680
and essentially is a clone. They, they reproduce by cloning,

127
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.600
so they don't need a male partner and uh,

128
00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:32.720
they're going crazy and there's a lot of, of them them.

129
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.520
<v 3>So great. First two sentences there,</v>

130
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.190
it sounded like there was a giant crayfish to send ending on Europe.

131
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.430
It was a female and she's mad.

132
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.070
<v 1>She's. &lt;laugh&gt;, she's tired. All these lobster dinners. So.</v>

133
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.670
<v 2>Yeahs, no it's and that's gonna work for a while. Right?</v>

134
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.510
And like asexuality has actually evolved in a few lineages,

135
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.630
a few verttete lineages.

136
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:57.030
There's some lizards that are asexual and it's all females and it goes great

137
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.340
until the environment changes, right? Because if you're cloning yourself, you,

138
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.940
your children are gonna experience exactly are gonna be exactly the same thing

139
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:07.740
that you were. So if you were a good fit for your environment,

140
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.660
the next environment better be the same or else your kids aren't gonna be a good

141
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:14.540
fit. So, right. My feeling is that crayfish. I haven't followed the story a lot,

142
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.220
but that crayfish is gonna do terrifically moving into exactly the landscapes

143
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:24.130
that it first mutated into existence in. And if you change the landscape of it,

144
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:24.610
it's gonna stop.

145
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.850
<v 1>Doing so. Well. I think they just farm it for food if it's tasty. Yeah,</v>

146
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:29.690
no doubt. We don't doubt have to worry about them. Breeding,

147
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:32.850
just get a ton of 'em together, crayfish or delicious. They are delicious.

148
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.250
Right. This is a good tasting variety. &lt;laugh&gt; it's free food. Yeah. You know,

149
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.930
I mean, it's kind of crazy. That's right.

150
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.120
So Heather and I were talking before the podcast started about,

151
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.040
I think a very important point when it comes to a lot of these, uh,

152
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.320
either progressive or right wing issues is that people tend to be extremely

153
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:55.000
tribal. And what they're really concerned with is winning. They,

154
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.560
it becomes a competition of us versus them.

155
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.920
It becomes our side versus their side,

156
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.920
and they tend to exploit weaknesses and then attack to score points

157
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.560
and all ideas of being honest, intellectually,

158
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.120
or looking at things objectively kind of go out the window.

159
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.470
You ignore facts that diminish your position or your team's position

160
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.790
and highlight things. Even if they're not real,

161
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.590
that would diminish the other side's position.

162
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.310
This is a real problem that humans have with arguments with, with,

163
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.910
with being tribal, with being on different sides. I mean, we see it,

164
00:09:31.911 --> 00:09:34.390
we forget about tribes. We see it with people where,

165
00:09:34.391 --> 00:09:38.260
when there's a certain time, when you see people arguing,

166
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:42.260
there's a certain point where the argument has deteriorated to a competition and

167
00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:45.060
it's no longer about what you're actually discussing. It's about who can win.

168
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.620
<v 2>Yeah. So, and this is what science is for. Yes.</v>

169
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:48.500
<v 1>Yeah. Well.</v>

170
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.540
<v 3>This has science ought to be indifferent when it's done well. It,</v>

171
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.860
it is indifferent to who's the stronger team.

172
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.930
It should really just tell you what's true. And in fact,

173
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.610
the reason to use science is to correct for biases.

174
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.650
Um, but so Eric and Heather and I have a, uh,

175
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.730
a phrase that is just shorthand for something which is, um,

176
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.690
bad faith changes, everything.

177
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.890
There's a lot you can do in discussion with people,

178
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.360
with whom you disagree,

179
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.960
as long as you are on the same page to a large extent. Yes.

180
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.560
And what you're describing is what happens when that system breaks down and

181
00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:31.560
people perceive themselves as needing to win against the enemy rather than on

182
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.200
a team that is trying to navigate to what is true or what is the most desirable

183
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.910
outcome with respect to values that we all share or something like that.

184
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:44.150
So what you're describing is a very common state.

185
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.390
It is a lower,

186
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.270
less capable state than a good faith environment where people who may disagree,

187
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.470
intensely agree on the basic rules and the desirability of figuring out what's

188
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:58.820
true. And so maybe that part of what uh,

189
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.820
we can do here is try to point to where the good faith conversation

190
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.180
can get to that.

191
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:09.020
The bad faith conversation is incapable of getting to the value. Really.

192
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.900
<v 1>Yeah. I think that's, that's a giant point. It really is. And it's a, I mean,</v>

193
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.660
it's really something that I would hope more people would adopt going into the

194
00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:17.494
future.

195
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.450
Stop connecting yourself to these ideas and just let these ideas exist on their

196
00:11:22.451 --> 00:11:26.690
own and examine them objectively and rely on science,

197
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.170
rely on actual science to formulate your,

198
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.050
when you're talking about biological issues. And.

199
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.530
<v 2>When I say science is the answer to this,</v>

200
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.640
it's not necessarily that we should accept.

201
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.720
No one should accept the findings of science just at, at face value.

202
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.720
But a scientific approach is I've got this idea what would have to be

203
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:51.080
true if that were true and how can I possibly prove it wrong?

204
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.040
And you work harder and harder and harder to prove it wrong. And if you can't,

205
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.000
then you have greater and greater and greater confidence that maybe it's right.

206
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.400
And so this, this is what we don't see in bad.

207
00:12:01.401 --> 00:12:05.040
Faith arguments is no one is trying to prove themselves wrong. And that's,

208
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:07.760
I mean, that sounds backwards the first time you, you hear it,

209
00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:12.360
but if you try to actually demonstrate that your own cherished beliefs are

210
00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:13.550
wrong, wrong, and you can't do it,

211
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.870
you have pretty good confidence at the end of that. And there is no actual end,

212
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.150
but the longer you've gone,

213
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.550
you have pretty good confidence that actually I'm probably seeing something real

214
00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:24.350
here. I've asked myself, I've asked my friends,

215
00:12:24.351 --> 00:12:27.350
I've asked my enemies is this thing. Right? And you know,

216
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.550
in an actual formal scientific setting, you do an experiment. You,

217
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:35.540
you run the data and you, you do the analysis, but is it right? Or is it not?

218
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.940
Let's see if I can prove it's not, even though I really think it is.

219
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.100
<v 3>Really. So you also get a test, you get something, uh,</v>

220
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.740
there's a bonus that comes with it, which is, I don't know what else to say.

221
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:51.180
It's super awesome. Which is, if you've tried to take your cherished idea,

222
00:12:51.181 --> 00:12:53.770
some hypothesis that you've come up with and you've tried, right.

223
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:57.810
16 different ways to show that it's wrong and you keep failing. Well,

224
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.210
every one of those things you did to see whether what you thought was true is

225
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.930
actually false. Now prepares you when somebody now challenges you and they say,

226
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.490
oh, but you haven't thought of this. Well, you have,

227
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.320
you've been through it 16 different ways and that you,

228
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.880
the ability to navigate almost anything that's thrown at you because, uh,

229
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.120
you have taken on the role of being your own harshest critic in order to make

230
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:25.960
sure that what's left at the end of that process is really robust.

231
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.720
The other thing, um, that I,

232
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.520
I want to insert here is that I think a,

233
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.710
I don't wanna be put in the position of defending everything that's been

234
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:39.670
published in the scientific literature as true, because it looks like science.

235
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.430
A lot of it isn't a lot of what's published in the scientific literature is not

236
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.950
valid. The methodology does not establish what people claim it does.

237
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.830
And that's a big hazard for, for people like Heather and myself,

238
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:53.350
because you have to sort the wheat from the chaf in order to figure out what to

239
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.140
defend and what to be agnostic about. Um,

240
00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.940
but I do think those of us who more or less get the story

241
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.620
of what let's say human sexuality is about at a scientific level.

242
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.940
And there's still a lot of mystery,

243
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:10.780
but there's an awful lot that those of us who have studied it are in agreement

244
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.520
about,

245
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.500
and civilization is not yet on the same page with those of us who have lived,

246
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.490
looked at it. Scientifically, one thing we have failed to do,

247
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.290
I think is to articulate what you will get in exchange

248
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.730
for signing up for a scientific worldview on this topic.

249
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.770
People do not realize that a scientific worldview is actually the thing

250
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.010
that empowers you to navigate your,

251
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.840
your own love life in an intelligent way. It will.

252
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.520
<v 2>Let you. And it's a lot more fun than it sounds when you say it that way.</v>

253
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.280
<v 3>Yeah, it it's. Well, you know,</v>

254
00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:48.960
they're all of these famous arguments about unweaving the rainbow or,

255
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.440
you know, somebody challenged Fineman that, um, he,

256
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.960
he was the kind of guy who would take part a flower and destroy its beauty in

257
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.320
order to figure out how it worked and find this is the trope.

258
00:14:59.321 --> 00:15:02.960
Science will destroy beauty, right? And it's not true. No, it's not true.

259
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.720
You will get a lot of value.

260
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.840
You will waste less of your time on people that you shouldn't be interested in.

261
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.590
If you understand what game they're playing, even if they don't understand it,
