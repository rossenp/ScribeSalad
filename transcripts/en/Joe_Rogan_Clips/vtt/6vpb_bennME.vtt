00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Look,</v>

2
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.440
can I ask Eddie this Eddie cuz me and Eddie have been going back and forth the

3
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:09.880
text. Why would, if it's, if I'm a conspiracy guy,

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.400
why would they do this? Eddie?

5
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.200
<v 1>What? What's the question? You know what I'm.</v>

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.120
<v 2>Talking about? No, no, what's the question. Why would they do this?</v>

7
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.040
Like why think they would fake a disease or, or make such.

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.750
<v 0>A big deal of it for Trump? I know, I know Trump, it hurt, it hurts his.</v>

9
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.550
<v 2>There's so many theories. Some people think it helps him. So many.</v>

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 1>Theories, Blas handling it.</v>

11
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.590
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Some people think he's handling it well, but there was a woman from,</v>

12
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.870
uh, I forget where she was from. I wanna say anyway, she was a, a,

13
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.030
a press lady who asked a question,

14
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.910
like why his administration disbanded the pandemic office. And uh,

15
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.180
he didn't know about it.

16
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.300
And so he turned to some other guy that was on stage with him. He's like,

17
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.420
do you know about this? Like why did we,

18
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.220
there's a lot of people in my administration. He's like, I didn't,

19
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:51.540
I don't know what, but I did a lot of good things. And he goes,

20
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:55.020
and we saved a lot of people and stopping travel, saved thousands of lives.

21
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.500
And he told her it was a nasty question.

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.220
Nobody up more than Joe Biden though.

23
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:05.290
When he got in that argument with that guy on the floor of, uh, that, uh,

24
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.890
you know, that argument that he got with a union worker,

25
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.530
he was talking about the second amendment. Yeah. I didn't see it.

26
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.850
Biden has said that they're gonna take away certain guns.

27
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.210
He said that this is recent. No. He said that in, in interviews before,

28
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.410
and this guy was confronting him on it and he called him a liar and oh wow.

29
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:22.280
You know it.

30
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.160
<v 1>Wasn't gun. Anybody,</v>

31
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.360
anybody talking about like making our guns smaller and they're like spending

32
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.120
time with, oh, we need smaller magazines. You, you guys got 15.

33
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.920
We need to drop it down to nine. Right? Anytime you, you,

34
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.440
anybody says anything like that. I'm like, I don't trust you at all.

35
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.440
Why are you worried about the size of my magazine? You fake.

36
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.310
I'm trying to protect my family. Who cares if have 15 round or, oh,

37
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.470
we need smaller guns. We need less am. I'm like,

38
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.910
anytime someone says anything like that, I don't, you're already done with me,

39
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:56.870
dude. If you're, you're like trying to,

40
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.470
you're spending time on the size of my guns.

41
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.540
<v 2>But I, I know what you're saying. You're done. I know what you're saying. Okay.</v>

42
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.260
I know what you're saying, but hold on a second. You're looking at it logically.

43
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:07.900
You're looking at it like that's his real feelings.

44
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.980
The problem is when something comes along, politicians have to make a move.

45
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.660
They have to do something in response.

46
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.660
They have to have a response for a crisis.

47
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.980
And if they don't have some sort of response,

48
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.060
they don't have some sort of response in terms of take away some of the guns

49
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.010
lashing. You have to have response. You have, I get that. I get that.

50
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.250
But hold on man. But it it's, it's it doesn't, it's not logical. I,

51
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.730
I agree with you that like saying you're going to shut down the amount of rounds

52
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.530
or you're gonna like you're. If you're trying to com stop a mass shooting,

53
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.810
a more effective way, be better mental health.

54
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.090
That'd be a way more effective way. And then it's common sense.

55
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.200
<v 1>Yes. It's good. Like you, you, okay. Some kid shoots up a mall.</v>

56
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.640
Now I gotta give up my guns. Your guns are too big.

57
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.200
Like how does that make sense?

58
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.080
I'm just trying to protect my family against any coming in. And now you go, oh,

59
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:01.280
your gun's too big. We need a, like, to me,

60
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.720
that's some I of, of course, that's not what you're trying to.

61
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.320
You're worried about. You're the overall goal is to take the guns. Totally.

62
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.600
But I see what you're doing. You're going peace by piece inch by inch that's.

63
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.080
But.

64
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.000
<v 2>If it was a grand conspiracy, that's what they would be doing.</v>

65
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.110
But what they doing is they're politicians and the left generally wants gun

66
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:23.150
control. And they,

67
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:25.550
when people want piece to people and I don't want hear anything,

68
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.230
I understand what you're saying. Soon as you understand,

69
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:30.350
this is more of a political ploy. It's a.

70
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.670
<v 1>It's a gay, I care. As soon as you start, as soon as you're into gun control,</v>

71
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.230
I don't want to hear anything else. I think what's.

72
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.980
<v 2>Weird is boom. I that's, it you're done. Okay.</v>

73
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.660
But out of all the people in America.

74
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.740
<v 1>Like you gimme a choice of Bernie Sanders or Biden like that. These are.</v>

75
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.180
<v 2>The guys. Well, not the best. We have to seem like it's Bernie Sanders anymore.</v>

76
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.500
He's out. It seems like he's basically out. That's.

77
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.660
<v 1>Such a bummer. You know what? You know what they're not talking about.</v>

78
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.100
If they're not talking about what if I wouldn't be surprised if someone like's

79
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:00.570
so called experts said, Hey, listen,

80
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.370
if we eliminated all the tax scams going on throughout the

81
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.970
United States and all Congress,

82
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.730
we eliminated all that and really put our tax money to work.

83
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:13.930
And we had some tax tax force,

84
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.570
making sure that the tax money is siphoned out and scammed on and all these

85
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.080
scams, if we eliminate, I wouldn't be surprised if,

86
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.400
if we a straight flat tax of 15% would

87
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:30.240
cover everything beautifully. If it was just managed. No,

88
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:32.960
one's talking about managing. They're talking about raising taxes.

89
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.920
They're already stealing all our money and now you're gonna raise our taxes

90
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.670
more. Why don't we figure out who the of stealing all our money.

91
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.990
And then we worry about raising it, eliminated scams,

92
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.550
eliminate the scams, and then figure out, get,

93
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.910
I bet if we clean out the scams, I bet we're pet scams.

94
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.750
<v 2>To what are scams, what are scams they're scams going? Tell me what.</v>

95
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.060
<v 1>They are that cross money that Biden was bragging about on video,</v>

96
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.500
on the CFR that you could see on YouTube. Those are the scams.

97
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.261
<v 2>That are going on. Well,</v>

98
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:09.980
you're talking about them getting paid by foreign governments, right? Dude,

99
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:10.390
their.

100
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.540
<v 1>Scams, their scam, all our tax money is being scammed. So they're talking about,</v>

101
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.780
we need more tax money.

102
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.780
<v 2>But actually go to something Eddie like the tax money,</v>

103
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.810
like some something has to pay for the fire to depart.

104
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:23.090
Something has to pay to fix this tree.

105
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.690
For sure something has to pay a hundred percent I'm down with that.

106
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.490
But there of all those things, that's not what I'm talking about.

107
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.570
<v 1>It's tremendous. I'm talking about.</v>

108
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.610
There needs to be a task force that monitors where this money is

109
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:39.610
going and is, or people siphoning and scamming and well,

110
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.600
they certainly could be. We that's what they need to be to about.

111
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:43.121
They're talking about,

112
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:47.520
they're talking about more tax with obvious that we're being

113
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.440
scammed left and right with our money, our money's being scammed. We,

114
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:55.880
that should be top priority. Like who's stealing our money.

115
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.280
Let's have a task force. Let's figure out where all this tax money's going and,

116
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.160
and how all these politicians are writing these bills to siphon off

117
00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:09.800
money into their foundations. Let's look into that. And then I bet,

118
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.400
I bet when it's all said and done and we clean that out.

119
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.830
I bet if everyone just throws in 15% flat, everybody's good. It seems.

120
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.430
<v 2>Like everyone, Eddie, that seems like something, an economi,</v>

121
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.150
sit down fantasy with a mathematician and they'd have to work this out.

122
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.390
It would take months and months. That's my, that's a ridiculous thing to say.

123
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.430
No, no, I don't know if you're right. It's ridiculous.

124
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:31.950
15% ridiculous without knowing exactly how much everything costs,

125
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.950
knowing how much, 15% actually ism sand. Yes. It's.

126
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.180
<v 1>Ridiculous. There's all this dude. There's evidence of scams. You.</v>

127
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.820
<v 2>Scams. I believe that.</v>

128
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.980
<v 1>We could talk about some scams.</v>

129
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.660
<v 2>Going on. Okay. I'm sure there's out the open. I'm sure there's scams. You ever,</v>

130
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.593
you ever think about.

131
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.100
<v 1>You would save our money. They're scamming. That should be our number one.</v>

132
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.380
<v 2>Priority. I think it's mismanagement as much as it is. It's oh, no. It's.</v>

133
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.380
<v 1>A bunch of tax money. Who cares?</v>

134
00:06:56.381 --> 00:06:59.610
There's people looking at there's people looking after it. Okay.

135
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:03.770
That we should find out who the is monitoring all that.

136
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.570
It just seems like tax Mon is like a billion over there.

137
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.010
Have like a billion dollars over to that country aid. They,

138
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.050
they kick back 500 million into foundations

139
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.330
and that's what's going on right.

140
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.760
<v 2>Now. Yeah. Yeah. It, we know we, yeah, you're right. We're being scammed.</v>

141
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:23.840
Like there should be a way that you could get like an account of all the money

142
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.480
for goes. That should be number one. And then that should be all accounted.

143
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:29.360
And everyone should know that all the money's accounted for. It's not you just,

144
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:33.200
you can't be able to think about how much you you're, how much money save,

145
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:34.760
moving to Texas or Florida. Look.

146
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.560
<v 1>At all these politicians that are multi-millionaires. I don't.</v>

147
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.350
<v 2>I did. I do think about that. Are you aware? Are you.</v>

148
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.390
<v 1>Aware? You pay a good.</v>

149
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.190
<v 2>'Em amount to live? You know, you pay for what you get.</v>

150
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.390
<v 1>Are you aware that there's politicians out there that are with worth like 50</v>

151
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.990
million and a hundred.

152
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.990
<v 2>Million isn't Nancy Pelosi worth like don't Hopkins.</v>

153
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.990
They all have to be load to run. That's the game possible?

154
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.430
How was that possible? Well,

155
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:59.460
they got into business like Bloomberg before they got into, but that the game,

156
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.100
but if they made the money involved, that's sneak sketchy. Well,

157
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.300
a lot of them like Obama, Obama became rich after he left office.

158
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.180
That's when he became truly wealthy. Well what's scams scams going on. What's a,

159
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.060
but that's a different, that's not a tax scam. You know.

160
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.940
<v 1>What? Hold on a of.</v>

161
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.420
<v 2>Deals being around Eddie, come on, you gotta let other people talk.</v>

162
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.930
It's not a tax scam. That's a scam where he's getting paid to talk to bankers.

163
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:21.230
Correct.

164
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.970
And all these different people and they paid them hundreds of thousands of

165
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.730
dollars for all these speeches. Oh yeah. That's different. It's very scammy.

166
00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:29.450
That's a different scam. It's very scammy, but not, that was the wrong scam.

167
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.090
I'm sorry, but it's you were talking about taxes. No, no specifically.

168
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.050
<v 1>I'm sorry. I was all on the tax thing, but you're right. Different scam.</v>

169
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.770
My bad I'm agree. A scam.

170
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.440
<v 2>Still a scam. Oh listen. It's the Clinton foundation. The scam it's scam.</v>

171
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.520
All those things are scams. The salary in the white house is 400. Is it 400 now?

172
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.760
Uh, it's probably like that, but Trump doesn't take any of it. He's like,

173
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:51.400
you can keep it. He said this. He said, this place is a double.

174
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.560
I'll take this on the long con I'll take money. Dumb man.

175
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.320
Yeah. He's, he'll take that long money. &lt;laugh&gt; a long game darling. But no,

176
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.600
he has enough money Trump. He didn't have to do it.

177
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.680
They're so after him he's he didn't have to do it. They keep the he's gonna do,

178
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.520
let's do again after him. Is he gonna Trump

179
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.240
let
