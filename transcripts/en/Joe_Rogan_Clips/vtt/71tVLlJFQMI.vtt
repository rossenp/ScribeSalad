00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's the weird one, right?</v>

2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.190
When you like watch a movie and you're.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.100
<v 1>Like, ah, where the did that guy go? Like w.</v>

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.320
<v 0>Was the guy from the mummy? What the, his name? Brendan Frasier. Yes.</v>

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.930
That guy guy was you. Well.

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.790
<v 2>Brendan Frazier crashed my Saturday night live closing, you know,</v>

7
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.800
at the end of the go good night, everybody. This has been great.

8
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.600
Thanks for watching. And everybody's there.

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.830
He showed up and was screaming the name of his movie that was opening that

10
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:28.664
weekend.

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.740
<v 3>But dazzled, dazzled. No, I was like,</v>

12
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:34.574
what the.

13
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.690
<v 2>Happening? Who are you? Why are you Brendan Frazier? What are you doing here?</v>

14
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.130
But dad's old. Whoa. Don't know to this day. Don't know what it was about.

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.240
Maybe that's what sunk them, but does all, maybe that's what did it could've.

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.020
<v 0>Been that mentality? Like that's not a healthy mindset.</v>

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.470
<v 2>I think what happened probably is he,</v>

18
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.080
they were going to work him into a sketch that got cut

19
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.200
to promote bedazzled, probably some studio, some back room smoke-filled room.

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.450
And then he was like, well, I'm going to go out there.

21
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.620
And he's probably a little drunk, many of y'all bedazzled anyway old.

22
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.600
<v 0>But that guy was a giant movie star.</v>

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100
<v 2>He was huge, massive, huge Matt and the mummy was mad.</v>

24
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.000
<v 0>Massive mass. I just watched it. I told you, um,</v>

25
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.650
my me and my family watched Tommy boy. No, we went on a,

26
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.530
we were doing family movie night because of the quarantine we watched,

27
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:29.750
like almost every night we watched a new movie.

28
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:33.200
I watched all the Adam Sandler movies watch a load of Eddie Murphy movies.

29
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.680
We watched the mummy watch couple of the mummies and we watched Tommy boy.

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.270
How did, how did Tommy boys stand up in, holds up? Does it hold up?

31
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.840
Funny movie, Matt, funny moments. Awesome. God.

32
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.070
<v 1>Chris. As far as it was good, bro was.</v>

33
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.110
<v 2>An and a great actor. My, my, uh,</v>

34
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:57.080
among all my regrets about Chris's passing was where he

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.600
would have gone as a, as a, as a, as an actor,

36
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.520
because he was cute as spade spades. The same they're acting in that movie.

37
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.680
Forget the funny, which is great. But like,

38
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:10.580
they're like legitimate acting moments in that movie. Yes. And,

39
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.780
and I think that's why it, it, it has the staying power,

40
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:19.070
but Chris was really going to develop into a, into a real serious actor. A good,

41
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.620
a good one. I think it was such a powerhouse.

42
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.900
<v 0>When he would go, look at, you.</v>

43
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.930
<v 4>Got this two idiots. I.</v>

44
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.020
<v 2>Like the, the part of the movie where we're spayed looks at me and goes, Hey,</v>

45
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.630
Lee Harvey. Cause I do my hair does look like Lee Harvey, Oswald.

46
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.170
He was awesome, man. That's the cow tipping scene, which, um, I was, uh,

47
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.180
I pitched to the writers. They had never heard of it. And it made.

48
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.240
<v 0>It into the movie who was your mom's slash girlfriend again? Oh,</v>

49
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.830
Derek that's right.

50
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.620
<v 2>Well, that was a great thing. Cause we, we, um, you know,</v>

51
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:54.680
she Bo Derek and her husband, John famous,

52
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:59.500
John Derek was very protective of her and she hadn't worked in a long time

53
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.060
and um,

54
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.740
he made her cut all her hair off the day before she showed up on the set of

55
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.070
Tommy boy. So what we, we thought we were getting Bo Derek from,

56
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.990
from 10 with the hair and she showed up with hair. That's basically my,

57
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.760
my length now. Cause, cause John made her do it. Why did he make her do it?

58
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.070
I mean, you can do the math. I think he was like,

59
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.160
I want you to keep you up in standing Inez, riding horses with me.

60
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.070
I need you to be a movie star again. Oh.

61
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.290
<v 5>But she was so lovely. She's the best. She's.</v>

62
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.310
<v 2>A really smart, um, really smart, um,</v>

63
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.210
just great woman. And um, I mean, I got to kiss Bo Derek. I mean.

64
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.020
<v 0>Yeah. I know I'm for people that don't know like what she was in 10. Oh my God.</v>

65
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.410
But she was the original white girl with cornrows when it was okay.

66
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.160
You couldn't get canceled for that. But yeah.

67
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.700
<v 2>She would have been that she would have been canceled in a heartbeat.</v>

68
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:55.470
She was the original I'm Gigi Hadid.

69
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.940
How about that as a reference? Is that in my cool and young now I.

70
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.070
<v 0>Missed it. I don't, I've heard that name before,</v>

71
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:06.570
but it was her dad got sued because he built a house that's too big. No permits.

72
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.553
Yeah.

73
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.720
<v 2>No, no. I know. Nope, absolutely no permits.</v>

74
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.570
<v 0>It's way too big. And the neighbors are worried. It's going to fall on them.</v>

75
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.840
Yeah, exactly. It's still there. Oh yeah, of course.

76
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:18.690
I haven't even figured out what to do with it. You know, there's lawsuits.

77
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.760
Don't look at Bo back in the day. Woo. How about the one on the left?

78
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.630
Go to that one. Can't nips power. Google.

79
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.750
<v 2>I'm going back. I'm going to go back and do a deeper dive on this.</v>

80
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.350
<v 0>She was hot as. Well, perfect bone structure, right?</v>

81
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.460
<v 2>Yeah, she was, she was amazing. And Tommy, you know, the thing about Farley was,</v>

82
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.623
um.

83
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.853
<v 4>He.</v>

84
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.200
<v 2>He and spade used to fight over me.</v>

85
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.670
Like I was the girl probably because let's face it,

86
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.090
it kind of look like gold and certain lighting. Um, and uh, they'd be like,

87
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.050
I heard you in the jacuzzi with Rob last night. Yeah. Oh,

88
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.560
we didn't call me well and they would, they, they would like fight. It was,

89
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.210
it was very funny and sweet. One night I took, uh, I took the gang out to

90
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.630
barbarians steakhouse in Toronto. Great steak.

91
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:07.464
I don't know if they're still there.

92
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.270
Chris ordered two bone in two bone in state. Uh,

93
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.010
porterhouse steaks ate both of them,

94
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.690
but on top of each bite he put a cube of butter.

95
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.430
And when I looked at him like, what the.

96
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.770
<v 4>Are you doing? He was like, it needs a hat.</v>

97
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.850
So if you want to put a hat on your steak.

98
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.800
<v 0>Some people just genuinely don't give a. No given. Yeah, obviously.</v>

99
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.370
Yeah. He's a wild man. I met him once on the set of a news radio.

100
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:44.970
He's partying with Andy Dick. He showed up gray,

101
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.740
like wet cardboard. He looked gray and I'm like, Hey man. He's like,

102
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.170
it was just, he was gone. Oh, it was, it was sad. It was weird.

103
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.250
He had gray skin. And I remember thinking, Jesus Christ,

104
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.210
Chris Farley has gray skin. Like what's going on? Like he was sweaty and just,

105
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.330
just all up. Yeah.

106
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.630
<v 2>He, he had major, major demons. Uh,</v>

107
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.160
and a lot of us really worked, you know, were, were worked out for yeah.

108
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.210
But you know, it's some people can't, they can't make that leap, man. That is.

109
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.490
<v 0>Who is the, I always wonder about guys like that. That are so powerful. Like,</v>

110
00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:25.990
is it the demons that made him so good? He was so good. So good.

111
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.460
He would go ape. I mean, he had the horsepower. He had,

112
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:31.780
it was so stunning.

113
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.430
Like when you have these scenes where he would just go crazy. It was so fun.

114
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.590
I would wonder like, what is, is that same thing?

115
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.960
What makes him, I mean, cause it was so real.

116
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.340
Is that what made him just go crazy with Coke and go crazy with everything else?

117
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.110
I think like normal.

118
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.370
<v 2>People, like, I don't see a lot of normal people drawn. Well,</v>

119
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:58.960
why would any normal person want to be in entertainment? Right. Right.

120
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.603
Why would they,

121
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.620
so I think just by default damaged people

122
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.940
or people with more, more,

123
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:11.590
more articulately people with a hole to fill are drawn to

124
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.460
entertainment to fill the hole and um,

125
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.870
yarns and some in some of the people who have other damage to rage, anger,

126
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:24.640
whatever it is. But without a question, the more normal someone is,

127
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:29.590
I know like, unfortunately the lesson, right?

128
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.603
You're find that though.

129
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.130
Like you're out of you have you're at dinner or whatever. And they're like,

130
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.980
I'm this. And they're like really, really nice and really, really decent.

131
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:38.650
And I'd go, I wish you were crazy and damaged like me. Cause then.

132
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.870
<v 4>You really? And then we can have a fun conversation. Well, that's absolutely.</v>

133
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.670
<v 0>The case with comedians. Like my favorite people are all completely up.</v>

134
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.470
<v 2>Have you ever met it? Can you think a normal,</v>

135
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.940
decent well-rounded unfucked up person? Who's hilarious.

136
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.980
<v 0>No, I'll tell you real quick</v>

137
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.080
right now.

138
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.570
Now the humor is a big part of humor is saying things that are radically

139
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.160
inappropriate. Okay.
