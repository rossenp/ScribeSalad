his Imperial wizard, Rob whoa, right here. And, and, um,

12
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.700
he gave you, his robe gave me his Rob, cuz he no longer believes in stands for.

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.980
Wow. And um, and how many.

14
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.940
<v 0>Years did it take that? There it is. How many years did it take before you?</v>

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.660
Just by being around him and talking to him? Um.

16
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.220
<v 1>For him it was probably like around maybe six and a half, seven.</v>

17
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.380
<v 0>Six.</v>

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.980
<v 1>And a half, seven years now, some something it's it is a matter of months,</v>

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.330
a matter of a year, two years. And.

20
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.050
<v 0>So what do you do to just talk? Is that the hat? That's the hood. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.050
<v 1>Oh Jesus. And you see, this is, this top part is the hood and this, uh,</v>

22
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:12.530
lower portion here is what's called the,

23
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.610
the mask and members who want anonymity.

24
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.450
They don't want you to know who they are. They wear this mask,

25
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:23.280
which is attached by three snaps or Velcro. Just remove it. They don't care.

26
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:25.560
And the face is exposed as you saw in that picture.

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.920
<v 0>Um, so what, what is it like you said you guys got closer,</v>

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.120
you said you became more and more friends. You started visiting each other.

29
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.680
Yeah. And did he ever say, you know, I'm starting to think this is. Yeah,

30
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.600
pretty much. How, how did he say it? Um.

31
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.750
<v 1>He called me up one day &lt;affirmative&gt; and he told me, uh, I, I got some, I,</v>

32
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.070
I wanna talk to you about, and I said, okay. He goes, you,

33
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:50.630
you wanna meet for dinner? I said, sure.

34
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.030
So I drove it to Frederick and met him and he sat me there. He said, you know,

35
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.870
um, I'm quitting, Mclan, I'm leading it. And.

36
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.703
<v 0>He's the top dog.</v>

37
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.500
<v 1>It top dog. He gave it all up and here's the thing. Um,</v>

38
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.900
he did a smart thing. He did a good thing. He didn't hand it down.

39
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.620
He shut it down. Wow. Yeah. Um.

40
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.060
<v 0>You know, did he convince the other people in the clan that.</v>

41
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.700
<v 1>Well, they had their choice to do whatever they wanted to do. Right.</v>

42
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.220
A lot of them left. A lot of them left as well.

43
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.370
Then there were those who tried to keep it going, but you know, but failed.

44
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.610
<v 0>Did he use you as an example when he was speaking to them? They, they.</v>

45
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.490
<v 1>Knew why he, he did it. Uh, he received some hate mail.</v>

46
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:35.610
He began receiving some hate mail from,

47
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.090
from some of his own members anonymously,

48
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.450
the same kind of hate mail that at one time he would send out to people,

49
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.200
anonymous would now come back to him, you know, uh, you know,

50
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.960
you are in bed with darl Davis, you're a lover, all that kind of stuff,

51
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.000
unsigned, you know, the same stuff that he would put out to other people. Uh,

52
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.440
and so he, he began seeing himself in the mirror, you know, underst I'm saying,

53
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.800
so that was, that was very crucial. Um, and, and I, I,

54
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.720
I have repeated this process many times with different people. Um.

55
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.480
<v 0>What did, what is the process do you, when, like,</v>

56
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.080
when you're talking about like the Charles Murray stuff, the bell curve stuff,

57
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.240
how do you refute that? What are you saying to him?

58
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.470
<v 1>I'm saying to him, look, Mr. Murray,</v>

59
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.070
anytime you wanna prove something, you find something that fits your narrative.

60
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.950
Yes. You can find some, some black person who has a very low IQ. Okay. If, if,

61
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:34.710
if I'm gonna, if, if I work for Ford and, and, and I want,

62
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.390
and I wanna prove that my car is better than Chevrolet,

63
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.980
then I'm gonna find this Chevrolet that doesn't, that doesn't run very well. Mm.

64
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.860
You know, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna do it that way. So I, I refuteed Mr. Murray's and,

65
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:51.660
and his, uh, his partner with two guys who wrote the book, um, uh, their,

66
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:56.220
their, their documentation and, and, uh, and see, they,

67
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.610
they, they go by things that they can see and understand.

68
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.530
I'm gonna give you an example of something that, that that's going, uh,

69
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.930
help you understand this Cyclop was riding around in my car one day with

70
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:12.650
me, he's sitting in my passenger seat. Right. And we're driving,

71
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.610
I'm driving along. And somehow we got on the topic of, uh,

72
00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:21.480
of black crime and he made a statement. He said,

73
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.800
well, you know, you know, we all know, uh, they say that, you know, again,

74
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:29.520
that vape authority, yeah. Say that, um, that, uh,

75
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.040
black people have a gene in them that makes them violent.

76
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.840
And I'd heard that before from other Klan people,

77
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.560
that's one of their narratives and, uh, you know,

78
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.030
the wild black Savage kind of thing. And, uh, I said,

79
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:44.910
what are you talking about? He says, well,

80
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:48.070
who's doing all the drive-bys and carjackings in Southeast,

81
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.190
he was referring to Southeast Washington, DC,

82
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.750
which is a predominantly black area. Some whites live there.

83
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.670
It's predominantly black, very high crime written. I said,

84
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.540
okay, it's black people. I said,

85
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.780
but that's what lives there. I said,

86
00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:09.020
who's doing all the crime in bangorma white people,

87
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.740
because that's what lives there. I said, you know,

88
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.860
you're not even considering the demographics. He's like, no, no, no, no,

89
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.340
you all have this gene, blah, blah, blah. So, you know, he's gonna shut me down.

90
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.850
And um, I said, look, he's right here. I said, look,

91
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.530
I'm as black as anybody. You know, I said,

92
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.130
I have never done a drive by, I have never done a carjacking.

93
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.490
How do you explain that this man did not wait one second.

94
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.880
He answered me like that. He said, your gene is latent. Hasn't come out yet.

95
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.320
&lt;laugh&gt; how do you argue with somebody who's that far in that field, right?

96
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.200
I mean, you can't even bite into that and chew on it. Right?

97
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.280
So I'm dumbfounded and I'm speechless. I'm just driving along. He's over here,

98
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.280
all smuggling. You see nothing to say.

99
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.560
So I thought about it and I said, you know, they say,

100
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.880
I use his, his authority. I said,

101
00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:08.160
they say that all white people have a gene that makes them a serial killer.

102
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.400
He said, how do you figure that? I said,

103
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.750
name me three black serial killers. He couldn't do it. It,

104
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.350
I said, here, I'm gonna give you one. I named one for him. I said, here, just,

105
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.110
just name me two. He couldn't do it. I said, Charles Manson,

106
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.670
Jeffrey Dahmer, Henry Lee Lucas. John Wayne.

107
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.350
Gayacy Albert DeSalvo the Boston strangler. Ted Bundy, uh, uh,

108
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.100
David beerit son, Sam ed gain Henry Lee. Lucas. Edguien right.

109
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.180
Ed Gean and his crazy machine is the skin people. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay.

110
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.580
I said, son, they're all white.

111
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.980
&lt;laugh&gt; you you're a serial killer. &lt;laugh&gt; it'slaant. Yeah. And,

112
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:53.700
and he said, well, Dar, I've never killed anybody. I said,

113
00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:57.180
your Gina latent hasn't come out yet. Oh, he goes, he goes, well, that's stupid.

114
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.130
I said, well, duh. I said, you're right. It is stupid. I said,

115
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:05.250
but it's no more stupid for me to say that about you than what you said about

116
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.370
me. And he got very quiet, but I mean,

117
00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:13.570
you could almost see it, Joe, his wheels were tears, spinning tears. And, um,

118
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:16.850
he's thinking about it. And then he changed the subject tears,

119
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:21.000
but within four or five months, he left the clan. Wow.

120
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.920
Based on that conversation. Wow.

121
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.800
And his robe was the very first robe I ever got. Wow.

122
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.240
<v 0>So he came to you and gave you the robe. He said that conversation.</v>

123
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.920
<v 1>With you. Well, well, first he said, uh, no,</v>

124
00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:36.160
he didn't come to me and gimme the robe. He, uh, he called me and, uh, and he,

125
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.750
uh, uh, I was gonna be up in that, in that area. And he, and uh, he said,

126
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:40.630
you want, you want to get together?

127
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:43.390
And I got together with him and he went to go over to the courthouse for

128
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:44.990
something, uh, he'd been in some kind of trouble.

129
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:46.430
He went to go pick up something with the courthouse.

130
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.390
So I gave him a ride over there and he told me he was,

131
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.150
he was gonna quit the clan, you know? And he,

132
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:54.950
he thought a lot about what I'd said. And um, I said,

133
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.750
what are you gonna do with your stuff? He said, trash it. I said, I said, no,

134
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.940
Don, don't, don't trash it. I said, give it to me. And he says, you want,

135
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.580
you want my rib and all my CLA stuff? And I said, yeah, he goes,

136
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.660
why, why would you want that? I didn't know why, but something told me,

137
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.620
just take it there. I'll just take it. Um, and I said, uh, I,

138
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.260
I don't know what I'm gonna do with it. But see, I said, yeah, I do want it.

139
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.690
So we went back to his apartment now I'd never been in his apartment.

140
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:25.330
Cause I hadd met him outside, outside in the driveway or whatever,

141
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.010
a parking lot. And he said, come on in. And uh,

142
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:32.490
so I I'm walking up the stairs with him to his apartment. I'm thinking,

143
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.810
you know, I hope I'm not getting set up here, you know,

144
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.810
but I walked on in and his fiance was sitting on the couch. Clanswoman,

145
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.920
that's seen her before and, uh,

146
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.720
sat down and talked with her and he went down the hall to his room and he came

147
00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:49.080
back with, when he came back, he got a hefty trash bag.

148
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.040
Went back there again and came back with this trash bag, all loaded up,

149
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.800
had his robe, his hood, a clan belt buckle. They have a C clam belt buckle.

150
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.400
Oh yeah. They got clan tie clips, all kinds of stuff, man. And, um, uh,

151
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.760
his certificate of membership, um,

152
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.800
all kinds of stuff and this bat and gave it to me. And um, I said, okay,

153
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:13.800
thank you. You know? And I, I didn't know why I wanted it,

154
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:18.070
but I just knew I your have, uh, well, first of all, it is history. Okay.

155
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.870
Um, and you don't destroy history. The good, the bad, the ugly,

156
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:24.350
and the shameful is still American history.

157
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.230
And the KKK I've said it before is as American as baseball,

158
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:32.830
apple pie and Chevrolet, you know, it's, it's a shameful part of our history,

159
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.020
but it is our history. Nonetheless, I know what I'm doing this stuff. Uh,

160
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:37.781
I got my five. Oh,

161
00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:41.140
one&lt;unk [inaudible] I'm gonna have a museum one day and put all this stuff in

162
00:09:41.141 --> 00:09:41.880
there. Wow.

163
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.900
<v 0>What's a five. Oh one&lt;.</v>

164
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.620
<v 1>Ckunk so it makes you tax exempt. Oh yeah.</v>

165
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.900
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; KKK conversion museum. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

166
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.820
You can have pictures of you with the dudes right next to the robe and each one.

167
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.530
Oh yeah.

168
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.610
<v 1>That that's amazing. Uh, most of them, most of them I do. And so, um,</v>

169
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.050
I began collecting all this kind of stuff. Um, this is,

170
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.250
well here. Lemme show you this one. This is a, uh, grand dragon robe. Gr um,

171
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.850
green is the sign for the grand dragon. And, uh,

172
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.690
there you go. That a little Confederate flags here,

173
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.960
you LAN patches who's is that who gave you that? This guy,

174
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.320
Bob white, Robert White,

175
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.960
Robert White used to be the grand dragon of Maryland for another clan group,

176
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.880
which was a rival to Roger Kelly's group. All right. Um,

177
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.440
when I, uh, when I first heard of Bob white, I was in my late teen.

178
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.310
And, um, he, I heard, I heard about him on the news.

179
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.590
He had been busted arrested and, uh, put in jail,

180
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:51.110
uh, for conspiring to bomb a synagogue in Baltimore, up on Liberty road,

181
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:55.630
the Liberty roads, uh, synagogue. And, uh, he was convicted.

182
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:57.340
He went to prison for 40 years.

183
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.260
This is before I started writing the book all the time. So I,

184
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:04.500
I just remembered him. And then, uh, he got out after doing his time,

185
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.220
continued running the clan, and then some years later he got busted again,

186
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.780
assault with intent to murder two black men with a shotgun. All right,

187
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.090
now understand something, a &lt;affirmative&gt; as a plan leader,

188
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.410
you don't make any money or not a lot,

189
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:25.410
unless you're embezzling money from the dues. And a lot of people do that.

190
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.450
That's what causes theseliner groups. Um,

191
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.850
if you're a leader like a wizard or a dragon,

192
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.570
you might get like a small stipend out of the dues,

193
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.610
but not enough to pay your rent or put food in your table.

194
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.440
So you have to have a regular job, you know, CyOps wizard, dragon,

195
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.800
whatever. These are all just titles, like boy scout leader.

196
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.440
You have to have a regular job to pay your rent and mortgage.

197
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.680
This man's regular job when he was doing all this nonsense, uh,

198
00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:59.160
bombing places and stuff. Baltimore city police, officer, whoa,

199
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.480
this is his police officer uniform. Okay. Yeah.

200
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.440
He was not an undercover cop in the Klan gathering intelligence.

201
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.270
He was a bonafide Klansman on the Baltimore city PO a least force.

202
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.950
Okay. Uh, and there are more, there are more okay. Um,

203
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.830
but he went on, this guy was vehemently,

204
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.630
vehemently anti-semimatic and racist and very, very violent. Um,

205
00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:30.390
but he went on to become one of my best friends. And, um,

206
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.420
he gave me his Glen robe, HES police uniform. Cause you know,

207
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.060
I do a lot of lecturing all over the country and stuff. Did.

208
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.900
<v 0>He quit the police force?</v>

209
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.500
<v 1>Uh, he was forced to quit the police force or be fired the police force,</v>

210
00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:46.420
Baltimore city police force. I mean, E even just last year, they,

211
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:50.100
they had a consent decree from the, um, department of justice against them.

212
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.260
They are very racist and very corrupt. Um,

213
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.130
&lt;affirmative&gt; what they would do is they would turn a blind eye to the Klansmen

214
00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:01.450
on the force. Cause, you know, as, as a police officer,

215
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.930
you're not allowed to belong to any subverive groups. All right.

216
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.090
They would turn a blind eye as long as the guys would not bring

217
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.050
unwarranted attention to the, to the department. Mm. You know, just keep,

218
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.320
keep your stuff, you know, whatever. Well, you know, he, he would,

219
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.720
he would end up getting busted for, for planning a bomb near a synagogue and uh,

220
00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:25.680
and you know, firing a shotgun and all that kind of stuff at black people. Um,

221
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.560
so they, they, you know, they gave, you know, Hey, you know, you gotta,

222
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.720
you gotta, you gotta retire or you put off the force, uh, you know,

223
00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:35.470
you you're causing us too much, uh, publicity. This.

224
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.390
<v 0>Is before he left the clan. Yeah. So what did he do after he did that?</v>

225
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.310
He had to get another job while he was talking. He.

226
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.670
<v 1>Got another job. He began, um, dealing in, uh, homeming pigeons. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

227
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.990
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; dude, that's a,</v>

228
00:13:51.991 --> 00:13:55.980
these people have plan ridiculous way to train information.

229
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.620
It's perfect for someone who's in something.

230
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.220
<v 1>Like the clown, but, um, you know, I mean, you, you have to work. Yeah.</v>
