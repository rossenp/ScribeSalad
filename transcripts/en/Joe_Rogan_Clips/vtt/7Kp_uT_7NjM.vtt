00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.890
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How did it laptop?</v>

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.430
How did this laptop become this big store? That's where it gets tricky. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:12.290
I'm curious because supposedly he dropped it off at a

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.830
top repair shop in Delaware. I mean, who's well crack head, right? Right.

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.350
The guys smoking crack, keep forgetting. He smokes crack. Well,

6
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:24.350
he did at the time, he apparently kicked it. So congratulations to him.

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.020
<v 1>But the guy who had some.</v>

8
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.150
<v 0>Problems with this is self admitted.</v>

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.070
<v 1>And they have the receipts and here's the thing. He calls him dozens of times,</v>

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.830
everybody knows what you bring a laptop or anything. And they say,

11
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.110
if you don't pay for this, we're going to wipe it and sell it.

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.830
And so three months goes by six months, goes by. Nobody ever comes against it.

13
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:45.680
The guy goes to look at it at the repair, shop the owner.

14
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.930
And there's all these 25,000 files.

15
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.810
What looks like underage girls and all the rest of this crazy stuff.

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.190
And him smoking crack, or God knows what he gives her. The FBI Ray does nothing.

17
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.110
The director hides it from Trump.

18
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.920
And so people let's just say inside that had copies of that,

19
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.790
they leak it to Rudolph Giuliani, who then now has started to put it out.

20
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:08.660
So instead of sort of facing up to it, they just say anyone promoting this,

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.380
whether it's the house or Senate committees that were linking to it or the New

22
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.670
York post or the president's press secretary, you're now banned, which again,

23
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:20.360
shows it's it's election meddling. It's gatekeeping to cover this up,

24
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:25.100
but I'll tell you what else has come out now. His daughter Biden's daughters,

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.580
uh, purportedly reportedly, and they've not denied it. Now,

26
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.180
this broke three days ago, left her diary in a house that she had rented.

27
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.440
And the diary talks about all the same stuff and everything.

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.083
<v 2>So.</v>

29
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.680
<v 1>Is wrong with jump in, hold on us the whole way. When I was looking.</v>

30
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.900
<v 3>Into this, the thing I keep seeing people say is that he lived.</v>

31
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.050
<v 0>In California, in California at the time. That is true. That's what I keep.</v>

32
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.860
<v 1>Reading. They fly back and forth to Delaware, jet setters. They fly to Ukraine.</v>

33
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.430
And that also.

34
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.100
<v 0>Might make sense that that's why he didn't go back to Delaware to pick up the</v>

35
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:57.590
laptop. Because when you're cracked out in California,

36
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:58.820
it's really hard to make the flight.

37
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.070
<v 2>Right. Tim is the.</v>

38
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.520
<v 1>Only one here who's got confirms. They have the lights on to confirm.</v>

39
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.090
It's not an easy flight coming down off cocaine or crack.

40
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.580
<v 0>Yeah. Have you smoked crack or you freebase cocaine,</v>

41
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:15.950
which is basically the stats close. How close is it?

42
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.940
<v 1>Not, not as close as where I ever went and made shady deals in the Ukraine.</v>

43
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.060
Well, that's never done that. That's in the emails finally where it's like,

44
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:29.390
yeah, 30 million part of it goes to the big guy. They're like, okay,

45
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:30.410
we want to meet with your dad.

46
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:33.680
And there's photos of them meeting and playing golf. So let me tell you,

47
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.160
this is real. The FBI has the files. They admit it's real. It's.

48
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.340
<v 0>A big deal, but it's a real problem to ban this stuff from Twitter,</v>

49
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.540
hootin rejects Donald Trump's criticism of Biden family business. Well,

50
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.470
because it's, Russia's bribing hunter Biden.

51
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.290
<v 1>Repriced 5 million through through Putin,</v>

52
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.550
through the Moscow mayor who he's friends with 200 Biden again. Well,

53
00:02:55.551 --> 00:03:00.340
if I was Putin, I would deny it too. Listen, Putin has got to this. If I.

54
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 0>Was Putin sitting back watching these people,</v>

55
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:07.600
eat themselves alive and destroy the first amendment destroyed democracy.

56
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.130
And I'm sure they have a hand in it. I'm sure China has an hand in it.

57
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:13.810
I'm sure Iran has a hand.

58
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.640
This is what the intelligence communities have been telling us for a long time

59
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:22.660
now is that it's not just one foreign company or foreign country.

60
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.770
That's trying to with our democracy.

61
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.550
<v 1>The idea that the Russians have a monopoly on this now. I mean,</v>

62
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.350
the Russians were an NFL football team.

63
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:34.890
They'd be like the lower third and by the U S and China at the top. And.

64
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.120
<v 0>We should say, we should say the United States does it too. Shorts,</v>

65
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.800
a hundred percent confirmed. You know.

66
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.880
<v 1>The idea that Russians got Trump in his asinine because here's what happens.</v>

67
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.010
Notice they tried to impeach Trump just nine months ago for Stephan Ukraine

68
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.880
because whatever they are worried about they project. Okay?

69
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.170
So Trump doesn't have Russia connections. Trump doesn't have those connections.

70
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.980
Trump doesn't have those outside connections. You can't buy him.

71
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:03.090
He doesn't have lobbyists.

72
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.340
The problem is he then has family and people around him that basically become

73
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:11.610
lobbyists for themselves. And Trump isn't really even aware of it.

74
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.110
And then that's going on. And I mean,

75
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:16.980
even junior aides now you'll find out how people giving them millions of

76
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:20.340
dollars. You just to say something to the president is this standard.

77
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.010
<v 0>Is this just standard? How politics have always been done?</v>

78
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:24.270
It's just now we're seeing it.

79
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.650
<v 1>Well, it was standard.</v>

80
00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:28.500
Let's say 200 years ago that you'd go out for the Y for the brother or,

81
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.670
or somebody who works at the lighthouse.

82
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.430
It got organized last a hundred years with lobbyist.

83
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.530
Trump literally cut the lobbyist off,

84
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.750
but all it did was now make everyone around him,

85
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:40.110
a lobbyist they're not officially a lobbyist. How did he cut the lobbyists off?

86
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.150
He just stopped meeting with them and stopped and just said,

87
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.920
I want briefings on what's going on, on all the side.

88
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.280
So that's why he official Washington off, not these even perfect,

89
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:50.430
but that he actually became the president for making decisions himself instead

90
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:54.240
of having consortium's and lobbyists pay him for policy. That's why he says,

91
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.440
Biden's raise more money than me.

92
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:58.740
Of course I can call up all these companies they'll give me any money I want,

93
00:04:58.741 --> 00:04:59.670
but I got to do what they say.

94
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.830
<v 0>But it would put him in a compromised position. Yes.</v>

95
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.180
<v 1>But I'm being honest about it.</v>

96
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.070
The vacuum and the blind spot is that then everyone

97
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.530
around him in his cabinet and everyone that works there,

98
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.670
even down to mid-level people are now getting multi-million dollar contracts for

99
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:19.620
companies like at and T and stuff. Just to, just to just even mention something.

100
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.120
<v 0>You said at and T this has been proven to the T T and T,</v>

101
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.240
or are you just saying at and T like companies, like.

102
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.420
<v 1>I'm not saying ATG is bad. I think, I think he's overall good.</v>

103
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.250
<v 0>Company, but is at and T doing something bad.</v>

104
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.760
<v 1>No, I just, I was mentioning that as a fortune 500.</v>

105
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.200
<v 0>Okay. But it's not 18 T no, it's not 18. So we shouldn't say that. See,</v>

106
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:42.450
this is why you need someone. That's like a fact checker.

107
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.280
<v 1>Right? Well, no, no. The slow down the media will say I'm wrong about that,</v>

108
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:51.960
but okay. But no, no. Hold on his personal lawyer, his personal lawyer,

109
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:54.690
the one that ended up going to jail, actually, Michael Cohen,

110
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.320
Michael Cohen was getting money from at and T go ahead and pull up.

111
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.450
I was just trying to give you a gestalt.

112
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.590
<v 0>Analysis. I, I, but I just want to, I've told you before,</v>

113
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:06.280
what you really need on your show is like a legit journalist who's right next to

114
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:07.840
you with a laptop going Alex.

115
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.150
<v 1>Hold on, hold on. Just slow down. But I think.</v>

116
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.700
<v 0>You're right about that because you get so much, right.</v>

117
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.410
But when you get something wrong,

118
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.180
that's 18 T confirms it paid Trump lawyer. Michael Cohen's company.

119
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.920
<v 1>Yeah, no, I remember that. See, Joe,</v>

120
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.450
they're always saying that I'm making stuff they're lying right now.

121
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.190
Every once in a while, my memory that used to be photographic,

122
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:28.990
but from everything I've done, it's not as good as it used to be.

123
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.310
It moves really quick. Okay. So when I'm saying stuff, it's just data knowledge.

124
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.220
Okay. And then I can like, okay. Yeah. Did I say that? Yeah, it's real.

125
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:39.100
Check it out, but I'm not trying to make stuff up. 99% of the time.

126
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.550
<v 0>Here it is at and T confirm Tuesday evening that paid president Trump's personal</v>

127
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:46.690
lawyer, Michael Cohen in 2017 for in quotes insights,

128
00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:51.370
into understanding the new administration insights.

129
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.770
I love that. Um, so how much do they pay him?

130
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:58.000
200,000 bucks in four separate payments of 50 bucks in late 2017,

131
00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.350
early 2018 interest.

132
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.371
<v 1>But he got paid.</v>

133
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:04.330
I think the number was 10 million total from a handful of companies.

134
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.660
Shady.

135
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.370
<v 0>Look, [inaudible] alleged that essential consultants,</v>

136
00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:14.110
a shell company set up by Cohen before the election to pay stormy Daniels was

137
00:07:14.111 --> 00:07:15.940
paid by several corporations,

138
00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:20.890
including a T and T at the time at and T was seeking government approval for its

139
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:24.400
acquisition of time Warner CNN's parent company merger.

140
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.610
<v 1>Yeah, but I'm telling you at,</v>

141
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.510
and T is a sweetheart compared to Google and Facebook and Twitter and all these

142
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.430
people. So I wasn't attacking them.

143
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.290
I was giving the example of how everyone in his entourage becomes a lobbyist

144
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.200
because he thinks I'll just cut lobbyist off. He's not taking any money,

145
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.350
but then everyone around him becomes a lobbyists. That's what he said.

146
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.050
<v 4>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

147
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.200
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

148
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:55.630
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

149
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:59.320
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

150
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.340
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

151
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.170
That's all we're asking is go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
