00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.990
<v 2>People who are from there who come to America, who understand the dangers of it.</v>

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.340
They it's, it's a very eerie warning. Yeah. You know,

4
00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:12.270
I had Melissa Channon on my podcast. She.

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.190
<v 0>Was describing let's follow her. She's great. She's.</v>

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.510
<v 1>Really great. Yeah. But her worries about China or, you know,</v>

7
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.110
like a lot of people are like, yeah, yeah, yeah. But like, no, no, no. She,

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.370
she really actually understands what the dangers are and that's the dangers of

9
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.630
accepting authoritarianism authoritarianism in this country is like,

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.130
there's a lot of people that like it, because it's silence is their opponents,

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.121
right. Like,

12
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.840
this is what's going on right now with like parlors getting shut down and you

13
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:44.700
know, Amazon pulls it from their servers and then apple pulls it off of their,

14
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.880
uh, app store. And then Google pulls it off the Google play store.

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.990
And everybody's like, yeah, good. They're spreading hate like, Hm,

16
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.240
what percentage is spreading? Hey, like what's the numbers. And is this,

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.400
is this wise that we shut down all discourse that you agree with? Like, yeah.

18
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.910
It's,

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
it's not good if someone gets on there and they they're talking about violence

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.800
against the government or violence against individuals or,

21
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.370
or they're spreading racist ideas or whatever the they're doing.

22
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.930
That's that's that, that, that, that,

23
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:20.550
that disturbs people and angers people you're right. That's not good.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.650
But I do not think that the solution is to shut them down

25
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.460
because the real problem is that it, it sets a weird precedent.

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.660
It sets a precedent where the people that are in power can decide that something

27
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:38.040
is wrong, speak something is bad and you can just eliminate it completely. Yeah.

28
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.640
And then when things like that happen, they keep going.

29
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.950
They don't just stop at that.

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.700
They don't stop at things that we can all agree are terrible. They, they,

31
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.640
they go to things that maybe you don't think are terrible. Right.

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.170
But other people do think are terrible.

33
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.840
And then they keep going further than that. And you see this with the left,

34
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.900
like there's a lot of people that claim to be leftist,

35
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.960
they claim to be left wing, but they're not quite left wing enough.

36
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.130
And so they get taken out by people who are more left wing and it gets weird

37
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:06.240
because it becomes this like,

38
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:11.040
sort of like political ideological wrestling match for control of what,

39
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.520
what is the left? What is the center? Where's the right.

40
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.740
If you disagree with anything on the left, you're the right.

41
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.480
And you might be extreme. Right? Right.

42
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.030
<v 0>Yeah. No, the year Nazi. But I think what you're saying already happened,</v>

43
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.430
because with this incident, you're going like, okay,

44
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:30.960
we blame Donald Trump's the president, his rhetoric was kind of, you know,

45
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.040
you can interpret it as like, he kind of gave them license to go do that.

46
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.150
So it shouldn't the Bock, the buck stops with Donald Trump. Like Donald Trump,

47
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.520
that's even a little bit of a debatable thing. You're going,

48
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:44.760
like he was speaking legally, you're going like, that's a first amendment thing.

49
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.470
He was speaking. He said, peacefully, go over there.

50
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:47.850
There it's in turn gives mixed.

51
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.750
<v 1>Signals. Of course.</v>

52
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.913
<v 0>In my opinion.</v>

53
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.160
<v 1>He says, we have to be strong. You have to go March to the Capitol. Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.340
He gives mixed signals. And he says like, we have to do this correctly.

55
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:59.230
We have to respect our great country. Like, whoa, what was that?

56
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
You said the other day,

57
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.910
you said that they don't respect anything other than strength. Right.

58
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.080
Like you said,

59
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.190
go March towards the CA you're firing people up and you're firing people up

60
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.700
with, they live with their mom. They're in the basement. They have no job.

61
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.880
Their identity is a T entirely associated with this.

62
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.650
<v 0>Yeah, no, my opinion is that. But I'm saying legally it's debatable.</v>

63
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.810
Like what he said, you could argue in court,

64
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.720
but then the buck should stop there. I mean, it's already happening.

65
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.080
Where they going? Oh, no, let's take, let's take this opportunity to shut down.

66
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.720
Part of let's take the separate and they're going after Andy knows book.

67
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:34.510
Now let's get that out of stores. Let's uh, they,

68
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:38.230
they want to keep going because like, it's a, this orgy of kind of like,

69
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.800
let's shut down this stuff that leads to, and you're like, wait a second.

70
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.970
How can you prove it leads to that? I mean, idiots are gonna do what idiots do.

71
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.800
Like, and to me that was a coup attempt.

72
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.710
That was a coup attempt by guys who believe like,

73
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.160
that's what you'd expect a coup attempt would look like by guys who believe like

74
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.890
that. Hillary Clinton has shapeshifter and she turns into a reptile.

75
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.260
That's what you would imagine. It would look like, like, what are we doing?

76
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.890
Okay. Let's, let's go in there with Trump flags and take selfies. And.

77
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.960
<v 1>So it's so dumb and.</v>

78
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.600
<v 0>Let's go kidnap Nancy Pelosi with zip ties.</v>

79
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.310
<v 1>Stacks of zip ties, like more zip ties than there are members of the Senate.</v>

80
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.540
Yeah. If anything, it was just like an.

81
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.490
<v 0>Inept coup attempt. Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.110
<v 1>Well, it's losers. It's losers who decided that this is their moment in the sun.</v>

83
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.960
