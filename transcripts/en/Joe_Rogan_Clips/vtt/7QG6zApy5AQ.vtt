WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.190
<v 0>&lt;Inaudible&gt;.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 1>Yeah, but that's the thing I was saying is like, there's no,</v>

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.600
you're not allowed to have a nuanced opinion anymore. You just have to be like,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.520
no, I am absolutely, eh, I, you must believe all women.

5
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:17.880
Did you see that thing I posted the other day about it was, uh,

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.950
the me too backlash gonna come? No, I didn't see that. And uh.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.230
<v 0>How's it gonna come? What kind of backlash?</v>

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.390
<v 1>The backlash is the, on the, the on campus thing,</v>

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.990
the, the, basically like the Obama administration and Joe Biden, uh,

10
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.030
recommended these guidelines for title IX and, uh,

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.580
and they, so they recomme men of these guidelines for title IX, uh,

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.580
the basically protecting women on college campuses. But the problem is

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.900
they throw out due process. Like literally if a guy, the,

14
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.060
the idea is if you're con if you get, uh, accused, you're basically convicted,

15
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:01.300
right. Guy gets accused, he's thrown outta school. And it's like, well,

16
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.490
that's not due process. There were all these things that were like,

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.090
like I'd never thought about before. Like, cuz I, I wanna believe all,

18
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.970
you know what I mean? Like I, I wanna believe that if a woman,

19
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.690
I don't believe women have much reason to lie about.

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.130
<v 0>The. See, well that's not true. I don't believe that at all,</v>

21
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.850
because I believe there's a lot of women that have grudges in their

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.800
angryhmm&lt;affirmative&gt; and they, they want to make things up about men.

23
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.040
And I know men where that's happened to before I know men who've been fall

24
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.360
falsely accused of rape. Yeah.

25
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:32.960
And the woman dropped it and told the police that she was just mad at him. Yeah.

26
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:36.480
And she, she had a vendetta that happens. It doesn't happen a lot. Right.

27
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:36.880
That's.

28
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.680
<v 1>What, I mean know, I don't think it happens.</v>

29
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.550
I just think that that it's a minor. I think it's just I't know if it's.

30
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.990
<v 0>Mine or not. Anthony kumeia said something that's really, he goes,</v>

31
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.950
he goes calling all women. Liars is just as crazy as saying, all women say,

32
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.950
say the truth, right? Yeah. It's, that's true.

33
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:55.990
You're gonna have a certain percentage of human beings.

34
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.630
<v 1>That are deceptive, which is why I say 97% of women are liar. Ah.</v>

35
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.110
<v 0>No, I think it's, I mean, I don't wanna,</v>

36
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.460
I don't even want to spend about what the stats are.

37
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.060
The problem is if you're a person who didn't do anything to someone and then

38
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.380
they're accusing you of doing something to them and then it ruins your life.

39
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.340
That's devastating. Yeah. And that.

40
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.580
<v 1>Happens. The, so I've been having this conversation.</v>

41
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.060
I posted it and I put on Twitter, Hey, if I'm wrong, if this is wrong,

42
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.500
yell at me here. Okay, go ahead. And I was surprised by,

43
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.210
by how few people yelled.

44
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.410
No one really got mad because when you see what the recommendations were,

45
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.450
people believe in due process and the rule of law they should. And,

46
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.530
and they people know that mob mentalities are not

47
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.010
good and they're not American. I mean, they're not the spirit of American,

48
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.200
right? They're they are pretty American actually.

49
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.760
But like the they're not the letter of America. Um,

50
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.120
and it was kind of baffling that Obama

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.280
and the administration. So what's happening is,

52
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.200
so guys are getting kicked outta school. They're getting, you know what,

53
00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:06.080
these they're, the colleges are following the guidelines and uh,

54
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.920
due processes thrown away. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; guys get, you know,

55
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.680
thrown outta school, da, da, da. And then they Sue the school and guess what?

56
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.760
A lot of 'em are winning. Yeah, of course,

57
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.830
because it's unconstitutional what the school did. So it's this weird thing of,

58
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.590
uh, it's such a sticky situation.

59
00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:26.430
Cuz I was talk because the,

60
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:31.390
after I posted a few female friends of mine texted or called me and one

61
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.510
of 'em said, uh,

62
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.430
that she was at NYU and was having sex

63
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:42.540
with a guy he tried to, uh,

64
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.300
put in her. She was like, no, she said, no. He said, can I?

65
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.540
She said no. Um, and he did anyway.

66
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.700
She just froze and was like stunned, frozen, silent.

67
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.850
He finishes no alcohol. No. And it just becomes,

68
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.090
he said, she said mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's like, what,

69
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.330
what should we do in a society about a situation like that?

70
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.050
And I truly don't know. I truly am like I have no idea.

71
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.690
<v 0>Mm well, if she said no and he did it anyway, that's a real problem.</v>

72
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.510
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.920
<v 1>That's right. Yeah. That's rape. But, but what,</v>

74
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.920
but also then it just becomes what it's a, he said,

75
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.840
she said thing, right? There's no evidence. We needdetector. No, we,

76
00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:33.880
you know what I mean? Like we need.

77
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.000
<v 0>Real lie detectors. I mean, that's really the,</v>

78
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.040
in situations like this where it's one person's word against the other and the,

79
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
yeah. The real results. Critical. You gotta,

80
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.070
I don't know if that's really possible though. I mean,

81
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.470
I don't know of anything that exists or any technology that's on the pipeline

82
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.360
that no.

83
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.710
<v 1>There isn't. So a friend of mine jokingly said that, that uh,</v>

84
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.830
all guys and women need to wear body cams. &lt;laugh&gt;.

85
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.870
<v 0>Like how like cops. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.220
<v 1>Like that's kind to where it is because they're, again,</v>

87
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.980
it is one of these like I don't, because it might be, you kind of think like,

88
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.860
oh yeah, no, it's probably, it's always pretty cut. Da, da. Uh,

89
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.500
and then you hear a thing like that and you're like, you know what?

90
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.660
I don't know what to, but then no, one's gonna you.

91
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:21.140
Should that guy get I'm I don't even on camera. Right? Uh,

92
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.250
the now we're into like, because I go, oh guys,

93
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:30.850
shouldn't get kicked outta school. There should be due process. Of course,

94
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.370
of course there should be due process. Then I hear a story like that.

95
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:36.450
And I'm like, man. I don't know. I don't,

96
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.690
maybe that guy shouldn't be able to go to school. I don't know.

97
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.930
I Tru I don't know. So.

98
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.960
<v 0>He lied. He said that didn't.</v>

99
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.840
<v 1>Happen. He didn't, she didn't press charges or of that. Oh, okay. Okay. Um.</v>

100
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.000
<v 0>Which by the way is super common. So when you take into account rape,</v>

101
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.360
the number of rapes that get reported versus the number of rapes that don't get

102
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:55.400
reported, it's.

103
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.680
<v 1>Like, it's a drop in the bucket. Yeah. And, and when, when guys go, well,</v>

104
00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:00.320
why don't girls report it, dude,

105
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.160
you don't like going to jury duty that, and that's a weak,

106
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.200
you want, you think a girl wants to talk about her vagina for a year and.

107
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.560
<v 0>A half. Not just that the stigma of yes.</v>

108
00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:14.000
Running around knowing that everybody knows you were raped.

109
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.550
Like having that feeling yes. Where people are judging you, staring at you. Yes.

110
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.630
Talking about you for nothing that you did. No, nothing.

111
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.190
<v 1>Fact. It's like literally as these things happen, uh,</v>

112
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.350
because you read these the, a lot of the times the, the,

113
00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:32.630
it feels like the choice for women is as it's happening. It's like,

114
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.550
I have to make my life about this.

115
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.380
Now my whole life has to be about this for at least a year and a half cops,

116
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.660
lawyers, uh, uh, court dates,

117
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.380
all just like a nightmare for one, a nightmare. Yeah.

118
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.140
That you likely did nothing wrong. Right. You just, and now it's like getting,

119
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.180
it's like getting in a, in a horrible car accident or something.

120
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.810
Um, yeah. And, and again,

121
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.570
I don't know what the solution is. Cuz as a comic,

122
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.650
my first end being contrarian, I go like, well, what did you, what did they do?

123
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:09.210
What did they do? All the, all the things. And it's like, no,

124
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.490
most of these things are, uh,

125
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.450
wrong place at the wrong time with a piece of, dude.

126
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.600
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

127
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.960
due process is significant though. It's gigantic. I know. You know,

128
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:26.640
have to have it.

129
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.480
I know mean what happened with the UVA case in rolling stone magazine,

130
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.800
they printed this stupid lie, this crazy story.

131
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:38.320
That really becomes a problem because there's real rape

132
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.270
on all the time on campuses that's happened.

133
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.590
<v 1>For real don't believe that that girl wasn't raped the UVA store. Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.030
I believe that she was raped. I don't think, uh,

135
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.710
it was the 15, like the way something happened, something, are you sure.

136
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.230
<v 0>Why do mean, what do you think that,</v>

137
00:07:55.231 --> 00:07:58.870
because I think they proved that she wasn't even there and that she was never in

138
00:07:58.871 --> 00:07:59.704
the, there was no.

139
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.460
<v 1>After any of that. Maybe I, people were all fake then I maybe didn't read it up.</v>

140
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:04.460
No, any.

141
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.580
<v 0>Follow up. I think that sign there's,</v>

142
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:10.300
there's so much evidence pointing to the fact that it was all made up. Yeah.

143
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.380
That there's very little possibility that something actually happened to her.

144
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.460
Yeah. I think they've completely dismissed that. Yeah.

145
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.020
I think they think it was just a girl just made some crazy up versus the

146
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.410
mattress girl thing. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the mattress girl.

147
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.490
One was a weird one because she definitely had sex with that guy and she

148
00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:28.130
definitely wanted to have sex with that guy cuz she was messaging him about sex

149
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.450
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and about, you know,

150
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.050
I think she said something about bring condoms and you're gonna put it in my

151
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:36.090
butt and yeah. But just a bunch of crazy. Yeah.

152
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:39.730
Like it was sex talk back and forth. Yeah. And then she just decided,

153
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:44.680
this is an amazing way to be a martyr and to be a victim and to

154
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:48.320
bring that mattress everywhere, including at a commencement speech. Yeah.

155
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.480
You know, I mean that, that's a different sort of case that kid is now suing.

156
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.360
Yeah. That kid is now suing that university and I hope he wins.

157
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.800
<v 1>Yeah. I, again,</v>

158
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.840
I hope he wins and because I think due process is as important.

159
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.640
It's literally a tie for first yeah. Between uh,

160
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.040
protecting women and protecting the constitution. Um, but

161
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.950
yeah, I, I don't even the, the,

162
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.070
the thing that bothers me about even talking about UVA or Columbia is it

163
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.150
makes the story about lying women. Right.

164
00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:27.430
Which is just not they're the outliers. Yes. They they're the.

165
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.310
<v 0>Outliers, uh.</v>

166
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.070
<v 1>By an extreme cause they're the.</v>

167
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.230
<v 0>Forward consideration when you,</v>

168
00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:34.390
you can't just completely ignore them in the equation. Right.

169
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.380
<v 1>Well that's the why you need due process. Yeah. That is exactly.</v>

170
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.273
<v 0>Why you need to, and you know,</v>

171
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.060
we also have to stop thinking out of it as like men and women.

172
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.700
It's human beings. Yeah.

173
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.140
Human beings involved in these situations and we have to treat them like equals

174
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.620
do you know the story about oxental oxental college in LA? Uh.

175
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.623
<v 1>Which story.</v>

176
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.500
<v 0>Boy and girl get drunk, text each other back and forth. I'm coming over.</v>

177
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:58.090
Do you have condoms? You yeah, come on over. She comes over or they,

178
00:09:58.091 --> 00:09:59.730
they have sex with each other. Um,

179
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.210
and then her friends convince her that because she was drunk,

180
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.050
she could not consent mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that it's rape &lt;affirmative&gt;

181
00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:07.570
knowhmm remember that was a big thing for a while.

182
00:10:07.571 --> 00:10:09.370
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that you, if you're not drunk, you can't consent.

183
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:11.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that was like for a year or two,

184
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:12.930
they tried to push that until they realized, oh my God,

185
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.530
that makes everyone a rapist. So they.

186
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.080
<v 1>Came, I mean, I having said that,</v>

187
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.160
I think that the part that alcohol plays in this giant

188
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.000
is so massive and nobody ever brings it up.

189
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.320
<v 0>It's giant. Yeah. If,</v>

190
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.880
if alcohol was complicit and all the things that people did while drunk the same

191
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:32.400
way, the prescription outta drugs, outta business. Yeah.

192
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:33.440
They'd be outta business out of business.

193
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.510
So this guy and this gal have some sad and it's consensual a hundred

194
00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:39.830
percent. But after the fact,

195
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.070
her friends tell her you couldn't consent because you were drunk. Yeah.

196
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.270
So even though he was drunk too Uh-huh so, um, you know,

197
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:49.950
people get told authorities get involved,

198
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.230
he gets kicked outta cool outta school. She does not, they,

199
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.190
they don't call it rape. They don't press charges.

200
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.540
He didn't do anything actually wrong, you know,

201
00:10:58.541 --> 00:10:59.700
in terms of the letter of the law,

202
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.580
since they're both intoxicated and willing and consensual,

203
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.540
but they kick him outta college. And so he is like, well, what the, man?

204
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.700
She's drunk too. So I got raped as well. Do you understand that? Yeah.

205
00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:12.460
I can't just be the man that yeah. Is doing the raping.

206
00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:15.740
If you're both intoxicated. Yeah. How the am I supposed to be able to consent?

207
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.810
So the idea is that this as much of a male

208
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:21.620
versus female.

209
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.650
<v 1>Thing, I had a conversation with a female friend of mine recently.</v>

210
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.890
And the conclusion, one of the conclusions was

211
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.450
men don't see women as humans.

212
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.650
Whoa. Meaning they're well, they're, they're like

213
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:44.280
less, there are other yes, there it's other. Yeah. It's other it's like,

214
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:49.360
you're not, I'm not saying you're not a human, but you're not a man.

215
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.201
I, you know what I mean?

216
00:11:50.201 --> 00:11:55.200
Like there's something of like the way men treat women is not

217
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.320
equal. Right. It's just, it's other, it's like you're in this other category.

218
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.440
<v 0>Well, they don't understand them that much cuz they're not one of 'em. Yep.</v>

219
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.640
And uh, if they don't have a good relationship with their mother,

220
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.361
it's even worse.

221
00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:09.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; especially if they' were raised by their dad alone.

222
00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:11.400
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; those guys are the sketchies guys of all. Yeah.

223
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.950
I'm general realizing.

224
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.030
<v 1>Honestly, I can't even think of one guy like that, but yeah,</v>

225
00:12:15.031 --> 00:12:16.790
meaning I don't think I know when a guy like.

226
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.470
<v 0>That, but yeah. Um, I know a guy like that. Uh,</v>

227
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.070
and sometimes even guys that were only raised by their mom or sketchy if their

228
00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:27.550
mom hates women, but the, the whole thing is, I mean, look,

229
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.950
it's just real hard when you start doing this men and women thing. Right.

230
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.580
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cause you, you you're prone to generalizations.

231
00:12:34.581 --> 00:12:38.940
There's no getting away from it, but men want sex from women.

232
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.140
So they're pursuing women. And do you have, do you know any men that are,

233
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.021
that you're friends with,

234
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.420
that you see over time that become more and more bitter towards women?

235
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:49.660
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because they begin rejected over and over and they

236
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:53.380
associate women with bad feelings. Yes. They associate women with negative.

237
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.210
I think men look at women like, like they're trying to score on a team.

238
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.103
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

239
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.850
<v 1>Yeah. It's dude it's first base. Second base. Third base. Yeah.</v>

240
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.810
It's literally like built into the language yeah. Of how we,

241
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.650
it is a thing that guys conquer. So it ends up being,

242
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.410
uh, I,

243
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:18.200
I like a it in the past to like Saudi Arabia or like towel

244
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.400
heads, but cuz they won't give us the oil. Right? Like,

245
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.840
no it's they're they don't like you,

246
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.840
they don't want to give you like they don't they,

247
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.480
but that doesn't mean that they're anymore than it means.

248
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:34.910
You're if you don't want this kombucha, it like,

249
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:38.670
you just don't your body doesn't want it doesn't mean that her body doesn't want

250
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:40.870
you like there's but it makes guys,

251
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.110
it hurts their feelings and it makes them crazy. And.

252
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.110
<v 0>It also deals with these evolutionary mechanisms that are designed to make sure</v>

253
00:13:48.111 --> 00:13:51.030
that we breed, you know, it becomes like a significant issue for you.

254
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.750
You wanna figure out how do I get this gal to like me to the point where she

255
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.060
wants to have sex with me? Oh, I gotta buy the right cars. Yeah.

256
00:13:57.061 --> 00:13:58.380
I gotta wear the wear the right watch.

257
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.300
I gotta do this and do that and say the right things and be a gentleen and hold

258
00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:04.780
open doors and all these things that we do. They're like, well,

259
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.260
why do men hold open doors? Will it be a gentleman? No. To,

260
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.540
to show that they're a preferential mate. That's what they're doing.

261
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:13.820
They're trying to con you correct. And to taking in that Dick, yes.

262
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.370
<v 1>That it' goes to speaks to the, your bit about invention. The, the thing that,</v>

263
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.250
that your invention thing now is that the reason,

264
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.410
the thing of like why women haven't invented. Yeah. Is cuz they don't have to,

265
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.290
they don't have to.

266
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.690
<v 0>It's also the way their mind works. You know, the hunter gatherer mindset,</v>

267
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.970
it's very different with the females in the tribe versus the male.

268
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.880
And we're dealing with still dealing with the echoes of all that, by.

269
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.840
<v 1>The way, for people that are, uh, uh, shallow.</v>

270
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.880
We're talking about misogyny right now. Yes. Yes. Just so you know. Yeah.

271
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.680
We're talking in theory about misogyny.

272
00:14:48.681 --> 00:14:51.640
These are not views that either of us hold, but uh, yeah. But um.

273
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.280
<v 0>In fact the opposite, I mean I, and I have all daughters, you know,</v>

274
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.240
I'm used to being around little girls. I, I know,

275
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.880
I know about women more now I understand them than I ever did.

276
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.180
And.

277
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.280
<v 1>How would you, how would you would,</v>

278
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.910
how different would your behavior have been 20 years ago? If you had what you,

279
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.910
the wisdom you have now from that it would, it.

280
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.750
<v 0>Would be way different. It would be way different. I just would, maybe my beha,</v>

281
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:23.190
I never did anything horrible. Um, like my record is clean.

282
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.190
Yeah, no, I'm think about assault, but what I am,

283
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.260
what I am more aware of now is the inner workings of like a

284
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:37.300
female from child to adulthood. I understand that.

285
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:42.260
They're just so there's a different evolutionary path

286
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.460
for their sex, for their gender.

287
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.500
There's a whole thing going on that they want to protect the nest.

288
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.501
They want to find a man.

289
00:15:49.501 --> 00:15:53.690
Like there's a lot of guys that look at a girl who wants a successful guy like,

290
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:56.050
oh, she's shallow. She just wants a bunch of.

291
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.490
She wants someone to pay for everything.

292
00:15:57.491 --> 00:16:02.330
Like there is a evolutionary path where the woman is looking for a

293
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:07.090
man who shows that he is capable of taking care of things while she is

294
00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:11.490
held up, being pregnant and taking care of the young, it is a natural instinct.

295
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.560
It is undeniable mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

296
00:16:13.561 --> 00:16:17.440
And there are some women that are super strong and super motivated and they

297
00:16:17.441 --> 00:16:20.320
don't have that instinct. Their instinct is to just have a kid,

298
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.440
give it to nanny, get back to work as quick as possible. And you know what,

299
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:23.880
but I'll.

300
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.120
<v 1>Tell you what, I bet their husband's tall. You know what I mean? Yeah.</v>

301
00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:30.400
There's still those things of like the evolutionary that they,

302
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.630
you can't get rid of your body wants to a. A tall guy. Yeah, yeah.

303
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.270
For the same for protection.

304
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.070
<v 0>All that for all that. Money. Yeah. Height, strength provisions.</v>

305
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.270
Yeah. Yeah. And,

306
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.270
and the ability to overcome significant situations.

307
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.750
Like whenever there's a, a,

308
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:52.310
like a guy that falls apart under stress is one of the most unattractive things

309
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:53.780
to women ever because it was, oh.

310
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.220
<v 1>Yeah. There was a study where like that I think Whitney and I have talked about,</v>

311
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.540
uh, where guys, women don't like when guys cry in front of 'em. Oh God.

312
00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:02.740
They say they want an emotional guy.

313
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:06.180
What they mean is I want you to listen to my emotions. Yeah.

314
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.540
I don't want you to be emotional. I need you to be a Marine.

315
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.500
<v 0>Yeah. And if you're gonna be emotional and cry about things, it better be like,</v>

316
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.890
like a brave display of emotions. Yes. My.

317
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.610
<v 1>One of your fallen brothers. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Or somebody's, you know,</v>

318
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.650
like a baseball player's retiring something. Some physical. Yes.

319
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.010
Some physical thing. Yeah. About the passage time in brotherhood.

320
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.210
<v 0>That's it? Yeah. Maybe that's it.</v>

321
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.570
That's maybe yourdaughter's birthday party and you're so happy. Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:33.190
That's the.

323
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.000
<v 1>That's the, uh, portfolio.</v>

324
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.240
<v 0>Yeah. Um, but the ability to respond to pressures a giant one,</v>

325
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.680
the ability to provide is a giant one physical features.

326
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.280
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like having strong features, having strong genetics.

327
00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:47.940
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you,

328
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.040
the woman has to know like genetically has to feel like she's being protected.

329
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.840
And then there's some women that don't like that at all.

330
00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.600
There's some women that like men mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and we,

331
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.640
we know those women and they, they they're the really domineering,

332
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.900
powerful women.

333
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.880
And they have these men that are like quiet and they they're sort of retiring

334
00:18:06.881 --> 00:18:11.310
submissive. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's okay too. But the, these,

335
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.150
these patterns that exist, they exist because for the longest time, I mean,

336
00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:19.550
look, it's a weird situation where a woman has to be pregnant for nine months.

337
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.870
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's a long time. Yeah. Imagine picking a man.

338
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.390
Imagine if you're,

339
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:27.430
you're a man and you're picking a woman and you have to decide when you're

340
00:18:27.431 --> 00:18:27.970
meeting this woman,

341
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.460
is this chick gonna be a able to keep it together with me while I'm held up,

342
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.580
literally held up for a year, like a whole year, for one year,

343
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.980
I'm gonna be stuck in this situation. And then from then the next 18 years,

344
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.740
I'm gonna be responsible for the infant that comes out of this union.

345
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.741
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

346
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:50.410
that's so that's so different than our thought process. It's so different.

347
00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:52.170
Their consequences, different, well, men want.

348
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:57.130
<v 1>Men only think about to me, men want sex.</v>

349
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.450
They don't think about they literally.

350
00:18:59.451 --> 00:19:02.130
And then it's just black and then it's just black. Sure.

351
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.850
It's like sex and then just like black into the distance. Yeah.

352
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:05.570
Infinite blackness.
