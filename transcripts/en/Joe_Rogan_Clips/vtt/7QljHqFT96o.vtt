<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.160
<v 3>Dude, last night. Okay. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; last night on my security camera,</v>

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.040
there was a big black cat, like a 60,

4
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.640
70 pound something or another. Oh my, well, I don't know what it see.

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.960
The thing about Texas is there's a real issue.

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.160
There's more tigers in captivity,

7
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.190
in access than all of the wild of the world. Really?

8
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.270
Because of like rich people, just people just have a fence. I want a tiger.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.790
And you could just have a tiger here. Yeah. Because, because of freedom,

10
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.430
freedom America. Yeah. Like zebras. Like my wife saw zebra.

11
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:37.990
Once she was driving on the road, she saw Ze zebra zebras. Just get out. Right?

12
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.300
Like people have zebras and they just get out sometimes whatever this thing was,

13
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:46.300
it's like a, can you ride, ride a zebra Panther? No, you cannot. Are they short?

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.460
<v 0>No. They're horse size. They're it's a horse. A wild horse that cannot be tamed.</v>

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.940
No one has ever been able to tame a zebra. It's like trying to ride a Wolf,

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.140
like get the outta here. I relate. Maybe my spirit. I don't zebra.

17
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.650
I'm in the middle of this. Sorry. Outside of my house is a, a,

18
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.610
a big black cat. Yeah. Like a black Panther. Wow. I'm like,

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.410
like as big as my dog, you know, my dog's like 80 pounds. Yeah.

20
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.850
This thing is like that size. Wow. Probably like a little less than him,

21
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.570
but it's a big black cat.

22
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.330
And you see its eyes on the security camera walking down.

23
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.160
And then my neighbor who walks his dog at night,

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.040
his dog is like on death's door. Right. It's like sweetheart of a dog. Yeah,

25
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:30.800
of course. And he's so he's got a headlamp on the dog. No, the,

26
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.640
the neighbor this dog's like dragging to tell a story and you're up my flow.

27
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.000
This guy, punchline, excuse me. This guy is dragging his dog. Right.

28
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.510
You know, the dog walks slow and he's kind of pulling 'em along on the leash.

29
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.030
The cat runs towards them. I'm thinking I'm gonna see a murder.

30
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.150
Were you a little excited to be honest? No. No,

31
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:55.270
because I had found out about it after the fact I know he was okay, but it like,

32
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:59.470
it ran towards him and then decided last second to dart off into the woods.

33
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.100
But like, it heard the footsteps, the tail,

34
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.420
and it just goes running towards him. Like I thought he was a deer or something,

35
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.180
but it was creepy. It was a big black cat. Yeah.

36
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.580
<v 1>I'm like more concerned. How are these people about to walk their dogs?</v>

37
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:15.900
So close to my King's home. I don't like this. Wow.

38
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.220
<v 0>They live in the neighborhood. They're wandering around, but it's uh,</v>

39
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.170
this cat is wandering around in like a residential

40
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:25.650
neighborhood.

41
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.770
<v 1>That's crazy. And it's because it's from someone else's.</v>

42
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.570
<v 0>House. I don't know.</v>

43
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.410
<v 2>What it is when I looked it up. I just typed in, uh,</v>

44
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.850
black Panthers in Texas in the wild. Yeah.

45
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.210
And what comes up is from not that long ago,

46
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:40.690
it says the wildlife officials say they don't exist in Texas.

47
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.930
And what you probably saw as a black hog or Otter. And I'm like, no.

48
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.440
<v 0>That's no, not possible. I thought you were gonna say it was like a black,</v>

49
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.960
listen, I have a video. Yeah. It's a black cat. There's no doubt about it.

50
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.840
No way fans are, but I know what a hog looks like. They look totally different.

51
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.840
A hog is a big bodied thing with, with little tiny legs. I'm ready here.

52
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 1>Okay. And I'm still wearing my half shirts. I don't give a. Black.</v>

53
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.040
<v 0>Panthers do not exist in the lone star state. That's not true.</v>

54
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.240
<v 1>I don't like lone star. It's not so sad.</v>

55
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.760
<v 0>It's not. So it could have been private, I guess back. Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:13.280
That's my whole yeah, yeah. Go up. But that's listen.

57
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.280
That's what it looked like. No. Those high is 100.

58
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.470
<v 1>Gorgeous. Eyes' is a hot, is.</v>

59
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.630
<v 0>A sexy animal. If I was a girl I'd wanna get.</v>

60
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.670
<v 1>By that. Listen, my dad might be upset.</v>

61
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.510
<v 0>But if I was a girl cat, see those things, black Panthers. What they are is,</v>

62
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.430
um, it's uh, the spots, but the spots are all over their whole body. Oh really?

63
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.190
Yeah. So what that is is like a Jaguar. Is.

64
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.430
<v 1>There skin, if you shaved it as their skin dark.</v>

65
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.900
<v 0>I don't believe so. I don't know though. Might be. Um,</v>

66
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.700
but show me, uh, like Google Jaguar,

67
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.140
a black Jaguar spots. Well, there's this thing.

68
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.380
Jaguar run the mystery of the Texas black Panther citing solved. What is that?

69
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.140
This is the year before that. I don't know. I mean.

70
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.170
<v 1>I saw this too. Jaguar. I, those sound hot. They come.</v>

71
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.003
<v 0>In songs.</v>

72
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.850
One of my security guys said he saw one in the woods and

73
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.490
he was, I think he said he was walking his dog too. And he saw one in the woods,

74
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.010
a black Panther. He said it was just like that.

75
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.450
And he was the one who spotted this thing on the camera. So they're it. Listen,

76
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.720
I have a video of it. It's believe 100% real.

77
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.240
So those from Texas wildlife, you need to shut the up. I got a video.

78
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.000
This thing is really well.

79
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.920
<v 1>They're probably saying, well,</v>

80
00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:31.920
they probably are saying there's none like just in the habitat, but it's, don't.

81
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.641
<v 0>That here's,</v>

82
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:37.040
here's why they don't know that Jaguars in particular have been spotted in the

83
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.240
wild in Arizona. And they didn't think they used to exist in.

84
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.150
They thought they were extricated. Pull up, pull up Jaguars in Arizona.

85
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.430
<v 1>It's gonna be the cars. There's a lot of retired people. I can't help it.</v>

86
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.070
John they're new.

87
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.950
<v 0>Cars, Jaguars. They still make 'em. They're not.</v>

88
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.510
<v 1>Retired. What's the car. Okay. When I make it,</v>

89
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.830
when I make my big bucks coming up here, what's my car. You're I think.

90
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.740
<v 0>You need a convertible.</v>

91
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.750
<v 1>Look at you. Really? I wanna.</v>

92
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.900
<v 0>Test the first, see these are Jaguars in, uh, in Arizona's so pretty beautiful,</v>

93
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.340
gorgeous.

94
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.580
<v 1>Animal, but you know, I wanna just wear that jacket.</v>

95
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.940
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; just get a fake one.</v>

96
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.180
<v 1>Of course, I would never get a real one. Don't murder.</v>

97
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.740
<v 0>To the Jaguar. I would never. So someone killed that one,</v>

98
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.940
the lower left hand corner. That's that was the, that they killed it in Mexico.

99
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.540
And that was like a famous Jaguar. Do you know?

100
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.850
That was one of the two remaining Jaguars in the us.

101
00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:27.250
It says to remain Jaguars in the us, but I'm pretty sure they killed it in go.

102
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.770
No, no, no. Go back, go back. Um, well that's really sad.

103
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.170
See the left hand corner, right, right below related images.

104
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.650
See known Jaguar shown out right there. Yeah. Click on that one.

105
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.240
Cause that article, um, it explains how they know it.

106
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.120
Roamed Southern Arizona 2016, but they killed it in Mexico.

107
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.800
<v 1>Interesting to wear a matching dress with the background.</v>

108
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.560
<v 0>Does she have a matching Jaguar dress?</v>

109
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.760
<v 1>Lemme say no, just no, she was wearing a blue. Oh. With the background was blue.</v>

110
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.520
You're such a.

111
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.120
<v 0>Girl. I can't help him. I tried not to be. I do.</v>

112
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.680
Uh, doesn't say anyway, I I'm 90, 90% sure they killed it in Mexico,

113
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.360
but they live in Mexico. They live in south Mexico. Ish. Yeah.

114
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.760
It does a look a look at those slides. &lt;laugh&gt; um,

115
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.550
they live in it say killed the I a mountain lion hunter.

116
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.590
It's a rumor that it was, oh, he heard someone trapped or killed one in Mexico.

117
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.710
Mm. By, so in Sonora, Mexico. Yeah. That's what I heard too. Um,

118
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.750
but my point is that in south America they're plentiful. Right.

119
00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:36.550
They live in the jungle, like in the Amazon. They're very dangerous.

120
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:39.860
Like they Jack people all the time, they're big. It's a big animal.

121
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.020
What do they do to them? They eat 'em. Oh, they kill them.

122
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.060
They eat people &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah.

123
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.020
Do you know when people do Ika and they do it in the Amazon,

124
00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:53.420
they have all these images of Jaguars and there's Jaguars and snakes,

125
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.730
or like a big part of the, the natural imagery. Yeah. I did mine in ago.

126
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.530
I was just thinking deep dish pizzas.

127
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.970
And they think they're taking on the spirit of the jungle and that this is like,

128
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.850
you like all the things you're afraid of in the jungle and all the things that

129
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:11.410
are in control and the wild and the powerful forces of the jungle. I don't know,
