00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.960
<v 0>Did you have you not watched unacknowledged?</v>

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.680
<v 1>What is unacknowledged? You gotta.</v>

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>Watch unknowledged what is that one? Okay.</v>

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.360
You gotta watch unknowledgd what is it? You gotta watch unknowledged.

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.600
<v 1>Is that that Stephen Greer movie? No, it is. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Listen to me,</v>

6
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:17.600
man. No, no, no, no. Good. Huh? No, this there's a industry.

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.910
And the industry is in people wanting to get mystery solved.

8
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:23.950
The great mystery of is their life out there.

9
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:26.190
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and nobody has any answers. There's I,

10
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.670
I did this show for sci-fi called Joe Rogan questions, everything. Mm.

11
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.270
Before that show mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I was a hardcore believer and a lot on

12
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.390
wonky conspiracies. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like Bigfoot and aliens.

13
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.270
I just love them cuz they see. So don't live interesting.

14
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.630
I Bigfoot you don't live in Bigfoot. No,

15
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:43.180
I don't believe Bigfoot's the most plausible you think so? Yes. Why? Why?

16
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:46.620
Because there was an animal called a gigantiiantopitheist that the longside

17
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:50.060
human beings, as recently as a hundred thousand years ago, it was a real,

18
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.980
absolutely real animal. Okay. And there's they found fossilized bones,

19
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:58.660
these things and they, they, they found teeth from an apotheary shop and China,

20
00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.980
there was a real animal.

21
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.970
It was a Giganti GaN biedal hoited that was somewhere around eight

22
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.610
to 10 feet tall. So this thing lived at the same time people did.

23
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.490
So this is probably the reason why there's this myth of Bigfoot that at one

24
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.730
point in time, this was a real thing. No, but.

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.090
<v 0>What about the, what about that? They're walking around now.</v>

26
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.690
<v 1>Probably not. That's what I'm saying. Most.</v>

27
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.450
<v 0>Likely not. That was what I was saying. I mean'm sure it was a giant.</v>

28
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.360
<v 1>You know? Yeah. But there's, you know, a lot of, so tell me about, uh.</v>

29
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.160
<v 0>About aliens. Tell me about.</v>

30
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.080
<v 1>Um, most is a business. Most of itbusiness. What about, what.</v>

31
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
<v 0>About the, what about the air force general that said,</v>

32
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.040
did that tape gave it to his wife? Yeah.

33
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.680
And said don't put this out until I'm dead.

34
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:41.280
Did you not feel as though when he was speaking? Any of that was real?

35
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.510
I think you've seen that way. I think too many.

36
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.430
<v 1>Have you seen that one? Yeah. I've seen a lot of those.</v>

37
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.710
I've seen a lot of those people theres a lot of there's a lot of former military

38
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:51.710
people that say they've seen crazy things and it's entirely possible that they

39
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.350
really did. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's entirely possible.

40
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but it's also possible that they're crazy.

41
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.150
It's possible that they love attention. It's possible that they're bored.

42
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.750
It's possible that they're schizophrenic. It's possible that they have memories.

43
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.580
It's they've concocted over the years.

44
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.180
It enhanced and it's gotten them attention and it's putting them in

45
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.580
documentaries and it gets them interviews on television programs.

46
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.940
But that there's no evidence, you know,

47
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.900
and the problem with all these people is they all have this same feeling about

48
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:17.940
them. And they're not.

49
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.500
There's very few of them that come across as rational and objective.

50
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.370
Most of them 'em across is there's something wrong.

51
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.130
There's a there's wires that aren't connecting.

52
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.170
If you talk to them about other things in life,

53
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:33.330
like if you had a chance to talk to them for a long period of time,

54
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.650
sit down with 'em for three hours,

55
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.410
ask them about ghosts and psychics and all kinds of other.

56
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.290
They almost all believe in that stuff. There's they're believers.

57
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.730
They wanna believe in nonsense. I hear you.

58
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.760
<v 0>When, as that crops up, I'm out of the room, but it's.</v>

59
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.480
<v 1>Possible that, I mean, not just possible,</v>

60
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.920
it's a hundred percent likely that there's alien life out there.

61
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:52.760
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; likely.

62
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.560
<v 0>A hundred percent glad you said that more likely.</v>

63
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.520
<v 1>You scared me for a second. No, I think it's more likely. I just love that.</v>

64
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.920
<v 0>Movie because it kind of had a nice thread through that movie's.</v>

65
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.360
<v 1>Horses. Okay. There's a lot of those movies that are horses. And that guy,</v>

66
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.360
he knows some of that's horses, like there's a little baby that they had found.

67
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:11.080
That's an aborted Fetu they were trying to pass that off as an alien baby for a

68
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.240
long time. But they have genome. You don't believe there.

69
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.360
<v 0>Were, uh, there were hybrids. No. What do hybrids?</v>

70
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.070
Can you tell me about the link?

71
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.190
What link between monkeys and us &lt;laugh&gt; seriously? Well,

72
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:27.630
well between the two front lobes Uh-huh and the full, the brain of.

73
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.463
<v 1>The monkey. Well,</v>

74
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.510
we are hominants mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mean we are primates mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

75
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.430
and we're just the most advanced priate the real question is how did we get to

76
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.510
be so much more? That's what I'm just, that's why I asked you. Well,

77
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:40.540
it's more likely that we found fire and our diet changed and hunting.

78
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.140
And then the stoned ape theory, which is a very fascinating theory.

79
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the stoned ape theory.

80
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:48.260
Isterrence McKennas theory that human beings

81
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.340
foundililicocidebin mushroommushrooms yeah.

82
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.980
And that through the use ofilic cyber mushrooms, which in low doses increases,

83
00:03:55.981 --> 00:04:00.810
visual acuity produces these ecstatic states that it might have

84
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:03.770
helped us develop language and communication and creativity.

85
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.010
And that this in turn was the reason why the human brain doubled in size over a

86
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:08.930
period of 2 million years,

87
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.330
which is the greatest mystery in the history of the fossil record.

88
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.610
They don't know why they did it, but there's a very clear path between.

89
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.530
<v 0>So we do believe the humans were here two a million years ago. Humans.</v>

90
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.400
<v 1>Hu. Well.</v>

91
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.233
<v 0>However, four.</v>

92
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.960
<v 1>Some form of,</v>

93
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.120
of primate was certainly here millions of years ago as was deer deer were

94
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:27.240
here millions of years ago. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

95
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:28.960
okay's there's a lot of animals didn't mean to.

96
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.040
<v 0>Do up here please. No, it's.</v>

97
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.840
<v 1>Okay. I, I don't know the.</v>

98
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.760
<v 0>Thing I feel that I feel like, you know,</v>

99
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.280
just cause there was an ice age that took part that took,

100
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:39.480
it was like how many hundreds? A hundred thousand years was the ice age?

101
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.670
<v 1>Well, just a bunch of ice ages,</v>

102
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.430
but the most recent one ended somewhere in the neighborhood of 12,000 years ago.

103
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.630
That was nothing. Nothing.

104
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.110
<v 0>Yeah. From beginning to end. So we, and we don't know what, what caused.</v>

105
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.790
<v 1>It well, when the ice age exists,</v>

106
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:55.710
we have to remember that some parts of the world aren't experiencing the ice age

107
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:57.950
and then humans thrived in Africa during parts of the ice.

108
00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:59.070
Age-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I mean, there's,

109
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.060
there's a lot of human beings live all over the world.

110
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.340
The real question is where did they start? Most likely from Africa,

111
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.820
but they could have possibly started from some other places too.

112
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:09.340
And we're starting to learn that well there' but.

113
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.420
<v 0>The people that are learning thing.</v>

114
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.820
<v 1>Right? The people that are learning, no, not really why. Well, I mean,</v>

115
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:13.700
there's that too,

116
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.540
but I mean mostly just people traveling mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but what you really

117
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:19.980
learn from is archeologists.

118
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.610
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; those are the people you learn from and biologists,

119
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:25.690
people that really understand the human genome.

120
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.210
They really understand the differences between people that emerge from China

121
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.690
versus people that emerge from Western Europe versus people that emerge from

122
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:36.090
mm-hmm, you know, or native Americans. I mean,

123
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:39.530
there's so many different types of human beings that came from different

124
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:42.320
climates and that their bodies evolve from these places. This,

125
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.040
and there's real science to that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

126
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:46.320
you're not gonna get that from these goofy documentaries.

127
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:50.840
These goofy documentaries are basically a business and the businesses to there's

128
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:53.240
a bunch of people out there that want, that wanna know the answers.

129
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.520
What is the truth? And so you get, I was a board, the secret UFO.

130
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.960
I saw the magnetic controller that makes us travel through the cosmos and bend

131
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.880
time and space. It's like a wormhole.

132
00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:06.080
And they'll say a bunch of sciencey sound and.

133
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but there's no evidence. There's nothing.

134
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.320
When they talk about there's nothing, will.

135
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.000
<v 0>You let what's David Wilco, Wilco, you know David? No, I get.</v>

136
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.630
<v 1>Another one. Really? That guy says that he is the reincarnation of, of Edgar.</v>

137
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.110
Casey. Do you know that? Um, did you know that? Yeah. I've heard that, you know,

138
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.750
Edgar Casey is uh, yeah, of course famous psychic who never really right.

139
00:06:27.751 --> 00:06:32.110
Figured out anything understood and thought to be a fraud most widely by

140
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.110
scientist and skeptics drinking too much loud, him.

141
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.260
<v 0>Loud him. Is that what he did loud? Don't you think? I don't know. I,</v>

142
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.500
everything was written and everybody was stoned. Well,

143
00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:44.620
I think when you talk about the psychede the psychilocybin

144
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.900
mushrooms, I mean opiates loudnum the last a hundred years.

145
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.513
<v 1>Get loud up.</v>

146
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.500
<v 0>Loudlum loudnum everyone was drinking that. Yeah. You know, but,</v>

147
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.250
but look like liquid. Yeah. There's there's you know there's.

148
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.810
<v 1>Yeah, that was in that, uh.</v>

149
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.770
<v 0>Japanese ne they never left the island.</v>

150
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.050
Do a lot of Japanese have the same eyes shapes.

151
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.650
<v 1>Yes they do. Is there a reason? Well,</v>

152
00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:12.610
there's a reason why they didn't leave the island and.

153
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.290
<v 0>Come back after mating with other anybody else.</v>

154
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.410
They stayed on that body of the land. Do you think they're from aliens? No,

155
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.480
not so not. It's just that they stayed on that, that, that, that plot of land.

156
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.423
Sure.

157
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.080
<v 1>But wouldn't you agree that a lot of millions of people from Asian look very</v>

158
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:29.320
fairly similar. Yeah, I do. There's variations in the similarities. Yeah.

159
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:29.920
But they were similar.

160
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.480
<v 0>Right. But I think it took millions of years. That's that's my take. Look it,</v>

161
00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:33.800
I can't.

162
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.440
<v 1>Prove anything. No, they do believe it took millions of years.</v>

163
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.910
<v 0>I always finished stuff by saying I didn't see it. Right. I I'm.</v>

164
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:41.230
When I go out at night, mawing walks walk around.

165
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:45.030
Uh-huh I'm dying to see with UFO. Me too. So are you everybody?

166
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:48.150
Every second I see one the second, right?

167
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.030
That will make clear. Like, you know,

168
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.590
the song I wrote called back when came was able way before the, anyways,

169
00:07:56.591 --> 00:08:00.180
about a mothership and way. I knew anything about.

170
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.300
<v 1>UFOs. Did you ever see anything when you did psychedelics, when you did drugs,</v>

171
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.580
whether you did mushrooms.

172
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.220
<v 0>Or I never saw anything that wasn't there. For sure. I'm not the kind of people.</v>

173
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.220
No, I'm not the kind of people. I mean, some.

174
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.820
<v 1>People have though. And the,</v>

175
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.780
the idea is that there are things that are out there and neighboring dimensions

176
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.380
that you really not capable of accessing them. Yeah. That,

177
00:08:19.381 --> 00:08:22.690
that that's where the real aliens live. Yeah. I don't know, man,

178
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:26.130
but I just know that all these people that are pushing it, they're all,

179
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:29.410
they all have. There's fuckery involved in all these people. No,

180
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:30.244
I hear that's a real problem.

181
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.330
<v 0>I, I hear you. I hear you.</v>

182
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.290
<v 1>Because it's, it's fun. It's fun. You wanna believe, right?</v>

183
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.810
You wanna believe it. There's a general out there. That's seen a spaceship.

184
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:39.970
That's under the mountain. Tell me about it, Mr. General.

185
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.960
And he goes on a lecture tour and you gotta pay money to see him.

186
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:46.160
And he's in a documentary and there's a lot of those people out there, man.

187
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:46.760
I live.

188
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.560
<v 0>With it. I was backstage with Joe Perry. What'd you do? Yes. My home life.</v>

189
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.760
Yeah. So I get what you're saying, the wow of the thrill of the story.

190
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.640
<v 1>But you know, people.</v>

191
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 0>Love to tell stories. There's something inside me that says, you know what?</v>

192
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.400
They still haven't found that,

193
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.640
that missing link that between if you talk to biologists and,

194
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.240
and how up because they're, but they do, they have.

195
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.080
<v 1>And they have a Australia ppicus fossils.</v>

196
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.950
They have the things that were like us that are different from a long time ago.

197
00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:16.784
They have those.

198
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.870
<v 0>And the, and the size of the brain. Yeah.</v>

199
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.230
<v 1>Two frontalals the brain changed. It doubled over a period of 2 million years.</v>

200
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.790
I mean, that, that did happen. But they, they know what we used to be.

201
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; there are simple hoonades that were, or,

202
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:33.870
or rather ancient homonades that are very similar to human beings and they

203
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.900
slowly became human. And there's also,

204
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.340
they keep finding all these different versions of human beings.

205
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.620
Like there wasn't just human there wasn't just homo sapiens.

206
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.980
And of course there was neanderals mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but there was that the

207
00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:48.700
one from Russia. What was that called? D that was in that Mo that book. Um,

208
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.260
hoid what, what is that? Uh,

209
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.690
de de I can't remember. Or the, it starts with a D,

210
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.330
but it's a one that they've found very recently. Very recently you find it,

211
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:03.570
Jamie. Yeah, here it is.

212
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.170
Dennis sovin Dennis. So Dennis sovin Dennis sovin,

213
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.570
hoinan the extinct species of sub or subspecies of archaic humans.

214
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.160
They found in the 1970s by the Russian paleontologist nickolaly

215
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.000
oldol. So there's been a bunch of different forms of humans.

216
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.960
We're just the most successful form of human.

217
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.000
The idea that it's just alien DNA connected with people. It's sexy.

218
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.720
It sounds fun, but there's no evidence. Ah, I hear.

219
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.600
<v 0>You, but isn't that what we are as humans?</v>

220
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.070
<v 1>Well, we are mute to patients.</v>

221
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.390
We are an ancient thing that slowly figured its way out.

222
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:42.310
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we became better at seeing things.

223
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.310
We became better at hunting. We became better at harnessing fire. Where.

224
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.390
<v 0>Do you think free will came from? There's.</v>

225
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.270
<v 1>A lot of people that don't even believe it's real. They be,</v>

226
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:52.950
they believe in determinism. They don't,

227
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:55.030
they don't even believe that free will is an actual thing. I mean,

228
00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:59.460
I've heard Sam Harris argue it pretty successfully that there is no such thing

229
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:02.140
as free will that you are an accumulation of your genetics,

230
00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:04.620
your life experiences, all the things that have happened to you,

231
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:07.740
the people that you've come in contact with that's true. Behavioral. Yeah.

232
00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:09.340
And that, that forms behavioral.

233
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.340
<v 0>Psychology. That's.</v>

234
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.300
<v 1>That's true. Your behavior. Think about your behavior. Yeah.</v>

235
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.340
And how much of your behavior is shaped by millions of adoring fans and people

236
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.810
screaming and cheering you on and singing songs that move people and ch

237
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:25.170
literally change generations, give people goosebumps when they hear 'em. I mean,

238
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.490
all that stuff is shaped who you are. I mean, all that stuff,

239
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.810
changes who a person is and who you are now.

240
00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:34.050
And the way you behave now is in many ways,

241
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.680
shaped by your life experiences as much as it is, as it is by genetics.

242
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.040
And you wouldn't be this person.

243
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.840
If you hadn't lived that life and the decisions that you make from this moment

244
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.601
on right now,

245
00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:47.720
leave the studio and have a conversation with someone will be shaped,

246
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.960
at least in part by this conversation.

247
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.000
And mine will be by my conversation with you.

248
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.720
This is what the idea behind determinism. Okay. So I would ask.

249
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.520
<v 0>What, what was, who said this? Who was.</v>

250
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.240
<v 1>This? Well, there's many, many people that, that come up with this concept,</v>

251
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.133
but I've heard it.

252
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.040
It was really argued to me by Sam Harris the most successfully.

253
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.880
<v 0>Wow. Interesting. I just wonder why then,</v>

254
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.310
you know, certain monkeys, certain breeze, monkeys, smart ones, Bonobos.

255
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.910
I love them. Cause I'm a bonobo, but, uh, have, you know, they stick,

256
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:20.990
they'll put a stick in something and pull out chilogy but you know, well,

257
00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:23.510
that's, that's also, they haven't taken going, well, wait a minute, now,

258
00:12:23.511 --> 00:12:26.430
then they haven't gone any, they haven't gone past that.

259
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.831
<v 1>So, well,</v>

260
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:30.150
do you knowpriimatologists are actually believe that chimpanzees have entered

261
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.003
the stone age.

262
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.300
This is one thing that's being considered now that they've started use of tools

263
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.500
on a regular basis. Okay. They think that they're learning from each other.

264
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.220
Right. And they think that they're if, if they are evolving. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

265
00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:43.340
And if human beings Evolv over a period of millions of years,

266
00:12:43.341 --> 00:12:47.180
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, we are actually watching chimpanzees evolve in real time.

267
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.140
Well, I think, and think so too, over time, long,

268
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.380
long process it'll take millions of years,

269
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.730
but they have entered the Stoney each.

270
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.130
So they think that who knows with a series of mutations, with natural selection,

271
00:12:59.131 --> 00:13:01.890
with a bunch of different things happening, what a chimpanzee is today,

272
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.490
most likely it will be a different thing in 2 million years. Of course it will.

273
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:07.010
Yeah. And that's, I totally agree in that. Right.

274
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.450
That these intelligent animals they're gonna experiment with things here it is.

275
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.410
Mac Cox often use stone tools.

276
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.120
Monkey have been living in the stone age for 50 years. So for 50 years,

277
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.360
these animals just 50. Okay. That animal'.

278
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.240
<v 0>More about that. That's when somebody first saw them using the stone. True.</v>

279
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.320
<v 1>Well, in terms of primatologists, observing behavior, get you get so,</v>

280
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.320
so these archeologists have uncovered stone tools.

281
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.320
They believe these animals have used mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

282
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.910
<v 0>Or other humans. Yeah. Or other humans. You can't figure stone out right now.</v>

283
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:38.190
When you look, what do you think about when you look up? And, and I look at,

284
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.430
I don't know the answers. That's why I got my girls here. Well, I definitely.

285
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.710
<v 1>Don't know the answers either again. Remember I just said, I just repeat.</v>

286
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.030
Smart people figured out &lt;laugh&gt; it's all I'm.

287
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.430
<v 0>Doing. What about the stones that are cut, cut up in not ma peachhu but up in,</v>

288
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.430
I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Those, you know, the laser cuts and.

289
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.620
<v 1>Well, not laser. Yeah. Very precise cuts. Yeah.</v>

290
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.460
Whoever it was most likely advanced civilizations that have been wiped out by.

291
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.220
<v 0>Catatechlys and that's what I'm saying. So my mind goes to. Yeah.</v>

292
00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:09.300
We were here something, the one underground there's places I saw movies of it.

293
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:10.700
Uh-huh &lt;affirmative&gt; where you go into the mountain.

294
00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:13.940
You go back three miles in the mountain. Right? Have you seen this? Yeah.

295
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.930
<v 1>There are CAS. Yeah. There's incredible. CA miles back in there's.</v>

296
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.770
<v 0>Natural CA systems, giant rooms like this in.</v>

297
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:18.891
<v 1>There.</v>

298
00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:22.090
There's natural cave systems in Texas that go back miles in the mountains.

299
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.650
So I'm.

300
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.090
<v 0>Just Hills. I should say. That's where my head goes with this, you know, ghost.</v>

301
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.290
Come on. That's your own.

302
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.130
<v 1>Fear. I don't know. But you know where you're talking about muscleholls yeah.</v>

303
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:30.550
Those,

304
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.850
the feeling in that room mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; there might be a similar feeling

305
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.960
when a violent encounter happens in a house that might be what a ghost is.

306
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.480
What a ghost is, is might be this thing that you can't capture.

307
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.520
You can't put it in a box. You can't wait on a scale,

308
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.520
but you get a feeling when you're in a place where something horrible happened

309
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.480
and you could feel it. It's not,

310
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.680
it's not impossible to imagine that that's the case. It's not.

311
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:55.000
And ruperteldrich was the guy that I told you believed that.

312
00:14:55.001 --> 00:14:57.880
And he's a scientist. And some people would argue against it,

313
00:14:57.881 --> 00:15:00.320
but mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that he believes that things have memory.

314
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.600
And that it's impossible. It's possible that even this table has memory.

315
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.080
All the people that are sat where you sat.

316
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.320
<v 0>I think it's got a vibe. I'm not sure if this memory know it's got memory,</v>

317
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.470
water, nobody knows about that yet. Well, right. Because it never goes anywhere.

318
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.750
You can never get rid of water. It's true. You can boil it steam and it goes up,

319
00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:18.670
it comes back down. So right. I think when they find out the memory and water,

320
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.590
I also gotta tell you.
