00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:06.180
I think there's as much of a difference between like a black belt in jujitsu and

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:09.210
what would be considered an equivalent, you know, world champion and more tie.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.600
Oh yeah. This is a big step in, step in, step in the ring and see.

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.170
<v 1>Jujitsu guys sometimes get cocky about that.</v>

6
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:18.080
I had a buddy of mine who was taking them may fight and he wasn't doing any

7
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:18.914
striking.

8
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.680
He was doing very little striking and he's a really good ground fighter.

9
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.130
And I said, do you know how you can toil with a guy on the ground?

10
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:27.980
And they really have no chance. He goes, yeah, I go, people can do that.

11
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.340
Do you standing? I go, you have to understand that the fight starts standing.

12
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.540
It's not like you start, like,

13
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:35.780
it's not EBI rules where you start on the guy's back and you know,

14
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.310
you have a real good chance of submitting them.

15
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:38.600
If you've got a great rear naked choke,

16
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.610
this is not that this is you start 20 feet away from the guy and you're

17
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:47.480
standing and you know, you have to close that distancing.

18
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.220
You're not a great wrestler either.

19
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.130
<v 0>Yeah. Well that's the key component, right? Yes.</v>

20
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.480
<v 1>It's a giant factor, right?</v>

21
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.490
<v 0>If at least if you wrestle, you can go, well,</v>

22
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:58.550
at least I'd know I have a decent chance of taking them down. Yes.

23
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.310
A decent chance. And even that's no guarantee anymore. Yeah. Well,

24
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.570
I'd go back to Mark Schultz.

25
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.400
<v 1>When he fought in the UFC, you know,</v>

26
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:07.010
when Mark Schultz fought in the UFC only find one UFC fight,

27
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.030
but that's when we got to see like a world champion Olympic gold medalist,

28
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.180
top of the food chain wrestler, you're only on your feet.

29
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:15.840
If you wants you to be like,

30
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.920
[inaudible] good luck throwing that punch or kick because he,

31
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.120
you have no chance.

32
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.790
He's going to close the distance and drag you to the ground unless you have

33
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.570
really good takedown defensive back back then when he fought big daddy,

34
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:29.540
Goodrich people didn't really have it unless they were wrestlers.

35
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:31.160
They didn't really have good takedown defense.

36
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.910
It hadn't really been established as like a part of the,

37
00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:37.820
the whole skill set of MMA. Yet you basically had what you came in there with.

38
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.640
You're a karate guy. That's what you had your moiety tie guy.

39
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.391
That's what you got.

40
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:43.770
You gotta hope you land that elbow before that guy clenches with you.

41
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.670
<v 0>And there is a,</v>

42
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.460
there is a overall strategic advantage to grappling because

43
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.770
you can close the distance. And if you're going to punch me,

44
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:54.560
you have to get close enough to you. You have to make contact with me,

45
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.660
which means I can grab a hold of you and get you down. That's why,

46
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.460
that's why the early UFC, it was like, oh,

47
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.320
you're gonna have to get close enough to either punch or kick me.

48
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.960
And when you do that, I grab a hold of you and get you to the ground. So.

49
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.160
<v 1>The chaos factor, especially in a street fight, the chaos factor is like,</v>

50
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:11.600
bodies are flying this bad timing, the clenches habit. It's not like every,

51
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.471
you know, you'll see,

52
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:16.400
you'll watch the occasional street fight where a guy tees off on some drunk guy

53
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.260
and you know, it lands the perfect punch and knocks him out cold.

54
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.010
That does happen. Yep. But you know what also happens,

55
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.360
Malay wild misses. And then someone clenches.

56
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.710
And then the worst thing in the world is the fight. A grappler.

57
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.350
Who's good at takedowns when you're on the concrete. Oh,

58
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.540
that is the absolute worst thing in the world.

59
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:38.210
You get suplex on your head on the concrete. I mean,

60
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.150
one of the worst things that could ever happen to you basically getting hit in

61
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:42.620
the head by the world. Yeah.

62
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.370
<v 0>Well, this is why I, when I talk about, you know, people say, well,</v>

63
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.700
what kind of self-defense you, you always say jujitsu for self-defense,

64
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.530
but you know, you shouldn't let a street fight, go to the ground.

65
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.970
Here's here's how it works out.

66
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.260
If you come to me and you want to fight me and you like square off,

67
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:01.240
like in a boxing stance, I can run away from you. Right. I can just run away.

68
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.550
I can just run away. I'm going to get away from you. I don't want to fight you.

69
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.590
If you want to kick me, I can run away from you.

70
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.740
Like there's my primary self-defense is I'm just going to run away from you.

71
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.210
When you grab a hold of me now everything's different. I can't run away anymore.

72
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.020
Now I have to actually know how to handle myself in a grappling situation.

73
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.820
So that's why I start with jujitsu and look, absolutely learn boxing,

74
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.460
learn more time. Learn wrestling. Absolutely. No doubt about it.

75
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.150
But the very first thing you need to learn is, cause if you want to fight me,

76
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.340
I can run away. If you square off, didn't, you know,

77
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:35.020
you put your Dukes up and say, come on or you push me good. I'm running away.

78
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.560
That's fine. I'll take that. But when, as soon as you grab a hold of me, now,

79
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:40.360
I got a problem. Cause I can't run in weight. Right.

80
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.640
<v 1>The real problem is the ego where people don't know how to fight and someone put</v>

81
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.040
their Dukes up and they decide to see what they can do.

82
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.080
They decide in that moment to either fake it or just to like see if they can

83
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:54.780
possibly hit the guy. And then they get pumped, banked.

84
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.580
So many tees off on them.

85
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.380
<v 0>Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think the whole thing with CTE right now,</v>

86
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.210
that's why I think the popularity of jujitsu is going to continue because

87
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.080
it's a large part of fighting. Same with wrestling grappling in general,

88
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.610
I think is going to continue to get more and more popular because,

89
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.570
because of CT, because you know, as a parent, you're not looking, Hey, I want,

90
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:21.870
I really want my kid to be sparring a lot when they're 13, right? No,

91
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.610
there's not too many parents that are saying that right now.

92
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.130
It's not a good idea. Yeah. So I think,

93
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.500
but you still want your kids to know how to fight, right?

94
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.000
So how are we going to do that? Well,

95
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.790
we're going to teach them jujitsu and wrestling and let them have that base.

96
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:35.940
And then if they get older, Hey, should they know how to throw punches?

97
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.863
Absolutely.

98
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.810
Should they get in the boxing ring sometimes and do some boy time matches?

99
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.980
Absolutely. You should absolutely do that as a human. But you know,

100
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:47.820
you can do that when you're 17, maybe 16, you can start getting that stuff in.

101
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:51.150
But the kids jujitsu, I don't think there's anything else better for them.

102
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.140
<v 1>Completely agree. And I think with martial arts, with striking,</v>

103
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:58.680
it's good to know, just to know distance, just to understand where you're safe,

104
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:02.460
where you're not safe and understand tels, understand what's happening.

105
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:04.830
When someone does this, when someone does this,

106
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.920
and then this is common when they do this, this is coming.

107
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.730
Like you should know that because some people don't know that, that you,

108
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:14.280
you should know how to protect yourself, how to keep your hands up,

109
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.040
how to duck under things. You should know that it should,

110
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.550
you should understand the timing. You should understand distance and timing.

111
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.630
Those are important things, but

112
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.570
swinging knuckles with some guy in the street is so dangerous.

113
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.920
Cause first of all, you don't know what he knows and you're,

114
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.330
everyone's vulnerable. Everyone.

115
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:32.280
Every person that gets punched in the face is vulnerable.

116
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.420
And if you just want to have like some sort of a kickboxing match with some man

117
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:37.254
on the concrete,

118
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.240
like I don't advise that I advise clench and trip.

119
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.290
I advise get out of there. Yeah. Get out of there. Yeah. Definitely.

120
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.850
If someone wants to start some with you,

121
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.270
you're absolutely better off just swallowing your ego and getting the out of

122
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:52.104
Dodge.

123
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.790
<v 0>Aye. That's the hor your kid books teach those kids. Hey,</v>

124
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.030
there's going to be problems. There's going to be bullies.

125
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.740
If you can do you don't need to fight them. And what's oh,

126
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.020
I have somebody hit me up. You know? Cause I'm always telling people to change.

127
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.170
It's just trencher to, to have somebody hit me up. You know, I I've tried it.

128
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.590
Uh, but I don't. I want to try. And I tried it a couple of times,

129
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.500
but I don't like to fight. And I'm like, Hey,

130
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.970
if you don't like the fight to fight you more than anyone else's should learn

131
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:23.150
jujitsu. Because if you know, digit two, you probably,

132
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.210
your chances of having to fight will go down a lot just by the way you carry

133
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:28.760
yourself. Just the way by, by the way you present yourself,

134
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.280
the chance of you having to fight, go down a lot.

135
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.610
<v 1>Also, would you Jitsu you're involved in real life struggles.</v>

136
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.110
The thing about like karate sparring and a lot of points like light sparring is

137
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.430
it's not the real chaos that comes with an actual fight.

138
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.630
Whereas jujitsu is full blast. Someone's trying to get you it's full.

139
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.900
So you get used to full blast. You get, you get accustomed to it.

140
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.350
You know what to expect as someone swings for you and you clinch with them,

141
00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.300
you know what it's like to resist with a 100% non-compliant

142
00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:04.660
body, you know, someone's like, really trying to get away from you.

143
00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:08.290
And really it's not like place barring. Yes, you can go.

144
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.570
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
