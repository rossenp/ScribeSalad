1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Um, I've been lost at sea once, which was pretty day. I'm going to say.</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>What.</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.760
<v 0>Happened two years ago? Um,</v>

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.590
I was in Mexico and I was with friends and I was, I was, I was so angry.

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.250
I hated the guy so badly. What happened? So I jumped into water.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.331
What's a friend of mine.

7
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.740
I've never Spearfish before and went in the water

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.610
spirit. No, no, he never did anything. He's just like, oh,

9
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:27.900
I want to look around and see what are you doing? And then I see the boat,

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.420
the water it's pretty deep. Oh, you can't see the bottom. And then the boat,

11
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:35.070
the bowl started going like further and further and further and further and

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.770
further. And my friend is like, oh, what's going on? I'm like nothing, nothing.

13
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.301
And I'm like, okay,

14
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.480
we're going to start swimming from the shore right now for the shore. Yeah,

15
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.830
for sure. So start swimming. It was like, it would have been doable.

16
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:49.950
What was it? I don't know. Maybe a good like five miles maybe.

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.630
<v 1>Shore was, was fine.</v>

18
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.110
<v 0>It was far, it was like, I would have done it.</v>

19
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.810
It was definitely been after Darwin reached the shore.

20
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.070
So I'm trying not to panic. My heart is like pounding in my chest.

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.990
I can feel it in my throat. It's dripping weight, drifting away for no reason.

22
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.240
And some legs in charge of the boat did the captain that we hired.

23
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.760
That was American actually. What'd.

24
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.280
<v 1>He do just start drinking and not paying attention to you. I.</v>

25
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.510
<v 0>Oh wait. And then it were stocks. I told my friend Akilah swim.</v>

26
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:25.440
We swam for about an hour, an hour and a half. And then a boat passes by.

27
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.480
So I started screaming and yelling and I had my Bruie.

28
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:34.500
Luckily I was swimming it and it passed next to me and it wave at me like, hi.

29
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:38.160
I'm like, no, no, no. I'm like how, how, how I go, come kill him nuts.

30
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.460
And then the boat stuff. And they pick us up and I tried to explain,

31
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.420
and my completely nexus in Spanish that we've been straining at sea.

32
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.410
And so I'm like on the boat is like right there super far away.

33
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.970
And they drop us to the boat. The guy is asking me for money. I'm like,

34
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.210
I'm lost at sea. My wetsuit thing. I'm carrying freaking.

35
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.790
<v 1>Like took you to the boat is asking you for money. Now.</v>

36
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.630
<v 0>They got the guy that pick me up. He was asking me for money for tip,</v>

37
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.530
for rescuing me in the middle of the ocean. I was like, sorry,

38
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:11.070
I don't have tip in my panties right now. But thank you for saving my life.

39
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.790
And then you drop us to the boat. And then we get to the boat.

40
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.990
And the guy's like, oh, I didn't put enough gas in a boat. Oops.

41
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.870
I'm like, what? So.

42
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.703
<v 1>He ran out of gas.</v>

43
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.853
<v 0>I guess.</v>

44
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.490
<v 1>So you were, he would never been able to get you home.</v>

45
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.351
<v 0>It was so bad.</v>

46
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.320
And then we managed to the coast guard came and they tried to build a boat.

47
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:38.190
And he started telling to the coast guard to like go screwed himself. Because,

48
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.850
because I don't want to pay for this. You owe a bunch of. I'm like,

49
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.780
can you stop talking right now? Oh my God.

50
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.600
And you literally insulted him so badly. The coast guard left.

51
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.550
Did they take you with them now?

52
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.660
That was still in a boat with my friends ever drinking or understanding what was

53
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.140
going on? Like, why are you so mad? And like, just, just keep drinking.

54
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.940
So how'd get back. And then he managed to find full reception.

55
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.140
And he called the cousin of his wife as his neighbor of this and that to come

56
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.590
tow-in he arrive like about an hour and a half later,

57
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.250
I got back to shore and the guy's like, oh, so what time are you going tomorrow?

58
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm like, screw you. I'm leaving. I'm never going.

59
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.240
<v 1>I'm only going tomorrow. What a delusional,</v>

60
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.180
I know you almost died. And I left you in the ocean and I didn't have any gas.

61
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.890
And I told the coast guard to go off.

62
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.940
<v 0>Ever see you ever again. And we get to the car and my friend is like, oh,</v>

63
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.550
I give him like a hundred dollars and tip, is that enough? I'm like,

64
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:38.020
you did what you said what now? At

65
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.560
my heroes. And, uh, yeah. So save as it was. Yeah.

66
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.800
Yeah.

67
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.650
<v 1>Is that the scariest thing that's ever happened to you in the water besides the</v>

68
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.484
tiger shark?

69
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.390
<v 0>Yeah, definitely. For sure.</v>

70
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.990
<v 1>Was there anything else like that that really freaked me out that should freak</v>

71
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:58.660
you out? Five miles is a long way to swim,

72
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.660
especially if you don't swim distance all the time.

73
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.580
Did you have any flotation device or anything.

74
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.130
<v 0>About that? Big and we were too.</v>

75
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.370
I was more scared because it was about like 4 25.

76
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:11.080
So the sun was getting down really quickly.

77
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.430
<v 1>We'll see where the shore is.</v>

78
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.300
<v 0>Now. I mean, we're delights. Yes, but it's more,</v>

79
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:19.190
I was more freaked about like sharks or things like that.

80
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.440
And when it's dark and it's.

81
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.480
<v 1>So.</v>

82
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.170
<v 0>I, I had moment in spearfishing. That was a little bit freaky.</v>

83
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:30.560
I also had a blackout last year, so yeah,

84
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.520
that's the biggest danger of spearfishing is actually blacking out.

85
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.090
It's not sharks. It's not getting bitten by anything. Yeah.

86
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.830
So basically what happens is that you dive down and then when you come to the

87
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.310
surface, if you stay too long, um, your,

88
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.180
your longs on your way to surface going to expand back and then your original

89
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.780
volume of air that you have left in your, and your lungs and becomes really,

90
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:53.614
really small.

91
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.680
So then the presenters becomes too low and then you pass out what becomes too

92
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:57.100
low.

93
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.930
<v 1>The percentage, percentage.</v>

94
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.150
<v 0>Of oxygen in your lungs become too small. And then you just pass out.</v>

95
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.560
So basically you brains shuts down to make sure that a lack of oxygen is not

96
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:11.230
creating any permanent damages. Oh, what.

97
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.220
<v 1>A 16. It's.</v>

98
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.600
<v 0>Actually kind of sport.</v>

99
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.640
<v 1>Mom that time.</v>

100
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.290
<v 0>But then that's what happens with people is that when it come back up, if you,</v>

101
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.990
buddy's not watching you, and that's why our spit fishing is a team sport.

102
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:25.030
If they're not watching you, if you pass out in the water,

103
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.520
what if they pass out to you gonna sink right down?

104
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.870
<v 1>You both do it at the same time.</v>

105
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.900
<v 0>Well, normally, well, the,</v>

106
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:33.880
the good system to dive is one person dives at a bottom.

107
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:37.270
The person is watching the other one. And then it's one up one down, one up,

108
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:40.300
one down. And then you, you, you, you watch each other's back.

109
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.710
<v 1>Is that what happened with you?</v>

110
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.170
<v 0>Yeah, it was actually very lucky. Um, uh, the, the guy that was diving with me,</v>

111
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.770
um, lost his brother a few years before Joe blackout.

112
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:55.120
So he was looking at me very, very closely. And I'm was,

113
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.790
I was beyond grateful. See his face at a surface. I knew it.

114
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.650
I knew it was going to blackout. So how'd, you know.

115
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.540
<v 1>You're going to black out because.</v>

116
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.230
<v 0>It was, I drove down and I was aiming at a fish. It was pretty deep.</v>

117
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.950
It was at like 85 feet and aim for a fish. It wasn't a pole spirit.

118
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.150
She wasn't in a gun and I missed it and I started choosing it in water and then

119
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.150
I miss it again and it was like, God it. And then I realized, I was like, well,

120
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.000
what am I actually pretty deep? And I've been there for quite a while.

121
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.120
So I started panicking a little bit. So then when you panic,

122
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.420
you let hear even more, which is completely stupid. And then I started finning,

123
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:30.290
finning, finning. And then you have, um, you started doing, uh,

124
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.360
finning, spinning, um, fitting, uh,

125
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.160
when we have you wear fins.

126
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.890
<v 1>Can you finish kicking, kicking? Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.713
<v 0>Yeah, exactly.</v>

128
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.310
And then what happens first before you blackout is you have a loss of motor

129
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:49.520
control. So I could start feeling,

130
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:52.010
I could feel like my body making like weird movements.

131
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.510
And then I knew that it was out of oxygen.

132
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.770
And then I knew that I would probably most probably going to pass out. Wow.

133
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.650
And then I came back, I came back and then I saw them,

134
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:01.130
my friend who was watching. And I was like, oh,

135
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.410
I really hope you watching you hope you're really watching.

136
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.830
And he grabbed me and then he woke me up and it was, how.

137
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.720
<v 1>Far were you from the surface? And you blacked out.</v>

138
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.570
<v 0>I blacked out a surface. Oh, at the surface,</v>

139
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.760
which is why it's called a shallow water blackout.

140
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.710
Cause even if you're in deeper water, it,

141
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.360
most of the time it happens at the surface.

142
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.200
<v 1>So when you got to the surface, what did he have to do to wake you up?</v>

143
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.450
<v 0>Oh, you have to take the mask off.</v>

144
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.660
You have to keep the head of the water and then you have to blow in the eyes

145
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:29.390
because you have a high concentration of nerves. You slapped a little bit,

146
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.170
not too hard. Call the person's name.

147
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:36.500
And then you don't really wake up pretty, pretty fast. Unless you inhale water.

148
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.580
<v 1>What did you, was it like you had a dream, like if you get choked out,</v>

149
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.760
like one of the things that happens when you get choked out is you wake up.

150
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.180
It's like, you're dreaming. Like, whoa, whoa. I was at a disco.

151
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.970
I was riding my skateboard. Like it's weird. I've never.

152
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.860
<v 0>Been choked out to the point of passing out.</v>

153
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.440
<v 1>I would imagine similar though.</v>

154
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.300
<v 0>But yeah, I missed out long in a few, a few minutes and I was just,</v>

155
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:04.460
wasn't sure what was going on. And then you just,

156
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.410
you just done for the day when it happens, but.

157
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.090
<v 1>Yeah, you have to be done. Huh?</v>

158
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.270
<v 0>It's yeah. For the, the risk of getting another one the same day,</v>

159
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:12.104
it's actually very hard.

160
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.920
<v 1>Wow. So once you shut off, you get shut off again. So you have.</v>

161
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.840
<v 0>To wait at least the following day to get back into, want to.</v>

162
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.690
<v 1>Jump back in the next day. Yeah.</v>

163
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.790
<v 0>I think I did. It was the day after.</v>

164
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:25.280
I really want to go back in the water as soon as possible.

165
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.380
<v 1>Just to jump back on the horse. Yeah.</v>

166
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.130
<v 0>So at night I was a little bit stressed out and my friend gave me some freedom</v>

167
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:31.964
and it was fun.

168
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.040
<v 1>Oh, that's tough.</v>

169
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.960
That's I used to think that stuff that create them was, um,

170
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.080
I didn't think it was a drug. I thought it was a mild stimulant.

171
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:46.640
I heard that people take it for pain,

172
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.550
but I thought that when they're taking it for pain,

173
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.720
that they're not getting high. They're just taking it in alleviates pain,

174
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:56.910
like Advil or something like that. And then I took,

175
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.930
I think I took eight of them eight or 10, which is a lot.

176
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.060
Cause I know Chris bell takes like 10.

177
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.960
<v 0>Oh, but it's like, it's a pill. Yeah. Okay. I took it in powder mixed with like.</v>

178
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.890
<v 1>Yeah, this is just the powder in pill form. And I was high as.</v>

179
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.860
And I was like, oh, okay. Now I know why people are nervous about this stuff.

180
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.620
I mean, do you ever, do you get approached by sharks.

181
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.460
<v 0>And The Bahamas? Yeah. And The Bahamas they're pretty much always.</v>

182
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.130
<v 1>There's a guy who just got bit in Texas. He got bit by a bull shark.</v>

183
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.280
And now he has flesh eating bacteria. That's destroying his leg.

184
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.520
Apparently this flesh eating bacteria in the water.

185
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.270
We don't need to Google that. It's pretty, pretty disgusting.

186
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.540
<v 0>I got pretty bad encounters with sharks. What happened?</v>

187
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.280
My worst one was in Tampa, Ashley, something super easy.

188
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.780
It was in 15 feet of water.

189
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:53.160
And that's actually the dangerous pit fishing is when you start getting cocky

190
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.210
and you say like, oh, water shallow is fine. We don't have to watch the Tutter.

191
00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:59.250
Everybody's doing their own thing, which is really bad.

192
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.470
Definitely never do this. I got my lesson break time and I was,

193
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.170
I shot a little fish. So I clip it to the back of my gun.

194
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.090
And then this tiger shark come in and I'm like, Ooh, tiger shark.

195
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.150
They a little bit. They can't be aggressive. Yeah.

196
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.520
They're not the nicest one you want to, you want to show up.

197
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.210
And then he was a junior juvenile one. It was still a good,

198
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:25.620
like seven feet long, seven yet about seven feet long.

199
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.970
But it was young. And the young son read the one that you don't trust,

200
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.420
the big old shark, you know, they wiser,

201
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:35.430
they know they check you out and things like that.

202
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:37.290
But a young ones had one a little bit crazy.

203
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.960
So they going to go more towards you.

204
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:42.450
And they're going to go try to do like curious bites,

205
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.650
which is Mo what happens most of the time, which tried? Why is this acute spike

206
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.830
in? So the, the, the shark is in front of me and he's charging me.

207
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.250
What is mouth open? So I would my gun I'm, I'm poking it.

208
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.480
I'm poking lady eyes. I'm poking the gills and booking knows.

209
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:02.940
I'm trying to poke everything. That's going to hurt him as much as I can.

210
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.520
And I'm not very strong, especially in the water.

211
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:10.080
So I'm really trying to like bang his fricking gun as much as hard as I could in

212
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:13.290
his face. And he doesn't back down.

213
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:15.690
He keeps like circling and he keeps coming in for me.

214
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.910
And at some point I'm like, okay, like something I'm going to have a shoot.

215
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.690
It hoping that that, you know,

216
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.660
I'm not going to miss because if I missed and it's the only thing between me and

217
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.553
the shark.

218
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.180
<v 1>And then you're poking it with the tip.</v>

219
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.870
<v 0>Yeah. I'm just pulling in with a tip and then you roll his eyes back. Oh.</v>

220
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.890
Which is when they, they ready. They're ready to bite. And I'm like, oh.

221
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.830
I'm like, I'm, I'm dying. And I'm like, okay, well, whatever, you know?

222
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.770
So I'm like, I'm like, okay, I'm,

223
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:45.210
I'm going to try to aim and try to see if I can shoot it.

224
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.420
And then my friend arrive, he's like, oh, I heard you screaming. What's up.

225
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.540
You have a fish. I'm like, uh, there's a tiger. Shy behind you buddy.

226
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.570
And he's like, oh crap. He was like, buy from Felix and Montreal.

227
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:58.540
I was like 17 year old at the time.

228
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.830
And you've never rarely Spearfish. It was his first time you're seeing a shark.

229
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.860
I promise his parents that would bring him back in one piece. I'm like,

230
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.920
I'm like, okay. I'm like, don't panic. Everything is fine.

231
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.270
How deep is the water? Like 15 feet of water. It was so shallow. So I'm like,

232
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:16.750
put your back against mine and then cover your half. And if he comes to colder,

233
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.800
spoke it and a shy came in a couple of times. And then because we were too,

234
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.980
he was like, eh, whatever. And he just left. He didn't like that,

235
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:28.630
that he was outnumbered. And I'm like, wow. So when I was alone with a shark,

236
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.950
it was screaming in a water.

237
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:33.160
And I was like calling my friends for help and nobody could hear me.

238
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.990
And then we went back to the boat.

239
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.570
<v 1>The water, how far away can people hear you?</v>

240
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.670
<v 0>Not, not too, not too.</v>

241
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.980
<v 1>Far. 10 feet, 15 feet.</v>

242
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.950
<v 0>So I depends on the wave again and the winds and everything like that,</v>

243
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.770
but nobody could definitely hear me. Then I went, got, get back on the boat.

244
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.251
And my friend,

245
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:51.490
I see my friends swimming towards the boat and he screamed tiger shark.

246
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.990
I'm like, no dumb. I'd be like screaming for your help. But I was half an hour.

247
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.800
And then you get to the boat. Then we left and the shark was like circling.

248
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:04.390
It was like, Ooh, that was really scary. But, and that situation again,

249
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.830
if I had shut the shark to, to save myself,

250
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.810
it's I would have got the worst publicity ever.

251
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.760
It's it's I just, at this one thing I don't understand.

252
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.530
<v 1>That happened where sharks became something that are protected in the public</v>

253
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:24.280
eye,

254
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.140
because was it the governor of New York that killed that shark?

255
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.460
When he was, uh, fishing somewhat with the governor, the mayor,

256
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:38.140
one of those guys was, uh, was sport fishing, caught a shark.

257
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.260
And was it the governor Cuomo.

258
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.600
<v 0>The shy fishing boat.</v>

259
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.750
<v 1>They're edible. I've had Maaco shark in restaurants before,</v>

260
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.560
but something happened. Something changed.

261
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.980
I think it was when there was all this awareness about, um, shark,

262
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:56.890
fin soup. Yeah. There it is. Andrew Cuomo.

263
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.320
He caught 154 pound thresher shark and everybody freaked the out.

264
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:01.990
<v 0>One it's one.</v>

265
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.610
They realized that the Asians were catching millions a day to make sure to make

266
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.200
fence suit.

267
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.550
<v 1>Yeah. So it became, instead of it being something that was just another fish,</v>

268
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.080
then it became something that's protected and people with a very shallow

269
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:21.460
understanding of what a shark is. We're freaking out about it. Yeah.

270
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.100
<v 0>Exactly. It's the Asians need it for everybody else.</v>

271
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.370
<v 1>How dare you be careful today. Say that, especially with crazy rich Asians,</v>

272
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:31.450
number one in the box office.
