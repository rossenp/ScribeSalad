00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.710
Is option for the possibility that one day we could conceivably create,

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.660
uh, some sort of an amazing simulation, but it hasn't been done yet.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.370
And this is why it's become this topic of conversation is that there's some need

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.460
for concern, because this is extrapolate technology.

6
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:22.500
And you think about where it's going now and where it's headed.

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.260
There could conceivably be one day where this exists.

8
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.080
Should we consider this and deal with it now?

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.740
<v 1>Well, so I would say that that would be highly unlikely in that if the third</v>

10
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.650
say, if the first two are wrong, right, then there are many,

11
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:41.300
many more simulated ones than non simulated ones will be over the course of all

12
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.180
of history over the course of all the history has.

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.170
But so then the question is given that, uh, you know,

14
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:50.900
that by the end of time, that will have been,

15
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.550
let's say just a million simulations and one original history. Sure.

16
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.610
Um, and that all of the assimilated people and the original

17
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.040
history, people all have subjectively indistinguishable experiences,

18
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.310
you can from the inside to tell the difference. Right. Then what,

19
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.490
given that assumption, would it be rational for you to believe?

20
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.340
Should you think you are one of the exceptional ones?

21
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.980
Or should you think you are one amongst the largest sets the simulated ones?

22
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.910
Or.

23
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.270
<v 0>Should you think that it just has not happened yet? Just because that would.</v>

24
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.780
<v 1>Be equivalent to saying that you would be one of the non simulated ones.</v>

25
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.490
<v 0>You you're talking about in the universe in yeah. But could, you could make.</v>

26
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.140
<v 1>It even just a, you could look at the narrow case of justice. Let's.</v>

27
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.260
<v 0>Just look in the narrow case of just the earth in the narrow case of just the</v>

28
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:45.590
earth. If the historical record is accurate, if it's not a simulation,

29
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.510
then it seems very reasonable that we're just dealing with incremental increases

30
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:55.220
in technology. That's pretty stunning and pretty, pretty profound currently,

31
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.930
but that we haven't experienced a simulation yet. Isn't there, that's how.

32
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.520
<v 1>It looks. Right. Sure. Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.220
But that's also how it would look if you were in a simulation.

34
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.140
<v 0>Yes. But it's also how it would look if you're not in a simulation yet,</v>

35
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.300
that's also a possibility too, right?

36
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.020
<v 1>Yeah. But for most people, um, who,</v>

37
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.580
for whom it looks like that it would be the case that they would be simulated.

38
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.810
Why? Well, by assumption, if,

39
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.210
if they're all these simulations created.

40
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.930
<v 2>Well, not yet. Well, right, but you don't know what time you don't.</v>

41
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.530
<v 1>Know what time it is in, in external reality.</v>

42
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.620
<v 0>Why we be assumed something so unbelievably fantastic.</v>

43
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.890
When just life itself is preposterous to the life itself.

44
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.380
Just being a human being on a planet, you know,

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.350
this planet is spinning a thousand miles an hour hurling through infinity.

46
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.180
That in itself is fairly preposterous if it didn't exist,

47
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.470
but it does exist.

48
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.480
And we know that we at least were all agreeing upon a certain

49
00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:00.430
historical record. We're agreeing upon Oppenheimer, the project world war one,

50
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.550
world war two, we're agreeing on Korea and Vietnam,

51
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.000
or we're agreeing on Reagan and Kennedy. We're agreeing on all these things.

52
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.223
Historically,

53
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.870
if we are all agreeing that there's this sort of historical

54
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.410
process and we were all agreeing. I remember when the first iPhone was invented.

55
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.110
I remember when the first computer, I remember when this,

56
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:21.430
I remember the internet,

57
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.710
why would we assume that there's a simulation?

58
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.280
We could assume that there's a possibility of a simulation,

59
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.620
but why would you assume that simulation hasn't occurred?

60
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.830
Why wouldn't we assume the simulation hasn't occurred yet?

61
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.760
<v 1>Right? I mean, so it,</v>

62
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.110
it is a possibility that we would be in the first time segments

63
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.700
off all of these. Like it's just more likely if we go outside say no, I mean,

64
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.050
it comes down then to this field, which is tricky,

65
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.830
probably biotic called anthropic.

66
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:57.630
So this is about how to assign probabilities in situations where you have

67
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:01.800
uncertainty about who we are, what time it is, where we are.

68
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.450
Um, so if you might have, for example,

69
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.200
all of these people who would exist in this scenario, uh,

70
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.400
having to place bets on whether they're assimilated or not.

71
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.670
And you think about two possible different ways of reasoning about this.

72
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.660
So one is,

73
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.100
you assume you are a randomly selected individual from all these individuals and

74
00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:28.710
you bet accordingly randomly.

75
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.450
<v 2>Selected individuals. So then you would.</v>

76
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.570
<v 1>Bet you're one of the simulated ones, because like randomly selected ones,</v>

77
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:36.360
if most are assimilated, most lottery tickets, are.

78
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.810
<v 0>We assuming that most are simulated? This is where I'm getting confused. Well,</v>

79
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.540
because it will have been simulated by the end of time.

80
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.640
<v 2>By the end of this is like a timeless claim.</v>

81
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.740
<v 0>I already, when it hasn't existed yet, like I'm, I'm like,</v>

82
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.090
let's say for the sake of argument,

83
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.960
cause I don't really have an opinion on this pro or con I'm opening the air.

84
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.490
But if I was going to argue about pragmatic reality, the, the,

85
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:04.020
the practicality of biological existence has a person that has a finite

86
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:07.440
lifespan. You're born, you die. You're here right now.

87
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.730
And we're a part of this just long line of humanity.

88
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:14.730
That's created all these incredible things. It's led up to civilization.

89
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.550
That's led up to this moment right now where you and I are talking into these

90
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:19.950
microphones and it's being broadcast everywhere.

91
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.270
Why isn't it likely that assimilation hasn't occurred yet?

92
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.010
That we are in the process of innovating and one day could

93
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:31.170
potentially experience a simulation,

94
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.950
but why are you not factoring in the possibility or the probability that that

95
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:35.880
hasn't taken place?

96
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.620
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, so it's in there,</v>

97
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.420
but if you imagine that people follow this

98
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:47.010
general principle of assuming that they would be the ones

99
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.990
in the original history before the simulations had happened, right.

100
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.280
Then almost all of them would turn out to be wrong and they would lose their

101
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:59.480
bets once a simulation has actually, I mean, if, if,

102
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.890
if it kind of integrate over, you know, the university, there's no.

103
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.550
<v 0>Evidence that a simulation has taken place, but there is evidence.</v>

104
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.740
<v 2>That you're alive. You have a mother you have, well, I.</v>

105
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.340
<v 1>Mean, those things could be true in the simulation as well. I mean, could be,</v>

106
00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:16.630
but isn't that a pipe dream? Well, it depends on what simulation, right.

107
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:20.310
Does that mean a lot of simulations might run for a long time and have a mantra.

108
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.520
Yeah. Yeah. But we.

109
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.840
<v 0>Know that if someone shoots you you'll die. We know if you eat food,</v>

110
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:30.370
you get full. We know these things, these things could be objective,

111
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.170
objective facts. These can be yes, right now.

112
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.300
Why would we assume? Why,

113
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:41.470
why would a simulation be the most likely scenario

114
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.380
when we've experienced?

115
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:47.980
At least we believe we've experienced all this innovation in our lifetime.

116
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:50.140
We see it moving towards a certain direction.

117
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.200
Why wouldn't we assume that that hasn't taken place yet?

118
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.200
<v 1>Yeah, I think, um,</v>

119
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.180
to try to argue for the premise that conditional on there being

120
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:05.530
first, an initial segment of non simulated Joe Rogan experiences,

121
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.040
and then a lot of other segments of simulated ones. Yes.

122
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.480
That conditional on that being the way the world in totality looks,

123
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.770
you should think you're one of the simulated ones. Why? Well, to argue for that,

124
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.420
I think then you need to roll in this piece of probability theory called

125
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.460
anthropics, which I alluded to.

126
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:29.200
And just to pull one little element out of there to kind of create some

127
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:31.000
initial possibility for this.

128
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:35.860
If you think in terms of rational betting strategies for this population

129
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.660
of Joe Rogan experiences,

130
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.970
the ones that would lead to the overall maximum amount of winning would be,

131
00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:47.920
if you all thought you're probably one of the simulated segments. Um,

132
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.850
if you had the general reasoning rule that in this kind of situation,

133
00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:54.940
you should think that you're the initial segment of the non simulated Rogan.

134
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.140
Then the great preponderance, um,

135
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.100
of these simulated experiences would lose star bets,

136
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.230
but there's no evidence.

137
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.520
<v 0>Of a simulation.</v>

138
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.530
<v 1>Well,</v>

139
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.000
I'd say that there is indirect evidence insofar as there is evidence

140
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.610
against these two alternatives.

141
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.290
<v 0>Well, the two alternatives being that they do tell her,</v>

142
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.300
so life goes extinct before they create any sort of simulation or that they

143
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.490
agreed to not create a simulation.

144
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.190
But what about if they're going to create a simulation,

145
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.970
there has to be a time before the simulation is created.

146
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.230
Why wouldn't you assume that that time is now currently happening when you've

147
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:41.830
got a historical record of all the innovation that's leading up to today?

148
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.260
If we understand? No, I mean.

149
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.020
<v 1>So I think the historical record would be there in dissimulation, but there.</v>

150
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.500
<v 0>Would, it have to be there in a simulation and not be there in reality.</v>

151
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.610
<v 1>Well, I mean, it, it, it could be there in a simulation if it's a kind.</v>

152
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.550
<v 2>Of simulation tracks all. Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.550
<v 1>Um, if it's a fantasy simulation, then, you know, maybe it wouldn't be right,</v>

154
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:02.060
but it could.

155
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.120
<v 0>Just be reality. It doesn't have to be right.</v>

156
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.610
<v 1>I mean, sometimes it would be both, right. I mean,</v>

157
00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:11.270
that would be one Joe Rogan experience in their real or regional history.

158
00:09:11.271 --> 00:09:14.660
And then like maybe a million that does say, uh,

159
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.050
in simulated realities later. But if you think about your actions,

160
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.520
that kind of can't distinguish between these different possible locations in

161
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:26.480
space time where you could be, most of the, um,

162
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.400
impact of your decisions will come from impacting all of these million

163
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.540
UroGen instances that existed in relationships, simulation.

164
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.680
<v 0>Has been proven to exist, which it hasn't been. We, we,</v>

165
00:09:38.681 --> 00:09:42.710
we have at least in terms of what we all agree. We're,

166
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.620
we're proven to have biological lives. We breed, we sleep, we,

167
00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:51.470
we eat, we, we travel on planes. And so those things.

168
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.920
<v 1>Are true. Yeah. I mean, I'd say those are, uh, are true.</v>

169
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.950
Probably even if we are in a simulation.

170
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.290
<v 0>Would you assume we're in a simulate, this is where I'm stuck,</v>

171
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.010
because why wouldn't you assume that a simulation is one day possible?

172
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.420
There's no proof or no evidence that makes any sense to me that there is

173
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:10.430
currently any simulation.

174
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.100
<v 1>Right? I mean, so it's a matter of, uh, probabilities and the numbers games,</v>

175
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:19.280
right? Is it, uh, that's.

176
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.440
<v 2>Oh, sorry. That reality.</v>

177
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.120
<v 0>But what would point to the possibility that it's more probable that we were in</v>

178
00:10:26.121 --> 00:10:27.290
a simulation? This is what.

179
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.200
<v 1>Wow. Okay. So I could mention some possibilities that would</v>

180
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.130
the most obvious,

181
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.860
like might have a big window pops up in front of you saying you're in a

182
00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:37.694
simulation.

183
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.490
<v 2>Click here for more info, pretty conclusive.</v>

184
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.240
<v 1>Right? Yes. Right. So short of that, um,</v>

185
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.950
you would have weaker probabilistic evidence insofar as you had evidence

186
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:53.720
against the two alternatives. So for example, if you,

187
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.740
if you got some evidence that suggested it was less likely that all

188
00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.560
civilizations at our stage go extinct before maturity,

189
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.150
let's say we get our act together. We eliminate nuclear weapons. We, you know,

190
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:08.630
we become prudent and we check all the asteroids.

191
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.360
Nothing is some collision course where there are stuff that kind of tend to

192
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:15.380
lower the probability of the first. Right. Okay. Um,

193
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.060
so that would tend to shift probability over on the remaining alternatives,

194
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.920
but let's suppose that we moved closer ourselves to becoming posthuman.

195
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.370
We develop more advanced computers and VR,

196
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:30.860
and like we're getting close to this point ourselves.

197
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.360
And we still remain really interested in running ancestor.

198
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.420
Disseminations we think are,

199
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.640
this is what we really want to spend our resources on.

200
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.050
As soon as we can make it work,

201
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.150
that that would move probability over from the second alternative.

202
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.160
Like it's less likely that there is this strong convergence among all post human

203
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.140
technological immature civilizations.

204
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:55.180
If we ourselves are almost post-human and still have this interest in creating

205
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.433
ancestor simulations.

206
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.850
So that would shove probability over to the remaining alternative,

207
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:03.880
take the extreme case of this. Like it might only, if we, you know,

208
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:08.440
a thousand years from now have built our own planetary science computer that can

209
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:13.180
run these simulations and we are just about to switch it on and it will create

210
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.620
the simulation of precisely, uh, people like ourselves.

211
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.550
And as we move towards the big button to sort of initiate this,

212
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:26.380
like then the probability of the first two hypothesis basically

213
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.910
goes to zero, right?

214
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.860
And then we would have to conclude with near certainty that we are ourselves in

215
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:36.070
a simulation as we push this button to create a million simulations.

216
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.480
<v 0>Once we achieved that state, but we have not achieved that state.</v>

217
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.440
Why would we not assume that we are in the actual state that we currently

218
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.460
experience? Wait.

219
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.470
<v 1>We shouldn't assume we should.</v>

220
00:12:46.471 --> 00:12:51.300
We should assume that we are ignorant as to which of these different, um,

221
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.050
time slices we are, which of these different, um,

222
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.460
Joe Rogan experiences is, is the present one.

223
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:05.400
Um, we, we just can't tell from the inside which one it is. Yeah. I mean,

224
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.490
if, if you had, if you could see like some objective clock and, uh,

225
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:11.490
and say that well, as, as yet,

226
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.910
the clock is so early that no simulations have happened,

227
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.240
then obviously you could conclude that during the original history.

228
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.600
But if we can see that clock outside the window,

229
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.280
if there isn't a window in the simulation to look out,

230
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.210
then it would look the same. And then I'd say, oh,

231
00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:30.030
we have no way of telling which of these different instances we are.

232
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.040
<v 0>And one of them might be that there is no simulation and that we're moving</v>

233
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:39.150
towards that simulation. That one day it could be [inaudible]

234
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.983
, but in a million. So one in a million is that life is what experience right now.

235
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.540
<v 2>One in a minute, I mean, conditional on the other, uh, I'll try to do speaking,</v>

236
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.320
not on those other.

237
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.100
<v 0>Alternatives being wrong. What's let's,</v>

238
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.170
let's say that human beings haven't blown themselves up yet.

239
00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.030
Let's say that human beings haven't come up with th th th there was no need to

240
00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:03.600
make the decision to not activate the simulation because the simulation hasn't

241
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:06.720
been invented yet. Isn't that also a possibility,

242
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.860
is it also a possibility that the actual timeline of technological innovation

243
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:12.480
that we all agree on is real,

244
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.290
and that we're experiencing this as real live human beings,

245
00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:21.000
not in a simulation that one day that simulation could potentially take place,

246
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.540
but has not yet. Isn't that also a possibility.

247
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:25.710
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, sure.</v>

248
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.260
It's just a question of how probable that is given the, why.

249
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.480
<v 0>Isn't it super probable cause we're experiencing.</v>

250
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.360
<v 1>It. Well, I mean, it would be a very unusual, uh,</v>

251
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.420
situation for somebody with your experiences to be in.

252
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.990
What about your experiences for my experiences are the same, same there. Yeah.

253
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.430
It would be extremely unusual. There's 7 billion unusual experience.

254
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.970
<v 2>[Inaudible] I think if there were, uh.</v>

255
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.300
<v 1>Like say a million simulations, right. Then, you know, that would be, um,</v>

256
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.560
a million times more.

257
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.500
<v 0>Would there be any simulations?</v>

258
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.290
Why would there not just be 7 billion people experiencing.

259
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.780
<v 1>Right. Yeah. That mean,</v>

260
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.140
then that would have to be something that prevents these simulations from,

261
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.630
from being created. This is where you lose me. Yeah.

262
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.490
So I think maybe the differences, I tend to think in terms of, um,

263
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.930
the world as a forte,

264
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.610
four dimensional structure with time being one dimension. Right. Okay.

265
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.540
So you think in the totality of existence,

266
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.590
that will have happened by the end of time,

267
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.290
you'll look at all the different experiences that match your current

268
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:35.410
experience. Okay. Um,

269
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.360
given these various assumptions,

270
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.790
the vast majority of thoughts would be simulated.

271
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.250
Why? Well,

272
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.680
the various assumptions being that option one and two are false. Basically.

273
00:15:50.681 --> 00:15:50.800
What.

274
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.920
<v 2>About option? My option. Yeah. So in your option.</v>

275
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.780
<v 1>The vast majority of all these experiences that will ever have existed will also</v>

276
00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:00.930
be simulated. If I understand your no, no, no.

277
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.240
My assumption is that nothing's happened yet. Yeah. But they will have been.

278
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.030
<v 0>Maybe, but not yet.</v>

279
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.770
<v 1>Right. But as I understand your option, this,</v>

280
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.030
that if we look at the universe at the end of time and we'll look back,

281
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.240
that will be a lot of simulated versions of you. And then one.

282
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.620
<v 2>Original one that you think you might be the original.</v>

283
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.160
<v 0>No, I'm not even considering that.</v>

284
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.750
What I'm saying is we may just be

285
00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:29.890
here that there is no simulation and that may be,

286
00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:31.540
it will take place someday.

287
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.520
<v 2>But maybe it will not. Right. But.</v>

288
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.690
<v 1>You have to, you have to sort of pick which of those versions you're,</v>

289
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.340
which of those scenarios you are considering.

290
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.430
<v 0>Is the,</v>

291
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.080
that is the scenario I'm considering the scenario I'm considering is we are just

292
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:46.330
here we are, but what happens.

293
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.590
<v 1>After like, so I want this Nora to say, what's happened in the past,</v>

294
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.660
what happens now? And what will happen in the future.

295
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.240
<v 2>Is going to happen in the future. Right. That's.</v>

296
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.150
<v 1>That's right. So we can consider both options, right? Yes.</v>

297
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.530
One option where there are no simulations created later. Right.

298
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.810
Then I would say that means one of the first two alternatives.

299
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.440
<v 0>The other option is there could be a simulation created later,</v>

300
00:17:11.441 --> 00:17:13.230
but it has not taken place yet that.

301
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.070
<v 1>That will be similar to the state. It.</v>

302
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.640
<v 0>Is that it's a possibility, but it has not happened. Right.</v>

303
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.030
<v 1>But that, that will be later that's, that's one possibility. And so then I say,</v>

304
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.920
if that's the world that we are looking at than

305
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.780
most, uh, experiences of your kind

306
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.050
exists inside the simulation.

307
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.840
<v 0>I still, I don't understand that. Why can it not have happened?</v>

308
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.780
<v 1>Well, it kinda depends on which of these experiences is your</v>

309
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.630
present moment in that scenario, so that that's gotta be a million of them.

310
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.800
Plus an initial one. You can't tell from the inside.

311
00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.170
<v 0>Be there will be a million of them, but there's right now,</v>

312
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.040
no evidence that there's going to be no evidence,

313
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:07.370
that there is no evidence that it's ever even going to be possible.

314
00:18:07.371 --> 00:18:11.810
Technologically. We think there could be, but it hasn't happened yet.

315
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.460
So why would you assume that we are in a simulation currently when there's no

316
00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:19.850
evidence whatsoever that it's even possible to create a simulation.

317
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.350
<v 1>Maybe various,</v>

318
00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:28.190
some alternative way of trying to explain.

319
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.443
<v 2>How I think.</v>

320
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.470
<v 1>I'm thinking like, suppose I understand you're saying that there's some, sorry,</v>

321
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.773
sorry, sorry.

322
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.210
I'm just thinking maybe we could think of some simpler thought experiment,

323
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.410
which has nothing to do with simulations and stuff. But, um,

324
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.630
imagine if, um, so I'm making this up as I go along as well.

325
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.880
We'll see if it actually works,

326
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.990
but you are taking into a room,

327
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.310
uh, and then you are awake there for one hour

328
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.640
and then a coin is tossed.

329
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.330
And if it lands heads,

330
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.230
then the experiment ends and you exit the room and everything is normal again.

331
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.630
But if it lands tails,

332
00:19:11.631 --> 00:19:16.370
then you're given an amnesia drug and then you're woken up in the room. Again.

333
00:19:16.371 --> 00:19:18.920
You think you're there for the first time because you don't remember having been

334
00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:22.310
there before. Right. And then this is repeated 10 times.

335
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.680
So we have a world where either there is one,

336
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.640
one hour experience. If you're in the room or Alice,

337
00:19:31.641 --> 00:19:36.470
it's a world where 10 Joe Rogan experiences in the room with an episode of

338
00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:38.300
amnesia in between. Right.

339
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.530
But when you're in the room now and you find yourself in this room,

340
00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:47.420
you're wondering, Hmm, is this the first time I'm in this room? Uh,

341
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.340
it could be, but it could also be that, um, later on, on,

342
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.160
I was just given an amnesia drug. Okay.

343
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.610
So the question now is when you wake up in this room,

344
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.290
you have to assign probabilities to these different places you could be in time

345
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.210
and be, have to bet or make some decision that depends on where you are.

346
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:15.140
Um, so, uh, what I,

347
00:20:15.141 --> 00:20:18.250
I guess I could ask you, like, so let's say if you wake up in this room, what,

348
00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:22.520
what, what do you think the probability should be? That the coin that, that,

349
00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:26.150
that you're like at the time one versus at some later time?

350
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.951
<v 0>Well,</v>

351
00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:32.270
what is the probability that I'm actually here versus what is the probability of

352
00:20:32.271 --> 00:20:35.570
this highly unlikely scenario that I keep getting drugged over and over again?

353
00:20:35.571 --> 00:20:37.550
Every hour. Okay. We assume that.

354
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.930
<v 1>Like, in certain that,</v>

355
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.970
that the setup is such that there was this mad scientist who had the means to do

356
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:47.920
this and he was gonna flip this coin. Right. So we assuming that's,

357
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.240
you're sure about that either way.

358
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:51.340
The only thing you're unsure about is how the coin.

359
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.561
<v 0>Landed. Okay. Well,</v>

360
00:20:52.561 --> 00:20:56.700
if that was a scenario where I knew that there was a possibility of a mad

361
00:20:56.701 --> 00:20:58.710
scientist and I could wake up over and over again,

362
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.110
that seems like a recipe for insanity.

363
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.340
<v 1>Um, well, it's a philosophical thought experiment.</v>

364
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:10.050
<v 2>So it's a way we can obstruct away from my initially and I'll get back to it is</v>

365
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:11.730
there's no evidence at all.

366
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.440
<v 0>That we're in a simulation.</v>

367
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.070
So why wouldn't we assume that the most likely scenario is taking place,

368
00:21:17.071 --> 00:21:20.220
which is we are just existing and life is,

369
00:21:20.221 --> 00:21:22.350
as it seems strange.

370
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.020
<v 1>So, okay. So if, if you, if you don't want to do this thought experiment,</v>

371
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:29.370
[inaudible].

372
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.680
<v 0>Incredibly limited, right? I was just saying, well, I'm trying.</v>

373
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.570
<v 1>To distill the probability theory apart from</v>

374
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.520
the wider simulation,

375
00:21:38.521 --> 00:21:41.820
but I guess I could also ask you if,

376
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.990
if we were to move closer to disappoint where we ourselves can create

377
00:21:45.991 --> 00:21:47.550
simulations. If we, if we survive,

378
00:21:47.551 --> 00:21:52.050
we become a multi-planetary is we build planetary sized computers. Yeah. Um,

379
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:58.020
how would your probability in the simulation hypothesis change as we kind of

380
00:21:58.021 --> 00:21:58.650
develop what.

381
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.520
<v 0>Would change based on the evidence of some profound technological innovation</v>

382
00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:05.730
that actually would allow someone to create a simulation that's

383
00:22:05.731 --> 00:22:07.260
indistinguishable from reality.

384
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.300
But I would rather assume that reality itself currently is

385
00:22:12.301 --> 00:22:16.200
just that, because it seems to be isn't that Ockham's razor,

386
00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:20.730
isn't that the simplest answer, this is reality. This is wood.

387
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.020
You are here. You actually are here one day. There may be a simulation.

388
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.100
It has not happened yet.

389
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.140
<v 1>Yeah. I think it's not.</v>

390
00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:32.250
That comes razor in that it would require you to postulate that you are this

391
00:22:32.251 --> 00:22:37.050
very unusual and special observer amongst all the observers that

392
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.310
will exist. But.

393
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:42.630
<v 0>Why is that? But everyone is unusual in their own way. That's true,</v>

394
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.290
but there's no, there's no clones. There's no one person,

395
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.670
that's a version that's living the same exact life in a million different

396
00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:51.840
scenarios and.

397
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.700
<v 1>Disrespect. Um,</v>

398
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.230
if there are all these simulations than most of these people

399
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.730
are not special in this way, that most of them are simulator. Um,

400
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.920
and only at the finding of minority population, right.

401
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.290
Always have many simulations. If there's no simulation.

402
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:12.480
<v 2>Then if there are no simulations and that we'll ever be in a simulation, Stan,</v>

403
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.620
who's saying there never will.

404
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.680
<v 1>Be well. So, so this, um, since,</v>

405
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.000
since we don't know what time it is now

406
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.540
in external reality, right. Um,

407
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.730
and we're,

408
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.890
therefore can't tell from looking at our evidence where we are

409
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.390
in, in a world where either there is just an original history and then it ends,

410
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.810
or there is a world within the original history and then a lot of simulations.

411
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.960
Um, we need to think about how to assign probabilities,

412
00:23:42.961 --> 00:23:46.370
given each of these two scenarios. Right. Um,

413
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:49.670
and so then we have a situation that is somewhat analogous to this one,

414
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.540
with the amnesia room where you have kind of some number of episodes.

415
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.330
And so the question is in those types of, uh, situations,

416
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:04.130
how do you allocate probability over the different hypothesis about how the

417
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:08.300
world is structured? And, um, this kind of bet thing,

418
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:13.280
argument is one type of argument that you can try to reduce to kind of get

419
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:16.730
some grip on that. And another is by looking at, um,

420
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.460
various applications in, in, in,

421
00:24:20.461 --> 00:24:24.560
in cosmology and stuff where you have multiverse theories, um,

422
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.650
which say the university is very big. Maybe there are many other universities,

423
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:29.150
maybe there are a lot of observers,

424
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:33.570
maybe all possible observer success out there in different configuration. How,

425
00:24:33.571 --> 00:24:36.200
how do you drive probabilistic predictions from that? Like,

426
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:40.430
it seems like whatever you observe would be observed by somebody.

427
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:44.540
So how could you test that kind of theory and this same kind of

428
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.760
anthropic reasoning that I want to use in the context of the simulation

429
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:53.780
argument, um, also plays a role, I think,

430
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.940
in driving observational predictions from these kinds of cosmological

431
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:03.920
theories where you need to assume something like you are most likely a

432
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.420
typical observer from amongst the observers that will ever have existed.

433
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.330
Um, so I would suggest, um, now I,

434
00:25:12.331 --> 00:25:16.550
I should admit as an asterisk that this

435
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.530
field of anthropic reasoning is tricky and not fully settled yet,

436
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.570
and are things there that, um, we don't yet fully understand,

437
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.070
but still the particular application of anthropic reasoning that is relevant for

438
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:35.420
the simulation argument, I think is one of the relatively less problematic ones.

439
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:40.490
So that conditional on there being by the end of time,

440
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.750
a large number of simulated Joe Rogan's and only one original one,

441
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.270
I think conditional and that hypothesis,

442
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.010
it would seem that most of your probabilities should be on being one of the

443
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:54.890
simulated ones, but I'm not sure I have any other ways of,

444
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.550
I can understand.

445
00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.980
<v 0>What you're saying. I completely understand what you're saying,</v>

446
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:05.080
but I don't know why you're not willing to take into account the possibility

447
00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:06.100
that it hasn't occurred yet.

448
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:07.510
<v 1>Yeah. So I mean,</v>

449
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.920
the way I say it is that I have taken that into account and they received the

450
00:26:11.921 --> 00:26:15.250
same probability that I'm, that initial segment,

451
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.390
as I would give to any of the other Nick Bostrom segments that all have the same

452
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.260
evidence. See, that's where.

453
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.771
<v 0>We differ,</v>

454
00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:24.940
because I would give much more probability to the fact that we are existing

455
00:26:24.941 --> 00:26:29.890
right now in the current state, as we experience it in real life,

456
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.470
carbon life, no simulation,

457
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.250
but that potentially one day there could be a simulation,

458
00:26:36.251 --> 00:26:40.870
which leads us to look at the possibilities and look at the probabilities that

459
00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:41.704
it's already occurred.

460
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:47.190
<v 1>All right. So what about this? Suppose it is the case that,</v>

461
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.370
all right.

462
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.230
So what we think happened is there was a big bang planets formed and done some

463
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:54.830
billions of year later, we evolved and here we are now. Right? Right.

464
00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.090
Suppose some physicists told you that while the universe is very big and early

465
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:02.700
on in the universe, very, very rare acacias.

466
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.370
There wasn't a big gas cloud in an infinite universe.

467
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:08.280
This will happen somewhere, right. Where just by chance,

468
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.380
that was a kind of Joe Rogan,

469
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:15.090
like brain coming together for a minute and done dissolved in the gas. Right.

470
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.750
And yeah, if you haven't even a universe, it's gotta happen somewhere. It's, uh,

471
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.820
but that's gotta be a minimum in a fewer Joe Rogan brains in such

472
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:25.860
situations then we'll exist later on,

473
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.350
on planets because evolution helps funnel probability into these kinds

474
00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:33.780
of organized structures. Right?

475
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.100
So if some physics told you that, well, this,

476
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:42.540
this is the structure of our part space time. Like there are like a few very,

477
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:46.530
very rare spontaneously materialized brains from gas clouds early in the

478
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:50.070
universe. And then there are the normal Rogan's is much later.

479
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:52.200
And now of course, many, many more normal ones,

480
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.800
the normal ones happen in one out of every, you know,

481
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.200
tend to the power of 50 planets. Whereas the, uh,

482
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.430
the weird ones happen in one out of 10 to the power versus weird house.

483
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:05.490
So how are you defining the normal ones are ones that have evolved on planet.

484
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.500
Sons had the mother and.

485
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.710
<v 2>Different. Is that what you're talking about in different planets?</v>

486
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.940
We only have one planet, right. And it's, it's.

487
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.670
<v 1>Like a, well, I mean, actually there are a lot of planets in the universe.</v>

488
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.880
That's gotta be a lot of couples, right. That has life.

489
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.520
<v 0>Right. This is pure speculation.</v>

490
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:27.470
<v 1>Right. But this is a thought experiment. In fact, it actually probably is, uh,</v>

491
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.630
matches reality in this respect.

492
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.960
Most likely there's some other planets out there. Well, there, I might not.

493
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.700
I think the fact that it matches relatives,

494
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.980
I think irrelevant to the point I want to make.

495
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.150
But so if this turned out to be the way the world works,

496
00:28:41.151 --> 00:28:43.610
a few weird ones happening from gas clouds,

497
00:28:43.611 --> 00:28:47.060
and then the vast majority are just normal people living on a planet.

498
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.920
Would you similar to say given that model, um,

499
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.570
that you should think, oh, I might just as well be one of these gas cloud ones,

500
00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.320
because after all it, the other ones might not have happened yet.

501
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.330
<v 0>What have I lost you? You lost me. Sorry. Yeah.</v>

502
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.780
<v 1>Um, anyway,</v>

503
00:29:08.781 --> 00:29:12.020
I think that this would be a structurally similar situation where there would be

504
00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:15.410
a few exceptional early living versions.

505
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.470
Um, that, that would be very small in numbers compared to the later ones.

506
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.700
And if they allow themselves the same kind of reasoning where they would say,

507
00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:30.020
well, the other ones may or may not come to exist later on planets. Um,

508
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.570
I have no reason to believe I'm one of the planet living ones.

509
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.480
Then it seems that in this model of the universe,

510
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:40.190
you should think you're one of these early gas cloud ones. And as I,

511
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.140
as I as said, I mean, this looks like it probably actually is

512
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.710
the, uh, the world we are living in, in,

513
00:29:49.711 --> 00:29:51.880
in that it looks like it's infinite to bake.

514
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.090
And that would have been a few Joe Rogan's spontaneous degenerated,

515
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:57.310
very early from random processes.

516
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.480
They're going to be very few numbers compared to ones that have in our recent on

517
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.640
planets. Um,

518
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.520
so that by taking the path you want to take with relation to dissemination

519
00:30:09.521 --> 00:30:09.911
argument,

520
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:14.170
I wonder if you would not be committed to thinking that you would be like in a

521
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:18.310
fact that Boltzmann brain in, in a gas cloud super early in the universe.

522
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.820
<v 0>I still don't understand what you're saying.</v>

523
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:25.680
What I'm saying is that we scientists agree if you

524
00:30:25.681 --> 00:30:30.420
believe in science. And if you believe in the discoveries that so far,

525
00:30:30.421 --> 00:30:33.000
people have all currently agreed to,

526
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.860
we have agreed that clouds are formed in that planets are

527
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:42.870
created. And then all the matter comes from inside of the explosions of a star.

528
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:47.760
And that it takes multiple times for this to coalesce before we can develop

529
00:30:47.761 --> 00:30:51.990
carbon based life forms, all of that stuff science currently agrees on, right?

530
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.770
And then we believe in single cell organisms become multi-celled organisms

531
00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:59.280
through random mutation and natural selection. We get evolution.

532
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.750
And then we agree that we have come to a point now where

533
00:31:03.751 --> 00:31:07.320
technology has hit this gigantic spike that you described earlier.

534
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.810
So human beings have created all this new innovation.

535
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.850
Why wouldn't we assume that all this is actually taking place right now with

536
00:31:14.851 --> 00:31:15.750
no simulation?

537
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.760
<v 1>Uh, yeah. I mean, the simulation argument is this, the, the answer to that,</v>

538
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.550
but with a qualification dab, a,

539
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.530
the simulation argument doesn't even purport to prove the simulation hypothesis

540
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:33.510
there. These alternatives be that even if the simulation hypothesis is true,

541
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.700
uh, in many versions of it, it would actually be the case that, uh,

542
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:43.170
in the simulation, all of these things have taken place. Um,

543
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.880
and the simulation might go back a long time and

544
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.670
it might be a reality tracking simulation.

545
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.570
Maybe these same things also happened before outside the simulation.

546
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.220
<v 0>I understand that. Um, but,</v>

547
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.230
or all these things have actually happened and there is no simulation yet.

548
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.730
Yep. That's possible too. Doesn't that seem really probable.

549
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.770
<v 1>Well, I mean, to me, it seems probable only if, uh,</v>

550
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.300
at least one of the other alternatives is true. Or when I,

551
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.560
I admit that there is also this general possibility, which is always there,

552
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.550
that I'm confused about some big thing. Like the,

553
00:32:23.551 --> 00:32:25.890
maybe the simulation argument is wrong in some way. Like,

554
00:32:25.891 --> 00:32:30.270
I'm just looking at the track record of science and philosophy we find were

555
00:32:30.271 --> 00:32:33.480
sometimes wrong. So I attached some probability to that, but,

556
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.050
but if we're working within the parameters of what currently seems to me to be

557
00:32:37.051 --> 00:32:40.100
the case, um, that would be the first,

558
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:47.000
um, civilization in a universe where there will later be many, many simulations,

559
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.570
um, seems, uh, yeah. On, on unlikely for those exact reasons.

560
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:57.230
And that if we are the first it's probably because one of the alternatives is

561
00:32:57.231 --> 00:32:57.470
true.
