00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Here's the numbers, right?</v>

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.480
The hospitalizations intensive care unit admission case by case fatality

3
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:13.400
percentages reported for COVID 19 by 18, uh, uh, COVID 19 by age group.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.920
So this is up until March 16th, which is a couple days ago.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.670
So zero to 19 there's, uh, hundred 23 cases.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.870
1.6 to 2.5 were hospitalized zero ICU,

7
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.590
zero fatality.

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.990
So then you get 20 to 44 that's you 705 cases,

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.590
14.3 to 20.8 hospitalizations,

10
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.780
two to four ICU and 0.1 to

11
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:47.740
0.2 case fatality. Now you gotta think those people are preexisting conditions.

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.860
Just looking at those numbers. 45 to 54, uh, that's my age group,

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.740
429 cases, less for some weird reason,

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.220
21 to 28 hospitalization, 5.4 to 10.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.730
It for ICU 1.4 to 2.6 fatality.

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.910
Again,

17
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.690
you gotta think those people have preexisting conditions and it gets all the way

18
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:15.250
up to really old. Let's go to 85 plus that's call's age that's call's age. Yeah,

19
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.090
144 hospital, 144 cases,

20
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.680
31 out of 144 to 70, uh, hospitalization.

21
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:26.160
So 31.3 to 70.3, hospitalization,

22
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.280
six to 29 ICU fatalities,

23
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.600
10 to 27. So the vast majority of, of fatalities,

24
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.040
you looking at people between 75 and 84,

25
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.840
which is 4.3 to 10.5 and then 85 plus,

26
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.030
which is 10.4 to 27.3. So it's, it's really,

27
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:48.550
obviously not good for really old people.

28
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.430
It looks like you got a 25% fatality rate at the,

29
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.870
the worst case scenario for hospitalized people that have the case.

30
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.270
But again, for young healthy people,

31
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.900
it's not what it's being. It's not,

32
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.340
it's not the big monster that everybody thinks it is. I mean,

33
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.420
there's people running around terrified that are young and healthy.

34
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.300
Well then there's the real concern is older folks. Well,

35
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.380
there's other the spectrum too.

36
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.940
There's the young people running around terrified and healthy.

37
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:21.460
And then there's the people who are mobbing beaches in Florida on spring break

38
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:25.090
saying our future leaders. it. Uh, did you see that video?

39
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:28.810
I'll probably be gone by the time they're the future leaders, but yeah, &lt;laugh&gt;,

40
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.770
it's hilarious, but, and you have to assume though,

41
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.690
that those numbers are completely inaccurate.

42
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.850
I would imagine the number because of the lack of testing,

43
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.610
but there's percentages are probably still the same. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

44
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:45.560
you know, I think there's probably just bigger numbers. Yeah. It's uh, well,

45
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.680
kids are just gonna be kids, man. You get 18 year olds on the beach in Florida.

46
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:53.760
They're there to. They, they're not worried about catching the,

47
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:55.800
the COVID 19. They don't even know what the that is.

48
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.600
Their brains aren't even formed yet. Yeah.

49
00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:00.680
As my nine year old says they have mushy brains.

50
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.600
I was trying to explain to the nine year old what, uh, the,

51
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.720
the development of the frontal lobe is. And I'm like, you know,

52
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.800
cause we were just talking about, I, I, I talk to my kids like they're kids,

53
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:13.520
but I also talk to 'em like they're adults. I do the same in that. I,

54
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.080
I lay things out and then I explain, so I lay things out.

55
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:18.360
Like I lay to an adult and then I,

56
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.830
your frontal lobe is a part of your brain that makes the decisions.

57
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:23.910
And it's not fully developed until you're 25 years old.

58
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.590
And so you see the little nine year old brain spinning and I go, it's not,

59
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.950
not really ready yet. She she's like, so it's like squishy brain.

60
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.350
I go exactly squishy brain nine year old vernacular. I like it.

61
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:35.630
So this is how she explained it to my wife.

62
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.990
And then her and I had this little conversation about squishy brain.

63
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.980
And I I'm like this. This is what the frontal little bit is. This is like,

64
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.140
when you see people that are young, that are doing stupid things,

65
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.860
it's not even necessarily that they're stupid. It's just,

66
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:50.820
they they're just acting. They just they're wild. You know, they're,

67
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.140
they're free. Their parents probably tell 'em what to do too much.

68
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.820
The school tells 'em what to do too much.

69
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:56.420
Their job tells 'em what to do too much.

70
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.100
And then they're out and they have a couple Miller highlights. They know,

71
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:01.330
and they're like, the COVID.

72
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.090
I don't give a by the way. Have you seen the coronavirus song yet? I,

73
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.570
you posted it. I saw it. You, you need to see it. I watch again.

74
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.650
Can you see it again? Jamie? Let let's we can't play it. No, no, no,

75
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.290
not that that's poppy guys taken down really think so. Definitely.

76
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.400
You need to respect other people's those intellectual properties, how it works.

77
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:22.360
Wouldn't help them. It's not how it works, but I mean,

78
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.160
is that on Spotify or even do they have a label? They definitely could.

79
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.240
I think they're comics. They could go on and take the video down. I don't know.

80
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.280
We're trying to help you guys. Sorry, go to my Instagram.

81
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.800
I was just gonna say that's probably, that's where I saw it. Yeah.

82
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.600
I might have watched it fiber. Yeah. 10 times if you want me to, but no,

83
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:41.870
that's okay. I don't you're right. I'm being an idiot, but the gentleman who,

84
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.270
uh, who made it, these guys, I, one,

85
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.630
one of 'em reached out to me and I up it's Reggie bay,

86
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.670
B B E E two. And then there's a Reggie bay,

87
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.750
B E E two underscore. That's a fake account. Those cus. And uh,

88
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.030
so I accidentally tagged the fake account at first. I was gonna say,

89
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:02.420
that's how mistakes happen, but now I got the real, well,

90
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:06.420
it's just some hoaxer who's pretended to be him. Yeah. Which one's fake.

91
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.100
The fake one is the one that has the underscore after the two. Oh, okay. Okay.

92
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.460
That was pieces of. How's your, uh, that's the real dude. Reggie bay be,

93
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.420
I mean, how's your wife think about what's going on? Um,

94
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.290
she's not concerned about us. She's concerned about her mom, you know,

95
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:26.650
which we should be. And I'm concerned about my parents as well. Yeah. Uh,

96
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.730
you know, and uh, more concerned that people are freaking out and that,

97
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.480
you know,

98
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.330
there's a lot of people around us that have never been tested and they're not

99
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:38.330
good under stress. And this is a,

100
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.520
this is a very unusual stress because there's no clear or answer not from the

101
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.880
president, not from the, the doctors. It's not,

102
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.880
no one has a real clear answer of how to fix this when it's gonna be fixed.

103
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.200
Yeah.

104
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.360
And when you hear things about like a vaccine will be available in 18 months,

105
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:59.000
you're like, what? Well, and if you continue reading that says,

106
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.760
if it is available in 18 months, that would be three times faster than normal.

107
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.320
Wow. Yeah.

108
00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:07.960
So that would be on the very front leading edge of what would be possible to get

109
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:11.400
into people's hands. Normal would be three X that and Oscar home,

110
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.840
the guy who was on the podcast that really sparked a lot of people to take this

111
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.150
very seriously. It in podcasts, by the way. Yeah, he's amazing.

112
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.910
And he said that they could have had a coronavirus vaccine that once SARS

113
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.030
happened SARS, which is also a coronavirus,

114
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.990
they could have worked on developing a coronavirus vaccine then,

115
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.510
and that we are far too flippant, uh, about how we approach these things.

116
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.590
And if it's not there right in our face,

117
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:38.060
they don't allocate resources is towards those kind of things.

118
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.340
I think our society is kind of defined by its excess and luxury. Yeah.

119
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.660
And when you live in that environment and I'm not saying it negatively at all,

120
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:50.220
but if you live in that environment, if you never leave that environment,

121
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:52.900
if you don't bend yourself before the world bends you a little bit,

122
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.180
gonna come off the rails when you get pressed. Yeah.

123
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.730
And that's where the B behavior of people scares me far more than the actual

124
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.810
virus itself. I, I mean, I have no control, uh,

125
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:07.290
over if I get the virus in how that plays itself out for me,

126
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:08.170
I cannot control that,

127
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.970
but I can control my behavior and how I act and try to exude calm,

128
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:15.730
like when it comes to my kids or my family, my friends and my social circle.

129
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.240
But yeah, I wish, uh,

130
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.520
I w I hope that people on the other side of this,

131
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.160
because it's not gonna be the end of the world, but I hope on the other side,

132
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:25.994
it gives them an,

133
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.360
a greater understanding and appreciation and perspective of what we have,

134
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.280
how lucky we are. And then just maybe to think about, you know, the people,

135
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.920
what's the obesity rate in the us right now, like 40, 40%. Yeah.

136
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.240
How about we work on that? Just to touch,

137
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:40.870
can considering that's one of the highest risk factors, right.

138
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.070
Instead of allowing that excess and, uh, you know,

139
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.310
luxury to define you. Yeah. How about, that's something you can control, right.

140
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.230
At all times. Yeah.

141
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.990
You can't control whether or not you have a disease or whether or not you're

142
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:55.670
old. Yeah. But you certainly can control whether or not you're fat.

143
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.780
The problem is people in, I experience spend a lot of time,

144
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.820
energy and effort focusing on things that they cannot control.

145
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.820
And that is definitely one thing that I learned from my old job is that at some

146
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:11.820
point you have to surrender the emotional and mental horsepower on the things

147
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:14.220
that you can't control and only focus on the things that you can,

148
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:15.540
which is specifically yourself.

149
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.700
Like I like you can't control what happens to you,

150
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:22.490
but you can control how you receive what happens to you and being scared,

151
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.810
allowing that to make the decision making process for you is what gets people in

152
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.570
substantial trouble. Like, I'll give you an example for my own job.

153
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.490
Getting shot at is not awesome. It's actually, it can be quite terrifying.

154
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.810
And the number one rule of a firefight,

155
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:41.120
if you get into a gun fight to win,

156
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.920
but the first thing you need to do is you need to shoot back with overwhelming

157
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.440
fire superiority, and then you have to maneuver, right?

158
00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:48.440
So you have to pin your enemy in place, and then you have to maneuver,

159
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.720
but let's say they, you get ambushed and you're on the receiving end of that.

160
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.600
And so you take a knee behind a wall and bullets are snapping over your head and

161
00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:59.000
you don't wanna move because you're scared and you think I'm gonna die.

162
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.240
So you have fear of death, which is totally real, and it can paralyze people.

163
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.320
And instead of moving, you sit there and other people maneuver around you,

164
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.560
that fear of death preventing you from doing the things that you had control

165
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.830
over, shooting back, maneuvering, coordinating with your team,

166
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.430
that fear paralyzes you and external circumstances,

167
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.470
or the enemy that you're fighting will maneuver around you.

168
00:09:20.471 --> 00:09:21.630
And then they're gonna end up killing you.

169
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:24.830
But the reason you didn't move is you allowed that emotion to take over your

170
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.550
decision making process. You have to detach the two Joah talks about it a lot,

171
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.510
and it's just reinforced constantly. And in training and in, uh,

172
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.380
operations overseas. And that'd be that's cuz people ask me like,

173
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:36.901
what should I do?

174
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.300
And my biggest thing is just try to remain as objective as possible.

175
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.740
You see people freaking out that doesn't mean that you need to freak out. And,

176
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.180
uh, you know, another way I've had it described to me that made a,

177
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.580
a big influence on me and the way I think about things,

178
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.260
if you think about two circles, like an archery target,

179
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:55.300
but there's only two circles, there's a, the bowl, the 10 ring,

180
00:09:55.301 --> 00:09:59.530
which is super small. And then God duly, where are you when I need you?

181
00:09:59.531 --> 00:10:03.450
What's the big ring on the outside? Yeah, like a five, uh,

182
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.970
I guess it goes 10, 9, 8 out, whatever the lowest scoring ring is,

183
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:08.810
that would be the other one.

184
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:12.850
So you got two circles and the big circle is your circle of concern.

185
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.380
And the small circle is your circle of influence. I see.

186
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:22.500
And the dangerous thing that I see often is people spending all their time with

187
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:27.380
their energy and effort on the circle of concern what's going on in the

188
00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:30.500
stock market. What's going on on Fox news. What's going on on CNN,

189
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.300
sharing back and forth things on Facebook that are probably half of 'em aren't

190
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:37.690
even true. Anyway, no research put into it. Um,

191
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.010
is there gonna be enough toilet paper? What do I do about this?

192
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:42.570
And they don't have control over any of those things,

193
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.410
but that's the stuff that they're worried about. Yeah.

194
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.450
And the only thing that you should spend your time,

195
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.890
energy and effort working on are the things directly inside of your circle of

196
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:52.210
influence. And even inside of that one, there could be the circle of control.

197
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.530
And what do you have control over at all times?

198
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.730
The things that come outta your mouth, how you,

199
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.120
whether or not you allow your emotions to override your decision making process,

200
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.320
uh, the way that you communicate,

201
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:08.240
whether or not you decide to work out as opposed to shoving 4,000 excess

202
00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:10.440
calories in your face every single day,

203
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.240
if you focus on those things and put your time, energy and effort in there,

204
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.760
you're gonna get through stressful situations, just fine,

205
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.630
because you actually have more mental capacity because you're

206
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:23.590
trimming off of the things that you can't control. Mm.

207
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.630
The thing about things that you can't control, those, some people are they're,

208
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:31.910
they're thinking that this is one of those things that if you were a paranoid

209
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:34.270
person and you prepped and worried about the future,

210
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.380
you would've already stockpiled enough food and toilet paid and ammo and all

211
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:41.660
these different things so that you were ready for this.

212
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.340
Whereas people that were just concentrating on day to day life didn't act,

213
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.540
didn't think it's probably got caught probably a balance between, I mean, I,

214
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.380
is it reasonable for everybody to have five years of food at their house?
