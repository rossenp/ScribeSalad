00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And it worries me a great deal where we've,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.630
we've changed. We've changed a few definitions,

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:07.980
like what it means to be a victim.

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.440
I think we've changed that definition overwhelmingly,

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.330
and we've changed the definition of justice also and an injustice and what an

6
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:17.940
injustice actually is. We've forgotten how to,

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.770
we've forgotten how to distinguish between discrimination and disparities.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.570
Like just because you don't have the same thing,

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
does that effectively mean there was a, some injustice that occurred there.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.140
We're not asking those analytical questions. And I think that's a real problem.

11
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:36.960
And it's, it's made debate very difficult. It's,

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.570
it's made debate with my colleagues in the democratic party,

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.560
very difficult because every disparity is assumed to be

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.680
originating from some kind of injustice. You know,

15
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.750
every time somebody is welder than somebody else,

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.020
the assumption nowadays is that well it's ill-gotten money.

17
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.650
And that there is some kind of injustice that occurred. You know, when we were,

18
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:58.260
when we were voting on this giant stimulus package,

19
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.630
not really a stimulus package, more of a rescue package,

20
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.260
remember how this happened. There was, you know,

21
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960
we were negotiating through this thing. It was actually looking pretty good.

22
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:11.010
Nancy Pelosi comes in, says, hell no, blown up the whole thing. And, uh,

23
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.700
we're going to protect workers and, you know, not these corporations.

24
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.060
Okay. So, you know, you fast forward a few days,

25
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.750
he ended up passing basically the same bill. Anyway. Um, that's a long story.

26
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:24.510
I'm happy to go into the details of that politically, if you'd like me to,

27
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.130
but the point is this, there was this outrage from the populous, right?

28
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.020
And the populous left against anything that had the name corporation attached to

29
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:37.470
it. And we've forgotten how to ask ourselves. Why is that?

30
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.810
W w did they do something evil?

31
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.570
What exactly is evil about these entities? You know, they,

32
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.960
they employ lots of people to create lots of wealth.

33
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.210
And in this particular case, they're not being bailed out.

34
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
They didn't do anything wrong, but we're really mad at them. For some reason,

35
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:54.930
we really hate them because there's this sort of cultural movement towards,

36
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.450
towards feeling that anytime something is successful,

37
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.990
like our reaction should be to punish it. And I, that,

38
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.190
that cultural movement worries me a great deal.

39
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.390
It worries me a great deal.

40
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.360
I think that's what leads to these sort of topics of socialism.

41
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.841
<v 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:14.790
I think that that is one of the bad aspects of the ideals of socialism

43
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.800
is this inclination to think that when there is an inequality that then

44
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:24.150
inequality is because of either corrupt corruption or greed,

45
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.520
there's also inequality of effort. People do not put in the same effort.

46
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.820
And when you put in more effort, you're more focused, you're more disciplined.

47
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.340
You do more work, you should be rewarded.

48
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.320
And there's people that don't like that idea.

49
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.800
And they don't like that idea because they're lazy and they're weak.

50
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.540
And that's a fact, and there's people in this world that are weak. And there's,

51
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.580
it's, it's an unpopular thing to say, because we want to say that, no, they're,

52
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.410
they're economically disenfranchised. And some people are, yes,

53
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.303
some people are.

54
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.300
And there's also some people that work like a and those people get by

55
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.130
and they get ahead. And those people should be rewarded for their effort.

56
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.320
One of the problems that I have with people that espouse socialist ideals is

57
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:16.180
that they don't want this competition aspect of our culture and our

58
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.710
society to exist. Where you put in more work, you get more reward.

59
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.270
That's my whole life. That is my whole life. I mean,

60
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.960
every everything that I've ever done, I realized, oh,

61
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.650
all you have to do is work harder than everybody else.

62
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.010
All you have to do is put in more time. All you have to do is be more obsessed,

63
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:39.760
more focused, and you can get by. You can get ahead. Well,

64
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.630
the people that don't like that, or the people that don't like competition,

65
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.260
they don't understand it. It makes you feel bad when you lose.

66
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.860
Everyone should get a trophy. Everyone should get a participation trophy.

67
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.110
That is a giant problem with our culture and this

68
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.430
inequality. Yeah. There is income inequality.

69
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.700
Some of it is corruption. Some of it is bad.

70
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.680
Some of it is inequality of effort and that needs to be addressed as well.

71
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.450
And it's not like you can have this blanket thing that all the people that run

72
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:17.290
corporations are greedy and all the money that they have

73
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.540
acquired is because of ill gotten gains. It's just not true. It's not true.

74
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.310
And it's, it's anti-American frankly.

75
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.610
<v 0>Yeah. I, I list a few, um,</v>

76
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.590
tenants of a culture that make it a sustainable successful culture.

77
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.920
The first one is personal responsibility. One of the detail on that,

78
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.020
the second one is mental toughness, which I wrote a whole book about. So,

79
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.760
and it's important for the, you, you,

80
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.970
you said it exactly how I describe it when I give speeches on this,

81
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.210
which is we need mental toughness because otherwise,

82
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:52.000
how do we survive in a free society where we have to compete?

83
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.720
Because the only alternative to a bunch of mentally weak people is that we do

84
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:58.870
live in a society where competition is not necessary because the government will

85
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:02.770
just give you everything. But I don't want to live in that society. And frankly,

86
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:05.710
that society can't function very well because nobody would actually do anything.

87
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.470
And you have to be mentally tough to deal with that.

88
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.720
And I think the American spirit and the America,

89
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.800
our history as a culture is a really,

90
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:18.580
really tough bunch of people. And I just want to remind people of that.

91
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.550
And I want to remind people that it's something to aspire to. Like,

92
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.400
this is a good thing. Like, it's cool to be tougher.

93
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.160
It's not cool to be a victim. Right, right. But we have so many, like,

94
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.700
postmodernists who actually, again, it's going back to this victimhood culture.

95
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.300
They want you to be that victim and then they'll celebrate you for it.

96
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.970
When people tell their victim stories, they're cheered, but it's like,

97
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.160
wait a second. Where's the, where's the part where you overcame it.

98
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.890
I thought that was the story we were supposed to cheer.

99
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.360
<v 1>Well, they also connect, they also connect competition with cruelty.</v>

100
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.830
And I think that's, that's foolish as well. Yeah. It feels bad to lose,

101
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.220
but that's just because it feels great to win. There's, it's a,

102
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.560
it's a peak in a valley thing. And you have to understand that and look,

103
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.230
every competition that I've ever had, any,

104
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:04.610
anything where I've ever competed in and lost, it has fueled me beyond measure.

105
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.870
It is what gets you buy it's what makes you better? I mean,

106
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.800
one of the reasons why I understand this is because of martial arts in martial

107
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:17.240
arts, you have to train with the best people you can. And it's, it sucks.

108
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.510
You get your kicked. It's part of the, but that's what makes you better.

109
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.170
You need those people. You love those people. They become your brothers.

110
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.490
It's very, very, very important. The bonds that are formed in jujitsu,

111
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.600
gyms and kickboxing gyms and martial arts gyms with the people that you train,

112
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:37.220
the men and women that you train with there's is an intensity to those bonds.

113
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.910
That's almost indescribable to anybody that hasn't experienced it. I mean,

114
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.660
I'm sure it's not as tight as people that have gone through combat together,

115
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.820
but there's something, there's something in those people. They, they fuel you.

116
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.730
They help you. And they help you by trying to kick your.

117
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.250
They help you by trying to be better than you.

118
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.860
They help you by trying to be the man. They,

119
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.300
they want to be the best they can be. And you think about those.

120
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.860
When you go to the gym, you go, God it. Mike is here. And you,

121
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:09.950
you get fired up for that person that you know is going to kick your.

122
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.900
And they provide you with fuel people that are better than you provide you with

123
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:19.520
fuel competition provides you with fuel. It doesn't mean you have to be mean.

124
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.520
It doesn't mean it's cruel. It doesn't mean it's insensitive.

125
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:26.300
It doesn't mean it doesn't mean that. It just means that competition is good.

126
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.150
Competition is good for you. It's good.

127
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:31.820
It shows you your better abilities.

128
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.450
It shows you that you can aspire to greatness.

129
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.610
You can aspire to be better than you are.

130
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.300
You can do this and you can do this by looking at people who also do it.

131
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.300
They are, your fuel. Inspiration is fuel.

132
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.880
Nobody gets inspired by Jessie Smollett putting a fake news around his neck and

133
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.670
walking into a hotel, still holding a subway sandwich.

134
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.440
Nobody's inspired by that. Maybe you're inspired to never be that guy and that,

135
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:00.590
but it's a weak inspiration. You're inspired by greatness.

136
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:02.870
You're inspired by great people stories, great.

137
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:07.250
People's autobiographies and documentaries and stories of them putting in that

138
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.030
work. And I mean, that's why there's so many people that, you know, their,

139
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:14.540
their Instagram existence is essentially just all they're doing is just

140
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.670
providing inspiration to people like David Goggins, that guy every day.

141
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.230
I mean that guy's fueling millions of people just by being a,

142
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.930
bad-ass just doing just life is hard,

143
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.030
stay hard and just getting out and running every day, just by doing that.

144
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.200
<v 0>I need to, I don't know him. Who is,</v>

145
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.280
who is filming these videos and like his wife, she runs the.

146
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.903
<v 1>Or something.</v>

147
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.980
<v 0>She's in a car,</v>

148
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.280
but there's been other instances where he's like climbing a mountain.

149
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.330
I don't know. It's a very, it's a very smooth, like maybe she has a stabilizer,

150
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.070
I guess There's, there's been some instances where I'm like,

151
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.980
okay, this seems like a car, but this seems impossible to film.

152
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.250
And without like some, some better equipment than just like a selfie video.

153
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:02.820
Yeah.

154
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.140
<v 1>Well, he's got a lot of money. I mean, he sold the out of that book. Um,</v>

155
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.120
so it's a fantastic book and I can't recommend it enough and you can't hurt me.

156
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.930
It's called. And the audio version is even better because the audio version,

157
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:17.250
he actually gets somebody else to read it.

158
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.330
But then he comes in between and discusses each and every chapter.

159
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.290
So it's like the audio book and a podcast together. You know, he,

160
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.750
he lives an incredible life and he's,

161
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.040
that guy is an amazing source of fuel for people.

162
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.990
But it's an amazing source of fuel because of his own competition with himself.

163
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.910
And he's a guy that's talked really openly about being weak at certain points in

164
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:46.680
his life and being fat and lazy. And that he got through that. He's not,

165
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:50.190
he hasn't, he wasn't born this warrior that came out of the womb,

166
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.740
running a hundred miles. He became that person.

167
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.180
And it became that person from being a slob. And he's real open about it.

168
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.480
And he's, he's even open about his own weakness currently. He's like,

169
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:03.990
sometimes I'll stare at my shoes for a half hour before I run my.

170
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.620
I don't want to do this, but then it'll go out and do it.

171
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.460
And while he's doing it, he'll yell, you know, like that,

172
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.690
people like that or fuel. And there's certain people that don't like,

173
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:17.670
people like that. Cause they make them feel bad.

174
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:20.970
They look at themselves and they go, God it. I don't work. As hard as that guy.

175
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.340
I don't have that kind of mental toughness. And then,

176
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:25.920
then they'll try to find something wrong with it. But it's,

177
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:27.480
it's because they're,

178
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.590
they're not willing to look at themselves objectively.

179
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.890
They're not willing to try to be the best person that they can be.
