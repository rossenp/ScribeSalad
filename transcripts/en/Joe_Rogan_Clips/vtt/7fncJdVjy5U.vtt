00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>So you and your dad, uh, bolt on this wacky diet,</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.860
you're both on this wacky carnivore diet.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.390
And this is probably one of the most controversial things, uh,

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:16.950
in relationship to, in relation to food today.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.610
Um, when, when people discuss diets, you know,

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:25.350
there's a lot of people that are vegetarian or vegan or try and to genic diets

7
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:29.040
or paleo. But when you say carnivore,

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.810
that is one of the ones where people just universally seem to like,

9
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.850
step back, roll their eyes.

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.020
Most people don't think it's a good idea.

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.420
They don't even know why they don't think it's a good idea.

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
And then you tell them about people like you or my

13
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:51.690
friend, Chris bell, who has similar auto-immune issues.

14
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.540
And he's had hip to hip replacements. He's only 36.

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.740
And I think he had both of them done by the time he was 30. Right.

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm pretty sure. Cause he's had them for quite a few years, um, you know,

17
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.210
massive joint pain, all sorts of issue. And you, when did you,

18
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:10.830
you got a hip replacement, how old were you?

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.350
<v 1>17 And an ankle replacement. 17 is a rough year.</v>

20
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.190
<v 0>That is crazy. Um, what you,</v>

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.100
so your whole life you've had arthritis issues or.

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.210
<v 1>Yeah. Um, so I started walking kind of funny when I was two,</v>

23
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.970
according to my mom and she brought me to the doctor and they said,

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.970
she's just having growing pains or something. When I was seven,

25
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:33.590
I was diagnosed with juvenile,

26
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.980
rheumatoid arthritis and I had like 37 joints affected.

27
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.100
And then I was put on immune suppressants in grade four.

28
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:42.680
So I was actually the first kid in Canada to be put on,

29
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:44.660
not this biologic called Ambrol.

30
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.940
So I was on Enbrel and methotrexate for ever like leading up to the hip and

31
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:53.090
ankle replacement and they did help reduce some of the pain,

32
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.620
but I still ended up with no cartilage in my joint and hip my hip and ankle, um,

33
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.550
when I was 17.

34
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.130
<v 0>And this is just from the effects of arthritis and the inflammation and</v>

35
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.290
swelling and just chewed the cartilage up.

36
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.110
<v 1>So I wasn't even particularly swollen. I didn't have a very like inflammatory,</v>

37
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.180
visually inflammatory arthritis.

38
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.400
So my rheumatologist who'd been at sick kids for 20 years,

39
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.410
said that I had the worst arthritis she'd ever seen. So it was very severe.

40
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.880
It wasn't particularly like swollen. My joints just disintegrated.

41
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.333
<v 2>Wow.</v>

42
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.530
<v 0>What do they think causes something like this?</v>

43
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.800
<v 2>They didn't know. So it was eventually.</v>

44
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.330
<v 1>After the hip and ankle replacement,</v>

45
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:41.570
the diagnosis was changed to juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

46
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:45.410
So it was literally like, we don't know. Wow.

47
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.440
And w how.

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.060
<v 0>Did you go from these medications,</v>

49
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.440
pharmaceutical medications to getting into this carnivore diet thing?

50
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.490
What was this this well, okay.

51
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 1>I'll give you a background of the path. Um,</v>

52
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.020
we we're very like science oriented, especially dad.

53
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.550
So even though mom kind of wanted to delve into diet and was like,

54
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:15.330
we should go sugar-free or stop eating, you know, whatever,

55
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:19.770
make sure you'd whole grains, like all that stuff. We never gave diet,

56
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.610
uh, a chance because there was no scientific evidence for it.

57
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.560
So I basically got sicker and sicker and sicker,

58
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:32.730
and I ended up by the time I got to university, I ended up with arthritis.

59
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.600
I was severely depressed. I was on antidepressants as well. Um,

60
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.190
I had idiopathic hypersomnia, so I was sleeping about 18 hours a day.

61
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.650
My whole body was itchy all the time. That started when I was about 14. Um,

62
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.050
and so that was when I started university.

63
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.070
And then my diet just got disastrous in university.

64
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:56.910
And I was like drinking all the time and eating like pizza and beer.

65
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.980
And I gained like 30 pounds in the first year. And ginger ale,

66
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:06.180
a lot of ginger ale. Anyway, I gained about 30 pounds in the first year.

67
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:11.130
My mental health declined even further and I didn't really know what was

68
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:15.030
going on. And then I started getting skin issues. So I started getting rashes,

69
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.400
cystic acne. And I was like, okay,

70
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:20.640
I can deal with like four really awful health problems,

71
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:24.150
but I can't deal with things affecting my skin. On top of that,

72
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.170
there's too many things.

73
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.570
I went to dermatologists and they basically told me I was anxious and

74
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.030
like causing these rashes by itching.

75
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.730
So that was the dermatologist's opinion, which was very unhelpful. Anyway,

76
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:43.380
I spent a lot of time. I was eventually prescribed Adderall for the hypersomnia.

77
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.340
So I spent all my time Googling, reading papers,

78
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.380
trying to get a background on skin disorders. And eventually I came across this,

79
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.490
uh, celiac disease rash online. And that's what I had.

80
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.060
It looked exactly the same, same. So I cut out gluten.

81
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.660
I read a whole bunch about like the effects of gluten on the gut and thought,

82
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.390
oh, there's actually some evidence that gluten isn't good for people.

83
00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:08.070
Why aren't people being told this? Like,

84
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:10.440
why didn't my doctor test me for celiac disease?

85
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.770
Because celiac disease couples with auto-immune disorders all the time,

86
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.760
like they test type one kids for celiac disease.

87
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.030
But for some reason they don't test kids with arthritis for celiac disease.

88
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.530
So I cut out gluten and that kind of helped maybe like 20%,

89
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:27.570
but it was hard to tell because it was the summer. I was like,

90
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:31.080
maybe I'm just feeling better from the summer. My rash kinda went down,

91
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:35.280
but it was still there. And then, so September, 2015,

92
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.390
uh,

93
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.260
my mom dragged me to a natural path and they gave me the sheet of foods and like

94
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:41.460
try this elimination diet.

95
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.010
And I looked at the sheet and thought this doesn't make any sense.

96
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.220
Like why can I eat lemons and not oranges? And why are almonds on there?

97
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:50.580
But other nuts are off. So I cut. So I thought, okay,

98
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:54.630
if I'm going to do an elimination diet, which I didn't believe in at all, um,

99
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.640
I'll cut down to what I considered safe. And I had no idea what I was doing.

100
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.010
So I just thought, okay, vegetables are pretty safe.

101
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.310
I'll get rid of night shades because people talk about them being bad

102
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.950
night, shades like tomatoes, eggplant, those kinds of foods.

103
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.820
For some reason there, I just knew that they were referred to as night shades.

104
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.530
I feel like literally everybody has heard them referred to as nightshades.

105
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.710
Have you heard him? I've.

106
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.530
<v 3>Heard the term, but not, I couldn't tell you what it was.</v>

107
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.480
I wouldn't have been able to say it with tomatoes and eggplants.

108
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.770
<v 0>And I'll think, Hmm. Maybe it's just cannabis. I don't.</v>

109
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.360
<v 1>Think so. No. Okay. Sorry. Tim comments decide and.</v>

110
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.610
<v 0>Don't let them decide. Okay.</v>

111
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.730
It's like calling demons for help. Anyway, go ahead.

112
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.950
<v 1>Um, anyway, I cut down. So I was eating mostly like green vegetables.</v>

113
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:51.520
I was still eating rice at that point because I thought everybody eats rice.

114
00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:55.240
Rice is safe, uh, and meat, but I cut out like dairy,

115
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.400
most grains, soy, uh, sugar processed foods.

116
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.530
And then in the next month my joints got way

117
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:10.330
better. And my skin healed and my skin never healed. Like for a couple of years,

118
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.000
I'd have, I'd always have these flare ups. It never went away.

119
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.250
And that was just on a, like relatively low carb diet. Just like just less.

120
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.380
I dunno, I was still eating rice. Right.

121
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.820
But it was still mostly meat and vegetables. And I thought, okay,

122
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:29.110
maybe there's something to this. And then I made almond flour.

123
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.640
Gluten-free sugar-free dairy-free almond flour, banana muffins,

124
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.630
and ate a bunch of those one night. And I woke up in the next day,

125
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:41.710
my wrists were sore and I thought, okay,

126
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.850
maybe that's weird.

127
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.290
And then I had a bunch more than muffins because the muffins were good. And,

128
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.750
and then I went away to a cottage that weekend and I couldn't walk because of my

129
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:55.570
knees. And I never had flare ups that badly.

130
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.050
I used to get my shoulder was always sore when I slept.

131
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.740
So I took Tylenol three at night for sleeping and my wrists were stiff,

132
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.010
but I never had like a flare up. Like I couldn't walk. Um,

133
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.750
so that was that weekend.

134
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:12.550
So then I went back to the diet and got really strict with it.

135
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.710
And then things were better. Like my skin was better. I,

136
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.970
I lost, this was weird. I lost five pounds, which wasn't a lot,

137
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:23.770
but I went down three pants sizes.

138
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.190
So it was all bloating that I didn't realize was bloating.

139
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.550
Cause it never fluctuated. So that was the first month.

140
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.530
And then 2015.

141
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.700
And I started trying to reintroduce foods because I was having cravings and I

142
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:39.550
missed going out to eat with my friends and everything.

143
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.710
So I tried to read the first thing I try to reintroduce was sour patch

144
00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:49.240
candy, because I was having really intense sugar. Don't look at me like that.

145
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.170
I was having really intense sugar cravings and I looked at the packet and I

146
00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:57.570
thought, okay, no, one's allergic to sugar. Um, there's no dairy,

147
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.210
there's no gluten, there's no soy. This'll be fine.

148
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.830
And I really wanted to eat them.

149
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.230
And I had those and the next day my whole body was itchy again.

150
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.570
And it was like, like mosquito bites, everywhere, itchy. So I thought, okay,

151
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.580
maybe, maybe that was a bad idea.

152
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.400
So I waited a couple of weeks and I tried to reintroduce almond butter,

153
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.840
organic almond butter, because I wanted something fast, protein fast.

154
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.730
And then I had, um, psych abdominal cramping,

155
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.750
diarrhea. Then this itch came back. Yeah.

156
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.700
So for the next year, um, well I'll slow down.

157
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.910
We've got some time. So that was, that was the almond butter.

158
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:42.210
So then I waited a while and I felt pretty good. And this was November, 2015.

159
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.520
And then I started feeling really good.

160
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.290
And I went off of my antidepressants and I had been taking antidepressants since

161
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:54.150
I was in grade five, a really high dose of, um, an SSRI,

162
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.890
which had been very helpful. But did you wean.

163
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.560
<v 0>Yourself off and did you do it under a doctor's supervision?</v>

164
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.240
<v 1>No, I didn't. You didn't leave me, right. I, I weaned myself down,</v>

165
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.630
so I went down to half and then I went to a quarter and then I went to an eighth

166
00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:13.340
and then I stopped taking it two weeks. It was nothing really. It was two weeks.

167
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:15.410
Yeah. I didn't have withdrawal symptoms.

168
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.830
Like I think maybe I was lucky that way.

169
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.260
<v 0>And so your dad at this point was, um.</v>

170
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.530
<v 1>So at that point I was eating rice occasionally,</v>

171
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:29.360
but it was mostly like broccoli salad, chicken, beef,

172
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:33.380
fish, you know, all of oil, apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper.

173
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.070
Um, at that point I was also eating pears and apples.

174
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.560
So it was kind of like paleo kind of very restricted

175
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:44.600
paleo dairy-free. And.

176
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.710
<v 0>So you're feeling good. You're off your medication. Your joints feel better.</v>

177
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.820
No more rashes.

178
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.430
<v 1>No mirages yet. So everything seems to be improving.</v>

179
00:10:52.431 --> 00:10:54.230
I was shocked when the depression lifted,

180
00:10:54.231 --> 00:10:57.140
because I thought that runs in my family. That's familial.

181
00:10:57.141 --> 00:11:01.760
We have some sort of brain chemistry problem that, that can't possibly be diet.

182
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.630
I thought I thought the skin, maybe that was diet cause of this gluten link.

183
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.250
And then maybe because of the celiac gene that I got tested for,

184
00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:11.660
maybe the arthritis was part of that,

185
00:11:11.661 --> 00:11:13.910
but I never thought mood was associated with it.

186
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.180
So that was a surprise in November. Anyway,

187
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.050
I went off of the antidepressants and then about a month later,

188
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.850
I tried to reintroduce soy.

189
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.330
And this is when things started getting really weird that year.

190
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.570
So I was having why.

191
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.150
<v 0>You re re-introducing things. If you're having all these positive benefits.</v>

192
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.720
<v 1>I was having cravings like crazy and I would miss eating out.</v>

193
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:39.770
And I thought there were probably like four or five foods I was really sensitive

194
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:41.960
to. And I, if I could just figure out what they were,

195
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:45.290
I could eat pretty normally I didn't realize, like,

196
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:47.330
I didn't know what was going on. Okay.

197
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.640
If I had known I would have done it much differently. Right.

198
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.590
But I tried to reintroduce soy because at that point I still thought was a

199
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:55.480
health food. Um,

200
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.180
so I ate a huge meal of like at a Mami beans and

201
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.080
beansprouts and miso soup that I made myself.

202
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:07.480
So it was gluten-free and soy sauce and tofu.

203
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.040
I literally ate soy in every forum.

204
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.690
And I had the same kind of reaction with almond butter.

205
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.580
I had immediately got bloated.

206
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.140
I had diarrhea like within maybe 20, 30 minutes of eating it.

207
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.410
And I thought, okay, that sucks. I guess I can't eat soy.

208
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.930
And then about four hours later,

209
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.700
my other legs got itchy and then my whole body got itchy and I was like, okay,

210
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.830
that sucks. I'm clearly I'm reacting to soy.

211
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.810
And then the next morning the depression came back and it came back.

212
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:42.250
Like that was the worst depressive experience I've ever had.

213
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.091
Um,

214
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.680
I was medication free and it came back in the morning and I got in the shower

215
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:50.620
and I just like, I balled in the shower and thought,

216
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:54.610
how could I be so naive to think that my horrible auto-immune disorder and the

217
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.400
depression and everything was caused by food?

218
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.460
Like what an idiotic thing to think, how could I be that hopeful?

219
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.900
And then I had to remind myself, okay, no, you ate a whole bunch of this food.

220
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.590
Then you had this like digestive distress, then you got itchy.

221
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.650
And now the depression is back. There's clearly a pattern here,

222
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.400
but it was hard to think like that when I got that depressed.

223
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.400
So that day was like, I spent a lot of that day crying.

224
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.230
Then the next day got worse and this is,

225
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:25.780
this is when it gets weird. Um,

226
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.660
so that night I went over to my parents and I was just like,

227
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.890
I don't know what's going on. Right. Um, and they're like, well,

228
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:34.630
do you want to take a car back to your apartment? And I said,

229
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:38.020
I don't think I can drive. Like I can't, I just can't think,

230
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.170
I don't know what's going on. So my brother, um,

231
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.300
drove me home and I was like on the verge of having a

232
00:13:46.301 --> 00:13:49.420
panic attack for no reason writers, just like my heart rate was increasing.

233
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:50.350
I was trying to find my keys.

234
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:55.090
And I turned around to look at my brother in the car. And

235
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:01.270
his head was a, like a, kind of a demon.

236
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.280
This, I know how this sounds,

237
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.970
but he had like a demon head for about a second and a half.

238
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.900
And he looked at me and then he turned and then it was my brother again,

239
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:16.590
standing up hallucinating for like a, yeah, about a second and a half nations.

240
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.090
Um, that year. Yes. Before that? No, that year, yeah.

241
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.370
After this I'll get.

242
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.380
<v 0>Into it and started tripping.</v>

243
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.030
<v 1>Yeah. Two days later. I know how it sounds.</v>

244
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.700
That's how it sounded to me too found.

245
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.500
<v 0>Comparable stories. So, and so.</v>

246
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.920
<v 1>Honestly I did as much research as I could possibly do, um, to soy, no,</v>

247
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:45.120
to gluten, to people who are schizophrenia sick from gluten. Yeah.

248
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.860
There are people with celiac disease who have schizophrenia induced by

249
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.650
gluten. So I found that, but I didn't find anything for other foods,

250
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.493
but let's.

251
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.570
<v 0>Get to schizophrenia, include hallucinations.</v>

252
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.850
<v 1>Uh, rarely visual.</v>

253
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.800
But I did find a case study of a woman who was seeing demons from her celiac

254
00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:06.760
disease. Gluten.

255
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.301
<v 0>Now,</v>

256
00:15:07.301 --> 00:15:10.750
when you say you looked over and you saw your brother and his head was a demon

257
00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:15.430
head, like describe it. Like, no.

258
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.100
<v 4>I found, no. It.</v>

259
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.360
<v 1>Was like, you know,</v>

260
00:15:19.361 --> 00:15:23.830
when it's really dark in a room and I don't know if you've experienced this,

261
00:15:23.831 --> 00:15:25.060
but it's really dark in the room.

262
00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:27.400
And then you can kind of see things in the dark.

263
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:33.610
It was more like that it was dark at night and it was like, I was so anxious.

264
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.530
<v 0>So distraught, you're a mess. And maybe you just caused yourself to.</v>

265
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.480
<v 4>This idea. Okay.</v>

266
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.480
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I saw it, like, I can remember what it looks like,</v>

267
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.980
but it wasn't a vivid demon or something. It was like, but it was there. Okay.

268
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:50.590
So you're freaking out I'm so I'm freaking out. So I'm like, okay,

269
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.970
that's not good. Right.

270
00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:55.300
So I find my keys and I go upstairs and then I went into my bedroom and like

271
00:15:55.301 --> 00:15:56.260
shut the blinds,

272
00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.190
turned on all the lights and then like smoked as much weed as I could possibly

273
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:04.600
smoke to try and calm myself down and then hit under the blankets all night.

274
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.000
I would think that'd be the worst thing to do after you see a demon.

275
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.570
But then if you smoke, I've had that comment before,

276
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.430
but enough and it calmed me down. Okay.

277
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.770
So then I spent the next couple of weeks basically stoned because

278
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.890
I didn't know when it was going to end. I didn't know what was going on.

279
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.660
And I couldn't find anybody on the internet who had,

280
00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:26.920
had the same experience as me.

281
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.230
And then about two and a half weeks later, it started going away.

282
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.960
And so when you say it, you mean the depression, depression, D arthritis.

283
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.280
It wasn't that just the depression that came up. That's just the worst. No,

284
00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:45.040
I didn't go back. I mean, I didn't eat soy again,

285
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.050
but I went back to the initial diet. I was eating.

286
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.930
<v 0>Essentially just this one meal,</v>

287
00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:53.380
this one great meal of soy threw you off for a couple of weeks.

288
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.770
<v 1>Yeah. Like almost for like three weeks,</v>

289
00:16:56.771 --> 00:17:01.360
but after two weeks it started getting better. Um, but the symptoms were like,

290
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.880
so this deplorable, the itching started.

291
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.050
I had bloating and then the depression came back and then about a week later,

292
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:13.000
my skin started breaking out and then maybe 10 days

293
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.410
later, my arthritis came back.

294
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.360
So I wrote all my symptoms down every day because I was going crazy and I didn't

295
00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:24.310
know what was going on. And I wanted to write it down to see what was going on.

296
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:28.030
Okay. So then it started lifting and I started feeling better again.

297
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.120
And I was like, okay, thank God. That's over.

298
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.780
And then waited a while. Things were good. Again,

299
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.110
my symptoms went away and then over the next year,

300
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.990
I tried to reintroduce foods over and over and over again.

301
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.400
And I was making like,

302
00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:46.240
I tried whey protein powder and that did net,

303
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.940
nothing ever got to as bad as that soy experience.

304
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.830
But I had a number of other experiences where it was the worst depression I've

305
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:53.581
ever experienced.

306
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:58.470
And it was on the verge of seeing, like,

307
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.420
I don't know, seeing faces in things. Okay.

308
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.600
<v 0>So you're having all these health issues. How do you get to the carnivore diet?</v>

309
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.860
<v 1>So I decide about a year later, I decide, Hey,</v>

310
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.580
maybe I don't want to keep cycling in and out of a horrible autoimmune mental

311
00:18:13.581 --> 00:18:15.740
problems, maybe we'll just stick with the original diet.

312
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.533
And then I got pregnant.

313
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.480
And so then my auto-immune symptoms flared again during the

314
00:18:23.481 --> 00:18:27.050
pregnancy. Yeah. Like right away. As soon as I found out I was pregnant,

315
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.030
it was like before I found out I was pregnant,

316
00:18:29.031 --> 00:18:33.110
that my autoimmune symptoms came back. So my legs were at G again, I was,

317
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.840
my joints were staffed. My skin was breaking out.

318
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.570
My anxiety was back and it was hard to tell, well,

319
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.720
what part of this is pregnancy? And what part of this is an autoimmune disorder?

320
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.300
Um, so throughout my pregnancy, I cut down on all the carbs I was eating.

321
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.540
So I cut out fruit, I cut out sweet potatoes.

322
00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:53.780
I went down to meat and greens and I think dad was on here one time.

323
00:18:53.781 --> 00:18:56.450
And he was on a meat and greens diet. So that was during that part.

324
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.010
So we're both on a meat and grains diet,

325
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.900
mostly because we didn't realize you didn't need greens to survive.

326
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.460
So we were eating meat and greens. And then.

327
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.600
<v 0>I would just say mostly because we realized you didn't need greens to survive.</v>

328
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.600
<v 1>We didn't realize ma only was an option.</v>

329
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.640
<v 2>Yeah. We hadn't.</v>

330
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.920
<v 1>Realized that we didn't know that.</v>

331
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.770
So it was meat and salad and it was a very simple salad with like olive oil,

332
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.300
apple, cider vinegar, salt, pepper, cucumbers, lettuces, spinach,

333
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.300
pretty simple salad, and then.

334
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.640
<v 2>Meat and fish. So.</v>

335
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.590
<v 1>We did that for about a year and then I had my daughter and then</v>

336
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:38.930
I didn't get better. So then I found out, okay,

337
00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:42.290
so these symptoms aren't really pregnancy related. It's just me now from,

338
00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:44.450
for some reason I've lost the tolerance to these foods.

339
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:49.130
I used to be able to eat and in eating salad and

340
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:52.610
meat. Yeah. And I'm still having autoimmune symptoms now.

341
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.630
<v 0>As symptoms that you used to have when you were eating everything nearly.</v>

342
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.780
<v 1>As bad, not nearly as bad. Like my fatigue wasn't back,</v>

343
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.650
my anxiety was manageable without medication. Um.

344
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.840
<v 0>You hadn't achieved the levels of health that you had when you were eliminating</v>

345
00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:10.040
things from your diet earlier.

346
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.930
<v 1>Yeah, exactly, exactly.</v>

347
00:20:11.931 --> 00:20:15.620
Like I reached a really good point and then I got pregnant and I couldn't reach

348
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:20.390
that point again. So then this is 2017,

349
00:20:20.391 --> 00:20:24.320
so it's like November and I'm getting really frustrated about being itchy.

350
00:20:24.321 --> 00:20:28.520
I'm just randomly itchy again and randomly arthritic eating meat and vegetables

351
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.610
mean salad. Yeah. And I thought, okay,

352
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.700
maybe I just have an autoimmune disorder and I can't control it with diet

353
00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:39.050
anymore. Um, maybe this, maybe I'm just stuck like this.

354
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.060
And so I Googled like out of desperation,

355
00:20:41.061 --> 00:20:43.910
I think I Googled allergic to everything, food wise,

356
00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:47.090
something like that into Google. And I found the story about Charlene.

357
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.970
Who's been mentioned a couple of times,

358
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.320
and she'd been diagnosed with Lyme disease and has been eating nothing,

359
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:56.140
but like red meat for 18 years.

360
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.580
And there are pictures of her family online. And I thought, okay,

361
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.000
I know I'm not. I think I Googled allergic to everything except meat.

362
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.880
So I found her, then I found that Sean Baker episode, you did,

363
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.750
and he'd been doing it for two years. And I think that night I thought,

364
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:19.180
screw it. I literally have nothing to lose here. I'm only cutting out salad.

365
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.540
So that's when I switched over, that was December.

366
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:28.060
And then I switched over and the itching got better pretty

367
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.830
quickly, like within the first couple of days.

368
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.790
But then my digestion just got totally screwed up.

369
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.350
So like bloating and diarrhea, every time I ate. And after about a week,

370
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:42.120
I thought, Kay, this is a bad idea. Bloating, diarrhea.

371
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.310
<v 0>Every time you ate meat, just meat.</v>

372
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.040
<v 1>And salt roast. Yeah. So I thought this is a bad idea. Obviously,</v>

373
00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:53.190
this isn't working, my body doesn't like it. So I reintroduced salad again.

374
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.440
It was literally lettuce, apple, cider vinegar, olive oil and salt and pepper.

375
00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.970
That's what I re-introduced.

376
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.050
And I woke up the next day and the itch was back in my joints were stiff.

377
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:05.790
And I thought, okay,

378
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.590
if I have to choose between itching and arthritis or diarrhea,

379
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.140
I'm going to choose the diarrhea. I was in a rough place.

380
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.710
So I stuck it out. And at six weeks of just doing this,

381
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.930
uh, my died, the bloating went away,

382
00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:25.110
the diarrhea went away and everything started to improve.

383
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.630
So that was mid January, but I was still pretty skeptical because I thought,

384
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.140
I thought maybe the reason the carnivore diet worked for people was because they

385
00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:38.550
just accidentally cut out everything that wasn't working for them. Um,

386
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.300
processed foods, sugar, you know, grains, all that surcharge,

387
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.490
reintroduce all lives like organic olives and olive oil. And that was February.

388
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.600
And then I had this itching came back with the depression. Um,

389
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.600
my skin broke out and it was minor in comparison to like soy.

390
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.100
<v 0>So you think essentially to give us the cliff notes, you're allergic day.</v>

391
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.400
Yeah. crazy. It's.

392
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.190
<v 1>Crazy. But then here's the thing. I started this blog.</v>

393
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.690
So the blogs don't eat that.

394
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.860
And I started this blog because I thought if for some reason there's someone

395
00:23:13.861 --> 00:23:16.890
else out there like me and they're Googling these things,

396
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.200
it'd be nice for them to know that they're not alone.

397
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:25.110
And I've found other people like this who are equally as sensitive. Sure.

398
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.640
<v 0>I mean, look, if you exist,</v>

399
00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:28.860
is there's probably quite a few people that have that issue. Look,

400
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.890
it makes sense. It makes sense that we all,

401
00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:34.560
we all have different tolerances and we all have different allergies. I mean,

402
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.190
some people are allergic to cats. Some people have no problem with peanuts.

403
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.260
Some people eat a Brazil nut and they die. This is just, we, we know this.

404
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.000
So the idea, this is one,

405
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.860
the problems with diet is that people want to think that a diet that works for

406
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:51.830
them works for everybody. And it doesn't work that way and things,

407
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.740
and people want you to follow their diet no matter what it is,

408
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:58.910
whether it's vegan or paleo, people are very ideological with that.

409
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.630
They would love you for you to do exactly what they're doing.

410
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.050
So to reinforce what they're doing is correct. Um,

411
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:11.030
there's a lot of pushback against this carnivore diet idea, but.

412
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.790
<v 2>I don't, I, I.</v>

413
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.330
<v 0>I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that someone like you might</v>

414
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:19.430
actually really be allergic to everything.

415
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.200
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I was like very sick.</v>

416
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.360
And from coming from that place to now,

417
00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:27.910
I can see how sick I was and it was like, I was dying.

418
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.370
I was on a bunch of medication. Just bad.

419
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.750
<v 0>Do anything with probiotics. Yeah. I can't tolerate probiotics.</v>

420
00:24:34.751 --> 00:24:36.190
Can't tolerate them. No.

421
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:41.050
<v 1>So the original idea was heal my gut repopulate with bacteria that maybe I'm</v>

422
00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:43.810
missing and then maybe incorporate more foods. Right.

423
00:24:43.811 --> 00:24:46.720
So what happened when we tried to do that? Same auto-immune flare up.

424
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.460
<v 0>Okay. But this is the same auto immune flare up that you got when you ate salad.</v>

425
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.640
<v 1>No, not quite, not quite as bad. Not it was different.</v>

426
00:24:57.641 --> 00:25:00.250
It was like with salad,

427
00:25:00.251 --> 00:25:03.760
there's more of the arthritis and like body pain.

428
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.930
And then with probiotics, what'd you get mood issues.

429
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:13.000
So like really volatile and itchy. Right. So I still got the itch.

430
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.630
Yeah. So I think it was, I probably had leaky gut.

431
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.420
And so the probiotics just going everywhere.

432
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.370
<v 0>Things, your dad brought up to me when he was here was, um, emulsifiers. Yeah.</v>

433
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.200
Yeah. Um, and then I started reading up on it after he discussed it with me.

434
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.960
And, uh, it's something that I'd never even considered before,

435
00:25:31.961 --> 00:25:36.910
but fast rising yeast and all these different emulsifiers

436
00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:40.510
that they put in bread and various foods.

437
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.810
They're terrible for you. Oh my God. Yeah. Terrible for your stomach.

438
00:25:43.811 --> 00:25:45.820
And they're, they're so prevalent. They're everywhere.

439
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.730
<v 1>Yeah. Soy lecithin in the it's in everything.</v>

440
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:49.750
<v 0>And everything. Yeah.</v>

441
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.110
I started really paying attention to it and I've read several articles on it

442
00:25:53.111 --> 00:25:55.120
and, and a couple of studies. It's,

443
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.270
it's crazy how this is something that's never even discussed.

444
00:25:58.271 --> 00:26:00.820
And it has all sorts of, uh,

445
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.170
negative effects on your gut and your gut lining. It's awful.
