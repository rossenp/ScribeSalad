00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 1>I think our problem in this country, there's there's many problems,</v>

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:11.120
but one of our problems is the loudest voices on the fringes.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.360
And this is one of the things that I wanna discuss with you is what's going on

5
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:15.200
in Portland. Yeah.

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.480
And I think what's going on in Portland is the loudest voices on the fringes

7
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.150
that people on the right and on the far right. And whether,

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.590
or recognizes recognizing as emblematic right of

9
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:32.870
the left, they think it defines the left. And I don't think it does. And I,

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.070
I think it is,

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.990
it's a symptom of it's it's a symptom of, first of all,

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.460
terrible govern of, of,

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.900
of someone who's allowing this to flourish inside the,

14
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.260
the mayor of Portland who seems to be supporting this in some sort of a weird

15
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.100
way, weird way. And, and ideologically believes that Antifa,

16
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:56.740
just because of a name stands for antifascist, if you had no name,

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.610
which you would have as a bunch of hood wearing mask, wearing violent th right.

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.570
Who are beating people who disagree with them and cuz that's what we saw with

19
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:09.610
that. Andy, how do you say his name go? Is it I think it's Andy. No, no.

20
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.250
And it's N G O right. I, I treated the G as silent until somebody corrects.

21
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.450
I think, I think you're right. Um, what you saw from that video? Yeah.

22
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:22.800
That anyone could support that of with a person who's just talking.

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.760
They, I mean he, if what I've seen of him yeah.

24
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.880
What they have tried to describe that he supports neo-Nazis that he supports the

25
00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:33.920
proud boy. I have seen none of this. I've seen no evidence of this,

26
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.720
but I've seen the narrative trotted out over and over again as a justification

27
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.800
for violence against him.

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.910
When the left supports bullying in the,

29
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.510
the worst possible form, ganging up on someone, punching them,

30
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.950
hitting them with sticks, Crow, bars, all this crazy,

31
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.550
thinking that it's okay to throw milkshakes at people thinking that this is

32
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:57.070
fine. This is nothing. If you, what? I,

33
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.990
I think this is a horrible precedent to set and it's a terrible,

34
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.380
it's terrible move. If you're playing a game,

35
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.060
it's a terrible fir first move because things only escalate.

36
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.380
They don't deescalate. No one says, wow, you beat the outta Andy. No.

37
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:13.300
So this is a mystery.

38
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.340
<v 0>Right? Like what the.</v>

39
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.580
<v 1>Hell is going on right now? Well,</v>

40
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:19.180
the hell's you allowing people to wear masks and carry backpacks with weapons.

41
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.380
And there's a natural human inclination. When someone gets hit to jump,

42
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.690
been and hit 'em too. So let you see it all the time. Watch world star,

43
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.703
go to world star,

44
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.210
hip hop.com and watch someone gets hit a bunch of people just jumping and hit

45
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.690
'em. It happens at truck stops and high schools. It happens.

46
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:37.530
People get brain damage, people die, punch each other all the time. Yeah.

47
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:40.930
People permanent injury. When you're seeing in Portland,

48
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.080
there was one of 'em where an old guy got hit in the head with a Probar right by

49
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:49.880
some mass kid because the old guy apparently disagreed or they all disagree on

50
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:51.600
things. I don't think someone's decided my guess is.

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.560
<v 0>That the old guy is not exactly as portrayed.</v>

52
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.480
I believe that the old guy may have been there with a

53
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.000
telecoping Baton.

54
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.480
<v 1>Oh. So he was hitting people. Let's.</v>

55
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.880
<v 0>Take this. I think this is so worthwhile, but like let's do it. Right. Okay.</v>

56
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:12.120
Because I think this is so mysterious. What the help are people doing?

57
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:16.160
Supporting right? Uh, Andy, no being beaten up on video. Let's so let's.

58
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.880
<v 1>Stay, stay with him because that's the,</v>

59
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.710
the best clearest example of someone who's a tiny little gay man. He's tiny.

60
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.990
I mean, he represents so many different maligned populations, right?

61
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.550
He he's pretty intersectional. Yes.

62
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.670
<v 0>He's Asian. He's.</v>

63
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.230
<v 1>An immigrant. He's an immigrant. He's gay. I, I, is he a Republican?</v>

64
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.110
<v 0>I thought he was left of center, but I was told he was a.</v>

65
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.420
<v 1>Conservative journal. I've been told I'm a AltRight guy. Yeah, exactly.</v>

66
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.500
I Don' exactly. It's very confusing. All right. He's also, uh,

67
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.900
dominive in physical form. He's not de he's not threatening physically. Right.

68
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.380
And, uh, they've chosen this guy as an example.

69
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.020
And one of the more disturbing things were,

70
00:03:57.021 --> 00:03:59.100
how many people saw the video and were justifying it,

71
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:02.250
saying things like get another hobby. These an, our,

72
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.210
the antifascist will not stand for, you know, your, your,

73
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.850
your bigotry and your hate. Like what are you talking? Okay.

74
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.410
You think it's okay to punch this guy? Like the,

75
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.650
the fact that you guys all piled on and punched him and through milkshake. This.

76
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.130
<v 0>Is, this is so I I've been thinking a lot about it. I have a model. I'm,</v>

77
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.520
I'm happy to hear yours because there is a mystery.

78
00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:24.160
Can we both agree to be at the beginning that you would imagine that that video

79
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:28.760
would've shocked people and to find so many people sort of excusing it is really

80
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:32.880
shocking. Well it's and given that he's also inter clearly interntersect like,

81
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.840
you wouldn't predict this from first principles, right? No, you.

82
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.680
<v 1>Wouldn't. If you looked at it on paper, you definitely wouldn't. Especially if,</v>

83
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.710
if you allowed him to self-identify as left a center. Okay.

84
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.230
<v 0>So here's how the, I think the model goes, okay.</v>

85
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.310
Unless you wanna give yours first. No, go.

86
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.143
<v 1>Ahead. All right.</v>

87
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.990
<v 0>The first thing that we have to understand is that there's a division.</v>

88
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.910
I wanna lay this out super carefully. The first division is between the,

89
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.860
what you're calling the loudest voices. And I'm gonna call the most

90
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.980
courageous, oh, I don't wanna call it courageous.

91
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.900
The most willing to accept loss.

92
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.700
The voice is most willing to accept loss.

93
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.020
Most of the left does not want to be dragged to the extreme left.

94
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.570
And so you, this thing about why are you focusing on a fringe?

95
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.610
And the answer is because the fringe is running the show, in my opinion.

96
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.970
<v 1>What do you mean by willing to accept loss?</v>

97
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.930
<v 0>If you go into an Antifa versus proud boys, Malay,</v>

98
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.680
you're willing, you, you accept that you may get clocked, bike lock.

99
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.280
<v 1>I don't think that's correct. Or at the time, I don't think that's correct.</v>

100
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.400
I think you're dealing with people that have no concept of real violence.

101
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.520
No experience of real violencelaring you seen him, have you seen yes.

102
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:54.160
They're they're it's cosplay.

103
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.440
It's cosplaylarrping have you seen the image of the guy? Who's a suspect.

104
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.080
Looks like he's never worked out a day in his life.

105
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:04.440
Looks like he's never been outside. And I think these people are playing a game.

106
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.400
We've we've agreed on.

107
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.520
<v 0>This. Yes. Okay. But you are willing,</v>

108
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.040
so you think you're gonna get into a wily coyote versus the road runner kind of

109
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.910
a thing where both of them always survived to the next cart. They have.

110
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.190
<v 1>No idea what they're doing. Yeah. Have you ever,</v>

111
00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:20.990
have you ever seen a fight between people that have no idea how to fight? Yes.

112
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.310
Yeah. Okay. We all have. I I've been one of those. Okay.

113
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:25.950
That STUs me as a martial arts expert.

114
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.270
It STUs me that people are willing to participate in that.

115
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.510
It's like me not knowing how to get in a motorcycle and getting in a race.

116
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.870
Right. I don't, I don't know how anyone's willing to do that,

117
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.140
but they're willing to do that and they're do that because they're delusional

118
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.780
they're and Delus and supported in their delusional perspective,

119
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.500
by the giant numbers of them. Okay. They all get together. And then,

120
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:47.740
then they wear masks, which further emphasizes this illusion,

121
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.420
that they're part of the game. But Joe look.

122
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.940
<v 0>Assume that you are not even in a physical situation,</v>

123
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.930
you're willing to be very loud on social media, about simplistic perspectives.

124
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.530
Yes. And you're willing to become a pariah at some level, because.

125
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.450
<v 1>Are you though? I think mostly you're supported. Okay. I need far more support.</v>

126
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.523
I.

127
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.490
<v 0>I'm not necessarily.</v>

128
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.250
You are gonna trigger so many times on this explanation that I probably just

129
00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:17.730
need a little place in the table to start building this up and then you can tear

130
00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:21.000
it the, okay. Okay. The first belief is,

131
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:24.840
is that the belief that I have is that the fringes are much more running the

132
00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:29.440
show than the people who claim that this is a small number of people believe

133
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.880
that the fringes are scary. Fringes are willing to go places.

134
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.600
The rest of us aren't I agree with.

135
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.600
<v 1>You on both sides left and right left. And.</v>

136
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.433
<v 0>Right.</v>

137
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.270
So I spend a lot of time focused on the fringes because the fringes have become

138
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.790
terrifying and the middle has become cowardly.

139
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.590
And the whole principle about the whole ideaw thing was about creating

140
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.150
a noncowardly

141
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.710
core that could actually potentially hold the center.

142
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.620
&lt;affirmative&gt; um, because people are actually fairly courageous.

143
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.540
Like you would have to say, my brother is fairly courageous. Ben Shapiro,

144
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.900
Andy know Sam Harris. These are people who've stood up to death threats.

145
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.140
You know, I, I, I have a guy who's threatening me every day of my life. Uh,

146
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.300
you know, coming through, uh, the internet and my family.

147
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.530
You have to have some courage in order to be part of this thing.

148
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.010
And that's part of my irritation when people come after it.

149
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.450
So there is a cowardly center and a very

150
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.090
terrifying fringe and the fringe is going around the whole thing right.

151
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:33.923
Left and right,

152
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.520
the next thing is that people are secretly weirdly

153
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.400
sympathetic with their violent, the violent fringe to their extreme,

154
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.000
rather than making common cause across the center. So for example,

155
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.920
you imagine that you run a laundromat and you're being visited by a

156
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:57.040
member of organized crime every week.

157
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.760
And he comes into your laundromat and he kind of plays with your stuff.

158
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.000
And he says, oh, I'd be ashamed.

159
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.560
If anything happened to your business and he shakes you down, starts saying, oh,

160
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.280
you know, I noticed that you have a daughter. I would love to date her.

161
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.160
Perhaps perhaps will go out sometime you hate this guy.

162
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.710
And then some sort of violent VI vigilante element that's operating extra

163
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:21.230
judicially after you've gone to the police over and over again,

164
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.030
breaks the guy's kneecaps, right?

165
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.630
You're weirdly sympathetic with the vigilante because you're being terrified by

166
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:32.510
a group that is not being taken care of.

167
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.580
I think that this is in part why some elements of the left that

168
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:39.701
are,

169
00:09:39.701 --> 00:09:44.340
should be more responsible that have institutional positions that have platforms

170
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.420
that they can broadcast are weirdly sympathetic to Antifa and why country

171
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:54.100
club Republicans are weirdly sympathetic to some of these far right groups is

172
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.610
that they view them &lt;affirmative&gt; as this is the dangerous group.

173
00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:01.810
That's kind of taking care of the problem that I can't stand up to.

174
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.170
So you've got this bizarre cowardly sympathy from the center who

175
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:09.410
won't actually stand up and say,

176
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.090
I have more in common with a country club Republican in like in my case,

177
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.640
I view myself as a progressive or a least a liberal,

178
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.280
I have more in common with a country club Republican than somebody who's got a

179
00:10:22.281 --> 00:10:22.850
bike lock.

180
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.560
Who's looking for trouble in a street demonstration trying to smash up a

181
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.840
Starbucks, right?

182
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.720
I don't want the help from my left.

183
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.240
Now the, the group that wants to play this out,

184
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:39.270
using these sort of proxy groups to handle the problems

185
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.630
is saying, look, we're gonna,

186
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.670
we're gonna sound an air horn before one of these things so that all reasonable

187
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:51.110
people can get the hell out of the way. And if you don't respond,

188
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.190
then your collateral damage and that's on you. That's how they see this. I,

189
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.550
I think that's for asking. So in other words,

190
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.060
I think Andy know is the guy who doesn't listen to the air horn,

191
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.300
Brett Weinstein, doesn't listen to the air horn. Jordan, Jordan Peterson,

192
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.580
Sam Harris, don't listen to the air horn.

193
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.340
<v 1>I think that's very accurate in your description of these fringe,</v>

194
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:16.140
people doing the work of the people that are more reasonable,

195
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.250
but are happy to have these bad people do,

196
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.850
do their work to fight this battle for them because they think that ultimately

197
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:24.690
it's for good. Yeah.

198
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.010
<v 0>I need my organized crime group to get rid of your organized crime group. Yes.</v>

199
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.610
Right? Yes. And so the idea is that the law and order people are like,

200
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.291
I really don't want,

201
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:35.530
anybody's organized crime group and I'm gonna actually stand up to the mob and

202
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:39.320
I'm actually not gonna pay you your God protection because I'm gonna own a

203
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:43.600
laundromat. And this is the United States of America and off that's,

204
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.320
that's the view that I represent. Yeah. I don't want, I don't. Thank you Antifa.

205
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:51.120
I don't need your help. Yeah. You know what?

206
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.320
I actually am much more afraid of the far. Right.

207
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:57.120
And the reason I concentrate my negative energy on the far left is what are you

208
00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:59.640
trying to do? You're trying to get the genie out of the bottle on the far,

209
00:11:59.641 --> 00:12:03.680
right. That is the danger. Yeah. You wanna see more Tiki torches. It's not,

210
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.360
teiki torches that you need to worry about.

211
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.520
It's armed people who come and they're not, they're not bringing bikes well,

212
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:14.310
and we're pushing ordinary human being to the extremes. Yeah.

213
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.910
Right. And the thing that I get is is that like,

214
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.230
I believe that the Republican party, you know, I just,

215
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.790
I never get a chance to say this stuff.

216
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.070
I have never gotten along with the Republican party. I just don't like it.

217
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.190
I view it as the thing that wants to exclude me from their country clubs.

218
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.350
I have an older model.

219
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.980
They're the group that wanted to put in condo developments in Yosemite valley

220
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.780
because they couldn't figure out why we would wanna preserve the national parks.

221
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:44.580
They were the ones that laughed about, uh, clubbing the baby seals. Ha ha ha.

222
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.580
I just always had this attitude. these people, right? This is my,

223
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:50.660
this is my emotional cadence.

224
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.930
And we always had this thing where the Democrats were the, we,

225
00:12:55.931 --> 00:13:00.770
we had most of the smart people. And so in a tiny fraction of time,

226
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.770
we have seen this giant evaporation of intelligence. Uh, if not

227
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.290
actually through a lack of courage,

228
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.760
the people who represent responsible, left, wing,

229
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:16.760
thinking who believe in structural oppression,

230
00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:19.120
but don't believe in the extent claimed, you know,

231
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.080
who want to keep making progress,

232
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.120
who want to make sure that traditionally marginalized groups are taken care

233
00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:28.120
of that we take our responsibilities,

234
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.160
but not our guilt as the reason for trying to make a better world.

235
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:41.990
<v 2>The.</v>
