00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I wanted to get back to something you said earlier,</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:08.790
you said the way restaurants were before the food network. Yeah.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.743
Like what happened?

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.663
<v 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.220
I think food network and food shows in general are a great thing. You know,

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.250
it empowers people to cook and there's all different levels.

7
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:23.640
And I think it's the, the greatest thing. And also has given us a chefs,

8
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.700
a platform to do some incredible things too,

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.060
but there was a different type of motivation between,

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.100
between the cooks in the kitchen and a good number of the cooks

11
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:39.960
today. So before, you know, there wasn't celebrity, um,

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.920
involved. So you were there for the reason, for the love, the art of it,

13
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.660
where as nowadays, I'm not going to say everybody because I cook with,

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.050
and I know there's plenty of people that are very serious about it. It's about,

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.610
about the craft of putting in the hours, the repetition,

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.390
that doesn't make sense until all of a sudden you're doing something without

17
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:05.130
thinking about it. And that's what it was like really before. Um, we were just,

18
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:09.960
everybody was in the kitchen was there because they loved cooking.

19
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.530
Not, not for any reason of celebrity or,

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.660
or whatever it is. So it, it really, it did change good, you know,

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.100
patients like, so people like the progression would be like, oh,

22
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:26.460
you work as a line cook for three to four years. And then, you know, you're,

23
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.490
then you're a sous chef for a number of years. And then you're a chef and,

24
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:31.080
you know, there was a progression.

25
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.800
And then when the whole thing came along and then it was,

26
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:39.480
everybody was like from culinary school to chef, you know,

27
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.180
they wanted to jump right into it. And.

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.320
<v 0>Are,</v>

29
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.260
do you think there's a significant number of people that are actually getting

30
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:48.450
into cooking to become famous?

31
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.180
<v 1>There was something about it. Yeah, there's an allure. I mean, it,</v>

32
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.590
that it has a, it has a thing, I don't know,

33
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.210
not the term famous is a little bit different. I'd say like notoriety,

34
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.300
in other words, they're like ready to show like, Hey, I can do this,

35
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:07.110
but with cooking, the there's a certain number of hours. You just,

36
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.980
you cannot avoid, you have to put this in, you have to have the knife in that,

37
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.720
in your hand for thousands and thousands of hours before you really are starting

38
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.570
to cook, because it's easy to do a dish,

39
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.140
but it's difficult to do a dish and to cook, you know,

40
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.900
consistently with all the different things,

41
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.990
getting thrown at you like this Corona virus thing, like, okay,

42
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:31.230
how do you adapt? How are you resilient? You know, how can you bounce back?

43
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.760
How do you understand? Like,

44
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:36.600
no matter what I'm going to get this dish up at nine o'clock,

45
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.990
if that customer wants it at nine, o'clock not anything else.

46
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.160
<v 2>W well, I think we're, we're rapidly moving towards opening up the country. Um,</v>

47
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.330
it's going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. Um,

48
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.660
so yeah. Um,

49
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.620
something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is, um,

50
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.610
when reporting, uh,

51
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.920
sort of COVID cases to separate out diagnosed with COVID

52
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.700
versus, uh, had COVID like symptoms. Yes. Um,

53
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.590
because the, the list of,

54
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.830
of symptoms that could be covered at this point is like a mile long.

55
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.360
So it's like hard to, if you're ill at all, it's like you could recover it.

56
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.270
So we're just, just to give you a better information,

57
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.430
definitely diagnosed with COVID or had COVID like symptoms we're

58
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:32.200
conflating those two. So that one that it looks bigger than it is then,

59
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.680
uh, if somebody dies is COVID a,

60
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.510
a primary cause of the death or not. Uh, I mean,

61
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.260
if you, I mean, if somebody has COVID gets eaten by a shark, um,

62
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.360
we find their arm, their arm has COVID,

63
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.290
it's gonna get recorded as a COVID death.

64
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.690
<v 0>Is that real? Not, not that bad, but heart attacks, strokes,</v>

65
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.220
you get hit by a bus cancer.

66
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.590
<v 2>If you, if you get hit by a bus, go to the, the hospital and die,</v>

67
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.500
and they find that you have COVID, you will be recorded as a COVID debt.

68
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.010
Why would they do.

69
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.843
<v 0>That though?</v>

70
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.610
<v 2>Well, right now the,</v>

71
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.350
so the road is hell is the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I mean,

72
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.840
it's mostly paid with bad intentions, but there is, you know,

73
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.280
some good intentions paving stones in there too. Um, and the,

74
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.990
the, the stimulus bill that was intended to help, uh,

75
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.900
with the hospitals that were being overwrought with, with, with COVID patients,

76
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.880
uh, created an incentive to record something as good as COVID.

77
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.470
That is difficult to say no to,

78
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:41.470
especially if your hospital's going bankrupt, for lack of other patients.

79
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.120
So the hospitals are in a bind right now. There's a bunch of hospitals.

80
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.360
They're following doctors, as you were mentioning, there are, you know,

81
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.020
they're your hospital's half full you're. It's hard, hard to make ends meet.

82
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.880
So now you've got like, you know, I just check this box. I get $8,000,

83
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.580
put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 or,

84
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:04.840
or I got to fire some doctors.

85
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.030
So what's the what's tough moral quandary is like, what? Where are you can do.

86
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.800
<v 0>So nice to be semi normal again? Yes.</v>

87
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.830
For shore restrictions.

88
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:21.760
It's supposed to be lifting up here in Los Angeles on Friday,

89
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.370
which means nothing for us, for comedians.

90
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.760
It means something for like some re retail, some other stuff,

91
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.830
but they're doing it nice and slow.

92
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:33.400
And did you see the list of that the governor's office put out of stuff you're

93
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:36.760
allowed to do? You should pull that up Jamie. Cause it is.

94
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.510
It's quite hilarious. First of all, it's, it's kind of condescending.

95
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.750
It's it's like treating you, like you're a moron,

96
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.610
like here's things you're allowed to do.

97
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.020
One of them that I thought it was hilarious. It said soft martial arts. Yeah.

98
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.210
It did say Tai Chi, this is you'll have to do this.

99
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:56.050
That's how soft martial arts? No, like, why can't you do,

100
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.280
why can't you shadow box? Can you do that?

101
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.610
Or it's only locate if you do things that don't work,

102
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.770
like you're saying martial martial art, or this, an art of war, right.

103
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.460
And Thai cheese. It is, uh, it's more,

104
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.950
much more of a meditation than it is an art of war.

105
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.480
I think it's very beneficial, but like, look at it. Test athletics. Number one.

106
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.360
What does that mean? Badminton. Singles,

107
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.560
singles throwing a ball, a baseball, softball stop.

108
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.500
Here's the problem with that? Yeah. If you're throwing a baseball,

109
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.550
you're basically shaking hands and you're doing it with an organic skin. Right?

110
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.120
Baseball. The outside of it is cow skin. You could throw a ball by yourself,

111
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.480
but that's not what they're saying now. Right? That's sort of sad.

112
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.200
You're going to throw it, throw it and go pick it up.

113
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.800
<v 3>Throwing balls to yourself in the park.</v>

114
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.810
<v 0>BMX biking. Okay. Thank you. You're allowed to canoe singles. Oh,</v>

115
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.360
look it. Specifies. What singles are they.

116
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.440
<v 3>Talking about? Crabbing. Like.</v>

117
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.490
<v 0>Crab walk. No, like catching crabs. You can go crabbing like fishing. No,</v>

118
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:01.190
that's what it means. Oh, you can go crabbing people do it all the time.

119
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.790
Oh yeah. In California. Not here, but in Northern California. It's a big deal.

120
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.120
Yeah. I've done it before you catch a blue crabs. I think they are.

121
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.580
I think they're blue. Mine. What species they are,

122
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.470
but you catch them off the piers.

123
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:16.400
Like there's a lot of areas around San Francisco where people catch crabs.

124
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.060
Um, it's really big in like, uh, like Maryland and you know,

125
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.750
like those guys love crabbing. Oh. And in Alaska too,

126
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:27.980
they do a lot of credits and things. It.

127
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.900
<v 4>Was just the California list. That's why I was like, I didn't.</v>

128
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.460
<v 0>They must have I'm in the oceans right here. Uh, gardening, not in groups.</v>

129
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.780
Oh, you can explore rock pools. Thank you. Oh, wow.

130
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.763
<v 3>Well, you can only do that.</v>

131
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.900
<v 0>Malibu, but you can't get to the beach.</v>

132
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.730
It's closed cycling golf singles. Walking.

133
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.360
No cart, Tony. Oh my gosh. You can't have a cart.

134
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.170
Why can't I have a cart? What if is my cart? I can't take the cart.

135
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.980
It's electric. It doesn't even hurt the environment. Like what is, uh,

136
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.780
why can't I take the cart or.

137
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.550
<v 3>Why can't they clean it? Wipe? Is there.</v>

138
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.540
<v 0>A logic to that? Let's stop a bit of it's your cart. Is there a logic to that?</v>

139
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.570
And how is it any different than the cart at the supermarket?

140
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.790
Like that getting passed around like a cheap ho, but that lady,

141
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.900
that new press secretary, she has sent that video, dude. She's a gangster.

142
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.600
Have you seen that video?

143
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.030
Never seen someone more prepared for a question in your life. Jamie, do you,

144
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:24.320
have you seen that? I'm talking about.

145
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.250
<v 4>Small point on that. Not the big point, but small point.</v>

146
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.350
She was so prepared for.

147
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.030
<v 0>Yes. That's what I'm saying. Well, she's supposed to be prepared. I said,</v>

148
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.860
you've never seen someone know why they're there because they're prepared

149
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.350
and you know why they're prepared because they're trying to play. Gotcha.

150
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.840
So she played gotcha with them. She checked me.

151
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.820
She came in there with that Elon Musk flame play that video. Play that video.

152
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.600
Like Leonardo DiCaprio. You're on you're on the other side. No, I was saying,

153
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.690
Hey, listen, jumps.

154
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.590
<v 4>In. I almost was saying that. It seems like she.</v>

155
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.430
<v 0>Was working with that reporter to say, Hey, feed me this so I can on everybody.</v>

156
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.930
No, that guy got, cause that does happen. That guy was yelling. He was like, no,

157
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.700
you were ready for this. Hold on, hold on.

158
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.020
What do you just see yourself if served up a softball so she could fire off the

159
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:13.320
machine? No, no, no. He didn't. That's not what he did at all.

160
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.680
Like I tried to play gotcha. With her. Do you want to take your word back?

161
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.950
Because she said that Trump is not going to let the coronavirus coming to the

162
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:21.540
country. And what she's saying,

163
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:25.920
the reason why they're shutting down a travel from Asia is because they're

164
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:28.800
worried about the coronavirus coming to the country and Trump's not going to let

165
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:33.480
that happen. So they, they tried to take what she said and,

166
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.220
and take it out of context or frame it while she was saying that Trump is

167
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:40.710
not going to let the country get infected by the Corona virus.

168
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.510
What she's trying to say is that she,

169
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:46.110
he's not going to have free travel where people have Corona virus,

170
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:47.880
because it's going to bring the virus in.

171
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.430
Not that it's the only way the virus is going to get here.

172
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:54.210
The virus got here anyway, but it came with the fire guys said,

173
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.310
are you going to take that by first of all, it's a question.

174
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.000
Like all those journalists take kind of in the first place.

175
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:06.660
They're trying so hard to have these moments where they,

176
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.290
they play. Got ya. But when did, when did these journalists,

177
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.530
quippy and journalists become like trolls off Reddit,

178
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.090
like some of their questions to Trump.

179
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.520
That's why Trump goes so hard in the paint on them. I know,

180
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:20.430
but he goes too hard. The problem is there's too much. There's too much.

181
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.030
Here's too much about what they think a lion should not be so concerned about

182
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.180
the opinion of sheep. Correct. And that's, it's not,

183
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.130
it's not becoming of someone who's in such a powerful position to the precedent

184
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.960
that guy's a writer for the way she handled it though. Oh my God.

185
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:40.170
She just dropped a phone with sexy, sexy,

186
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.340
wildly coyote with a TNT. Boom. She was like, you ready? You want to do it now?

187
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.050
Yeah. And then she had a big smile and walked off as they're trying to say.

188
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.900
And he's like, you prepared for that. She went, thank you. Have a good day.

189
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.101
Oh gee,

190
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:56.400
you think she prepared for it with all those stats that she read right in front

191
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:56.730
of you.
