00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.390
<v 2>Let's go to your store, explain to everybody what happened with you.</v>

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.340
<v 1>Okay. Mm. I mean, I'm not sure how about how far back you want me to start,</v>

4
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.174
but.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.850
<v 0>How you getting kicked off Twitter?</v>

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.810
<v 1>Okay. So, I mean,</v>

7
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:20.790
I was one of the only people in Canada who was talking

8
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.870
about gender identity critically. Um, I'm not saying that to big myself up.

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.570
It was very annoying. Cause I obviously was like targeted.

10
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:29.580
So there was Jordan Peterson, um,

11
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.480
who spoke out and then there was me and then there was like a couple other

12
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.990
people and I was pretty vocal about it. Um,

13
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.490
I first started talking about it back in like 20 16,

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.670
20 17 because the liberal government was pushing through bill C 16,

15
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.480
which was our gender identity legislation. Um, so they were,

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.840
they were trying to and succeeded in, cause the bill passed,

17
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:56.190
incorporate gender identity into the, um, human rights code,

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.923
um, and the criminal code.

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.760
And I went and testified against that bill

20
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.180
to say like this bill shouldn't pass, um,

21
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.880
it'll have a negative impact on women's rights, which before.

22
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.460
<v 0>The people that don't know what the bill, what it means,</v>

23
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.060
could you explain what it means? Cause some folks aren't hip to the argument.

24
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.370
Right. And also that Canada,

25
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.380
we should explain Canada does not have a first amendment.

26
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.060
So you don't have freedom of speech over there.

27
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.490
You have the human rights council. Right. So,

28
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.230
and then if laws violate, if, uh,

29
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.670
rather some of your speech violates the laws that they put in place,

30
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.230
you can literally be arrested.

31
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.180
<v 1>Yeah. You can you go through a human rights tribunal? Um,</v>

32
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.070
and so, I mean the law didn't actually,

33
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:48.510
it was very vague. Like it didn't specifically say for example, you know,

34
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
if you mis-gender somebody that's a hate crime or hate speech or something like

35
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:54.150
that,

36
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.620
all it did was to say that gender identity and gender expression essentially

37
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:03.600
needed to be protected under the law. Just like whatever race,

38
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.060
um, other sort of marginalized identities or whatever. Um,

39
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.720
and what we thought would happen,

40
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.860
which did happen is that it would sort of direct policy. Um,

41
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.100
and it would mean that, you know,

42
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.130
anybody could use any bathroom or change room.

43
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:26.400
It would mean that men would have to be allowed in transition houses and women's

44
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.100
shelters if they identified as women, um,

45
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:32.430
it would mean that men could be transferred to female prisons if they identified

46
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:35.550
as women, essentially like to me,

47
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.840
the concept of gender identity, nullifies sex, like you can't have both,

48
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:44.360
you can't say either you are a woman and you're a woman because you're

49
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.540
female or you identify as a woman, you can't, you can't do both.

50
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.660
And then anybody of course can identify as a woman. Um,

51
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.220
I'm sort of going about this a long way, but, um, yeah,

52
00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:00.280
I was just worried about the implications. Uh, I testified at the Senate,

53
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.740
Jordan Peterson, are you okay?

54
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.910
And so essentially, like I was the loudest feminist voice in Canada,

55
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.610
um, by far and I was tweeting about these issues. Um,

56
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.910
I was asking questions about gender identity. I was sort of saying like,

57
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.930
what does this mean? Like I said, one of the tweets that I,

58
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.960
my account was locked down for was, um,

59
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.860
what's the difference between a man and a trans woman. Um,

60
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.570
and I wasn't saying that to try to be rude. Um, I was saying like, somebody,

61
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:39.520
please explain what happens to a man between him being

62
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.030
a man and then him being a trans woman. Do you know what I mean?

63
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:46.000
Like if he hasn't had any surgeries or anything like that,

64
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.530
not that I think that a surgery can change your sex, but like, what is it?

65
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.050
So now yesterday he was a man today.

66
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:56.500
He identifies as a woman or a trans woman what's happened here.

67
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.780
What does this mean? Like, it, it was just so nonsensical. It's just, uh,

68
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.010
a belief system. Right.

69
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.330
<v 0>And you get even worse. Right. But you,</v>

70
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.170
you can decide to go back and forth throughout the day. Yeah. I mean,

71
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.210
people have, they've allowed that this is, this is also accepted. Like you,

72
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.980
you can be gender fluid and you can be gender fluid depending upon your mood

73
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.810
multiple times a day.

74
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.240
<v 1>Right. And th yeah. And that's what the concept of gender identity does.</v>

75
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.660
It's just an identity. It's just something you say, like,

76
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.780
it could be something you feel, but it's just a proclamation.

77
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:36.250
There's no material reality involved. There's nothing concrete.

78
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:40.690
There's nothing you can point to. Um, you know, essentially like it's,

79
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.190
it's a kin to a religion as far as I'm concerned. It's faith-based right. Um,

80
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:46.660
so, you know,

81
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.490
I feel like these laws are in a way sort of in forcing

82
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:55.300
religion on people. Like, it's like, they're enforcing this, like faith-based.

83
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.870
<v 0>Religion. Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.910
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you could call it progressive,</v>

85
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:02.260
but it's of course not progressive.

86
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:06.820
It's just weird and nonsensical and has a terrible impact on women. But, um,

87
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.290
so one of the tweets that I was locked down for was that one, you know,

88
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:14.020
what's the difference between a man and a trans woman? Um.

89
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.350
<v 0>Just a question. Yeah. And so they suspended you for that.</v>

90
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.720
<v 1>Yeah. They locked down my account and they're like,</v>

91
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.750
you have to delete this tweet. If you want your account back, I appealed it.

92
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.690
It was every time I've appealed to anything, it's just been totally ignored.

93
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:30.280
They don't explain why they never tell me what rules I break either or did

94
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:34.060
break. Right. Like they never said, they say hateful conduct,

95
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.120
but they don't say, oh, it's this specific rule.

96
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:41.380
Like you're not allowed to mis-gender or dead name or whatever it would be.

97
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.410
I mean, I don't even know what rule that would break saying, like,

98
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.140
what's the difference between a man and a trans woman? Um,

99
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.930
the other tweet of course, was men or women,

100
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.150
which wasn't targeted at anybody. I wasn't saying you're not a woman.

101
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.190
It was like part of a thread.

102
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.050
It was part of a conversation that was back and forth. And I was like,

103
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.310
but men aren't women. That was one of them that got me locked down again.

104
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.340
And then, well, yeah.

105
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.470
<v 0>Like literally like denying biology.</v>

106
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.590
<v 1>I mean, so what I think, I don't know, because again,</v>

107
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:14.510
no one's really explained anything to me.

108
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:18.920
No one from Twitter has communicated with me. No one said what I did wrong.

109
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.150
So I'm just guessing.

110
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.920
<v 0>They said, yeah, they said that you were told to delete the tweet,</v>

111
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.670
but you took a screenshot of it and you deleted it,

112
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.740
but then re posted the screenshot.

113
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.530
<v 1>That I didn't know that I wasn't allowed to do that when I did that.</v>

114
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:37.520
So I wasn't trying to be a Dick, like trying to be like, you.

115
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.640
I was so mad. I was like, are you serious?

116
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:45.500
Like I got banned for saying like men or women for asking these really basic

117
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:45.980
question.

118
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.600
<v 0>That was their justification to me as to why they banned you for the rest of</v>

119
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:55.160
your life. Well, just bananas. Yeah.

120
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.890
You're the,

121
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.360
there's the example that I bring up when I talk about this idea that you can

122
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:03.530
just ban people for saying things that are factually

123
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:08.090
correct. Maybe politically insensitive, you know,

124
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.170
dependent upon the current climate, but factually correct. Biologically,

125
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:17.060
correct? Scientifically. Correct. Maybe might say that it's not kind like,

126
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.460
but what is wrong with being,

127
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.680
are we really deciding that there's certain rules that we

128
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:28.940
want to apply in regards to progressive thinking

129
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.560
that bypass or supersede biology?

130
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.920
Is that what we're doing? Because when you say a man,

131
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.330
if you say a man is never a woman, that's what you said that.

132
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.940
<v 1>Aren't women, men, aren't women, aren't women. That's.</v>

133
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.460
<v 0>A fact and are not women.</v>

134
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.520
Now I believe in trans women,

135
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.770
I think there are people that have gender dysphoria.

136
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:56.750
And I think there are people that are happier if they identify as a woman

137
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.770
dressed as a woman are treated like a woman or are, or, you know,

138
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.870
use a woman's name and people describe them as a woman. It's,

139
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.250
it's obviously real right there. The obviously exists.

140
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.660
<v 1>I think, I mean, sure. Like I could buy that.</v>

141
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:13.760
There's such a thing as gender dysphoria.

142
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.600
So you have some kind of like mental condition or mental illness.

143
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.930
I'm not trying to be mean. I swear to God, like people get like triggered,

144
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:22.970
if you say like a mental illness, but I'm like,

145
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:25.370
you literally think you're something that you're not like,

146
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.910
you literally believe you're a male. You actually believe you're a woman.

147
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.430
That's a form of mental illness. Fine.

148
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:34.190
It doesn't mean you're a bad person and I don't care.

149
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.880
What if you want to dress in women's clothes. If you want to wear makeup,

150
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.670
if you want to get cosmetic surgeries, if you want to change your name,

151
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.850
go for it. Like, do whatever makes you feel better. That's fine.

152
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.710
But I'm not going to lie to comfort you or whomever else.

153
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:49.850
Um,

154
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.650
so I don't even agree that like gender dysphoria means there's such a thing as a

155
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:58.890
trans, like, to me, I'm still like, this concept doesn't make any sense.

156
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:02.070
What's a trans woman. Like, what does it mean? Do you have to be on hormones?

157
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:06.780
Do you have to have a bunch of surgeries? Do you have to have like a Neo vagina?

158
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.033
<v 0>We are because of like,</v>

159
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.540
it's very strict that you must accept that people are trans women,

160
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.490
but then like what defines a trans woman is completely open to

161
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.140
interpretation. It's it's the,

162
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.310
the person who decides whatever identity they identify with

163
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.930
male, female, whatever it is, it's up to them. It's up to them.

164
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:31.050
Whether they have surgery, it's up to them. Whether they take hormones,

165
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:34.350
it's up to them, whatever you can do, absolutely nothing.

166
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.580
You could have a full beard and say, you're a woman with a penis,

167
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.450
functional testicles, no problem at all. And you could say,

168
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:44.520
you're a woman and everyone has to agree.

169
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.170
<v 1>Speaking of which, um, the,</v>

170
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.190
the final tweet that I was actually banned for it.

171
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.980
So they locked me down for those two things. Right.

172
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.790
And then the final straw for them was one. I said, yeah,

173
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.620
it's him in reference to Jessica Yaniv, who was once Jonathan?

174
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.480
Um, if you recall,

175
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.890
he was the man in Vancouver who was going around to local estheticians and

176
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:12.150
asking them to give him a Brazilian bikini wax. Um,

177
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.210
and he is fully a man. I mean.

178
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.480
<v 0>Fully man, intact testicles, intact penis.</v>

179
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.680
<v 1>Yeah. Everything. I mean,</v>

180
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.210
and also a crazy person and a major creep,

181
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.160
like any he's messaging, these women on face Facebook. Um,

182
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.000
I think sometimes under like a fake photo and name.

183
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.150
So maybe with like a woman's photo and women's name, that's not him.

184
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.190
And then they would realize that he was a man,

185
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:40.200
I guess maybe if they talked to him on the phone or something like that.

186
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:43.080
And they'd be like, no, sorry. Like we don't offer this service to men.

187
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.470
And he would accuse him of transphobia and essentially try to extort money out

188
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:51.060
of them. And when that didn't work, I guess he decided he wanted to. I mean,

189
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.530
again, he's a crazy person.

190
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:55.830
So we can't take this as representative of very much other than the fact that

191
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:58.470
he's like a grifter and a crazy person, but you know,

192
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.380
to take them all to the human rights tribunal, um,

193
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.610
to say he's being discriminated against, but this is exactly,

194
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.670
exactly the perfect example of what happens.

195
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.420
If you just say anybody's a woman and you just have to accept it.

196
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.340
He has a penis, he has balls. He obviously looks like a man at that time,

197
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:20.490
he was still using his male name, um,

198
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.740
in various places like on Facebook,

199
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:27.060
some other places I think on Twitter at that time, he was, um,

200
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.510
maybe using both names. Um, but there was,

201
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.100
there was nothing to show me that he was a woman. So I said, yeah,

202
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:38.610
it's him. I figured out that it was him. Um,

203
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.170
and then I was permanently banned. Yeah. And that was in November.

204
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.330
And that was it. I appealed. They were like, Nope, sorry, hateful conduct again.

205
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:51.930
Didn't tell me what rule I broke 20 minutes after I was banned.

206
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.170
I was banned on Friday night. I was at the bar. It was like, what the?

207
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.850
I'm trying to have fun. Um, 20 minutes after I was mad pink news,

208
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.070
which is like a, like LGBT news site. Um,

209
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.200
they send articles saying Twitter has a new rule against mis-gendering

210
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:13.540
and deadnaming. And I was like, oh,

211
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.340
this is a really funny coincidence that this 20 minutes after I was banned

212
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.340
for some rule that they didn't specify,

213
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.730
but I can only assume was mis-gendering

214
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.720
mis-gendering a man. Who's a predator.

215
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.350
And who was still going by his male name and various places on the internet.

216
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.430
Whoops. So, I mean, he should have been banned too for mis-gendering himself.

217
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.310
<v 0>Good point. Thank you. It's it's just so weird.</v>

218
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.670
Cause it's the one area that, uh,

219
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.900
there's no room for. Oh, there's no room for interpretation.

220
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.640
There's no room for debate or nuance. It's just like,

221
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.780
you cannot mis-gender you cannot DET name. You cannot like.

222
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.910
<v 1>10 You're cruel and horrible. If you.</v>

223
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.820
<v 0>Do. Yeah. They're cruel and horrible to you.</v>

224
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.200
<v 1>Yeah. I mean the things that people aren't banned for on Twitter, I mean,</v>

225
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:09.850
I have been like subject to countless death threats. Like you should die.

226
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.930
You get the wall, you should go to the Gulag. Like people show, you know,

227
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:17.740
like people say horrible things to me online. I honestly don't care.

228
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.980
Like I'm like, it's the internet. People say horrible things.

229
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:25.300
I'm not gonna crumble or feel hoarder offended because somebody says some to me

230
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:26.134
on Twitter,

231
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.120
but you can't even say he to somebody who's

232
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:34.450
declared themselves a woman or you're essentially guilty of hate.

233
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.150
<v 0>Speech or they can call you stupid and.</v>

234
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.350
<v 1>Worse. Believe.</v>

235
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.400
<v 0>It or not. What's.</v>

236
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.560
<v 1>Worse. Like, I don't know.</v>

237
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.980
Kill yourself. You turf.
