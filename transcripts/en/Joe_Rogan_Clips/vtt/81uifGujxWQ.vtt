00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.680
<v 1>Do he to tell me a story once about how he had to take a? So he took a in the,</v>

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.920
in the bathtub and then he had to smush it with his foot to get it go down the

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.320
drain it all. Wouldn't go down. And.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.040
<v 2>That's when his two paths use the toilet dude.</v>

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.733
<v 0>He told me if do.</v>

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.520
<v 1>Logs, he used to leave. He used to leave logs and he come look at this.</v>

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.790
And he used in there. No, no, his, when he was really big, he couldn't.

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 2>Read his, couldn't pushed him front, front of toilet. So he.</v>

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.470
<v 1>Couldn't get all the way back there. So his drinking would lead. They would,</v>

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.190
they would land on the beach in front of the water.

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.150
They didn't land on the water. So they never really flushed. Oh my God, they,

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.070
you just see them. And.

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.420
<v 0>They're like, he sends me photos. Oh, all the time.</v>

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.340
Now that he texts, he's texting like a ninth grader. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, yo,

16
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.500
you see the monkey on this chick, everything. He sends me.

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.900
<v 2>Pictures, everything, dude, my in Columbia from all the,</v>

18
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:58.420
just the greasy oily Banuelos and Chi Romans. It, it was the first,

19
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.930
all many times a day. And it was this, it was just probably helps like soft.

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.730
Like it, it was like,

21
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.370
if you fed a puppy too many treats &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.

22
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.410
<v 1>Bro. When my, when Marsha was a puppy,</v>

23
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.330
one thing happens to some dogs is when their babies would try to eat their.

24
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170
And so he was and trying to eat it at the same time.

25
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:24.520
So he'd spin around circle and try to bite it as it was coming out of the hole,

26
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.120
he was trying to eat it right out of.

27
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.800
<v 0>The tap, right out his. Yeah. Uh, Joey told me one time that, uh,</v>

28
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:32.840
he was about in the shower and he was like, yeah, it was great.

29
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.920
I did it all the time. I was like, &lt;laugh&gt;, sit in the shower. And he's like,

30
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:40.920
yeah, he goes and he's like, if it's like a log, I'll just.

31
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.510
And then I just toss it to the toilet. And I was like, oh.

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.150
<v 2>No. &lt;laugh&gt;. And then he said.</v>

33
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.190
<v 0>He said.</v>

34
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.510
<v 1>That how much practices he ever doing that you must have missed before piece of</v>

35
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:58.910
paper, you go for the, can you miss? Oh, missing that.

36
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.160
<v 0>Missing.</v>

37
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.993
<v 2>Would be.</v>

38
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.660
<v 0>He said that I go, you did stop. That's so revolting. Did you? He goes,</v>

39
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.420
he's like I had to, &lt;laugh&gt; go. Why goes? My wife saw me do it one time.

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.940
And she said, no more.

41
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.740
<v 1>No more. My wife saw me. Do you imagine.</v>

42
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.860
<v 2>Some point God with.</v>

43
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.093
<v 0>In their hand? Like.</v>

44
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.460
<v 1>Oh my God, it's hilarious.</v>

45
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.380
<v 2>I didn't wanna leave in the, in the bathtub.</v>

46
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.090
<v 1>I farted once in the, in the, in the shower and I all over the place.</v>

47
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.850
You did &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, I wasn't feeling that good. And I,

48
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.330
I farted just all over the, all over the floor, but I have one of those,

49
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.490
you know, those handheld jam and I just had it down, rinsing it down.

50
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.250
I was in that shower for like a half an hour.

51
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.610
And then I squirt shampoo all over the bottom.

52
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.600
<v 0>Do it. This will clean it down.</v>

53
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.721
<v 1>Like it's a murder scene.</v>

54
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:50.960
And then I left and then I came back in just to get a fresh smell of it. Yeah.

55
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.000
Cause you know, you don't,

56
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.040
you all factory senses are weird because they don't detect smell.

57
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.760
They detect changes and smell. That's right.

58
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.080
That's why people in Pennsylvania who live near those cattle ranches. Oh,

59
00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:02.080
they don't smell anymore. They don't smell anymore. Right.

60
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.200
Cause if you go to like, my parents used to live in Wilbury, Pennsylvania. Nice.

61
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.280
Used to go to drive, drive to visit them from the city. Oh my God.

62
00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:11.840
There's a stretch that you drive. That's all just cattle ranches.

63
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.793
It just horrible.

64
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.000
<v 3>Smell. I'll be there on the pretty point tour.</v>

65
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.590
<v 1>It's great town. It's a great town. It smells like they'll be happy there.</v>

66
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:23.230
It smells like death and. Cause two things that are happening there.

67
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.750
Slaughter houses and and, and cow. Cow. Yeah.

68
00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:29.990
So you just get this like that methane stuff that they talk about.

69
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:34.750
Like being contributed to greenhouse houses. That's legit. 100%.

70
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.910
And apparently you can, they can do something about that.

71
00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.620
If they just add a certain, a seaweed to a cow's diet.

72
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.540
<v 3>You just, you just blew my mind.</v>

73
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.660
So smell is it's the change in smell that you notice. It's not the smell.

74
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.340
<v 1>Right? That's why people stink. Don't notice they stink.</v>

75
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.180
That's also why when you smoke a joint, you don't notice it,

76
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.260
but everybody else around you, they come, oh my God, you guys are high as. They,

77
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.230
they come in the room.

78
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.770
<v 3>Smell weed. Why Indian people can live at Indian people homes. Oh, you piece.</v>

79
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.770
<v 1>Bro. It's Curry. It's not bad. I had Indian food tonight.</v>

80
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.890
<v 3>I love Indian food. First time ever had, I never had Indian food.</v>

81
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.450
When I was in Russia, we got, uh,

82
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.810
lap answers from these strippers and they had all eaten Indian food. I'd never,

83
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.130
I'd never smelled Curry before smart on you. So I'd only grown up in up Florida.

84
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.400
We didn't have Indian restaurants and I lived in town and the smell was so

85
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:23.240
disgusting. I was like,

86
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:28.120
these are the most disgusting smelling women I've ever been with. Kasu probably,

87
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.640
probably 15 years later. I'm having dinner with my wife.

88
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.720
First time I ever had Indian food and they bring it while we walk in the

89
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:36.160
restaurant and I go, dude, smell, smell a.

90
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.990
I realize I must been Indian food. &lt;laugh&gt;.

91
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.350
<v 1>Oh my God's hilarious.</v>

92
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.830
<v 3>That's so that blows my mind.</v>

93
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.590
It's just the change in smell that you notice smell. That's why when you fart.

94
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.080
Yeah.

95
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.870
<v 1>Right. You.</v>

96
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.830
<v 3>Smell. Smell for a second.</v>

97
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.710
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But you're factory senses are designed to detect changes. You're uh.</v>

98
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.940
<v 3>Your body, your brain senses a signal to you. You that to be smell.</v>

99
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.420
And that's why it doesn't affect you as much as someone.

100
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.180
<v 1>Else's fault. No, there's something about no, you're ready.</v>

101
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.420
<v 3>This is blowing my mind right now. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:11.180
That's why people that smell don't know, they smell.

103
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.501
<v 1>Well.</v>

104
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.900
There's also a thing about your farts that smell good to you because there's

105
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:16.940
something in your body. It's like, there's something in your brain.

106
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.500
It triggers like that. You're having a relief. It's like, there's a buildup.

107
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:22.650
And then you smell a smell. And it's like, ah,

108
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.810
cause it signifies the relief that you know, that feeling when you to fart,

109
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:27.291
it's like, oh,

110
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:30.850
when you're in your car and you fart and then you start wafting the smell up.

111
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:32.690
You're like, oh, not bad. It's pretty.

112
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.850
<v 3>Already fart in a pillow and take it to the face. I love my farts.</v>

113
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.890
That's that's do you ever take it.

114
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.000
<v 1>Over here? Do you ever fart in your bed and you, your wife is in the bathroom.</v>

115
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.760
You're like, oh my God, I gotta get a pillow out. fans. Fans.

116
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.120
<v 3>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

117
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.640
That's when I go that's when I hold it down and I go, Hey, do me a favor.

118
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.560
You're a bad person. Check. Good.

119
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.120
<v 1>People, Tom and I are good people, Tom.</v>

120
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.560
<v 3>He not, I know.</v>

121
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.680
<v 0>What I do is I do more theatrical stuff. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.113

123
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.240

124
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.520
<v 0>I wanna hear your story. Well,</v>

125
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.480
I do things like I'll do like leg kicks as I fart or &lt;laugh&gt; I'll pull my legs

126
00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:14.600
back. Like I'm changing my diapers on a position. She doesn't like it at all.

127
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.670
She doesn't like it at all. Uh, my mom today, farted for like,

<v 1>One that your mom did when you caught her in the kitchen,</v>

130
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.703
then she turns and looks to you.

131
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.590
The look face was you need to take her to a doctor. Oh,

132
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.350
there might be something.

133
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.510

135
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.820

137
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.540
<v 3>I'll give her hundred 50 for that.</v>

138
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.620
<v 0>Made a deal. That it's it's pretty.</v>

139
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.500
<v 1>Impressive. Wow. Hold on. Let's hear this. Let's hear this. Let's hear this.</v>

140
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.460
Oh yeah. Go, go from the beginning. Hold on. Hold before you play.

141
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.220
<v 3>Were you just randomly filming her? You weren't thinking it was coming.</v>

142
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.570
<v 0>Were you? No, no. Here's what's happened. I, I said something about, I go, yeah.</v>

143
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.130
You think you have one and she didn't. She thought we were just like bantering.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.570
You think you have one fart? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I, and like, as a,

And you know the beauty of these things, I was like,

147
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.490
pull it out and I just hit the camera from the lock screen.

148
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.410
And then she didn't know. Let.

151
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.160
<v 1>Loop. The look on her face. When she turns around,</v>

152
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.920
