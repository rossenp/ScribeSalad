00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Did you see the video with, um,</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.240
I don't know what it came out. It's Adam Corolla sat down with Tucker Carlson.

3
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:10.360
Did you see that? What did they talk about? They talked about like California,

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.880
they talked about the homeless epidemic.

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:16.480
That's here in California and how I'm gonna try and quote right.

6
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:19.480
How he says the government just kind of looks at blind eye because we,

7
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.270
we are a city in a state that lives on permits and parking and licenses.

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.150
And, you know, we just want that money, you know? So it's like, if he,

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.470
he says something, you know, forest Memorial, forest lawn Memorial, mm-hmm,

10
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.190
&lt;affirmative&gt; like how you look across the way. And there's all these, you know,

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.230
um, immigrants and whatnot, like selling flowers, you know,

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.950
but like a woman driving without a license plate she'll get pulled over. And,

13
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.940
but all these other, it was kind of interesting. And I hate saying,

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.260
I hate being like, oh, Tucker Carlson, but it was just,

15
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:50.460
it was actually a really interesting interview. That's probably good point tech,

16
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.380
California would care about the homeless. If you could get money from,

17
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.820
from if we could get money from them. Sure. And all the way over here too,

18
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.460
I was just looking at all these tents and it's just so sad. It's so sad.

19
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.460
It's really sad. And it keeps growing. It keeps growing.

20
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.570
I live in west Hollywood and I remember like a couple years ago cuz you know,

21
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.090
it went from downtown and then downtown pushes 'em all out.

22
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:09.570
So they keep going west, keep going west some go to the beach,

23
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.850
some go to Santa Monica. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but now it's like,

24
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.650
I live in an area that, you know, six, seven years ago it was,

25
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.250
it was fine. But now it's like, even on the way to go get coffee this morning,

26
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.720
I walk everywhere. I go. It's like, I saw like three,

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.640
three homeless people just outside, just screaming at nothing. You know,

28
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.280
they're in tattered clothes and they're dirty. And they're, you know, I went,

29
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960
I used to work with a girl years ago, um,

30
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.520
at a restaurant when I waited tables and she's now homeless and she's like out

31
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.670
of her mind and I feel bad. Would she always have mind? No, no. She, her,

32
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.310
you know, her name was Lodis you know,

33
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.470
she did yoga and now what happened? I don't know. I don't know.

34
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:53.710
You just tried to talk to her. I did. When it was like,

35
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.670
I got to watch the progression of the crazy, the illness. Yes.

36
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.350
So I would see her every now and then I was like, Hey, what's going on?

37
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.710
Cuz like back when the recession happened, you know, we were rating.

38
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.700
So we bounced from job to job because one day we'd go to work and there'd be

39
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.220
chains on the door cause they couldn't pay us.

40
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.180
So we had this little kind of group that we would go apply together at different

41
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:16.820
jobs. And then I started seeing her out on the street,

42
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.740
just walking around and I was like, Hey, what's going on?

43
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.340
Hope you hope you're doing well, da, da, da, da.

44
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.860
And she just kind of never let me know how she was really doing.

45
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.850
And then a couple years would go by and I'd see her. And I'm like,

46
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.130
she looks a little out of it and I would say hi to her and she wouldn't respond.

47
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.650
And then now it's full on,

48
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:35.730
like teeth are missing and oh running down the street crying.

49
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.290
And it just breaks my heart cuz it's like, I don't know what to do.

50
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.930
And I don't know if she would be willing or uh, how tight were you with her?

51
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.880
I mean had her phone to number? No, no, no, no I don't. I mean,

52
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:47.600
I don't even know she has a phone. I can't. Right.

53
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.640
But did you at one point in time ever phone? I think. Yeah. And it's like,

54
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:52.840
it's just that like inner guilt and you're just like, God,

55
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.640
how did it get so bad? She had an apartment, you know,

56
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.560
I think her parents passed away and that might have like set her, you know,

57
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.840
spiraling. But yeah,

58
00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:03.920
I remember just like doing a spot at the laugh factory one night and walking

59
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.840
outside and you know how everyone, they just keep everyone outside.

60
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.120
Like you do &lt;laugh&gt; and,

61
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.600
and she just like barreled through everybody,

62
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:16.800
just screaming nonsense and like like teeth missing and oh, it's just sad.

63
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.840
It's just really, really sad.

64
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:21.550
And then I'm at the Jim working out and I'll see her like down there, you know,

65
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.030
with her garbage and everything and yeah, she doesn't,

66
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.590
it's just sad. It's it's.

67
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.150
<v 1>A lost cause when you knew her,</v>

68
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.230
she didn't seem like she had any mental health issues.

69
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.950
<v 0>No, really? No. I mean she would talk, she would do yoga. I mean,</v>

70
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.860
I remember her, um, her new always Lotti her,

71
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:42.060
well, her name was Lotus harmony,

72
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.140
which I don't know if that's a real name &lt;laugh&gt; but at the time, um,

73
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.500
that's how I knew her. She was always just this sweet lady, you know,

74
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.420
just beautiful skin, beautiful smile, always in a good mood. When she got mad,

75
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:58.900
you were like, oh man, Lotus is. You know?

76
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.730
Cuz she was always so friendly. Yeah. And then now you're just like.

77
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.450
And I, you know, I just want, I don't know what to do. I,

78
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.450
I would love to help her because it just breaks my heart.

79
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.170
Homeless people break my heart. But female homelessness really,

80
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.090
really is sad for me.

81
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.530
<v 1>Yeah. Because we're a sexist.</v>

82
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.280
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

83
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.240
<v 1>Well, it's, I feel the.</v>

84
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.000
<v 0>Same way, you know, it's just like, like someone's daughter, someone's wife,</v>

85
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.880
someone's just out there, you know,

86
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.800
vulnerable to the elements and predators and it's just, yeah, it breaks my.

87
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.640
<v 1>Heart. No, it's awful. But I,</v>

88
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.720
I think most of what you're seeing with homeless people is people that are

89
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:38.840
severely mentally ill.

90
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.910
So you gotta wonder what caused maybe she was on medication and her yeah. Her,

91
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.910
you know, her insurance ran out. Yeah.

92
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.030
<v 0>She couldn't full on joker. Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.550
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Dude. That's real. It is real. It's real.</v>

94
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:54.630
There's a lot of people out there with giant mental health issues. Yeah.

95
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.470
<v 0>I, I mean, I, I, um, I know, I know several people who,</v>

96
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.820
you know, have anxiety, a, a guy that I used to date is like, you know,

97
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:08.260
we dated for a long time, but it's like, if he didn't have his, um, his,

98
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.500
uh anti-anxiety. Yeah. Like, and he got off that,

99
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.380
I mean he would full on have a panic attack and that would get dirty.

100
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.860
And I had to witness that, which was insane. Yeah. People that.

101
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.930
<v 1>Lose it because of their, if their medication. Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.290
That's a sad situation because you're like,

103
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.850
you're always gonna be tethered to this thing that keeps,

104
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:28.684
keeps saying could worry by.

105
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.890
<v 0>Used it twice today. Did I? Yeah. You said it earlier, before we started tether.</v>

106
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:32.370
They probably use.

107
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.203
<v 1>It all today. Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.530
<v 0>I just hope it works. Tether Tuesday, hashtag tether Tuesday. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

109
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.611
<v 1>It's you know,</v>

110
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:43.360
like what happens to them if the coronavirus hits and get lock the doors for six

111
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:43.820
months.

112
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.480
<v 0>And you just become a agoraphobic and mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; lose your.</v>

113
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.840
<v 1>Well, we were talking about this the other day,</v>

114
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:53.360
that most of what this is all happened from the Reagan administration,

115
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.920
during the Reagan administration,

116
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.640
they changed the standards of what it means to be mentally ill.

117
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.120
And they just released people from asylum.

118
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.040
Cause they didn't wanna pay for it all mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

119
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.760
And you know that look,

120
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.760
if LA is LA is a city of 20 plus million

121
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.320
people, which is as many people in LA, as I think is in all of Australia.

122
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.310
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so think about that.

123
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:21.390
Think about the amount of money and that they can't make asylums here.

124
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.830
Think about how many abandoned buildings there are. Think about how much money,

125
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.230
how much money would it cost.

126
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.950
There's currently somewhere in the neighborhood of 70,000 homeless people. Yeah.

127
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:32.310
They said.

128
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.790
<v 0>There was some statistic that said there's more empty apartments in this town</v>

129
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.060
than the homeless people.

130
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.820
<v 1>The thing is though that those folks don't just need a place cuz they'll that</v>

131
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:45.620
place. Yeah. They rehabilitation punch holes in the wall and in there and stuff.

132
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.340
Smear it. Yeah. They're crazy. Yeah. They,

133
00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:50.620
what they need is help mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they need medication and they

134
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:54.860
need counseling and they need, I mean, and some people I don't, I mean,

135
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.180
I'm not a mental health expert.

136
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.250
I don't some of 'em you might not be able to do anything too. Some, some,

137
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.490
some are so gone far gone might not. And also they get so filled with despair.

138
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.650
Yeah. I knew a bunch of guys that were homeless back from my pool hall days.

139
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:09.370
There was a bunch of guys that would hang around the pool hall.

140
00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:11.650
They would even sleep on the floor. And you know,

141
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.690
I knew guys that'd try to sleep in people's couches.

142
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:15.970
They'd sleep at the bus stops.

143
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.560
And then they'd come to the pool hall and try to hustle up enough money to get

144
00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:21.000
some drugs. And it was,

145
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.520
they were stuck in this place where they could never get past where they were.

146
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.600
They were just in a rut and they could never get out of it. And it was just,

147
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.840
it's heartbreaking. Yeah. Despair so much despair. Cause.

148
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.040
<v 0>You're just like what happened? The O for instance, the other day,</v>

149
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:42.950
I'm walking down Santa Monica Boulevard over by, um, Barney's Beery.

150
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.350
And I just hear up and I look over and this kid's like had to

151
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.270
be 22, 23 years old. And I was like, what happened?

152
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:53.830
Where are your.

153
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.310
<v 1>Parents? One too many auditions blew a few.</v>

154
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.460
<v 0>Yeah. Just snapped. I, if I hear no one more time. No.</v>

155
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.460
<v 1>I know IA dropped him and he's just out there randomly dropped.</v>

156
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.180
<v 0>Him. &lt;laugh&gt; I'll show you Hollywood reporter you.</v>

157
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.421
<v 1>God.</v>

158
00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:13.580
There are people though that you meet in this town where you meet 'em early in

159
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:16.220
their journey. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they still have hope.

160
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.300
Like it's not worked out yet, but it's gonna, I'm gonna make it.

161
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.650
And then you run in, in comics.

162
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.770
<v 0>Oh, I mean, that's the thing. I think it's so relatable in our field as well.</v>

163
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.050
Cuz you, you know those people. Yeah. We do know those people. I, I,

164
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.650
I wanna say I almost was one of those people. Were you? Oh yeah. When,

165
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.050
what time? I mean.

166
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.010
<v 1>Gimme a time where it like.</v>

167
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.320
<v 0>2002 And then in</v>

168
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:44.760
2005 and then really 2000. Yeah. I.

169
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.400
<v 1>Mean there were, I didn't meet you until when 2007 ish. I wanna.</v>

170
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.040
<v 0>Say. Yeah. I think I met you at, um,</v>

171
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.840
the ice house when we were podcasting out there. That's and then,

172
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.640
and then when you came back to the store, that.

173
00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.473
<v 1>Was like 14.</v>

174
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.080
<v 0>2014. Yeah. That's when I saw you again. And even then it was like, you know,</v>

175
00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:04.760
I'm making it work. And I remember you looked at me and you go,

176
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:08.600
you're the weirdest gay guy I've ever met. And I was like. Yeah.

177
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.160
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; why did I say that? I don't know. You were probably all really high.</v>

178
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.070
Yeah, probably. So probably didn't know what I was saying when I was saying it.

179
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:16.750
Yeah. But I mean.

180
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.270
<v 0>I feel like that's, you know,</v>

181
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.110
you get through that struggle and you get through the,

182
00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:23.630
the years of being hungry in the years of like, can I pay my rent this year?

183
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:28.310
And you do whatever you can to just scrounge everything up and, and do it.

184
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.230
<v 1>So you had those moments where you like, this might not work out.</v>

185
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.390
I might go crazy. Mm.

186
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.660
<v 0>Or what's my other option. Move home</v>

187
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.820
or suicide. Yeah. I mean, this sounds hard.

188
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.580
It's.

189
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.780
<v 1>Very hard. Well, it's also, you see so many people that are doing well, right?</v>

190
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.340
Like it seems so far out of reach,

191
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.970
like when you're broke and you see some guy driving by a Mercedes convertible,

192
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.490
you're like, you know, you see these people going into those big,

193
00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:03.810
high rises off of Los enga, you know, Dormin there and.

194
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.290
<v 0>Everything, but no one lives there, no one lives there. Oh,</v>

195
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.210
no one can afford that. Are you kidding me? Who's talking about, I mean,

196
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:12.410
there's maybe like what I've heard is that the,

197
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.970
they build those and then the, um, Saudis one,

198
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.040
their kids to come to school here and get American education.

199
00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:21.080
So they just buy 'em for 'em. But nobody, have you done.

200
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.120
<v 1>Any research on this or.</v>

201
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.120
<v 0>Is this just I've overheard some things &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>
