00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It is the ultimate who knows question,</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.730
but God, I wish more people from S four would come forth.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.810
If Bob really did work with all those people and they really were breathed the

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.070
same way he was. If we could get more of those people to talk,

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.430
that would be utterly fascinating. Well.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.350
<v 1>Your show has a big reach. So maybe this time somebody will come forward.</v>

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.190
Did anybody.

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.240
<v 0>Ever reach out to you that claim to also have worked with Bob a.</v>

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.920
<v 1>Bunch? Yeah. And, and do verify any of them. They could not be verified.</v>

10
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.150
And in fact, I think they were lying.

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.870
<v 2>To me. Right.</v>

12
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.290
And bombs shoots people down all the time so that guy's standing on UFO stage

13
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.770
line. I mean, you know, no, he hasn't even,

14
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.770
he was hoping one other employee would. Um, however,

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.470
I have had people that work at area 51 confirm parts

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.400
of Bob story.

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.560
One in particular saw him coming off the jet where he says he saw him

18
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.390
coming off. The Janet flights. I said,

19
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:04.250
will you go on record with me that you met Bob there on the tarmac? No,

20
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.500
Y everything we did, there was confidential.

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.370
We couldn't even tell our wives, why would I go on record with you? And if.

22
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.180
<v 0>He did go on record, he'd probably get harassed or arrested, or.</v>

23
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.740
<v 2>He can't even tell you what he ate for lunch out there. You know that. So,</v>

24
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.860
and one of the guys, I was real excited to talk with just recently passed away.

25
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:28.250
He actually started the bar that was at area 51.

26
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.650
So everybody told the bartender stuff. He started as a,

27
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.400
as a flower fund because no one would send flowers to wives when people died out

28
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:39.380
there. But my point is, people have come forward to George. To me,

29
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.180
a lot of people are lying, but it adds up over time, man, more than.

30
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.200
<v 1>Two dozen people who have come to me with bits and pieces of the story who had</v>

31
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.710
worked out at area 51 that I confirmed were out there. Uh,

32
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.480
security people who had seen, uh, uh, disc, uh, under a tarp in a,

33
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.620
in a hangar, um, different people had worked there at different times, 50,

34
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:04.940
60 seventies and eighties who had little pieces of the story not to confirm Bob.

35
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.930
And then there was one that I pursued.

36
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.640
I don't know if you want to keep going on this, but I had pursued this guy.

37
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.800
I was trying to find in the early nineties,

38
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.910
people who were in a position to know about what goes on out there.

39
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:20.480
And I found one and he had, he had been active in the nuclear weapons program.

40
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.950
He had worked for EG and G.

41
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.170
He had a EG and G had the contract to manage Arie 51 from the beginning all the

42
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:29.060
way through the first 30 or 40 years of it.

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.310
And so I started basically stalking the guy.

44
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.450
One of his sons was a state Senator, and he had told me,

45
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:40.430
he confided to me that you got to ask my dad about UFOs and aliens. And, uh,

46
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.840
another son had been an FBI agent. So I stocked the guy, introduced myself.

47
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.380
There were a couple of public events where I would just show up.

48
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.490
And he finally got, uh, competent enough in me to invite me to his home.

49
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.330
And he started gets out these scrapbooks and he's shown me these stories and

50
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.210
clippings and photos from the nuclear weapons program.

51
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.080
And I'm watching them take a notes and stuff.

52
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.820
And suddenly he closes the book and he goes,

53
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.270
you're not here to talk about this nuclear weapons. Are you? I said, no,

54
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.690
not really. And his wife walks in and she says, uh, oh,

55
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.310
you're not going to tell him that stuff. Are you.

56
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.970
And then he started telling me, then over the course of two years,

57
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.960
I would meet with him, have a cup of coffee somewhere. I couldn't take notes.

58
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.050
I couldn't record anything. But he told me the story. Now,

59
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:26.260
this guy actually is someone that you've had referenced to on your show.

60
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.520
Remember any Jacobson or book a battery fish? Yeah, well, it's the same guy,

61
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.610
but the story that he told me was different than what he told her.

62
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.200
He said that they, uh,

63
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.520
eventually told me that they had a live alien out there that I could not go

64
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:44.110
public with us until after he died, that they, um, that they had craft,

65
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.040
that it was in a special spot. Uh, originally was at Indian Springs,

66
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.630
which is now Creech air force base.

67
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.380
And then it was moved to area 51 when 51 became active.

68
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.230
And then there was a very small group that tried to analyze this stuff.

69
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.440
They didn't know where it was from. They didn't know how we obtained it.

70
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.350
He said this thing was alive. And, um,

71
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.940
and that they eventually were able to communicate with us and told me that he

72
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:10.270
was going to make a videotape and he was going to make it available so that

73
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.680
after he died, I could have it. Well, suddenly two or three years later,

74
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.300
he totally changes his story.

75
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.970
What had happened was there was a congressional investigator.

76
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.290
His name was Richard D'Amato and he worked for Senator Robert Byrd and he

77
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.540
oversaw black budget projects.

78
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.460
And he got onto this UFO story from Whitley Strieber. And so he was assigned,

79
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.740
find out what the deal is. So he went around the country,

80
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.720
talk to different researchers and came to me and wanted to know about area 51.

81
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:41.260
And Lasar. So I told them a story and I told him about this guy,

82
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.090
and he got permission for this guy to violate his security

83
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.440
oath and talk to him about it.

84
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.850
And they had multiple conversations and they went to the founders of EG and G

85
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:54.610
the company and, and, uh, it became a dead end.

86
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.570
But after that congressional inquiry, this guy completely changed his tune.

87
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.800
So he made up this story, which is the one that you heard from Annie Jacobson,

88
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:07.390
that what crashed at Roswell was a, a Russian technology, uh,

89
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.550
Nazi technology flown by the Russians containing a little concentration

90
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.790
camp victims. Who'd been experimented on by Dr. Mengele,

91
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.680
completely ridiculous, you know, story. Um, but I think he got scared.

92
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.940
He was a real guy in a real position to know, and, um,

93
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.490
had shared with his family, some of this information.

94
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.960
I think the story that he told me, um, was legit. Um,

95
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.690
but if the made the tape, which I think he did, I didn't get it.

96
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.060
<v 0>How much time has been wasted talking about. Yeah. And this subject,</v>

97
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.860
oh, central.

98
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.810
<v 3>Centuries. That's part of the problem. Isn't it? People.</v>

99
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.400
<v 2>Just make up and the more fanciful and ridiculous,</v>

100
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.380
um, the bad, the better. Unfortunately,

101
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:55.560
people pay more to hear that and consume.

102
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.250
<v 1>It. I had an operation one time after the Lasar thing,</v>

103
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.270
somebody who was targeting me and he had other people helping him that convince

104
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.410
me that he had worked out there with live aliens and I'm getting letters from

105
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:09.980
his supposedly written by his neighbors. Hey, you got to check this guy out,

106
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:11.990
doctor I'll just say X. Uh,

107
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.840
he was taken away by armed security in the middle of the night.

108
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.680
I think he has something to do with aliens. And from out of the blue,

109
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.630
then suddenly I am at a planetarium event and I'm gonna speak about UFO's

110
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.130
summit event at this community college. And the guy shows up in a men's room.

111
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.270
Hey, uh, my name is Dr. X standing there at the urinal.

112
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.750
You're not doing a story about me or you, so no. Who are you? What?

113
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.880
This was a concerted effort to get me to believe that he had worked out there

114
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.970
and went on for a couple of years. And of course it was complete.

115
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.940
When I finally did dig into his background,

116
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.330
I was able to document where he had worked and what he'd been doing through most

117
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:53.150
of his life. And it was just like a fantasy role-playing thing.

118
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.110
At least I hope it was.
