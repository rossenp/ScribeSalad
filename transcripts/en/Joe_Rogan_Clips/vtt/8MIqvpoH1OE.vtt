WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.070
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, you know, so, oh yeah. I've been,</v>

2
00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:07.220
I've actually been shadowing mindful like Mike Tyson for like the last, um,

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.430
I'm good friends with, uh, with his manager, Rob, Rob Hickman.

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.000
And that's just the stuff that they're doing at Tyson ranch man is it's pretty

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.140
cool. It's really cool, right? Yeah. They're,

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.370
they're bringing medicine to the world. So my I've been on his podcast.

7
00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:22.580
He's always talked about the toad. I was like, all right.

8
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:25.190
And then also I became good friends with, I call him uncle Mike man.

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.010
Cause he's just, you know, he scares me a lot and every time he sees me,

10
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.420
he's all, you know, he he'll compliment,

11
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.840
but then he'll school me at the same time. So he always talked about the total.

12
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.570
I'm just like, well, let's, let's do it. Then Mike, let's do it, onco mine.

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.080
So he's like, man, dude, you share you. I'm like, yeah, man,

14
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.360
you've been talking about her for a minute. So, you know,

15
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.700
so we go out and we go on this, uh, uh, you know,

16
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.760
they have this whole rural nice set of Melwood rituals or whatnot.

17
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:51.290
And we go out to a 20, which is an island off the, off the Caribbean. We have a,

18
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.460
our Africa what they're called, uh, the person that, uh, Sharman. Yeah. Sharman,

19
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:59.510
I'm sorry. And he's out there in the, you know, Mike goes first. So Mike,

20
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.500
imagine this is Mike Tyson does. And you know, Mike Tyson's Mike Tyson is he's,

21
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.140
he's doing it. He's he's going, he's going a bit crazy, man.

22
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.410
Because a lot of what that, what that does is it brings out you a lot of your,

23
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.080
as you say, you know, you open up the saves, a lot of your demons,

24
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.380
a lot of things that you've probably been holding onto for a minute.

25
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.340
So I'm seeing, I'm seeing Mike over here, twist and turning and kind of,

26
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.970
you know, talk about a lot. I don't want to share that stuff, but you know,

27
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:26.960
talk about a lot, a lot of it's Passman this me, as you said, he's an idol,

28
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.100
he's a legend. You know, that's the way I look at my two I'm over here, here,

29
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:33.140
you know, I'm just, I'm almost like tripping now,

30
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.230
but at the same time and treat no,

31
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:41.030
because so then I go up and I do it. And the Amanda took me to,

32
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.000
uh, especially out of retirement here, man. Like I, I would,

33
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.190
I almost kind of somewhat wanted answers.

34
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.920
I was hoping that it would give me okay, man, this is like the path of what not.

35
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.760
And uh, it took me, it took me to like,

36
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.470
it took me to my mom's like your mom's like first love man. You know?

37
00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:00.230
And it showed me like in a store almost like in a movie,

38
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.640
you know how I was born, how my mom had me, how, uh, how,

39
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.190
by the time I was eight years old, like I had my sister.

40
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.460
So it was no longer the youngest, how my mom kind of like, you know,

41
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.340
and not fairness, kind of somewhat pushed to the side,

42
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.020
leaving home at the age of 17 in and substituting.

43
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:22.850
My mom's love for self-fulfillment wrestling, uh,

44
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.890
mixed martial arts. And the, it brought me back to a little kid when I was, uh,

45
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.850
maybe four or five when I would cry to my mom. Cause I remember as a kid,

46
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.870
we would go, uh, we would go from LA to New Mexico, like in greyhounds.

47
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.410
I remember stopping at McDonald's and things like that. But to me, you know,

48
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.060
as a kid, you don't know you're poor,

49
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.500
but what that did is that brought me back to the person that created me.

50
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.000
That brought me back to my mom's love, man. So it like,

51
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.260
it like resurrected something in me and I was crying.

52
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:53.660
I was asking for life for a given us I'll speak in Spanish.

53
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.860
[inaudible] forgive me. It was something, uh,

54
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.520
it was something scary in some ways, because it does, it takes you out of your,

55
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.590
your body. Like it's, it's,

56
00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:08.110
it's almost like you're in judgment day and you're the one that's being

57
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:09.850
convicted. And you're the judge.

58
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.960
<v 1>Too. I feel like, um, the athlete thing was like, okay,</v>

59
00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:15.840
they're super athletes and they don't have any symptoms. Right.

60
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.430
But we're not super athletes. Okay.

61
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.750
But then Idris Elba is just a really good shape in shape actor. Well,

62
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:25.280
he seems okay with Tom Hanks is an older gentlemen who doesn't live there,

63
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.550
he's in great shape. And he got through it. What is, you know,

64
00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.790
and then you find out the flu numbers and they, but it's not the flu. Okay.

65
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.770
Okay. It's not the flu. It's not the flu.

66
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.040
<v 2>You know, science is new religion, bro. Well.</v>

67
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.590
<v 0>Think about, is, think about it though. No.</v>

68
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.350
<v 1>But it's money. Money. I really believe this. I really believe it.</v>

69
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.580
<v 0>Same with the Monday morning,</v>

70
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.960
but like quarterback and think about like the way religion operated in the past,

71
00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:51.990
right? The second you said anything against the church, they shame you.

72
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:55.230
They ostracize you. Who the are you? How could you say these things?

73
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:56.300
They put you in your little box,

74
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.770
whether you get ex-communicated any of us were like,

75
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.490
you sure it really kills everyone, right? Like, are you sure? Are you sure?

76
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:06.540
It's that contingency? What the is Fowchee? Come out of the Keebler elf house,

77
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.900
tell them what's going on. They've just rail at you nonstop.

78
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.830
And the second and the second you say a single thing you are,

79
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:17.520
what did they label you? As I think Amazon even like took out a book, a heretic,

80
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.210
right?

81
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.890
<v 1>Wasn't it, is that what the term is?</v>

82
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.610
<v 0>I think you were blasphemy or something. One of these things, right?</v>

83
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.630
And then all of a sudden this information starts to come out where it's like,

84
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:30.210
okay, it's not that bad. The curve is kind of flattening.

85
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.260
Now the comes out today. That was, it basically said, if you're asymptomatic,

86
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.380
you can't transfer it as easily as they thought it's almost impossible.

87
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.590
<v 1>Right? So all that worry that we were about kids giving it to the grandmothers.</v>

88
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.250
They're not gonna do. That.

89
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.530
<v 0>Was the only reason why stores are shut down.</v>

90
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.420
The only reason why comedy clubs shut down restaurants.

91
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:47.970
Because if you're asymptomatic, you pass on. Now we know you're not.

92
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:50.730
If you have a cough, if you're sneezing, if you got the flu, stay the home.

93
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.590
That's it. Crank it open. Let's go crank.

94
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.660
<v 1>It open. Yeah. Same all you have to wait mass.</v>

95
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.090
No New Jersey just said they want another a month for.

96
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.310
<v 0>So this is where we get into like the.</v>

97
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.540
<v 1>More my moon. But you don't think this is just people trying to get reelected.</v>

98
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.460
Um, it could be,

99
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.880
but it could be people who are scared of people dying on their watch because.

100
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.600
<v 0>Now it's not the economy that gets reelected. It's people hang on your watch.</v>

101
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.710
<v 1>Well, if someone comes along and says, the reason why X amount of people died,</v>

102
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.820
it could have been much less.

103
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.260
If you had just done the right thing and kept those people safe and kept

104
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:26.520
everything closed for another month. You in your career,

105
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.850
you were known for lifting large amounts of weight too.

106
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.280
<v 3>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like I was saying, you know,</v>

107
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.490
I started power lifting when I was in high school. You know, I had the,

108
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.240
like the gift of strength, you know, I was pretty strong in high school,

109
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.650
you know, my all throughout my college days. And uh, you know,

110
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.300
it was just something that I, I think I was kind of born with it a little bit,

111
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.090
you know? Cause, uh, you don't just start lifting heavy weights like that.

112
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:54.080
All of a sudden, you know, you have to have a, like I said,

113
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.830
you have to have some kind of natural talent for it.

114
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.390
<v 1>Well,</v>

115
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.570
there are some crazy photos of you during the Mr. Olympia days when you were a

116
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:02.950
police officer, is that you look at that. Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.400
<v 3>That's that's me in the ninth grade on the left. And that's me wearing, uh,</v>

118
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.760
what.

119
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.880
<v 1>Happened to your arm and a left? You got a cast on, yeah bro. somebody out.</v>

120
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.760
I know how.

121
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.060
<v 3>To sell all playing football. And uh,</v>

122
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.540
I think I fell on my wrist or something and cracked it or something.

123
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.000
And that's me winning the uh,

124
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.150
Mr. Universe turning pro in the middle.

125
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.790
And that's me winning the 9 99 Mr. Olympia for right there. Wow.

126
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.180
<v 1>You were big. Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.860
<v 3>I was kinda big. Well, you know,</v>

128
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:41.380
I got a lot bigger than that. That was my second Olympia.

129
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:45.790
I only weighed about 2 55. There what's the biggest he ever got. I was 2 95,

130
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.560
my seventh one.

131
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.500
So I put on a little bit more weight as I got on up there. But.

132
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.590
<v 1>Is it one of those things where you just kind of have to keep up with everybody</v>

133
00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:58.560
else and everybody just keeps getting bigger?

134
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.730
<v 3>No, it was that thing when I was trying to distance myself from everybody else.</v>

135
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.390
So I kept getting bigger and bigger, so nobody would catch up with me

136
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.690
and what a lot of people don't understand is you see me big up there like that,

137
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:16.900
but you know, it took a long time for me to get there. Hmm, no,

138
00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:18.100
that doesn't happen overnight.

139
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.750
I put on about five pounds of muscle between five and 10 pounds of muscle a

140
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:26.320
year. And that came from all that, you know, that heavy lifting,

141
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.460
a lot of eating, a lot of eating.

142
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.190
<v 1>A standard meal for you. I.</v>

143
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.680
<v 4>Mean, it.</v>

144
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.310
<v 3>Wasn't a lot to me, you know, but if, if somebody, you know,</v>

145
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.820
normally try to eat, it probably be a lot. So I eat probably like, uh,

146
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.740
a pound of chicken, uh, grill breasts, you know,

147
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:51.490
with a half a cup of rice. That was a normal meal. Yeah.

148
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.210
That was how many of those did you have a day? I had know about six meals a day.

149
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.380
You know, it's kind kinda hard to eat like that, you know?

150
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.550
So I would have to wake up in the middle of the night to eat and go back to

151
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:06.970
sleep. Yeah, no, no,

152
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:08.590
that'd.

153
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.290
<v 1>Be annoying. You're tired and sleeping and gotta wake up.</v>

154
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.640
<v 3>No, you kind of get used to it when you eat like that,</v>

155
00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:19.600
you get hungry every three hours. Oh really? Yeah. Every two to three hours.

156
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:23.170
You're hungry. Cause I'm not, I'm not eating a lot of fat, you know,

157
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.690
it's lean and I'm not eating a lot of carbs. So it's just, it's,

158
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.080
it's a little, a little bit of food at a time. For me, it was.

159
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.030
<v 1>These new laws that they've passed recently where the government can just look</v>

160
00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:40.090
into your internet, searching with no warrant whatsoever.

161
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:43.720
This was something that I don't know if you know about this part of the Patriot

162
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:46.750
act that, um, this was one of the things that was,

163
00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:50.320
people were furious at Senator Sanders because Bernie Sanders didn't,

164
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.000
he wasn't there. He didn't show up for the vote.

165
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.760
And if he had shown up and voted the other way, it wouldn't have, why did.

166
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 2>He show up? He won't comment. Oh wow. He won't.</v>

167
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.430
<v 1>He's been reached out for, uh, to comment on it. He won't comment on it,</v>

168
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.540
but it's very disheartening.

169
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.550
And a lot of people who are progressives are furious at them and they,

170
00:09:06.551 --> 00:09:07.384
they feel very,

171
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.490
very betrayed by this because now no one even knows like Mo you didn't know.

172
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:12.780
Right? Most people don't even know. Well,

173
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:16.320
the government can now look at all your dirty little searches.

174
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.380
<v 5>Care about that though. Like, I bet it's a slippery slope, right?</v>

175
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.430
Is that the fear?

176
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.790
<v 1>Well, here's the fear. The government is just people, you know,</v>

177
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:27.770
I don't want any, I don't,

178
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.780
I don't think like I should be able to just go look in a Jamie search, like a,

179
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:36.170
just for whatever reason I know Jay Jamie's at home. What if I have some code?

180
00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:39.920
I can go, just look, what was Jamie looking at? What is, what are you searching.

181
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.070
<v 0>For? That's that's creepy, right? It's creepy. Like.</v>

182
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.560
<v 1>Privacy is privacy. It's important. You should be,</v>

183
00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:48.710
should be able to reveal what you want to reveal. And if the government,

184
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:51.020
which is just a bunch of people can peer into your life,

185
00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:54.590
but you can't peer into their life. It sets up abuse. It's the same.

186
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.890
It's the same, it's power. It's the same thing you see with cops, right?

187
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:01.160
All this that you see with cops, for sure racism is involved,

188
00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:04.100
but you know what else is involved? Power. When you see that,

189
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.090
that old man get thrown to the ground. The one that Trump said is faking it.

190
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.760
That bashed his head. Yeah. Bleeding out of his head.

191
00:10:10.761 --> 00:10:14.540
And Trump's like very good actor, by the way. I mean, that's what Trump said.

192
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.160
He said that it seemed to have fallen too easily, but yeah, he's dead.

193
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.540
He's an old man. Oh God. The fact that he said that, that it's, this might,

194
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.450
he might be in tifo like what all.

195
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.960
<v 5>Of these conspiracy theories out there as an actor. I must say,</v>

196
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.540
if any of these people are conspiracy guys,

197
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.820
they're they they're Daniel Day Lewis.

198
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.500
<v 1>Like they are great.</v>

199
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.300
<v 5>Actors. Like, you know,</v>

200
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:41.960
like certain times I even send like dumb YouTube videos of, uh,

201
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.650
there's a funny YouTube video of, um, uh, uh,

202
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.110
his girlfriend leading his two K NBA account. And he just destroyed.

203
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.430
You can tell it took every thing for him. Like not to like hit her or like,

204
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:58.640
whatever. Right. He just, he was just destroyed. He was crying.

205
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.520
And then some of my buddies like, oh, I don't know, man. That's fake dude.

206
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:06.020
I was like, yo, that guy, that guy is a, uh, Emmy award,

207
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.790
Oscar winning actor. That is fake. Cause that is not easy to do. No.

208
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.030
<v 1>People think everything is fake. You think so many things are fake.</v>

209
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.000
So many people have sent me things. So you think this is fake? And I'm like,

210
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.810
oh Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah. Some things are vague. Yeah.

211
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.980
That old man falling the way he did and bouncing his head off the concrete in

212
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:28.790
the middle of a huge protest. Yeah. That was real dude. Yeah. That's real.

213
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:31.700
That's what happens when you push an old man? I was like 30 years.

214
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.410
<v 6>Ago. And what happened was we were</v>

215
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.410
in an off-campus apartment and I kept putting on to tell a story.

216
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.280
I'm gonna tell the quick version, uh, tell the overs.

217
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.720
No two of my buddies left to go upstairs.

218
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.690
It was one of those, you know, those old Boston,

219
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.910
it looked almost like a three family house,

220
00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:55.420
but wasn't was one of those big ones that has all apartments in it. Right?

221
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.340
So they left the party.

222
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:02.110
We were on in the first floor and then they went upstairs and like

223
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:05.830
20 minutes, they came back. One of my buddy's shoulders was separated.

224
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.900
The other guy flat lip. And he had a flat top to,

225
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.650
or maybe had this big gash coming right down here and blood coming down his

226
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:13.780
face. And we were like, what.

227
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.960
<v 0>The happened? What the happened? We just asked this guy for drinking.</v>

228
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.400
<v 6>The whole party started beating on us.</v>

229
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:24.130
So this whole mob goes up the stairs to go fight the

230
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:28.690
party. Right. And I'm going upstairs. Like, what the am I doing? My big hit?

231
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:31.450
I'm going to get knocked out here, but I have to go. Cause then my friend.

232
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:35.830
So we go up there and uh, we hear the party.

233
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.650
So my buddy, the mouthpiece guy, like the most innocent void,

234
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.940
it knocks on the door. He goes, Hey, he's like,

235
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:45.580
is there a party going on in there? Right. And the door opens up.

236
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:49.180
And it was like a west wild west movie, like a saloon fight,

237
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.680
just haymakers. I remember, I didn't even want to go in. I was so scared.

238
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.390
Cause I was like, oh my God, this is going to be nuts.

239
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.480
And just the mob just sent me in and it was just like,

240
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.560
everybody's just throwing.

241
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.430
I remember this dude jumping over my back punching face. Right.

242
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.640
And the smoke clears and it all settles, you know, it was, I was like 15,

243
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:11.680
second melee and it all settles.

244
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:15.790
And we look at the party and there's like six or seven guys,

245
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.570
six or seven girls in there's like a board game that's tipped over.

246
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.750
And we had gone to the wrong party. Swear to God.

247
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.250
I know this sounds like a joke. The real party where they got hit was upstairs.

248
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.430
And I don't know, I don't remember what happened, but they,

249
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.100
they were actually rich kids and they sued my friends for going in,

250
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:34.210
whatever the dumb they did.

251
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.610
We all went into the wrong party and they were in there having like a couples

252
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.190
thing and they were playing like monopoly or something.

253
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:44.500
And all of a sudden there was a knock on the door. Hey, is there a party?

254
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.720
And then everybody just came running.

255
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.900
<v 4>And give back to them.</v>

256
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.320
<v 6>That's what I'm saying. That's why I didn't want to tell. Cause I felt,</v>

257
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:56.910
I felt really like, yeah, I felt bad. Okay.
