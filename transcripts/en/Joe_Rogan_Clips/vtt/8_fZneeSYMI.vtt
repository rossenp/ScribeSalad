00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.741
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:05.820
But that's also because he's from the Philippines in the Philippines.

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.640
Look how good he kids look perfect position on the seven,

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.930
watch this seven to the eight, eight to the 10. And he's out 10 ball.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.190
Watch this pop. If you watch how he strokes the ball,

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:20.850
like everything's super precise. Look at his position. That's,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.700
he's a professional look like a legit professional.

8
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:27.240
So if Manny decides to retire from, uh,

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.450
from fighting and goes, uh, into professional pool,

10
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.810
he might win some world championships. Like no. I mean,

11
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.370
he's still fighting actively.

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.130
They're actually talking about him fighting Connor McGregor right now,

13
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.800
which is kind of bonkers through that gets out. Beautiful.

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.310
<v 1>Why do you say it's kind of bonkers because you think Manny McGregor dominate</v>

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.593
Connor.

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.920
<v 0>Right? Is that a question?</v>

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.810
One of the greatest boxers of all time against the guy with one professional

18
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:54.200
boxing.

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.000
<v 1>Match? I agree. And I'm a huge Manny Pacquiao fan, but,</v>

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.410
but God, I can't believe it.

21
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.750
The other week I rewatched McGregor

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.420
Mayweather since it's been like done.

23
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:11.840
I just wish it was on my Showtime app and I wanted to watch some box.

24
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.580
It popped up and I clicked on it and I did not remember.

25
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.910
I remembered Connor shocking me with how good he did,

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.050
but I did not remember it being as close as it truly was.

27
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.760
<v 0>Let me explain something.</v>

28
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.040
The reason why it was close is because Mayweather let him blow his wad. Right?

29
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.080
Just let him look.

30
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:37.100
He clip Mayweather will the Git legit left uppercut early in the fight.

31
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:41.270
And I was kind of stunned. I was like, wow, that's really legit. Watch this.

32
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.260
Here we go. See what, what Conor it. Look at that. If you see it,

33
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.150
watch this left upper cut. If he, if he,

34
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.580
if they don't think they replay that it's really quick. Oh,

35
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:52.940
so let's rewind a little bit. So just so I could see it, cause it's really,

36
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.330
really good. Look at that left upper cut.

37
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.560
Here's the thing Mayweather had to figure out Connor's timing because what Conor

38
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.990
is, Conor is not a professional boxer. Okay.

39
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:06.500
So because he's not a professional boxer, he's not as, um,

40
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.720
efficient and he's going to get tired. Easier.

41
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.560
Mayweather is one of the greatest, if not the greatest boxer of all time,

42
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.360
I say there's a real good argument.

43
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:18.440
He's the greatest of all time because he's undefeated 15 O and really only been

44
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:19.670
hurt by sugar,

45
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:23.900
Shane Mosley and my Donna two guys in a spectacular career,

46
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.500
50 and oh, and just gets hit less than anybody.

47
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.570
And he's super smart about how he sets up fights. He sets up one of these.

48
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:32.840
He does.

49
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.820
He just talks a mess of and gets everybody wanting to root for him to lose.

50
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.070
He'll show you all his rolls. Royce has his show.

51
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.950
You all this money to show you all these watches. And everybody's like,

52
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:44.960
he's going to go broke. He's going to go broke buddy.

53
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.890
Never because he keeps making money. He keeps making money.

54
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.180
So because if you look at his style, he's,

55
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.160
he's got a brilliant style. His style is take the minimal amount of damage,

56
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.050
find your, and then establish a game and then dominate.

57
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.670
And that's what he's done to everybody.

58
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.580
That's what he did to Manny Pacquiao and their fight. And you know,

59
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.440
Manny Pacquiao apparently had a up shoulder,

60
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.590
but that's what he did to Ricky Hatton dominated Ricky Hatton,

61
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.120
who at the time was, you know,

62
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:16.270
one of the best in the world and a guy that a lot of people were interested in

63
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.940
seeing how he would do against Mayweather.

64
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:21.040
And then the second fight with my Donna.

65
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.750
You get to see the brilliance of Mayweather.

66
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.520
Cause you knew he got clipped in the first fight.

67
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.470
So he digested all of my Donna's movements and what he did wrong in the first

68
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.560
fight. And he came out in the second fight and just put on a clinic.

69
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.150
He's the best of all time. Yeah,

70
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.350
but Connor is a freak.

71
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.330
He's an explosive guy. He's so fast. And there's no remedy for that. Right.

72
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.730
Other than getting tired. So what may weather was doing was boxing with him.

73
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.760
But preserving being safe,

74
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.540
got clipped a couple of times realize that Connor can punch Connor could punch,

75
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.590
but just drag them into deep water, drag them into deep water.

76
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.650
And that's what a guy like Mayweather would do. He's the most,

77
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.720
he's the most intelligent in terms of his overall strategy to preserve his

78
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:11.530
health yet to always win. I mean, he's the most intelligent and he's so good.

79
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.990
You know, all the greats have suffered losses and setbacks and

80
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.470
except him. Yeah. Sat Pam. We.

81
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.760
<v 1>Don't even know what it's like. I mean,</v>

82
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.110
you don't even know how we would recover.

83
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.190
<v 0>He's had tough fights. He's had a couple of tough fights, but dude,</v>

84
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:30.090
he's so good. He's so protected. He knows where to beam,

85
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:33.390
where not to be he's so composed, like look at that. Look at that.

86
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:36.000
Look at that movement. Look how he moves away from everything.

87
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.300
So you're punching it air and you're still threatening,

88
00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:41.820
but you're not really hitting him. And he's making you throw punches.

89
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.300
And occasionally you clip them with a shot as he's moving away.

90
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:49.470
And he rolls with a lot of. So it's real. You gotta be a Gilot like sugar.

91
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:52.650
Shane Mosley clipped him, really clipped him, like really hurt him.

92
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.450
And he just grabbed a hold of him and held onto him.

93
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:59.880
And then eventually started kicking sugar. Shane's just took time. He's a,

94
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.440
if you're a young boxer and you want to know what it's like to be a

95
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:07.890
41 year old and still be at the top of your game, you gotta be like him.

96
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.730
Or like Bernard Hopkins. When Bernard Hopkins was at the top of his game,

97
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.210
he was older. He was like in his forties. But he was,

98
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:17.820
I think he was 36 when he beat Felix Trinidad.

99
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.420
And a lot of people like Bernard done it's over Felix Trinidad,

100
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:25.740
Tito Trinidad is a future. And he lit Felix Trinidad on fire.

101
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.190
And then the same thing with Kelly Pavlik. He, I.

102
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.010
<v 1>Was not expecting that. We were expecting that to be Kelly.</v>

103
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.810
Public's big like return. And he got some.

104
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.800
<v 0>Bernard Hopkins is a national treasure.</v>

105
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.460
He's because he look who that kind of pops them with that jab.

106
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.690
And that was uncomfortable. But it's like, he's looking, look how calm he is.

107
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.310
Stop back that up, back that up a second. Look how calm he is.

108
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.250
Wash his jab, come to Floyd's face. He doesn't even blink.

109
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.910
It touches him in the nose, but he knows it's not going to hurt him. Look.

110
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.440
<v 2>At, watch this. Look at this, look at this. He doesn't even move. Wow.</v>

111
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.610
He doesn't even move. He's a master of distance. He really is a master.

112
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.550
<v 0>Of distance. Bernard was a master of distance too.</v>

113
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.160
And Bernard was different kind of style,

114
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.790
different kinds of defensive style Bernard look, but frustrate guys a lot.

115
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.820
We would clinch with them, tie you up, make it very physical.

116
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.100
And guys get real frustrated and they didn't know what to do.

117
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:21.080
And they just wanted to start winging punches.

118
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.930
And then he'd get right in your face again and clinch a hold of you,

119
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.260
but then break with you and catch you with a left hook break catch with the

120
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:31.930
right hand, always defensive, always protect, always disciplined, you know.

121
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.190
<v 1>Frustrating. Your opponent and boxing is one of the interesting things, right?</v>

122
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:40.030
Like Holyfield Tyson. It's crazy. Everybody remembers the ear bite,

123
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.400
but not a lot of people talk about the massive amount of clenching and headbutts

124
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.460
that Holyfield was landing on him in that fight. Oh yeah.

125
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:52.120
It's very clear when you watch it again. Episodes.

126
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.320
