1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.200
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. &lt;laugh&gt; so you're, you're working with Rick Ruben now.</v>

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's awesome.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.440
<v 1>Yeah. Rick's fantastic. What is that like.</v>

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.400
<v 0>Though, for you being like a guy who's kind of like,</v>

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.080
you've kind of controlled everything before, right? Yeah, totally. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.080
So what is it like for you to have Ruben in the mix?

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.270
<v 1>Yeah, well, Rick's a friend, so for me it was like,</v>

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.430
I was sort of at a low point and he kind of picked me up when I was down.

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.190
So it was like,

10
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.870
I didn't mind sort of trusting him with like the head part of it all. Mm-hmm,

11
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.450
&lt;affirmative&gt; kind of like,

12
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.710
you deal with that part and I'm just gonna sort of be up the performer in the,

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.950
the weird guy in the corner. Did it give you relief? Oh yeah. Yeah.

14
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.180
I felt like it allowed me to on the music and the performance and sort of just

15
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.380
freed me to just, you know, let whatever,

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.500
because sometimes you can psych yourself out. I dunno if that makes any sense,

17
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.420
like, yeah, you can have a really good song, you know,

18
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:54.780
it's a good song and then you start second guessing yourself. Mm.

19
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.460
And then you start thinking, well, maybe this song's not good enough. And,

20
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.501
and then that'll,

21
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.290
that'll infiltrate into your performance as opposed to being free. Like, Hey,

22
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.570
I've just got a good song. And if that one doesn't work,

23
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.330
I've got another good song. Yeah.

24
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.650
So letting Rick kind of do the picking and choosing,

25
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.010
and that's a good take and that's a good song. It was just like, okay,

26
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.690
I'm just gonna kind of just go down this road.

27
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.370
It took me back to sort of a more innocent way of approaching the work.

28
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.410
And I'm very grateful to him for that.

29
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.640
<v 0>That's awesome. Yeah. It's gotta be it a mind.</v>

30
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.400
To create something and then practice it and rehearse it over and over again and

31
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:30.440
tweak it and mess with it and not know really like not,

32
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.000
not almost not be able to be objective.

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.760
<v 1>Anymore. Yeah. Well, the weird thing is, is I hope people can appreciate how,</v>

34
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.960
I mean, it is like at one point when I, my ear was really to the ground,

35
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.310
I was able to do that. I was both able be objective and subjectve, mm-hmm,

36
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.190
&lt;affirmative&gt; be the writer and be the producer. Right.

37
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.110
And I hit a lot of home runs. So then you get kind of like,

38
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.950
I know what I'm doing. Right. So then when it stops working,

39
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.430
you have two choices. You can blame yourself,

40
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.750
which is the natural thing you should do, or you can blame others.

41
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.820
And once you start blaming others, you're in this hallomes. Yeah.

42
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.980
<v 1>You know, instead of RA raising your hand saying, okay, I've had a good run.</v>

44
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.980
Now I need, it's like getting a coach or something.

45
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.780
Like maybe a guy goes on a losing streak and needs springing a new coach,

46
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:17.340
just to say, I think you need to work on your offensive. You know what I mean?

47
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.820
Just somebody to tweak you. Yeah.

48
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.340
But when you're flying a thousand miles an hour and you're selling gazillions of

49
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.500
records and making all this money,

50
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.130
and you're surrounded by a bunch of sick fans, they're not gonna tell you,

51
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:28.770
Hey man, you need, you need, you know,

52
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:32.490
you need the doctor to come in and kind of sort, sort your head out. Yeah.

53
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.890
So then you start going this way.

54
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:36.770
And then that's when it gets like hall mirrors. So that's where,

55
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.810
that's where my own hubris sort of got in my own way.

56
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.450
I couldn't accept that I got on a losing streak and then, you know,

57
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:45.560
go to somebody like Rick and say, I, I, some help. I need some objective help.

58
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:46.040
I'm did.

59
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.920
<v 0>You feel yourself?</v>

60
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.240
Like when you were listening to the music that you were creating,

61
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.720
did you feel like you were on a losing streak? No.

62
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.840
<v 1>No. So it sounded, I couldn't, I couldn't,</v>

63
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.800
I couldn't intellectually understand why I was failing.

64
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.000
It didn't make any sense to me. And sometimes it's just generational.

65
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.400
It's the market changes, whatever. It's not personal. Right.

66
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.320
It feels incredibly personal, which is why it's easier to blame somebody else.

67
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.280
Right. Right. Like you don't understand the depth of my, yeah. My work here.

68
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.480
I'm so deep and you, you're not following my, my meta path or so,

69
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.360
you know what I mean? Yeah. And look, it's most, most entertainment is pop,

70
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.190
right? I mean, you you're a comedian. I mean, it's like, yeah,

71
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.270
if you go up and tell a bunch of jokes and the audience doesn't laugh,

72
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:24.870
whose's fault, is it? Well.

73
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.271
<v 0>The, the,</v>

74
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:29.830
the mind of music to me has always been very fascinating because you guys create

75
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.790
it in like a vacuum almost totally, almost. And then you bring it to the people.

76
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.830
Like when you release an album, they get it. And it's done. It's like, holy,

77
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.660
here it is. And you know,

78
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.300
a big fan plays it for the first time and they're listening to it. They're like,

79
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.580
oh, like it's, it's all. Whereas we, uh,

80
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.700
have ideas and I need an audience to create,

81
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.580
like I need to be around them. Yeah. I can't,

82
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.220
I can only create so much on a laptop. Mm. Most of it has to be like,

83
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.930
fine tuned refine. So by the time I record something, I already know it works.

84
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.090
Ah, yeah. It's already been tested. Right.

85
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.770
<v 1>So that's go back to my point. If you get on a winning streak and you're,</v>

86
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:13.210
you're creating things in a bubble and then they work well, then you're,

87
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.970
you wanna take all the credit for it. Yeah. Yeah.

88
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.850
You forget all the thousand hours in the bedroom that you listen to Jimmy

89
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.200
Hendricks or yeah. You know, about how amersible fate or whatever, you know,

90
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:24.400
like that gave you all these ideas. You, you know,

91
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.800
you don't want to give them credit. You wanna be the author of your own success.

92
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.920
That's right. And it starts patting you on the back and.

93
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.360
<v 0>Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt. No, that's fine.</v>

94
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:36.240
You're very introspective in that regard. Like you, you have a very, um, uh,

95
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.880
failure.

96
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.480
<v 1>Would failure would do that to you. Is that what.</v>

97
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.750
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; but you say failure though, but you massive amounts of fans.</v>

98
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:42.630
You're still deeply.

99
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.270
<v 1>Respected. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm weird in that.</v>

100
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.830
I've always been willing to talk about the process, which again is anti gimmic,

101
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.750
but also, um, uh,

102
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.070
I I've always approached it more like a performance artist in that I'm after the

103
00:04:56.071 --> 00:05:00.030
bigger message of how work intersects with fame,

104
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.020
intersects personal feeling, intersects with personality and,

105
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.700
and, and how people perceive things.

106
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.980
Like I like all that weird Andy Kaufman uncomfortability. Mm that's.

107
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:12.420
Part of my attraction. Right.

108
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:14.580
So I've been willing to use myself as the battering Ram,

109
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.820
which is how I end up becoming a meme &lt;laugh&gt; right. Because people,

110
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.250
people latch onto these personalities I've created, which of course are,

111
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.370
are ancillary to my real personality. Right. But they don't,

112
00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:28.210
they don't necessarily wanna gimme credit that I'm a sort of controller of the

113
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:32.010
forces at play. So if I say something dumb, people assume that I'm dumb.

114
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.450
It's hard for them to assume that I'm saying something dumb on purpose because I

115
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:36.730
want a reaction, right?

116
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.730
<v 0>Yeah. When you become a,</v>

117
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.920
a hugely successful musician and your life becomes

118
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.960
touring, big arenas, doing radio shows,

119
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.720
getting on the bus, getting on the plane, all this stuff.

120
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.280
Does it make it difficult to have like

121
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.880
the time or the, the actual experiences to continue to create?

122
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.293
Yes.

123
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.423
<v 1>Because you get,</v>

124
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.440
so deoxiggenated in the bubble that you start writing songs about being on tour.

125
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.390
Yeah.

126
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.080
<v 0>Like comedians will tell jokes about airline food. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; exactly.</v>

127
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.990
<v 1>Yeah. You had to be coming. So sort of like,</v>

128
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.910
you're trying to take people in the insularity of your experience,

129
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.430
but it's not that interesting. Right. And at some point it becomes unrelatable.

130
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.470
<v 0>Well, I always say that about like, uh, I mean, there's, there's a lot of bands,</v>

131
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.430
but some of the great Alman brothers are Leonard skyner like they

132
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:36.910
had a bunch of songs about leaving about getting away from whi

133
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.060
you know, Lord, I was born a rambling man. Rightly so. Yeah.

134
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.780
There was so many songs about just getting away from women. Yeah. The other day.

135
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.940
<v 1>I heard that Crosby still's national song and it's like,</v>

136
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.180
just a song before I go, it's all about he's going on tour.

137
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.420
And they go to the airport and it's uncomfortable. It's like,

138
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.260
it's such a going on tour song. Yeah. But it's like,

139
00:06:55.261 --> 00:06:57.020
it's really not that relatable to most people.

140
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.570
<v 0>You know, to a lot of people it's not. Yeah. I mean, skinrd had a load of those.</v>

141
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.210
They, they really did have quite a few songs about like getting the outta Dodge,

142
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.743
but they were good.

143
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.623
<v 1>Oh.</v>

144
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.890
<v 0>Such a great fan giant fan. I mean,</v>

145
00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:16.610
they're probably the greatest thing to ever come outta Florida. It's arguable,

146
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.390
you know.

147
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.840
<v 1>I'm trying to think came outta of Florida.</v>

148
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.260
<v 0>Uh, Jim brewer.</v>

149
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.900
<v 1>I thought we were just talking about music. Did Creek came outta Florida?</v>

150
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.060
&lt;laugh&gt; I thought we were just talking about music.

151
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.580
<v 0>Uh, yeah. I don't have anything else when it comes to music.</v>

152
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.100
Who out pit bull &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.330
It's uh, the, the, so do you, did you feel it while it was happening?

154
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.890
Like when you are, you're doing these mega tours and everything,

155
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:49.010
do you feel like the staleness and the creation?

156
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.650
<v 1>Um, I did. Yeah. I think what I tried to do is change personalities,</v>

157
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.410
change musical directions to kind of reinfuse things.

158
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.680
And it worked up until a point until my mother died,

159
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.560
like in 96 in, in a,

160
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:09.840
in a weird three month period, the drummer left the band.

161
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.800
My mother died and I got a divorce in like a six month period.

162
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.710
And so I tried to use that as fuel to sort

163
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:22.630
of just pivot where I wanted to go musically,

164
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.950
but I wrote this very introspective, dark record,

165
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:27.710
which a lot of people really like now, but at the time it was like,

166
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.630
so antithetical to this big rock yeah. Machine. Um,

167
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.070
yeah. It was like castigate for being an idiot.

168
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.430
And I went from golden child to idiot, you know, and one fell swoop and yeah.

169
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.860
<v 0>Well, so many great artists or a prisoner of their early success in long.</v>

170
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.940
<v 1>Ways. Yeah. And, and rightly so, you know what I mean? I,</v>

171
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.140
I have a much greater appreciation for the zeitgeist effect of the public.

172
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.220
I don't know if that makes any sense. It's like,

173
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.560
it's like how many Zeit guys did Elvis have three U,

174
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:02.480
two S had two or three Frank Sinatra had two or three or four. I mean,

175
00:09:02.481 --> 00:09:05.080
there's something about when it all seems to make sense,

176
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.760
like the public's fascination, the artist place in time,

177
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.280
the work that's being created, there's a sense of like familiarity,

178
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.510
but also something is how happening and everybody wants to take part in it.

179
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.190
And so I have a much greater appreciation for that moment.

180
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.230
The ego of the artist wants toconvince yourself.

181
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:25.910
That you're always in that moment. And that's just impossible.

182
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.550
That's just impossible. There's just no way.

183
00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.790
It's just that cyclical nature of creation.

184
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.180
<v 0>That's such an important thing to say for people listening for &lt;affirmative&gt;</v>

185
00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:36.900
people that like struggle with this themselves.

186
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; hear something like you say that.

187
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.980
<v 1>Yeah. It's it actually kind of makes sense. It's like, it's like, it's like, uh,</v>

188
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.180
typical example.

189
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.860
It's like falling in love and expecting to feel that feeling forever. Right?

190
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.540
It's just not gonna happen. You're.

191
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.340
<v 0>Not gonna feel the same. No, I.</v>

192
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.260
<v 1>Would argue if you are, there's something wrong, right. It's go to a doctor.</v>

193
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.610
You haven't matured into a deeper relationship. So in the same thing,

194
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.770
an artist needs to mature into a deeper relationship with their work or their

195
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:04.970
relationship with the public or their relationship with themselves.

196
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.970
And if you can do that and you, and you look at great examples, Johnny Cash,

197
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.850
Neil, young, Tom petty, when they get there, everybody comes back,

198
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.760
Bob Dylan, because they think, okay, now you're giving me some new information.

199
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.000
Yeah. This isn't just a riff on the thing that you gave me before. And, um,

200
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.800
and I think the public has shown over time, the, the,

201
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.200
the willingness and the ability to follow artists, if they're willing,

202
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.920
if they're, if they're able to go to that place where they mine out,

203
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:30.510
something new,

204
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.520
that actually is like a cultural contribution and not just sort of more of what

205
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:35.354
they already know.

206
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.590
<v 0>I think that's so important for you to talk about.</v>

207
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.510
And I'm so glad you do because for, uh, upcoming artists and in,

208
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.590
in all sorts of genres,

209
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.070
just people who are involved in creating mm-hmm to hear someone as successful as

210
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.190
yourself, talk about the various struggles of the mind and,

211
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.710
and of momentum and the, you know,

212
00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:57.500
the different stages and various points of your career. Yeah. So important.

213
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.820
Yeah.

214
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.780
<v 1>The music business plays this Jedi mind trick on you where the whole thing's set</v>

215
00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:06.500
up to be repatacious and take advantage of your weakness. How so?

216
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.100
Well it's like, um, I, I can, I'll use the music business as an example,

217
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.180
and I'm sure there's plenty of parallels across the entertainment spectrum. Um,

218
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.170
you, you, you, you to get the contract and then the contract is sort of,

219
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.410
you know, the in indentured servitude type of thing. We,

220
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:27.490
our first contract was seven albums, essentially 14 years.

221
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.930
So I signed that contract when I was 23. That's crazy. Okay.

222
00:11:31.931 --> 00:11:34.290
So I'm signing a 23 years old. I'm signing a contract.

223
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:35.890
That's supposed to take me into 37.

224
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.160
<v 0>You'd signing a contract for more than half your life.</v>

225
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.760
<v 1>And, and if you look at the shelf life of most artists, it's for to,</v>

226
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.720
so they're basically anticipating your entire arc. That's so crazy.

227
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.400
So you don't have any leverage, you know, other than that, they wanna sign you,

228
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.000
you sign the deal and then it becomes this weird dance of like,

229
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.280
can I sustain success? Yeah. If you get success and you have leverage,

230
00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:03.560
they'll get out of your way. Cuz you're making them a lot of money,

231
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.560
but the minute you're not making them as much money,

232
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.600
then they step in and they start playing these Jedi mind tricks on you.

233
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.470
We know what to do. You know, the public's forget about you. I mean,

234
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:17.150
I've heard all these things like, you know, this kind of weird, like yeah,

235
00:12:17.151 --> 00:12:18.910
you're in the room, but you know,

236
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.430
we're the arbiter of whether you can stay in the room.

237
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.950
<v 0>That's the weird position that record companies had for a long time that they</v>

238
00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:26.990
don't seem to have anymore.

239
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.950
<v 1>I wouldn't, I would argue against that because they, they still do well.</v>

240
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:33.300
They've moved to a different set of circumstances and I'm not as conversant as

241
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.580
I, as I once was. But one thing they do with certain younger artists.

242
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.980
But I think particularly more in the pop realm is they do these 360 deals where

243
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:44.100
it's like, right. If you get a perfume deal, if you, yeah.

244
00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:46.900
Like your whole world, they own you, we own a piece of your whole world.

245
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.620
And fame is such a great quotition in American life.

246
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.810
Now that you can see where kids would trade fame and give and be willing to give

247
00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:57.170
away like the, the, the profit part.

248
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.850
<v 0>Well, they'll take a risk at the long term ownership.</v>

249
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.850
<v 1>Right? So let me jump in there. So if you actually survive the cut, let's say,</v>

250
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:09.730
let's call it phase one. You're successful. You're a name.

251
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.050
And now you're in a place to either renegotiate or your deal is up or whatever.

252
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.040
I once had a conversation with a very powerful music executive. And I said,

253
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.640
and I was friends with the guy. So I was like,

254
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.800
give me the insider psychology here.

255
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.240
Now that I know the game that you run,

256
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:30.520
what do you tell people like me when they get here? And he says, oh, it's just,

257
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:31.520
there's always a price.

258
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.590
So they know that even if you get through matrix of the whole thing and get out

259
00:13:36.591 --> 00:13:39.590
the other side, that there's just a dollar amount that will buy you back in.

260
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.430
Whoa, they're not worried that you'll go independent. And in fact,

261
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:46.750
if you look at a lot of the machinations of the music business over the last 20

262
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:48.430
years, especially with the rise of the internet,

263
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.950
it's to keep people in the system. Yes. They don't want true independence.

264
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:55.760
<v 0>Right. But.</v>

265
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.760
<v 1>It seems like, look, look, look,</v>

266
00:13:56.761 --> 00:14:00.680
I'll give you look no further than the deals that the record labels cut with the

267
00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:03.760
streaming services, they got into ownership,

268
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:06.920
equity deals with the streaming services in an, in an,

269
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.080
in an arrangement for them to have an equity position.

270
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.440
They agreed to very low rates for the artist's music.

271
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.100
<v 0>Ah.</v>

272
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.870
<v 1>So that's why, so when you, when you listen to Bob Dylan's song on Spotify,</v>

273
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.830
Bob, Dylan's not getting a lot of money for that,

274
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.030
but as Spotify and the other streaming services raise up in their equity

275
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.630
position, the labels benefit.

276
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.950
So the labels pimped out their own artist to take a greater

277
00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:35.950
equity position in a rising business. It's like, you see what I'm saying? Yeah.

278
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.860
They weaken the artist's position to take a better position at the table

279
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:39.980
themselves. That.

280
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.580
<v 0>Is fascinating. And they,</v>

281
00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:46.260
they weaken the monetary position of compensation in order to get equity in the

282
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.460
company. Right. And, and.

283
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.940
<v 1>Now you got, and now you see it where, uh,</v>

284
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.160
metallicica's management for example has come out and, and, uh, especially, uh,

285
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.600
YouTube's former manager, Paul McGin has come out.

286
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.560
They're trying to take on YouTube now,

287
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.760
cuz YouTube's got this weird funky position where they'll pay on license music,

288
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.360
but they won't pay for covers. And you know what I mean? Yes.

289
00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:10.750
Like YouTube's like one of the big targets of the business because what I ever

290
00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:14.710
deal they agreed to with YouTube 10 years ago is super weak. And, but again,

291
00:15:14.711 --> 00:15:18.550
these are all machinations that go on above the artist's spot. Right.

292
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.470
And a quick thing into your, into your world

293
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.550
when McGregor leap out and did the fight with Mayweather,

294
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.510
he creates this whole different set of dynamics because he's,

295
00:15:30.511 --> 00:15:32.580
he can &lt;affirmative&gt; he can run his own game. Yes.

296
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.900
UFC can't pay him that kind of money. And last I heard is like,

297
00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:38.500
maybe he's gonna do another fight. So I'm not,

298
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.620
I don't wanna get totally into that.

299
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:42.260
But my point is is you see where those dynamics,

300
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:45.100
where people step outside the system, it changes the game. Yeah.

301
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.980
So it's actually kind of, you could now, now, and I don't want to, you know,

302
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.370
I've never met Dana white, but if Dana white could go in a time machine,

303
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.370
maybe he'd pay Maywe, uh, McGregor more money to keep him in his world.

304
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.090
Cuz now that he's out.

305
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.850
<v 0>I don't think Connor would've accepted that. Okay. But I think, yeah,</v>

306
00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:05.370
I think he recognized the unique opportunity that he's in.

307
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.530
So he probably wanted.

308
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.810
<v 1>I'm talking about stuff as a fan. You you're on the other side of the fence,</v>

309
00:16:09.811 --> 00:16:13.280
but my point is, is when you see when breaks out of the,

310
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:16.120
sort of the matrix of how it's the game is set up, right.

311
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.640
It creates this weird thing.

312
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.560
<v 0>Yeah. And there are a few today though that have kind of figured it out through</v>

313
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:24.880
YouTube and all these different, I I think chance the.

314
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.080
<v 1>Rapper, I don't know much about his, his business,</v>

315
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.720
but I know he is sort of worked out this other model for himself.

316
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.560
<v 0>But yeah. Jamie knows a lot about him a little bit.</v>

317
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.440
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, he,</v>

318
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.470
I know he is getting money from way other places than just the traditional, uh,

319
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.630
record contract. God bless.

320
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.230
He's gotten big deals from major companies like Sprite and other.

321
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.270
<v 0>And he's still independent. Right. Tech technically that's.</v>

322
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.630
<v 2>The word they would use to market him. Like he's an independent artist,</v>

323
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.430
but he's got a machine behind him. So I don't know if he's independent,

324
00:16:48.431 --> 00:16:49.264
you know? Yeah.

325
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.750
<v 0>I'm good friends. Withurrgil Simpson.</v>

326
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.620
And sturggi's tried to educate me as to how the,

327
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.220
the record business keeps people in,

328
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.100
in the fold with the owning,

329
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:03.820
your merchandise and your likeness forever and all these different things.

330
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.100
It seems, it seems crazy like it.

331
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.380
<v 1>We actually signed, we actually signed a clause. It, it said,</v>

332
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.130
um, and this contract pertains to this universe and any universe,

333
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:22.170
not yet discovered what we signed that clause.

334
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.930
<v 0>Who, who wrote that? The record company, Jesus, what are they Scientology?</v>

335
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.130
That is crazy.

336
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.770
<v 1>Like we literally had to sign a thing and it was like this contract pertains to</v>

337
00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:35.880
this known universe and universe. Not yet discovered that.

338
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.440
<v 0>Is insane. &lt;laugh&gt; that is insane.</v>

339
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.280
Like if someone found a parallel universe somewhere and they figured out they

340
00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:43.720
could sell music to them, &lt;laugh&gt;,

341
00:17:43.721 --> 00:17:47.240
it's a parallel mu they haven't heard the smashing pumpkins get over there quick

342
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.000
shoot, a rocket ship filled with cash over.

343
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.720
<v 1>There. Well that, you know, why they put that in is because the, when,</v>

344
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.760
when they transitioned to CDs,

345
00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.640
the contracts didn't account for CDs. Oh. And what they did, it was a very,

346
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.440
it's a very classic thing is so they had to go back and renegotiate all the

347
00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:09.390
deals because of the CD technology. This would've been like,

348
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.390
whatever eighties Uh-huh. So they went to every artist and they said, look,

349
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.830
it's this new technology and we're not sure it's gonna work.

350
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.110
So you gotta take a price cut.

351
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.430
We're only gonna pay you 75 cents on the dollar.

352
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.630
So we could advance the new technology. Oh Jesus Christ.

353
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:24.463
<v 3>They're dirty.</v>

354
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:34.700
And.
