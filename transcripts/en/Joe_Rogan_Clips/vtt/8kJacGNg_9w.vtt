00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.610
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's some of our favorite stories though,</v>

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.770
is someone who comes back like Dave Chappelle is a perfect example of that.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.150
<v 1>I can do what the I want. Not only that.</v>

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.370
<v 0>Dave did it in a legendary way.</v>

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.990
They offer them all this money to do this comedy central show in a different

6
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.260
way. They want him to change it and tone it down.

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.590
They want to make it more suitable for advertisers, too many voices.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.200
And he's like, you know what? I'm just going to go to Africa.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.670
<v 1>He just went to Africa.</v>

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.460
<v 0>I'm out, just took off and then came back and said, I quit.</v>

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.370
And then stopped doing standup. He was doing,

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.760
I don't know if you know he was doing stand-up in a park in Seattle.

13
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:40.890
He'd show up with a box and just do it.

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.770
Plug a microphone into it and just start doing standard.

15
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.070
But people would gather around like, what the is happening here? No,

16
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.770
he didn't want any money. He would just show up at shows.

17
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.860
If you want to do a show, he would show up at a comedy club. No money.

18
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.140
Just show up, do a show after the show is over.

19
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.720
<v 1>It's a great Dave Chappelle story. I'm in Seattle.</v>

20
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.580
I think it was in Seattle. Sold out arena thing.

21
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.360
I'm doing to Seattle. And we had two shows. Same night.

22
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
We do about 30,000 people. Right? great day.

23
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.050
Miss Seattle. I get word to Dave.

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.480
Chappelle is in Seattle and Dave Chappelle randomly put up a theater

25
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.580
show and he's performing

26
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.510
tonight. Yeah. He's performing tonight. Call date, Dave.

27
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:38.070
You in Seattle? Yeah. When did you book a show here?

28
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:42.120
I would've came, dude. I'm here. I'm at the theater. Oh, I didn't even know,

29
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:46.500
man. What'd you meet Dave? I'm at the arena. What?

30
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.620
I am going to see if I can get down there to iron man. Y'all just put them up.

31
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.490
What time do you think you going to get here? I don't know.

32
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.830
After my show, I pushed the time back, man. Dave

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.120
pushed the time back. What did you put? All the stuff. I don't know, man.

34
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.680
Tell him, I'll do it. Not show up, man.

35
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.690
I just call him and tell him I'm going to push it back, man.

36
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.450
I get to the theater. I rush after our show,

37
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.320
Dave has a, uh,

38
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.230
a trailer and it was like a little motor thing on the back of the trailer.

39
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.790
It's like a little bus motor trend, like bus.

40
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.930
And then it was like little, the things that you pull in attached to it.

41
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.420
I said, what are you doing here? He's like, I don't know.

42
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.260
My we've been doing cross country taking our bikes, man. We ride across country.

43
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.440
So I just, when I need money, I just book a show and just.

44
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.290
<v 0>So different, so.</v>

45
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.110
<v 1>Different. And he sold him. But the freedom,</v>

46
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.610
Dave has a level of freedom. Me and Chris rock. Talk about it, man. You know?

47
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.760
No one's like him, his, his level of freedom. I put myself in his place.

48
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.050
You know, I got the, the,

49
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.030
the corporate relationships in the CEO hat and the companies.

50
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.900
So, you know,

51
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.670
I can't do certain things because the consequences aren't just for

52
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.210
me, it's for the people that are underneath this umbrella.

53
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.220
If something were to happen, it's I have to be, I have to be responsible.

54
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.701
I have to,

55
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:26.380
I have to understand that it's not just about me and I'm envious and

56
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:31.300
jealous of Dave's ability to go and be free

57
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.280
as a comic in the times where we desperately need to be. Yes,

58
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.320
we desperately need to be.

59
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.450
And Dave can be and a bow down to him.

60
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.880
I called the, I don't give a about these numbers. Anything. I got Dave,

61
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.700
in my opinion, you're the goat. In my opinion,

62
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.710
you're last special has allowed you to surpass

63
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.760
the Richard Pryor. In my opinion,

64
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.190
Dave Chappelle,

65
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.420
I got to witness do groundbreaking

66
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.910
controversial

67
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.010
movement as a comedian.

68
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:22.060
And the times where comedy was being frowned upon

69
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.090
comedians were being held accountable for

70
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:32.920
doing what we thought we would never be ridiculed for. Right?

71
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.440
The one person that has stood on a pedestal that

72
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.980
got the attention that no others can get outside of

73
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.060
myself, a rock, a Seinfeld.

74
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.200
He said in the time where the fire is the hottest

75
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.900
I'm going to do what nobody else will.

76
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.660
You got to applaud that he stood up for comedy. He stood up for comedy.

77
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.280
Whether you want to see that or not. Right? He did that. Yes,

78
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.610
he did it when there's the most pressure when it was the most pressure.

79
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.420
And when the times of we could cancel you, by the way,

80
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:18.100
which is the stupidest that I've ever witnessed in my 40 years of

81
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.720
life, the whole idea of I can kill you today with it,

82
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.960
with the cooking, by knocking your life. By the way,

83
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:29.650
this is a real feeling that people have, yes, I'm in control of your life.

84
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.140
If I want your life to stop and be over our counsel,

85
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:35.620
you and I means you can't live no more. This is how ridiculous it is.

86
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.510
Think about the meaning of council culture.

87
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.100
So you're saying that my life is over.

88
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:43.780
I can no longer survivor or provide for myself. Cancel,

89
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.400
I don't know, figure it out. You're canceled. They Chappelle said, all that.

90
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.980
Do what you wanna do. I'm gonna do me.

91
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.710
That is epic. That is groundbreaking.

92
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:01.490
That gold like behavior. So I bow down to Mr. Chapin.

93
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.780
<v 0>He's very important.</v>

94
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.210
He's one of the most important figures in the history of common.

95
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.980
Cause the fact that he's willing to do this when the scrutiny is the highest,

96
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.870
you know, and, and also just his, his just his story,

97
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.580
the BA the way he did it,

98
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:21.200
the way he walked away for 10 years and then came back and immediately went

99
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.034
right to the top.

100
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.440
<v 1>You know, it's my, that is my as my brother from another mother. I love him.</v>

101
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.340
Chris, rock, Chris rock and Maggie. One more. May Chris rock had comedy cellar.

102
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.150
I called Chris, Hey Chris, come down to the cellar, man.

103
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.360
I'm a working with jokes tonight. I'll see what you think. Alright, Kevin,

104
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.940
I'll come though. Chris comes down. He's like, yeah, I'm gonna get up to,

105
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:45.260
I got some I'm working on too. So tell what you think. But I go on stage.

106
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.400
Chris rock sits in the back of the seller. Get off stage, Chris.

107
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:52.370
I funny cab though. I was like, yeah, you like it. Right? Got some stuff,

108
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.470
got some notes. He's like, yo, I'm about to go. Art done. I'm sitting here.

109
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.480
I'm watching. Chris goes up. Chris got some funny. Chris. Funny.

110
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.880
I like it, man. Chris, I have a nice conversation. Go upstairs. We about to eat.

111
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.340
Dave comes in. What update would you do doing? I was going to go up. I'll, man.

112
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:12.320
Chris went up. We will come down and watch you. Right? Dave goes on stage.

113
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.230
Dave does about an hour. There's a moment where Dave is probably at about 40,

114
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.950
45 minutes in may of Chris, both look at each other. And at the same time,

115
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:24.650
when I was saying the word balled up, the material that we just worked on,

116
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.520
we, we without saying it without saying it.

117
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.950
I ripped the page that I had in my little book.

118
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.140
And Chris just balled up his little thing. And we were like, he's unbelievable.

119
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.760
We came in crafted. We got some that we wanted to work on.

120
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.140
Dave just went up there and talk.

121
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.070
<v 0>It's like, he's living like a legend. You know what I mean? Like if you,</v>

122
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:51.110
if you wanted to have a legend of a comedian,

123
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.760
you would talk about a guy who created the greatest sketch show of all time.

124
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.540
I mean, it only went for two seasons, but when you talk about like sketches,

125
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:02.480
like Clayton Biggs B, when you talk about the Rick James,

126
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.440
these are so classic. They're unstoppable.

127
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.680
And then he goes away. He goes away like a mountain.

128
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.570
He vanishes he's in a farm in Ohio. You hear? Where is he? He's on a farm.

129
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.670
You got a farm. He's on a farm in Ohio. What is he doing? Comedy?

130
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:25.370
Sometimes randomly just shows up sad his barn.

131
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.420
But he does this for 10 years as in Denver. Right?

132
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.810
And this was before his comeback. I was in Denver and um,

133
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.640
I'm doing standup and uh,

134
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.560
I get off stage and I opened the green room and Dave's there I go, Dave,

135
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:43.910
what are you doing? And he goes, oh, Hey Joe, I just decided to fly into Denver.

136
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.610
I go, you don't have a show. Schedule nothing. He goes, nah, man,

137
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:50.210
I heard you here. I signed him flying. I go, do you want to go up? He goes, oh,

138
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.780
should I go. Yeah, hold on a second. I run back.

139
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:57.240
People are leaving people getting up and go, come back, come back,

140
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:01.440
tell everybody to come back. I go, Dave, Chappelle's here. And I'm like, what?

141
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.430
They all come back, sit down. And he does 40 minutes.

142
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.720
<v 1>I love the best part of that story is you want to go up?</v>

143
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.640
Should I dang Dave? You just took a flight to Denver.

144
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.780
Yeah. Dave, why not?

145
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.240
<v 0>I guess so then he takes me out.</v>

146
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:22.590
We'd go out on the town to all these spots that I didn't even know

147
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:24.780
existed in Denver. He knows where all these,

148
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.490
after hours places you go behind an alley, you knock on a door. They open it up.

149
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.470
Everything's velvet line. It's a small private bar. He's he's.

150
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.200
<v 1>He is a one on one. He's one of one.</v>

151
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.790
<v 0>One of one of, one of one.</v>

152
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.080
<v 1>What the is, should be like, you see, this is, this is us embracing.</v>

153
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.650
This is us embracing. We're embracing someone,

154
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.210
embracing got there's nothing wrong with that. World is important.

155
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.770
There's nothing worse. There's nothing wrong with embracing someone.

156
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:59.100
That's doing what you can deem as great.

157
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.930
<v 0>Yes. A house to have to it's part of the thing you have to,</v>

158
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:06.810
you have to sing praise, shower,

159
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:09.090
praise on people that are doing it the right way.

160
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.420
And no one's ever done it better than Dave. He's doing it the right way. No.

161
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.940
And even like I said, even the legendary store, it's like,

162
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.360
he's like a character in a book. No.

163
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.970
<v 1>I'm saying a mountain man. He's like a mountain man.</v>

164
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.180
<v 0>He goes off to a farm outside of Dayton. Ohio.</v>

165
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.530
<v 1>Does that. By the way, tells me Kev, you got to come down to the farm, Dave.</v>

166
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.700
I don't what.

167
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.863
<v 0>I don't.</v>

168
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.970
<v 1>Want to, what do you want me to do down there? Dave? What do you want me to do?</v>

169
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.020
You got to come down, man. It's a good time. We're going to have good time, man.

170
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.610
It's the barn fires music. Dave, it's a farm.

171
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:49.560
You got to promise me. All right. I'm coming, Dave. I, I like literally, I,

172
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.570
I can only hope to be remotely close to as

173
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:59.430
creative as he is at that point in my career and

174
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:02.490
find this jello. Like he's in an amazing jello right now.

175
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.350
<v 0>He knows who he is.</v>

176
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.930
I compromised and no one can tell him any different. He is who he is.

177
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:10.831
I mean,

178
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:15.750
he just he's unapologetically himself and he gets

179
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:16.170
it.

180
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.500
He's his part of his brilliance is not just being in a brilliant observer and a,

181
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.540
a brilliant orator in a, in a describer of life.

182
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.520
But also in being who he is perfectly like he doesn't have any conflict

183
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:33.870
in being who he is. He knows who he is. He knows how to do it.

184
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:35.010
He knows how to do it. Right.

185
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.780
<v 1>And he's okay with not having.</v>

186
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.750
<v 0>And when he walks on stage, man, he strolls on that stage.</v>

187
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:42.030
Like he belongs there. He's okay.

188
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.590
<v 0>Go.</v>
