WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 1>Um, yeah, I walked in about 180 1. Um,</v>

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.050
and like for the Tony five was 180 4. So, you know.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.620
<v 0>The Tony fight was a mess because of the staff, right? Like, yeah.</v>

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.200
You guys have a decision where you had to make, whether you're not,

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.034
you're going to pull out of the fight.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.660
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I tried my best to keep it from everybody, so,</v>

8
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.800
and I kind of succeeded in it. Um, I mean really the only one, something over.

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.780
<v 0>It at the weigh-ins right? Yeah. Put a.</v>

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.250
<v 1>Makeup, Susie, the girl, she, uh, she did it for me, but you know,</v>

11
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:36.450
that really just made the, the, the, the weight cut and in my body much worse.

12
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.284
I mean, I,

13
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.860
I don't really look at the fight and say that Tony's a dog and I kind of give

14
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.560
that to him. You know, I kind of, uh, uh,

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.710
I learned a lot about myself from Nephite Eva. Uh,

16
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.120
and then fights after that. I've had a lot of tough weight cuts going into him.

17
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:53.520
So I don't really, uh, I don't really put too much.

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.890
<v 0>At first round though, man, before you got tired,</v>

19
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.070
you had a mounted and that was a, it was a big first round for you.

20
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.810
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah, but that was one of the fights where I,</v>

21
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.430
if I would've listened to Robin that fight,

22
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.670
I would already be the champion and then everything would look different,

23
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.160
you know, I would already fought McGregor by now. Uh,

24
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.100
and then the whole sport would have looked different, I think. Uh,

25
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.560
but I didn't listen to him and I, what did.

26
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.420
<v 0>He tell you that you didn't listen to? He.</v>

27
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.680
<v 1>Tried to tell me to calm down.</v>

28
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.060
Like when you see me like walk out for that fight, I was on,

29
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.220
I wouldn't even like on 10, I was on 12.

30
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.290
I was on 12 from the morning that I woke up until,

31
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350
you know, until the fight ended. Uh,

32
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.470
and that adrenaline pumping that. I mean, I,

33
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.470
I never felt like that since I probably don't.

34
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.560
I don't really want to feel like that either. Uh, I was,

35
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.840
when I stepped into the arena that night, you know,

36
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:48.300
we get there about two hours before the fight actually is going on.

37
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.410
I was ready to fight. And when I was warming up, I was ready to fight.

38
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.800
I was fighting people in the bag. There was no warmup. There was no warmup.

39
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.023
I was fighting.

40
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.490
<v 0>No. How, how much did that staff with you?</v>

41
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.780
<v 1>I think it, it put me into a state of fight or flight.</v>

42
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.480
<v 0>Because you were compromised.</v>

43
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.870
<v 1>For days before, you know, not even just that, that, you know,</v>

44
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.070
the day of the fight, put me in that state for,

45
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:15.570
for days before where it made the weight cut. Uh,

46
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.760
so horrible, like,

47
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.480
because my body is just trying to hold on to everything and trying to, you know,

48
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.440
when I woke up that morning, I was about 1 62.

49
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.550
I woke up at 5:00 AM weigh-ins or at 9:00 AM. I had to be 1 55.

50
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.170
So I've got seven pounds to, to cut, which is okay, you know,

51
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.930
it's not too bad. Cut about nine pounds of the day before.

52
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.700
I'm a little dehydrate, I'm a little, you know, I'm a little already worn, but,

53
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.430
uh, as the way cut was going, you know,

54
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.580
we got till about eight o'clock and I had only cut a pound and a half.

55
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.100
So I still 1 61 in a half,

56
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:54.630
something at eight o'clock weigh-ins or at nine o'clock to the point where we

57
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.470
gotta do something.

58
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.160
So they start to put me in the bathtub just because we do most of our

59
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.640
cuts in the bath. You know, when you, when you're in a high humidity,

60
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.030
you you're going to cut more water weight, or you're going to sweat more. Uh,

61
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.060
and water is obviously a hundred percent humidity. Um,

62
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.270
so they start throwing bull and hot water.

63
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.020
Cause we couldn't get the water hot enough to make me sweat more Christ.

64
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:21.670
So we just take a kettles of, of hot water and just pouring it on me. Uh,

65
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.271
and you know,

66
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:27.010
doctors are in and out twin 12 people in and out of the hotel room to make sure

67
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.920
I'm okay. And I make sure that I could cut the weight.

68
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.370
And I was just in such a, like an adrenaline

69
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.590
like on 10 I'm like, just get up, you know, I'm screaming at everybody.

70
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.790
I literally, I was in the tub. I was crying like why?

71
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.800
But to me, I was like,

72
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:49.060
there's no way I'm not making this weight and six

73
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.630
pounds. And about an hour, maybe two hours,

74
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.490
cause like weighed in about nine o'clock or so, uh, or, I mean, uh, about 9 30,

75
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.840
10 or so, um, six pounds in two hours, this,

76
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.250
it was brutal, but I think that just kept me as such a,

77
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.800
such a tin on my adrenaline level.

78
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.320
I never really understood how to bring it back down, you know,

79
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.740
and Rob would try and talk to me and try and tell me like, Hey, calm down, like,

80
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.350
you know, take a few deep breaths. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'm breathing,

81
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.290
whatever I'm listening. I wasn't listening to it. So.

82
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.540
<v 0>Now when did you know you had staff?</v>

83
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.120
<v 1>Uh, the Sunday, the Sunday before?</v>

84
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.840
<v 0>Yeah. Oh geez. So you had a whole week to think about it almost.</v>

85
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.680
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I think about it like that as, just to be honest with you,</v>

86
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.950
which is notice I noticed like a little, uh,

87
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.320
just the bump and it,

88
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.400
and it got like really big and I thought a spider had bit me or something. Um,

89
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.150
and you know, for, for Sunday I just kinda, you know, I didn't think about it.

90
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:50.670
I wasn't trained in that day. So it was nothing when I went in on Monday, uh,

91
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.010
Dewey was actually the one, uh, Dewey Cooper, my striking coach.

92
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.220
He was the one that kinda noticed it. And he was like, Hey, is that all right?

93
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:01.000
And you know, uh, and then Rob, when he took a look at it, he was like, oh yeah,

94
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.380
that's that's staff for sure. And, uh, you know, I just kinda, what did.

95
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.300
<v 0>When that happens, if you can't, if you're not,</v>

96
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.360
you decided not to take antibiotics. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you do?

97
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.240
<v 1>I roughed it.</v>

98
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.930
<v 0>I was just roughed it. You didn't put anything topical on it or was there,</v>

99
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.850
was there a scratch that got infected?

100
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.370
<v 1>I honestly have no idea when I just, when I woke up on Sunday, it was just,</v>

101
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.200
was sticking out of my chest till about, but right here in it,

102
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.880
I thought it was a spider bite or something, you know,

103
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:32.290
I had never really had staff like that before. Um, I knew guys who had had it,

104
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.330
especially through college wrestling, uh,

105
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.310
those rooms are just so dirty and filthy, um, that I seen other people with it,

106
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.770
but it didn't look like that. You know what I mean? You normally look like a,

107
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.730
uh, uh, um, you know,

108
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.180
you have an open wound or something and then that'll get yellow and pissy and

109
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.940
disgusting, but this was underneath my skin.

110
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.320
So it was not like open moon or anything. Um, when I talked to doctors,

111
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.110
they said it was just on the layer of muscle, I guess, or, or something. Um,

112
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.780
and kind of sticking out from it. Um,

113
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.440
at the time I didn't really know what that meant. Like he said,

114
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:10.220
it was staff and I was like, okay, you know, like I still feel good.

115
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.340
Like I can still move around. Like we hit pads that day. I've still felt good.

116
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:16.130
You know, I can, I was like, I'm showing up to fight. You know, I,

117
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.030
when I saw that.

118
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.190
<v 0>Anything on it or there was no.</v>

119
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.570
So for six days you just trained and did everything with that staff.

120
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.900
<v 1>And that was kind of like the last thing on my mind, even, you know,</v>

121
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.260
I was there to fight when I, when I, when I signed the contract,

122
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:34.880
I I'm showing up to the fight. Like I haven't pulled out of a fight yet. Uh,

123
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.060
when I say I'm gonna do something, I'm, I'm going, I'm gonna go ahead and do it.

124
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.060
Regardless of if my leg was halfway falling off, it's like,

125
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.390
I still got another one. You know, I still got five more toes on the other leg,

126
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:44.750
so.

127
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.270
<v 0>Right. But looking back on it now,</v>

128
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:49.520
you happy that you made the decision that you made. Oh yeah.

129
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.410
<v 1>It wasn't smart, but you know.</v>

130
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.940
<v 0>But you would have done it again tomorrow.</v>

131
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.130
<v 1>Yeah, no doubt, no doubt. I mean, first world title fight, you know.</v>

132
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.900
<v 0>Do you do anything to prevent staff?</v>

133
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.760
Do you use like defense soap or anything like that?

134
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.970
<v 1>Yeah. Ever since you actually hooked me up with, uh, with those guys, a defense,</v>

135
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.500
uh, glad you did that. Yeah. They, they been great. So, uh, I shot the guy.

136
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.040
Yeah.

137
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.970
<v 0>Yeah. That's taco.</v>

138
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.220
<v 1>There also. So not just take way more preventive, uh, uh, yeah,</v>

139
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.260
I haven't had anything flare up on me since, uh, probiotics here and there,

140
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:22.160
here, and they're a good.

141
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.070
<v 0>Way to prevent that as well. It also helps prevent ringworm.</v>

142
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.360
<v 1>Um, I try, I try my best to eat as many natural foods, uh,</v>

143
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.290
and especially like a lot of yogurts and, and Kiefer is one of them. Cool. Uh,

144
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:36.980
so I, you know, I try and stay on top of it and, uh, at least I, I not,

145
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.440
no flare up has been happening to since, you know,

146
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.370
I shower every time I make sure like, I'm on top of it.

147
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:44.540
I make sure I break my soap and I shower. Cause.

148
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.140
<v 0>You don't want that again. It's mostly the.</v>

149
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.480
<v 1>The, you know, yeah, the fight didn't go my way or whatever. Uh,</v>

150
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:54.110
but it was about three or four weeks after that flight where I was just,

151
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.160
uh, I was wrecked. I was just in a worst shape ever. And when, when it,

152
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.710
when I got on those antibiotics, I just kills.

153
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.550
<v 0>People. Styling.</v>

154
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.570
<v 1>Kills people.</v>

155
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.080
<v 0>It was terrible. People would ignore staff. I want to scream at them. I'm like,</v>

156
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:09.620
listen, man, you could die this. It seems like you just got an infection,

157
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:13.430
but that gets systemic. It gets in your bloodstream and you could die.

158
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.130
One of my friend,

159
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.800
Brian Callan's friend's wife died and he went over to the house and she was

160
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.130
like, you know, some people get crazy with holistic stuff. Oh,

161
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.150
she's just going to try natural healing. And he's like, get her, do a doctor.

162
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.790
He's like her gums were bleeding. Jesus. Yeah.

163
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.780
It had gotten systemic and she wound up dying. Geez. Yeah, man from staff,

164
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.510
I've had it twice. And uh, the first time I had it,

165
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:39.800
I see when I got on the antibiotics, first of all the antibiotics kick your.

166
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.350
The fact that Luke Rockhold won the title against Chris Weidman while he was

167
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:49.310
on antibiotics shows you what a stud that guy is. Yeah.

168
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.300
Cause that kicks your. He had, he had staff when he fought Weidman.

169
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.853
<v 1>Yeah, he was.</v>

170
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.910
<v 0>Wrecked. Right.</v>

171
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.950
<v 1>I know those antibiotics mess you up bad.</v>

172
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.260
I've done them once for like a sore throat or, or something, uh, earlier, um,

173
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.450
a couple of years ago and it just wrecked me bad.

174
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:08.190
So I knew like going into that fight, I was like,

175
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.490
I'd rather have the staff than the antibiotics. I was like,

176
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.890
I haven't a stabbed before I've had the antibodies.

177
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.750
I know what they're going to do to me. So I was thinking.

178
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.710
<v 0>That when you fought and afterwards talking to you about,</v>

179
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.570
I think you probably made the right move to not do antibiotics,

180
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:24.450
but I don't know, I'm not a doctor, but I was thinking that,

181
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:26.460
that it just weakens you so much.

182
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.150
<v 1>Just you, you live and learn from these things. I think, you know, it's,</v>

183
00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:35.700
it's just part of the journey. And before I would have like that,

184
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:40.380
where I wanted everything to be perfect or I wanted everything to kind of be the

185
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.620
way I saw it, you know, especially like starting out the career,

186
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:47.040
like everybody wants to be Floyd and when you 50 and oh, and, and it's just,

187
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.010
you're not getting touched and it's just easy. Uh,

188
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.370
but then when you take a look back at that and you don't see like how many

189
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.370
amateur fights Floyd had, you know, he's got his dad who fought,

190
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:58.800
he's got his uncles and his whole family been fighting.

191
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.910
So he's learned from all their mistakes and all their losses and everything, uh,

192
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.451
to where it's like,

193
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:05.970
I'm the first one in my family to even ever think about this.

194
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:10.380
So you're going to bump your head here and there. And it just is what it is,

195
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:10.650
you know?

196
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.600
<v 0>And Paris one is the thief of joy. Yeah. Yes. You can't, you can't do that.</v>

197
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.310
You got to just think about being the best that you can. It.

198
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.370
<v 1>Is hard. It's very.</v>

199
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.780
<v 0>Hard. You'd be inspired by people,</v>

200
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:26.100
but by comparing yourself to their path and everybody's got a different path,

201
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.630
everyone's got different genetics, right?

202
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:29.820
Some people are just better at certain things. Some people are,

203
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.180
some people struggle with certain aspects of the sport. I mean, that's, it's,

204
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:35.040
everyone's got their own individual challenge. I mean,

205
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:38.070
it's one of the things that's so interesting about it is watching people adapt

206
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:38.610
and grow.
