00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So well, you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.960
there is good evidence that lionsmane also, uh, compensates in many of these,

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.960
uh, neuroogenic benefits. That's also stuff all the time.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.720
This is like a lions man. Deixer that? I, I pour tell me if that any good. Well,

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.350
it from China and is that bad? Um,

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.310
every Chinese expert I've met,

7
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.390
they said I wouldn't dare buy a mushroom from China. Geez, Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.550
So this is, we have a spoonable lions, man. I see what you got. And uh,

9
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:37.510
I put that in smoothies all the time and that's my go-to and that's what exactly

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.950
the research. Can I put it in coffee? Yeah, I put it in coffee and Jamie do,

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.980
can you pull up that? How much should I put in there?

12
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:47.700
The neurogenesis benefits of lions main? How much should I put in? Oh,

13
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:51.060
it's open. It's not open yet, right? No, it's how much should I put in there?

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.133
I put a,

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.620
about a teaspoon teaspoon and it stird in about that,

16
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.020
but the, the neuro that's good. And the neurogenes the,

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.450
this company in France that we did the neuroogenic test with found that the

18
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.970
mysilllium was far more active than the mushroom fruit pot.

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.970
And so the lions main stimulates, uh,

20
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.850
neuroite outgrowth and basically extends the nerves from, from,

21
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.690
uh, from growing compared to baseline. Yeah.

22
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.800
So in seven to 12 days of substantial up to 22% increase

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.280
in neuro uh, outgrowth, what we found was actually there was one was, um,

24
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.800
at 8%, one was at 12% and then, um, separately,

25
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.880
we stacked it with an analog of soulsybin and rather than then being the earth

26
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:42.280
medic earthmatic additive of cumulative, we found the synergy.

27
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.510
So we think that lionsma,

28
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.190
the research is shown increases Mylin regeneration on the sheath of

29
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:53.990
the nerves and theilocy proliferates nerve tip growth.

30
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.150
So it should conceivably help you learn. This is, so this is an example,

31
00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:02.830
this is unexpected result. This islysna meinium, uh,

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.780
showing a 14, uh, you know, basically a 14.8% of a baseline.

33
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.780
Then we have ail Ibin analog that didn't do all that. Great.

34
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.180
Which analog is this again? This is a, I'm gonna cribe the analog for now. Okay.

35
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.020
Uh, for obvious reasons, but it's a legal analog. It creates a 7%,

36
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.930
uh outgreth of neuro, but then we stacked it with lionsman. Uh,

37
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.090
and, and the sy&lt;inaudible&gt; analog. There's a theoretical additive effect,

38
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.130
one 14 plus 1 0 7 1 22,

39
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.530
but we got 1 36 statistically significant the outlier actually is even higher.

40
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.730
So the neuro neuro,

41
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.080
the neuro scientists in France that did this study was extremely excited.

42
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.360
And we found that, and the more we titrated it to greater dilution,

43
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.200
the more active it becomes. What's that mean, well, what titrate?

44
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.921
What does that mean? Well,

45
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:02.880
may the we're Del it and it is our human cellspoent stem cells.

46
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.480
And what we found was originally, uh,

47
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.240
we were told it is called three micrograms, uh,

48
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.520
per milligram or three micrograms and millionth ofmogram. Um,

49
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.280
but when we went back to, to, uh,

50
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.190
0.0 300 times less,

51
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.830
the neurogenic benefits became greater.

52
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.990
Now there's something called the PK conversion. The,

53
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.030
the pharmacokineetics when you ingest something only a,

54
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.550
a small portion of it may make it into your bloodstream. So,

55
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.630
but the good news is,

56
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.460
is that these things are so non-toxic and they're so potent now

57
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.420
looking at the dosing regimen, it appears so far,

58
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.260
we haven't done this clinically. This is human cells in vitro,

59
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.260
but this laboratory is predictive of neuroogenic compounds. Um,

60
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.020
that these PO the neuroogenic benefits are so substantial, uh,

61
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:01.010
that the PK conversion of ingesting them could be seen in the bloodstream,

62
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.130
um, as a fairly good conversion rate. So you, for instance,

63
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:07.130
if you take, um,

64
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.650
vanillaic acid vanilla about 2% will make it into your bloodstream.

65
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.610
So if you take a one whole gram of vanilla,

66
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.250
only 2% actually get gets in your bloodstream. So that that's the PK conversion.

67
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.080
So what we're seeing is right now,

68
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.400
the potency of this is so strong at lower and lower dilutions.

69
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.360
We're getting more and more potency. So I'm, this is, yeah, it's a,

70
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.720
it's a, I like to say dilution is a solution to profitability.

71
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.120
The more we dilute, the more potent it becomes.

72
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:40.160
So this is why the neuroscientists in France are doing the study going this

73
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:43.790
stuff is potent, please. Dilut it. Dilut it. Dilut it. So, wow.

74
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.950
And so we're, we see this as a tremendous horizon, um,

75
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.030
that lionain's legal,

76
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.270
it's an edible and choice mushroom thousand year history of use. Um,

77
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.590
I, we found that my sillium is far more potent in the mushrooms for really good

78
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:04.980
reasons. &lt;affirmative&gt; the, the com some of the compounds are called anaines.

79
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.180
And these are actually discovered by kaghishhi in 1994,

80
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.020
looking for an antibacteriaal agent. And so when they,

81
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.420
when he was looking at the myilllium, uh, fighting bacteribacteria,

82
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.970
he found that the myilllium expressed this antibacterial Yhan and derivative,

83
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.490
and he gave it the name anaine after Hericium,

84
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.970
anaius just like penicillin named after penicilium.

85
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.570
And so he'd stumbled on the fact that it has neuroogenic properties and

86
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.323
antiactbacteriaial properties.

87
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.170
So the micilium is navigating through the ground through a hostile environments,

88
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:41.970
only one cell wall thick it, the,

89
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:46.720
my isilllium has an immune system that's operational between like 40 degrees

90
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:51.160
Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, you know, 35 degrees Celsius. That's,

91
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:53.000
that's, that's the window that it's growing in.

92
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.680
So its immune system is operative in that window.

93
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.720
When you do super hot water extracts, you're in the extreme zone.

94
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.680
That's not part of the immunological lifespan of the mushroom. You're,

95
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.160
decocting it you're taking out ingredients, but you're not harnessing, uh,

96
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:09.880
within the meological, uh,

97
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.480
window of temperatures that the micilllium has evolved to fight off pathogens.

98
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.360
And so what we have found is the,

99
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:20.030
my isilium is far more active than the fruit bodies. This is all new science,

100
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.830
but then mushroom references.com.

101
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.790
It is populated with dozens upon dozens of peerviewed articles,

102
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:30.270
showing the myilium is far more active than the fruit bodies and, um,

103
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.390
a whole genome sequencing of raychi for instance, found 25 more,

104
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.340
25% more genes coding for proteins are expressed at the

105
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.500
myial state than at the mushroom state. Well,

106
00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:45.020
it makes sense because the mushrooms at the end of millions of cell divisions

107
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:46.060
over months, years,

108
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.860
even decades finally produced a mushroom that rots in five days, right?

109
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.420
The mushroom doesn't need a good immune system is attracting Michael vores,

110
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.770
animals, deer. Um, you know, John just showed me some photograph. So, um,

111
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.730
he's gonna show you, he was in a campground and found deer in the morning,

112
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.730
digging up mushrooms out of the ground. Well, animals engaged mushrooms, your,

113
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:10.690
your, one of your colleagues here, or maybe it's Jeff, I'm sorry.

114
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.610
<v 1>Jeff. One of the guys who works here. Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay.</v>

115
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.480
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, okay. Um, so the idea, but, but anyway, mushrooms attract, uh, people,</v>

116
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.200
animals, um, because they're frequent, uh, they're protein,

117
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.040
they're nutritionally dense, and they want to engage humans.

118
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.360
The micilllium is navigating through a microbilia hostile environment.

119
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.600
And a report came out in the literature of a thousand species of bacteria and a

120
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:39.030
single gram there's more than eight miles of micilium and a to say, well,

121
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:39.730
cubic inch.

122
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.950
So the myilllium is navigating through a hostile microbial environment is

123
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:43.784
setting up, uh,

124
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.470
guilds and microbiomes and collections of cooperating bacteria that can help

125
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:50.990
them defend against pathogens. Look at that.

126
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.870
<v 1>Estimated up to eight miles of myscellium in a single inch of soil.</v>

127
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.790
<v 0>And it's only one cell wall thick. That's such.</v>

128
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.620
<v 1>A weird looking. So it's.</v>

129
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.660
<v 0>So hard to see what that is.</v>

130
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.460
That's a mushroom that's melted back into the ground. Wow. Is mycillium,

131
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:07.620
that's just now the mushroomsgenerate mycillium and it goes underneath the

132
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:10.260
ground. So every time you're walking on the ground,

133
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.700
you're walking upon miles upon miles of myilllium and it knows that you're

134
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:19.460
there. It, these are sensitive. These are not only externalized stomachs.

135
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.970
There are digesting nutrients and externalized lungs exhaling, carbon oxide,

136
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:29.730
inhaling oxygen. But I believe these are, uh, extent, uh,

137
00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:31.890
neurological networks of nature.

138
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.930
When you see that pervasiveness of those cells and the climate change scientists

139
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:41.400
are coming around to this 70% of the carbon biologically is stored in myilllium

140
00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:45.080
in the ground. The way to fight climate change is not only replanting trees,

141
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:47.160
which is great. I love it. Uh,

142
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.840
but it's the myicial networks you're building in the Humis that creates the soil

143
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:54.280
that creates the biodiversity, that then guarantees the health of the ecosystem.

144
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.480
So it's the myceial networks that govern, cuz they're so pervasive,

145
00:08:58.481 --> 00:09:01.000
they set up because they're antibacteriaal properties,

146
00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:03.520
they're pro bacteribacteriaal properties. Um,

147
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.920
and another example of this is in the microbiome of soils and inside human

148
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.480
stomachs, uh, Turkey, tail mushrooms, and a placebo controlled,

149
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.470
uh, uh, random, uh, uh, uh,

150
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.750
a randomized clinical study with humans, uh,

151
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.830
from a sun scientist associated with Harvard found that turkeytail mysilium is a

152
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.670
prebiotic for the microbiome that feeds, uh,

153
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.950
bifido bacterium lelactopbacills, uh, and suppresses cloriddium,

154
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:34.630
which is an inflammatory bacterium. So it's really,

155
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.860
really an interesting that the micilllium is feeding nutrients to

156
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:44.500
the beneficial bacteria within the microbiome that then gives us health.

157
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.380
And so, uh, it's,

158
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.460
these are precursor nutrients that elevate the populations of the beneficial

159
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.300
bacteria. So the two go hand in hand. Now what about edible.

160
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.290
<v 1>Mushrooms? Things like shitakki and those type of mushrooms,</v>

161
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.090
is there any nutritional benefit.

162
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.250
<v 0>To those things? Uh, enormous nutritional benefit.</v>

163
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.210
And there's been two also meta studies that have come out this year, um,

164
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:11.170
showing, um, that, um, the ingestion of, of, um,

165
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.110
of,

166
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.840
of mushrooms with elderly people over the age of 60 there's a 50%,

167
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.760
uh, decrease odds of alzheimer'slike symptoms,

168
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.240
a population of people consuming three mushroom meals per week.

169
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.880
Now they didn't specify the mushrooms as not a Singapore. Um,

170
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.680
but the mushrooms that are commonly eating are oyster mushrooms,

171
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.360
Chi talking and shamaji and may, and maybe some of some other mushrooms,

172
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.110
but that's that's once meta study that came out,

173
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.470
there was a study out of Japan from Dr. Ikikawa, uh,

174
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:47.270
at the national cancer center that found statistically significant reduction in

175
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:51.710
cancers across the board, I think 162,000 people in this data set.

176
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.390
And he was sent over the naanafe perfecture to look for this.

177
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:58.300
Now these are edible and delicious mushrooms also empower the immune system

178
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.420
again, signal from the noise,

179
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.380
statistically significant reduction in overall cancer rates associated with a

180
00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:08.460
food, the division now between, you know,

181
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.020
foods and medicines is blurred.

182
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.180
And yet it speaks to hippocratees in a,

183
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:18.610
in dioccl varieties stating that let food be I medicine and medicine to be like

184
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.970
food. So it's interesting because, uh, physicians have been taught, you know,

185
00:11:22.971 --> 00:11:25.090
this sort of monomolecular approach to medicine.

186
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.170
And now we're realizing that these foods are essential nutrients for your immune

187
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:34.090
system, that, that, uh, downregulates inflammation. It's so interesting.

188
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.090
<v 1>That we're learning all this during our lifetime too.</v>

189
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.880
So you think that would all be.

190
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.560
<v 0>Established by now? Well, I'm,</v>

191
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.400
I'm glad you asked that we have a paper coming out in the next, uh,

192
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.640
two or three days, maybe in the next week and this on, uh, Turkey tail meicium,

193
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:48.580
um,

194
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.480
the grown on rice and we were able to find out something that no one had really

195
00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:54.080
reported in the literature. The,

196
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:57.160
the traditional Chinese medicine approach is that these are immunomodulators.

197
00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.280
They help the immune system, but they also are not inflammatory.

198
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.000
When you have an immune response,

199
00:12:02.001 --> 00:12:05.560
oftentimes associated with an inflammatory response, blood rushes to the wound.

200
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.480
You inflame, you have all these,

201
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.400
these compounds that are being produced by the blood to, to suppress, uh,

202
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.683
in infection,

203
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.790
but you can overampmp the immune system and have an a pro-flammatory response

204
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:22.430
that can cause a lot of oxidative stress damage collaterally.

205
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.870
And so the article that that's just coming out with BMC, um, um,

206
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.830
bio central, um, uh,

207
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.820
alternative a compliary medicine peer reviewed, um,

208
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.660
we have found that the micilllium when it grows on rice,

209
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.140
bioferments the rice to then produce a unique immunological

210
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.460
response that upregulatees, what's called interleukin one RA and interleukin 10.

211
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.940
These are anti-inflammatory, uh, cytokines.

212
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.890
And so the myilllium doesn't do the mushrooms don't do that,

213
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.330
but the myilllium is biofermented the rice, uh, like Tempe is,

214
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.370
is transfformed or like yogurt comes from milk

215
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.890
because of, of a lelactovaccius or aciddohas.

216
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.570
And that transformation then makes it novel product.

217
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.690
We found the same thing that they,

218
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.880
the rice compared to the rice control has no anti-inflammatory properties.

219
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.760
The micilllium because of the excellularator metabolites changes the rice into a

220
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.800
unique immunological product that excites the expression of

221
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.000
anti-inflammatory compounds while also exciting the pro-immune response.

222
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.680
So it's a buffered response.

223
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.870
<v 2>So.</v>
