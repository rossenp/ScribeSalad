00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.900
<v 3>So that lead you from a hut. You're staying down. They stop, they go stop,</v>

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.430
listen to the insects and the river. He goes, that's going to be amplified soon.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.020
I don't know. Okay. It comes. And they, the woman, uh,

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.830
the Shama wears his head dress. And she beats you with these leaves and rubs.

6
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:23.370
This says whatever chance she says and rubs his stone all over,

7
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:25.860
you gives you the Iowasca tastes like

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.600
tastes like whatever's left in this ashtray. And you just drank it down.

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.830
They say your partner on this side of the fire, you're on this side of the fire.

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.960
You don't talk, he's having his trip. You're having your trip. That's it.

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.420
Um, um, you might throw up because that is the Iowasca,

12
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.960
doesn't make a trip to Iowa. It takes everything out of you. And then the

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.800
chunk I have written down actually

14
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.420
chacruna was the, oh, that's a different drug.

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.460
<v 1>Yeah. So I was clear as you Alyssa chacruna in this case, do it. They showed,</v>

16
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.580
they showed me where the iOS came from plants at 80 years before they planted

17
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:10.200
it. So drank it, I'm laying there on a mat. It was just like a thin,

18
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:15.070
thin mat next to his fire in this like HUD hut. Um, I don't,

19
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
I I'm a bit worried about like anacondas and Jaguars and stuff, but like,

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.180
um, so she says, the Shawmut says,

21
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.260
I'm your mother here die WASA. The root is your grandmother.

22
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.190
My son who's, who's trained to be a shaman. He is your brother.

23
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.360
And the fire is your ancestors. Um,

24
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.800
so I drank it. He said, stare at the fire for about five minutes.

25
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.634
Then go lay down.

26
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.230
My partner started throwing up 10 minutes in going to the edge.

27
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.280
There's two entrances to the thing, store it up. I just wasn't coming. It.

28
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:54.840
Wasn't coming a little bit of like a light capita stem mushroom feel about,

29
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.210
I don't know, hour and a half or so. And then I started getting nauseous,

30
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:01.680
but I'm sorry, I'm trying to choke it down.

31
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:04.800
Like don't don't and then it hit me like, oh, I think I'm supposed to like,

32
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.750
supposed to throw up. So I kinda like pitch black. I mean,

33
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:14.460
away from the fire went to the, the edge and then like, you know,

34
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:17.280
how you can like, sort of like, and then barked like a little bit,

35
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.440
and then just unloaded.

36
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.910
I was afraid it would be like retching and retching. It wasn't that, um,

37
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.790
just like unloaded. And then he's right there.

38
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.450
The shaman's like trainee son with a bowl of water.

39
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.980
He was pushed around. Don't drink it. And he goes, uh, are you having visions,

40
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.140
dude? I don't know how he was.

41
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.320
I don't know how he's communicating to me in Spanish.

42
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.120
I barely speak Spanish and he barely speaks Spanish, but it enough,

43
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.430
I guess I was like, he was like, are you having visions? And I was like, yeah,

44
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.230
they're more of like, kind of mental, like a mental mushrooms, mental.

45
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:01.480
And he goes, okay, go back. Be strong.

46
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.970
I don't know how he was conveying this to me. But he was like,

47
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:11.440
okay, go be strong, go lay down there. And like, you have to like be strong.

48
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.290
So then it just opened up and so more than an hour and a half in,

49
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.610
more than an hour and a half out of a seven hour trip. Wow. Um,

50
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.310
yeah, it took a while partner was going immediately, but like, uh,

51
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.120
I see these like fractals and like an,

52
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.900
a K G geometric shapes and occasional like splashes of,

53
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.030
and this is the roof of the hut, right?

54
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.280
So there's nothing there and an occasional,

55
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:41.800
like real splash of like vivid neon light.

56
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.920
And then I started seeing these like orbs kind of like going up into

57
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:51.880
the fractals. And then the more I looked forward and back I'm on my back,

58
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:53.380
but more like forward, backwards side of the side,

59
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:57.190
there's just hundreds or thousands of these, these orbs,

60
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.990
these small orbs going up into the fractals and just sort of like playing with

61
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.290
each other, these orders, they were kind of like had a life to them.

62
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.690
So like,

63
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.370
and then at some point from me comes this orb and sorta like goes up and then I

64
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:17.080
started examining what the orbs are. So look, look,

65
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.850
I don't know. I don't know about any of this stuff,

66
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.270
but this is just what it gave me. I don't know. You know, same as mushrooms.

67
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.330
I don't know if it's just scientific or if it's like, uh, another realm,

68
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.250
whatever. Right? The orbs were.

69
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.220
I call it when you pure something, when you pure it to me, they were,

70
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.930
they were moments of pure artistic expression. You ever have a,

71
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.330
like a set or, or, or a Jew or a role where you're like,

72
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.680
I hit every move you get in the zone. You're in the zone. Sure. You pured it,

73
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.740
you know, in golf, Jamie, you might know. It's like,

74
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:57.400
when you hit one and you're just like like up, but you're like,

75
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.760
I can't hit the green from here. You do see it go perfectly and bounce.

76
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.390
And it's just a pure moment of artistic expression.

77
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.110
And generally when I see that, it makes me cry when I listed to nevermind,

78
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.850
I start, I tear up, you know, you ever hear that album? And you're like, oh,

79
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:16.770
this is th they nailed it. You nailed it. Nailed it. Uh,

80
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.740
cigar de Familia in Barcelona, this church that was being built still,

81
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:25.450
it was a 200 year plan to build the perfect church St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

82
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.140
Okay. And you see it stunning. And I worked in there. I just thought, I mean,

83
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:33.070
I started we'd start crying. Yeah. It's like, I don't know. It's just like,

84
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.870
it's overwhelmingly perfect. It's art. Yeah. Other moments I was at, um,

85
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.250
the, um, it doesn't have to be big moments. It could be small moments.

86
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:43.270
I was at the, um,

87
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.340
haunted ride at Disney back in LA and I was with some chick and

88
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:52.480
I was like, some guy was like, oh right. This was, uh, you know, and like pitch,

89
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.310
he's playing the role, whatever. And then like,

90
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:58.010
he left to go greet the next like car. And as we were slowly moving forward,

91
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.080
and then I was like, oh, I thought it was creepy. Right.

92
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.990
And then he was back on me to go, Ooh, there's you say?

93
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.480
It just like frightened me. And I'm like, that guy nailed it.

94
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.040
And that moment we were both jumped. He nailed it. Right. He peered it.

95
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.240
And what you want in those moments, you did it. Right.

96
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:19.070
You made this thing and that's the orb and what you want is to make it for sure.

97
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.570
But you also want, is some recognition. You want someone to say, like,

98
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:25.520
if you hit that golf shot, you look around, like,

99
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:29.450
if you're playing by yourself and somebody that next he's like, dude, nice one.

100
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:32.060
You're like, yes, thank you. You saw it. You saw it. Right.

101
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.650
And so there's been two things.

102
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.240
I've gotten that way to two things that I've had that I'm like, I,

103
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.190
I appeared it. Um, one was that storytelling show.

104
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.030
This is not happening. I just think it was like, I mean,

105
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:55.010
I don't, I don't want to talk about myself, but like, it was cool. And it,

106
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:58.280
it nailed was a way for other comics to show themselves.

107
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.760
<v 2>Can express it for you. You did an amazing thing.</v>

108
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.420
And those opening sequences where you'd have like these animated fight scenes

109
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.650
and, there were awesome.

110
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.310
<v 1>Cool and fun to watch. And let people go like, Hey,</v>

111
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:12.800
we're not going to censor you. Right. We want you to do your thing. You're a,

112
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.450
a strip club.

113
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.680
And the woods story is like these moments that I'm also allowing other people

114
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:20.540
to, like, I figured out my orbs,

115
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:25.130
what I do is make stuff myself and then also give a chance for other people to

116
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:25.511
make theirs.

117
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:29.030
It's one of my things I like making you have the same thing where you like

118
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.440
having other people make their things.

119
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.770
It's one of your art forms is allowing other people to make their art.

120
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.550
Another one was this last hour I did the Jew hour. It was, it was good.

121
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.650
It was really, it was good. And so it would have bothered me at the time.

122
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:48.590
I wasn't able to like, make it as special, but it was able to,

123
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:53.480
in that moment to go, but I made it, it was good. You know,

124
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:57.860
I made a really, really mindful kind of perfect thing.

125
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.930
And yeah, maybe whatever happened.

126
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:02.090
Like I wasn't able to make like millions of people saw it,

127
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.520
but like thousands of people saw it,

128
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.030
maybe 150,000 people saw it live, you know?

129
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.760
But like I made it and I cried hard for

130
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:18.200
that, for this not happening, not so much that like for the loss, but for like,

131
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.440
for like when I, I was able to, I was able to step back and go, like,

132
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:29.120
it's done now. I made it. And it, it hit me like, oh, dude,

133
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:33.530
that was good. And I just kind of said goodbye to it.

134
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.870
And that orb went up and played for

135
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:39.470
eternity.

136
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.770
Every time you do something like artistically pure like that and nail it,

137
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:47.660
you pure it. Those things are up there in the heavens and the whatever

138
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.180
they're playing with each other, all the forms that guy at Disney,

139
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.990
the guy who made the Basilica NEF, uh, Kurt Cobain,

140
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.880
nevermind, not Kurt Cobain, nevermind is up there playing with each other,

141
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.370
enjoying each other's company forever.

142
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.650
And I saw myself in 50 years dead and the orbs is still

143
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.140
playing and I'm decaying and the orbs is still playing.

144
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.003
There'll be there forever.

145
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.960
And I was able to sort of like put that behind me and say,

146
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:20.100
I'll move on to my next thing,

147
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.060
because what I want to do is I want to make things right.

148
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.630
I want to make another orb. And that's kind of,

149
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.100
all I want to do now is just make another thing. And I won't always get there.

150
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.920
But even if you fail, even if you're like, ah, that's, that was so, so,

151
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.870
you know, what's getting you closer to a perfect set.

152
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.670
And sometimes it's just a 15 minutes set at the whatever club, you know,

153
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.890
uh, governors or some where it's like, oh,

154
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:46.290
I nailed that somebody has a 10 minute pop. And you're like,

155
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.070
stop that earthquake thing that I saw at the ha that was one.

156
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.910
Cause there was some kid, some young one-year comic watching that going,
