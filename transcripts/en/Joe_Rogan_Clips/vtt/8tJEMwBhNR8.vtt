00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.560
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. And some, some people make that argument with, you know,</v>

2
00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.400
Floyd Mayweather said, listen, his uncle,

3
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:10.360
his dad he's been doing since he was about six he's the best argument,

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.640
the best argument. Yeah. The best argument who he never gets hit,

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.400
he's been hit in a professional career. That's spanned 49 fights.

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.630
He's been hit maybe hard seven or eight times. True. The, the, the only,

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.670
and there's a few X factors in the, in this fight. The,

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.750
the only kind of thing that gives people hope if you're on team MMA or team

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.430
Connor, which is not MMA versus Suboxone.

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.870
But if your team Connor is these X factors of Floyd's had two years off, right.

11
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:37.670
He said two years off, but in the past,

12
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.510
he's taking time off and comes back better.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.140
But he is 40 it's for that has to be something, you know, and the other thing,

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.940
why is he doing it? Is he doing it for money?

15
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.980
What's he's doing it for attention. Why is he coming back to get to 50?

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.700
And then, uh, the eight ounce gloves, which they officially approve today.

17
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.340
Eight ounce gloves is a huge, huge advance for con I think, man, it's all,

18
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.740
it's all interesting, man. But they're all X factors, right?

19
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:02.730
Like we don't really to be on. No one really knows.

20
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.370
I think I have an idea what I thinks gonna happen, but no one knows. Right. But,

21
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.170
and that's why I think the, the footage of Connor sparring,

22
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:13.050
poly is such a big deal. Cuz people go, oh, no, he can actually box.

23
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.410
And I even think Dan and the Ts who were there watching go, uh,

24
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.730
we actually got something here and that's why it was such a big deal.

25
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.400
Cause I think everyone's like, all right, Connor MMA. He's good.

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.000
I I've seen him move around. I'm saying this, this dude,

27
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.920
as far as boxing he's you've guys, some problems, is he the best,

28
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.800
all time problems? Who knows? What,

29
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.360
what kind of training had Paul been doing before that fight? Like how,

30
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.680
what kind of shape was he in? Yeah, not in, not in 12 round shape, you know?

31
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.080
And Paul just got, did the plane. Why did he do 12 rounds?

32
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.710
Why do he that's what they that. Right. But had he been training? Uh,

33
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.310
he got word from Connor's team that they're going to use them.

34
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.150
So he started to train some, but not like,

35
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310
it's not like he was getting ready for a fight fight, you know?

36
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.190
So that's what he said. He goes, man, you know, for me to go,

37
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:57.790
12 rounds was tough. Like I wasn't expecting to go all 12 rounds.

38
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.030
Cause the first day they used him,

39
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.070
I think he said he only did six or eight rounds. And then he was like, oh,

40
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.020
we're gonna spar tomorrow more. And I'll get in better shape stuff like that.

41
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:08.620
Get used to the fighting shape. And they, they didn't use them. Then he flew to,

42
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.460
uh, cover the, uh, Mikey Garcia, uh,

43
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.700
uh Broer fight and then came back and he was fresh off the plane.

44
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.900
And then he sparked 12 rounds. Mm. So he is like, they just did me dirty, man.

45
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.180
That's his whole thing. His, his feelings are hurt. He's like, why,

46
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.980
why would they do that, man? I's here to help him.

47
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.450
What they did that that's the kind of help they wanted.

48
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:27.810
They just wanted kind of help that he didn't want to give.

49
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.050
They wanted the kind of help where Connor beats a out of a world champion.

50
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.930
Correct. And that's what Connor said though. Yeah.

51
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.170
Like in Connor's defense when they go, oh you're bringing, Paul goes, yeah,

52
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:38.970
I'm bringing, he says it on Showtime during the media scrum. He goes, yeah,

53
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.730
I'm bringing him in the him up. And I think Paul thought oh, said that. Yeah.

54
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.200
He goes I'm. He goes, I'm gonna bring him in and him up.

55
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.200
&lt;laugh&gt; word for word that's on. That's on document. Yeah. That's document.

56
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.280
So then Paul gets in and goes, oh, we'll spar and be all good. But remember,

57
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.360
six months prior to this poll goes,

58
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.880
I could be Connor with one hand type behind my back. Oh,

59
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Connor's like a baby elephant. He stores that and was like, right man. Oh,

60
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.520
he said that mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whoops.

61
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.360
But he thought it was just hing the fight. You know,

62
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.840
he thought they'd spar and be like boys, but that just didn't happen.

63
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.520
Like Connors literally there just to prove a point. Well, he,

64
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.360
it's a very important point to prove before a giant fight like that.

65
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.200
Like that video alone is probably worth,

66
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.870
who knows how many thousand of hundreds of thousands of buys on of price

67
00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:24.430
priceless, priceless. That's worth so much money. I mean, how many more people,

68
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.390
a lot of people were gonna buy the fight anyway,

69
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.670
but how many more people are gonna buy the fight now that you see con landing

70
00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:32.430
that straight left and then dropping Pauling.

71
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:35.270
And Paul said is a push down mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you could see that it's

72
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:36.550
not a push down. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I mean,

73
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.620
it's just not mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if you get pushed down like that,

74
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.460
you probably concuss already. Yeah. If your balance is off,

75
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.740
I see what you're saying. That's so bad.

76
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:46.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like he was saying something about him getting grabbed in

77
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:49.460
the back of the head. You could watch it, watch the knockdown. Paul saying,

78
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.540
poll's saying it's dirty. And he, he, I get that. I get that.

79
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.340
But that he signed up for it. Its a fight. But the other thing is,

80
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.580
poll's saying, you know, and he goes, take what you want from the video goes.

81
00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:01.970
But I think come on his team and Dana up putting this out. Cuz now,

82
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.570
now Floyd may with the team knows, this is, this is how he fights.

83
00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:07.890
Like this is the dirty stuff he does so they can warn the rest.

84
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:10.450
They're nothing dirty there. The whole, the rabbit behind the head,

85
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.490
dirty inboxing. That's dirty. You can get away with it, but that's frowned upon.

86
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.850
It's gonna happen. Those rabbit punches. But Floyd's gonna do that. See this,

87
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:22.600
this part right here. Give me some volume on that. So you can hear that

88
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.520
He's hitting him hard, man. Okay. You know,

89
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.320
he hits him with a straight left.

90
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.080
That's clean and then it looks like he's wobbled and he hits him with the right

91
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:40.040
hand afterwards. Like play that part one more time when he goes down.

92
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.750
Like you can't, I don't see an argument.

93
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:47.350
I've tried to look at it of a push down. I don't see it. I don't see it.

94
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.750
This is the beginning part up. And that's a legit ref by the way. Yeah.

95
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.910
Yeah. Joe Cortez. Super legit. Ooh

96
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.100
Dude. He's beating the out of me. Okay.

97
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.100
I don't give a what anybody says.

98
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:11.540
Like if he can land those combinations on Paulina like that at any point in

99
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:15.420
life, that is yeah, man hitting that.

100
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.620
Validate that to me, that validates at the same time in Paul's defense,

101
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.930
you know, nine, 12 round in fight, shape. He's exhaust. Get all that.

102
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.890
I get all that. But still Paul should have never done that. Yeah. He must up,

103
00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:32.410
he must have underestimated him. You know? Uh, I had uh, uh, uh, Andre,

104
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.290
Beton on my show. He's supposed to help Connor out and he's like,

105
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.770
I ain't going up there. So I'm and he's he's he's good friends with con him,

106
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.330
Connor did rehab together. He's like, nah, I'm not going up there, man. He goes,

107
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.680
just speak. Cause and he had a good point. He goes,

108
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.960
let's say I go up there and help Connor. And for whatever reason,

109
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.240
he doesn't think he's gonna win. He goes,

110
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:50.040
let's say he bla fully made with in the face.

111
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.040
I'm gonna get so much hate from the boxing world. Like he's a fraternity man.

112
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.360
And he's like, and mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; the way he did poly. Like we just,

113
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.080
we can't do it. It man, he goes, I wish I'm the best,

114
00:05:58.081 --> 00:05:59.480
but I'm not gonna help him. Well,

115
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.400
I also think that if he's peaking and he's in full fight shape,

116
00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:04.680
but they're making you fight 12 rounds.

117
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.840
I mean that's when you're in the gym and you're sparring 12 rounds that isn't

118
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.080
that unusual that you get one guy to bark 12 rounds with you. Oh no, no, no.

119
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.800
It was designed for Paul to get beat up. Yeah. But, and I feel like, uh,

120
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.390
you know, Paul's is a team player. If I don't know if you've ever met Paul,

121
00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:22.110
he loves you. But if you ever met Paul, like, I feel like he's such a good guy.

122
00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:24.990
Didn't say anything. Listen, if you brought me to do anything,

123
00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:27.030
I've got guys offered that wanted me to help him with camps.

124
00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:28.630
I turn it down and you're like, Hey,

125
00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:31.670
we need to go five fives that ain't happening. Right. I'll give you one round,

126
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.830
two rounds. But you, for your, for the best condition, usually do a shark tank.

127
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.220
You're on this joke, bringing fresh guys for D it looks and push you harder.

128
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.260
So this is just a showcase of Connor's abilities at Paul's expense. Yep.

129
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.940
I like Paul's commentator. I think he's one of his best in the world.

130
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.940
He's really, really good. He offers like real legitimate insight. He's really,

131
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:49.400
really good.

132
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.260
Do you think that he got rocked and doesn't doesn't remember how this went?

133
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.900
Like did he think that he me maybe did think that he got pushed down? No, I,

134
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.890
again, I think it's a combination of both. I think, you know, poll had one,

135
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:03.650
some, and he even says, he goes, I want some rounds, collar won some rounds. Mm.

136
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.450
You know, I'd like to see it. All right. Me too. And the UFC said,

137
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:08.810
they're gonna release it after the fight,

138
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.050
which is that that's gonna be the real test.

139
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.730
It's gonna be real test what cuz Dana said it was a one-sided Beatdown. Yeah.

140
00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:17.650
Dana was like, he has it for 12 rounds, which I don't believe that.

141
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.360
&lt;affirmative&gt; what if it's true? Uh, like you, you,

142
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.920
you gotta go with what poll did say happened and then what you see happened.

143
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.160
I think it's a combination of both. I really do. I think again,

144
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.480
I think it's people were like, yeah, you know, everyone's on this con wagon,

145
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:32.880
especially in the UFC Dana that's his golden boy. Right.

146
00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:35.480
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I think we knew Connor could box,

147
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.840
but then when you see him doing againsts Paul you're like, oh.

148
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.870
And so even I bet when we watch the tape room, like, oh Connor did pretty well.

149
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.270
I don't think you beat the up poly for 12 rounds. I think towards the end,

150
00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:48.470
you probably like you see that, that hap like that happens. Well, obviously,

151
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.870
listen, this has obviously been very valuable.

152
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.070
If there were more moments like this, don't you think they would leak those two?

153
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.670
Correct? They'd be everywhere. I mean,

154
00:07:56.671 --> 00:08:00.020
they're saying they don't want him to see what is working on. Okay.

155
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.780
Just show us a mom. Gimme the highlights. Punches that landed.

156
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.100
Just gimme like one of those Mike Tyson sicky second highlights.

157
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.340
Just show me a few BA BA BA BA, BA BA. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

158
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:11.140
you don't have to like show all of its patterns,

159
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.100
but how well did this hype that like, this is probably this huge giant.

160
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.580
And now Paul, you know, you have this huge soap,

161
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:20.650
opera run boxing going right now. Paul's a main character now.

162
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.450
So Paul might have to fight Connor if Floyd,

163
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.850
if Floyd and even if Floyd and Connor,

164
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.850
if Floyd beats Connor and then Paul can say, look, I,

165
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.930
I want my shot at him. You know, you,

166
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:36.170
you talked a lot of and I didn't get in shape. That's the play.

167
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.320
But it's only the play. It's only the play. If Connor has a good showing,

168
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.160
even if you lose in decision as long, he's a good showing. Right.

169
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.160
Then you do McGregor promotions against poly MAANA. Yeah.

170
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:51.960
And I'm buying that the only way. fighting. Kabe, Tony Ferguson,

171
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.800
all that elbow. Cuz Jitsu. Nah,

172
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.960
we're gonna put on these eight ounces, go 12 rounds and make some money.

173
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.360
Some serious money. That's a lot of people think he'll never fight MMA again.

174
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.480
I mean, he's gonna make a hundred million from this fight. Yeah.

175
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.040
Probably more that's with sponsors. Yeah. That's a lot of money.

176
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.190
That's that's SCR MC duck rich. That's that's we go in 30,

177
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.550
even 30. It has a son, you know, he's a smart guy. Yeah. I,

178
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.830
I think the play would to, and I know a lot of you see,

179
00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:24.710
people are like that's cuz you're never a fighter shop. And I get that.

180
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.870
Give any UFC fighter $100 million. They're both throwing up deuces going see ya.

181
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.950
Yeah. This is way too hard of a life. A hundred mil Steven sat sheets.

182
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:36.420
And I can go fight Paul. Yeah. For another, whatever.

183
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.500
50 mil probably of my own money. Ooh. Or,

184
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.140
or I'll go fight Nate di as an a trilogy. You know what I'm saying?

185
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:47.420
90% or more econom McGregor versus Floyd may there money man says notorious will

186
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:51.820
lose 90% of his 75 million payday he's disqualified. Yeah. Yeah. I know that.

187
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.140
Yeah. Oh yeah. That's that's if he does an MMA move on him and he,

188
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.250
he won't people ask that all the time. He's not gonna get,

189
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.570
can you throw a Superman punch, spin and punch. I'm like get outta my face.

190
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.730
Absolutely not. You can't it's too bad.

191
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:06.370
You can't throw a spinning back fist though. Whoa. Have some, some,

192
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.410
some gentleman rules for God's sake. Did you imagine though, if, if Floyd said,

193
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.730
uh, you could throw elbows mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I'm surprised he has it.

194
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:17.800
Eight ounce gloves. We'll do what we wanna do. Let's do this. Let's do this.

195
00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:19.160
Could you imagine? Oh yeah.

196
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.920
And you get elbows and you can throw one kick around and the guy can clench and

197
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:23.960
throw elbows from the clench.
