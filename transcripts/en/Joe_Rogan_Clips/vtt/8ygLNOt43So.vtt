00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 1>What other episodes of my, of my puck.</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.520
<v 0>Uh, cause.</v>

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.480
<v 1>I launched Warner. I launched it off of this one.</v>

5
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.360
<v 0>Yes. I listened to Warner Herzog. Yeah. I thought that was interesting.</v>

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.240
Although he's a little bit self-congraulatory, which is a little shocking.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.240
<v 1>But he is the most interesting.</v>

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.880
<v 0>Man in the universe. Yeah. He's a very interesting guy. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.040
He's also been in some really terrible movies.

10
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.150
Like he was in that Jack Reacher movie with Tom cruise.

11
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.150
The best part about that movie is that he drives a Chael 1970 chall don't know

12
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.590
about this. You don't know about 70 chavells. Did you listen to the Brett up.

13
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.510
<v 1>Brett? Uh, episode Brett.</v>

14
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.790
<v 0>Weinstein. Oh your brother. No, I did not listen to that one. Okay.</v>

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.790
I've only listened to five or six.

16
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.940
<v 1>If you listen to, to episode 19, which is the Brett episode,</v>

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.340
I think that's been the most important one except for the one released today.

18
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.170
<v 0>That sounds like you gear me up for the one released today.</v>

19
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.970
<v 1>Well, um, I, what is it? I would start with the,</v>

20
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.290
I would start with the Brett one and what's.

21
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.170
<v 0>So important about the Brett one.</v>

22
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.320
<v 1>Um, the Brett one is a story about his prediction,</v>

23
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.440
uh, that all the laboratory mice that we use from the major supplier,

24
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:12.480
which is the Jackson laboratory in bar Harbor,

25
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.120
Maine may have been compromised by their breeding protocols,

26
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.200
which allowed the telomes to radically elongate.

27
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.950
And that we thought that these mice were represented of Al mice and that they

28
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:27.030
had radically elongated telomes at the end of their chromosomes,

29
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:31.590
which appear to mediate the level of mitosis that can happen during,

30
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.430
uh, histological repair. So if you imagine that your,

31
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:39.390
your cells can divide a certain number of times, if, if there isn't a counter

32
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.820
that stops the number of visions, everything can become tumors.

33
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.700
And since you have like 30 trillion or a hundred trillion cells in your body,

34
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.980
it means every cell, uh, almost can kill you.

35
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.380
So it appears that the reason we may die,

36
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.620
uh fromsescence that is aging is that that's our anti-cancer

37
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:01.120
mechanism.

38
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.450
So if you eliminate like infectious disease use like viruses and insult from,

39
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.930
you know, being hit by a car,

40
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.810
the two things that you have in the end is, uh,

41
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.170
either you die from imortality, which is cancer,

42
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.850
which where cells can divide an infinite number of times,

43
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.170
or you die from the recursion limit,

44
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:24.320
which is how many times the cell can divide called in biology, the heflic limit.

45
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.400
And Brett predicted from first principles that what we thought about mice,

46
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:33.440
which is that they have radically elongated telomes was only true for laboratory

47
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:36.840
animals because all the laboratory animals in which we test things like drugs

48
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.823
have been broken.

49
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.120
<v 0>They've been broken because of selective breeding. Yep.</v>

50
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.320
<v 1>Because the breeding rotations, um,</v>

51
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.110
privileged my younger mice and removed all sort of, uh,

52
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:52.990
threats from the environment. And so, because telome are not protein coding,

53
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.270
there are sequences of neleotides that repeat as a counter rather than coding

54
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.200
for a translation, uh, in the ribizsome in,

55
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.840
into amino acid sequences. Um,

56
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.640
what you have is is that the body can, um,

57
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.080
mutate, if you will,

58
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.800
to use the Jackson laborator's concept of this very rapidly,

59
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.720
because it's not building something structural, it's just a question of,

60
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.030
do we have 17 on the end or 170 on the end because

61
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:24.830
that it's, it's acting, uh,

62
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.510
nucleic acid has multiple ways in which it can participate in regulating,

63
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.910
um, the body's responses. So in fact,

64
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.310
the BR breeding protocols constituted a novel system of selective pressures

65
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:42.140
that the efficacy of all of our laboratory animals potentially.

66
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.100
<v 0>Holy. So that.</v>

67
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.500
<v 1>Was, and so he predicted from first principles, he said,</v>

68
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.140
I bet if you test wild type mice, rather than laboratory mice,

69
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:54.260
you'll find that their telomes are not long as you believe. And this was, um,

70
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.980
actually carried out by carolreider who did not acknowledge the prediction.

71
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.130
<v 0>She didn't acknowledge the prediction. You should listen to the show.</v>

72
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.050
Why did she not acknowledge the, you should listen to.

73
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.050
<v 1>The show. So it's, it's a okay. It's no, cuz it's, it's it's this is serious.</v>

74
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.970
It' complicated. And it's a Nobel Laureate on the other side of this.

75
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.450
So we're taking some risk over the, over there at the portal.

76
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.410
<v 0>That's really interesting.</v>

77
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.290
So the consequences of this could be grave

78
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.120
could be that so much of the studies that are predicated on these mice tests

79
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.160
are they're useless.

80
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.920
<v 1>Well, I've called up the Jackson laboratory and asked them when did,</v>

81
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.920
have you had any changes in your breeding protocol? Are you, they say,

82
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:38.520
we don't even count the number of telir thetelome length. And I say,

83
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:41.190
do you have a history of when you've changed the protocols,

84
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:45.190
are you aware of these articles? And she said like, what? I said, you know,

85
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.110
these articles of Carol Reder and they said, how do you spell glider?

86
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:51.710
Like the plane? I said, Reder like the Nobel Laureate.

87
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.990
And how do you spell that? &lt;laugh&gt; G, R E I D E R.

88
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.850
And um, so, and then I, and then they said to me,

89
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:06.570
well, we don't remember if we've changed the protocols. I said,

90
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.010
you're producing laboratory animals.

91
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.290
I would imagine you would have a documented history of every change in the time

92
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:17.810
series of how these animals were prepared. Like, well,

93
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:22.050
I don't know if there's anyone around from that time. It's like, are,

94
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.920
are you kidding? Were you absent the day they taught science?

95
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.210
Who are you? You know,

96
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.290
this is like a single point of failure. If true. I can't even,

97
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.970
we've been at for 20 years, we've been trying to get an answer as 20 years.

98
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.370
No one will break the story. I mean, this episode,

99
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.120
which is almost impossible to listen to because at the beginning of the episode,

100
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.280
I'm absolutely insufferable to Brett because he won't tell the story.

101
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:52.760
He's afraid to tell his own life story.

102
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.240
<v 0>Why won't he tell the story?</v>

103
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.850
<v 1>Because in academics,</v>

104
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.240
the idea of some punk kid alleging that they predicted

105
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.800
in a telephone call to a Nobel Laureate,

106
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.400
that if they would test wild type mice,

107
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.880
the telomes would be radically Elong, uh,

108
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.440
radically shorter than the elongated telomes of the laboratory test. And,

109
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.870
and then the person refuses to acknowledge

110
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.450
that such a prediction was made, even though we have emails from the lab that.

111
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.690
<v 0>Um, so she refuses to acknowledge it or she doesn't acknowledge.</v>

112
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.610
<v 1>It. I cannot find a single I've been over the literature.</v>

113
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.890
There is no mention anywhere of, and I,

114
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.520
I, I live this with bread in real time. So I, I,

115
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.360
I know the events were happening. We have communications with that lab. Um,

116
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.920
since there is, I cannot find any acknowledgement,

117
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.560
uh, from the Johns Hopkins university laboratory that this, uh,

118
00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:56.840
interaction ever took place.

119
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.350
And that because he called and wrote and did not write an email,

120
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.310
he did not have a paper trail of that prediction.

121
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.030
Now there's consequential consequential emails that show the

122
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:11.990
interaction between the labs. But, um,

123
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.070
how many times have you ever heard anyone predict a molecular result from

124
00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:19.060
first principles, an evolutionary theory,

125
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.620
this is what Brett was supposed to be famous for. And then, you know,

126
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.860
he became like this obscure professor at some ridiculous college,

127
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.980
and then this thing happened to him, but that's not his origin story.

128
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.020
His origin story is that he is the badass of biology, um,

129
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.410
who was able to make this prediction from first principles and may advance the

130
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.970
theory of why we have to die balance between deaths from imortality that is

131
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.130
tumors and deaths from recursion limits.

132
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.530
That is tmome mediated hayflix hayflic limits.

133
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.250
<v 0>So what if anything has been done since this information has gotten out.</v>

134
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.230
<v 1>Um,</v>

135
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.680
the world went crazy for the episode and there was silence everywhere inside of

136
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.480
what I've called the gated institutional narrative, because.

137
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.720
<v 0>To acknowledge it. Yeah. They really have to throw out how much research.</v>

138
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.040
<v 1>We don't know. I don't know, but it,</v>

139
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:17.320
it puts the question out how much research is compromised by the

140
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.150
laboratory breeding protocols and breeding rotations from a single point of

141
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:24.710
failure at the Jackson laboratories in bar Harbor, Maine.

142
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.563
<v 0>Wow.</v>

143
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.180
<v 1>Episode 19. Oh, get on it. And,</v>

144
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.740
and you will hear me in a way where you' will just say,

145
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.220
Eric is the biggest Dick I've ever heard in my life,

146
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.850
but it's all to push Brett to act, actually talk.

147
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.370
You should have 'em back on the show to talk about it's it's killer.

148
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.850
I would love.

149
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.370
<v 0>To. Yeah. So he just wants to, he kind of wants to soft dance.</v>

150
00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:50.490
It is that what it is soft step. It.

151
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.970
<v 1>He's just wrong. I mean, here, here's the problem.</v>

152
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.050
There's a point after which I'm not Mr. Nice guy.

153
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.520
And I'm just like a adamant mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Brett is simply wrong. It's a,

154
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.800
it's a result and a story that needs to be told if there is another side to the

155
00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:07.000
story, we need to hear the other side of the story. Um,

156
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.800
and my goal is to have, carolreider say, you know, what?

157
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.800
This interaction did happen,

158
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.670
and I probably could have handled this better because she has work that she's

159
00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:16.911
done,

160
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:20.190
which is beyond question some of the most important work that has nothing to do

161
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:24.790
with anything Brett has done, but it does not give,

162
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.590
uh, that laboratory,

163
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.630
the scientific right to deny the existence of this interaction,

164
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.990
the importance of the interaction.

165
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.180
And because there are potential Onstream consequences in pharmaceuticals,

166
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.300
we need to have an answer. And every answer is interesting.

167
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:46.060
Like if the laboratory mice having rat radically elongated telome

168
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.060
is not a problem in some way. That's fascinating.

169
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.500
How could you have an animal that has this huge adaptation to the laboratory?

170
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.970
Not, uh, affect things that would be interesting if it does affect things.

171
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.490
That's fascinating. Well, especially if you're,

172
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.290
if you're running tests on it thatt have anything to do with hillomelast right.

173
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.330
Well, no, but if it doesn't have to do, like, for example,

174
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.370
let's say you have a really toxic substance, right?

175
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.280
And it causes a lot of cell death that requires histological repair air.

176
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.080
Well, if you have huge, longtelome,

177
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.800
you're gonna have an ability to metabolize that toxicity very much better.

178
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.760
Right? Right. You you'll be able to take the insult that comes from this.

179
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.040
And so these mice are probably pre naturally disposed towards radical

180
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:37.030
histological repair. That's why they remain youthful and young.

181
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.750
And if you test something that might be, you know,

182
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.990
if you're doing toxicology studies, it could be that thetelomes,

183
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:43.824
even though you're not testing,

184
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.430
thetelomes what you're actually doing is picking up that these broken mice are

185
00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:51.670
like the world champs of repair, but they suck at cancer.

186
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.270
Like all die of cancer, all of them. Yeah.

187
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:58.420
Almost if essentially all the mice that with rat ly elongated tomes,

188
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.740
let go long enough, all die of cancer because they're,

189
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:06.420
they're tricked out for one special thing, which is recovery.

190
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.780
We, we, yeah, we are the best at repair. Oh, wow. Right.

191
00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:14.460
So think about it as the theory of death and the clear way all of the noise.

192
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.500
There are two ways that, that nature can't figure out, uh,

193
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.130
and escape from either you dive IM mortality,

194
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:24.130
which is that you think all your cells want to wanna live forever.

195
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:30.050
You know, and that's a huge death, a huge danger, or we call it a resource,

196
00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:32.730
like leak in computers or they die.

197
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:35.410
Because the only thing nature can figure out to do is to say,

198
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.760
you only get a finite number of cell divisions, uh, up front.

199
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.680
Now there's some adjustments to the theory, but if you only get a, like, if you,

200
00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:48.040
if you look at the moles on my face, which are, uh, people love to comment on,

201
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:48.874
in the comment section,

202
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:54.080
they probably started as a runaway replica replicative process that

203
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.280
arrested at the border of the mole, uh, in order to keep the,

204
00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:03.080
from killing me. Right? So we have cells that go rogue all the time.

205
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.040
But then what happens is, is that there's some means of making sure that it,

206
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.400
the process doesn't take it down the entire organism,

207
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.630
but think about the 30 trillion assassins, uh, as the cells in your body,

208
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.190
all of which might kill you at any moment, it's like terrifying.
