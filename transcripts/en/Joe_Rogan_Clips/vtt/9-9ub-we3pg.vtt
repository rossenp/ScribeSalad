00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.440
<v 1>You know what I want to, I'm gonna completely change the subject as if I may.</v>

3
00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:07.274
Sure. You know,

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.440
I want to talk about when you came on my radio show with philate about the moon.

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.400
<v 0>Oh. Talked about the moon landing. Yeah. Yeah. But what.</v>

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.480
<v 1>I, what I think is fascinating about this, about clubs and stuff, you know,</v>

7
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.630
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is, uh, I, uh, you know, and I, I, I, I know I've,

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.030
I've read here and there that you, uh, you've, uh,

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.670
you've gone back on a lot of that and your conspiracy stuff. And so, yeah,

10
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.630
but that's, that's not.

11
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.830
<v 0>That's not, but I can explain that too. I don't know what I'm talking about.</v>

12
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.951
You know, this,

13
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:37.470
this is the thing I've zero astrosics mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; education zero.

14
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.180
I don't know anything about whether or not the it's possible to put people in

15
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:46.500
the moon. I do know fuckery and I, I do know teams and I do,

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100
I do understand when people are bullshitting people mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I

17
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:52.140
think there's a lot of that with, with a lot of the NASA stuff,

18
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.660
a lot of the older stuff in particular,

19
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:58.420
there was a lot of manipulation of images and putting things online

20
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.330
that may not have actually really happened because it press releases.

21
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.570
And there's an image of Michael Collins from like, uh, Gemini 15. That's a, uh,

22
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.850
a very clear, um, image of him, uh, doing a simulation,

23
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.330
like in a studio with straps and harnesses,

24
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.450
and then someone from NASA or someone put that exact same image

25
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.720
image, blacked out the background and used it as a Fu of a,

26
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280
of a space mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's not real, you know,

27
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.720
but they sold it as real. There was some overzealous like that.

28
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.760
That if you're conspiratoratorially minded, you might say, ah.

29
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.560
<v 1>Once, once you start lying. Yes. You know, it's,</v>

30
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.440
it'sia 51 and stuff. Yes. You know, we know they lied. Yes. Like. Yeah. And,

31
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.470
and that's the problem, but what I just wanted to compliment you,

32
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.310
and I just also think this is really interesting, you know?

33
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.910
So Joe Rogan believes this crazy. We didn't go to the moon. I know Joe Rogan,

34
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.350
we're on a, we're on a radio show together. Da, da, da, da. He's a good guy.

35
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:58.310
We did fear factor, but he believes this.

36
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.790
Let's let's have him talk to someone as real. So I call Phil play.

37
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.980
Do I don't know that well, right. But he's the baddest on him.

38
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:07.140
And he knows this. And I say, uh,

39
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.060
I really want you to come on my radio show and just talk to Joe Rogan about, uh,

40
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.860
about, um, the moon landing Moodle landing. And, uh, Phil says, oh, no problem.

41
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:18.780
We'll just go on there. We'll we'll send him straight. And I go,

42
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.770
I just wanna warn you, uh, have your ducks in a row. Cuz Joe's really it.

43
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.410
And he goes, well, Joe's, Joe's a comic, right? I, I go, yeah.

44
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.650
And that's your problem because Joe's better at talking than you.

45
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.210
Joe knows when the commercials are coming. &lt;laugh&gt; Joe knows how to make a joke.

46
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.410
And Joe knows also how to set you up and take you down. He, oh no, no, no.

47
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.080
It'll be no problem. I said, he understand that hemo he's a comic,

48
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.920
right? Yeah. Not an astrophysicist,

49
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:49.920
but you understand that he's smart and he's also,

50
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.640
you are going into his form. We're gonna be on radio.

51
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.600
This guy has done a lot of radio.

52
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.440
This guy's talked to a lot of people, so just have all your facts in line.

53
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.840
And then we're sitting there cuz you know, you were,

54
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.920
you were on the phone and uh, gooddo my,

55
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.480
it was on my podcast with me too sitting across and me and we're listening and

56
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:16.800
you come in and you come in humble and charming

57
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.710
and sexy and with perfect timing on everything and Phil

58
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:26.110
place starts going. I, I I'm, I go, oh man,

59
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.150
Joe is wrong and Joe is gonna win &lt;laugh&gt;.

60
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.430
And I said, I set this up so that, um, so that, uh,

61
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.630
it will be a FA it'd be fair.

62
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.340
My whole thing of doing this the way I bill boarded, it was,

63
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.340
I'm just gonna have two guys talk from two points of view.

64
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.580
I'm not supposed to commit that. I don't know if you remember,

65
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.860
but the whole show HEADSS and I go, oh, by the way,

66
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.060
we did land on the moon &lt;laugh&gt; and just tried to do this final authority

67
00:03:56.061 --> 00:04:00.170
thing. And Phil said afterwards, well he, he had, I said, yeah.

68
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.930
And it's just that idea that you can't, you know,

69
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.170
his idea was there's the science team that's right. Yeah.

70
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.730
And then there's this goofy comic and trying to get Phil plate to understand

71
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.770
that a goofy comic was not a goofy comic.

72
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.410
And I believe that the only thing that the SATs truly test

73
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.480
is how good you'll be. The comedians comedian. &lt;laugh&gt; that kind of verbal.

74
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.400
It was a wonderful thing to listen to.

75
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:30.600
It was wonderful to listen to someone who I believe absolutely was

76
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.160
100% wrong. Yeah.

77
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.080
Who was just so skilled and so moral and so thoughtful and

78
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:40.480
so humble. You had everything going for you that I,

79
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.430
I respect except it didn't happen to be right. Well.

80
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.870
<v 0>We don't know what happened.</v>

81
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.110
We assume that what we see is what happened.

82
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.750
We assume that what the scientists tell us was hap was what happened.

83
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.710
We assume that what NASA told us was what happened when you say,

84
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.060
I know this happened, right? You're not always correct. Exactly.

85
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.540
Oftentimes. Correct. I know Kennedy got assassinated in Dallas.

86
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.580
I've seen the video. I know he got assassinated in Dallas.

87
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:11.740
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know if Lee Harvey Oswell did it. I don't know.

88
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.060
I assume he was involved. It seems like he was. Yeah.

89
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.700
Was there other people involved too? I assume there were.

90
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.260
And one of the reasons why I assumed there were the magic bullet, the,

91
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.930
and the guy who got hit with the Rick ricochet under the overpass.

92
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.570
<v 1>But I do want you to know that I made the shot with a man laercacon oh yeah.</v>

93
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.530
<v 0>It could be made. Yeah. Oh, that's horses. Listen, I've talked about that in,</v>

94
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.330
in, in length and also.

95
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.370
<v 1>The heads towards that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.330
<v 0>Well there's a lot of things. There's a lot of things. Um,</v>

97
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.690
there's there's a lot of things we could, you know,

98
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.000
go over the Kennedy assassination. There's a lot of, I'm not on one.

99
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:43.920
Wait a minute, wait, wait.

100
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.560
<v 1>A minute. Are we gonna, are we gonna solve the polarization in America?</v>

101
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.320
Or are we gonna solve the Kennedy assassination or are we gonna solve the bull

102
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:53.160
landing? All of them or you wanna do all of them? Yeah. Okay.

103
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.400
I just wanna know what our goals were.

104
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.400
<v 0>The moon landing is a conspiracy theories dream,</v>

105
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.520
a conspiracy theorist dream because it's got everything in place.

106
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.840
It's got this incredible technological achievement.

107
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.520
It's got these three guys that look incredibly nervous at the post landing press

108
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:12.800
conference. And they, they look all sketched out.

109
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.400
It's got these guys that don't do interviews afterwards.

110
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.230
It's got no one ever lands on the moon again, after 1973 or whatever it was.

111
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.630
It's got all these technological achievements,

112
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.190
but we never get outside of Earth's atmosphere. Again.

113
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.270
We're always inside of Earth's orbit. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

114
00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:32.750
there's so many beautiful things that conspiracy theorories can grasp a hold of.

115
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.230
Themem go see it's. But it doesn't mean the distance,

116
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.790
but it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

117
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.740
There's the van Allen radiation belts there's that we never even sent a chicken

118
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.020
in a deep space and had to come back alive. There's all these things,

119
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.620
but it doesn't mean it didn't happen. Right. And the, my problem was,

120
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.860
and this is, you know, and people said, oh, you know, you've sold out.

121
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:54.180
You're a shell now. Like, no, no, no. I'm just being honest now.

122
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.580
Whereas before I wasn't being honest with my,

123
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:58.570
myself and I wasn't being honest about the subject.

124
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.090
I do not know whether or not people went to the moon.

125
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.770
I was pretending that I knew that people didn't go to the moon and I was arguing

126
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:10.810
it that way. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I was on a team. Yeah. I was on team. It's.

127
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.210
We didn't go to the moon and you,

128
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.360
you really can't do that accurately. Can't be done. You,

129
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.600
you can say, this is what's interesting.

130
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:25.760
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; this is what I find curious. This is what's weird. In fact,

131
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.200
there's not a single technological achievement from 1969. That's not cheaper,

132
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:32.440
easier and faster to reproduce today except going to the moon.

133
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.041
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

134
00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:36.640
it's one of the rare things in life still doesn't mean it didn't happen. Right?

135
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.310
Like umm's razor is a slippery thing because there's weird that happens. Yeah.

136
00:07:41.311 --> 00:07:43.710
And you gotta take that into account. Like there's no absolutes.

137
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:45.670
There's not one thing that you can say, well,

138
00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:48.190
there is a rule and this rule must be followed and here's that rule.

139
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.910
It doesn't work that way. The world is made of weird stuff. And.

140
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.870
<v 1>I'm also the, the, the idea there's, there's a thing that's changed.</v>

141
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:59.220
There was an article in the times about this us,

142
00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:03.860
and you might have even been mentioned in it. Um, there's a, uh,

143
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.780
a playful space of conspiracy theories.

144
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.700
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that it's taken me a long time to understand my daughter is

145
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.900
14. And she talks about, you know, her,

146
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.810
her father did a show called it.

147
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.170
And she talks about how she loves conspiracy theories. And this is from Paul.

148
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.810
McCartney's dead to, we didn't land on the moon to all those things,

149
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.690
but she sees it, which it's so hard for me to understand.

150
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.690
She sees it as not impacting reality,

151
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.640
but is a playful inter intellectual your size.

152
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.560
And I don't know what's going on,

153
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.800
but there was this wonderful article in the times.

154
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.600
And you were mentioned there too, but there's also another guy who does it,

155
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.640
who will do this, uh, to use a cliche. I can't think of a better one going,

156
00:08:53.641 --> 00:08:56.880
going down the rabbit hole of conspiracy stuff,

157
00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.040
playing around with the logic that almost feels like

158
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.000
a mathematical thing or a pure philosophical thing, or a,

159
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.240
or a angels dancing on the head of a pin thing. And, uh,

160
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.390
there's a quality that you have learned, um,

161
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.790
that my daughter has learned indirectly. I think from you,

162
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.750
um, through other people doing this of there is a playful space.

163
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.390
We discuss how we, uh,

164
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.870
how we share our reality that is happening

165
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.300
in the conspiracy theory, art form.

166
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.860
And the conspiracy theory art form is now seeming to me to be more

167
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.580
like rap or rock and roll,

168
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.500
or it's just a form,

169
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.660
a thing where you play around with this kind of thing. And I am so, um,

170
00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.730
literal minded. I'm so verbal minded. You know, Bob, Dylan's easy for me.

171
00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:04.810
The stones are hard. You know, zap is easy, 20th century, classical's easy,

172
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.330
but just funk is hard for me. And it's the same kind of thing here.

173
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.170
It's really easy for me to say we are doing, um, uh,

174
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:20.000
the old fashion scientific inquiry, and this is a way falsfiable,

175
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.960
but there is something happening in our thinking.

176
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.040
That's really interesting that I had to have my daughter explain to me and the

177
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:31.920
New York times after I already knew you and watched you do it well, you've.

178
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.680
<v 0>Always, you've always been a champion of science and reason, right?</v>

179
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.590
And conspiracy theories for the most part fall in the face of science and

180
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:41.190
reason. And it, you don't want to be a buffoon. One wants to, there' a be fool,

181
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.990
but there's a poetic thing happening, but it's tricky. And you don't,

182
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:47.510
people don't wanna be a fool. Well, I'm a professional fool.

183
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:49.710
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't mind being a fool mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you

184
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:52.590
know, being selfeprecating and being a, a moron is part of being a comic.

185
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.390
It's fun. The,

186
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.500
the conspiracy theory world went south for me when I did a

187
00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:01.900
television show about it. Right. I did that. Joe Rogan questions,

188
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:05.020
everything show Mmhmm. And I spent six, seven months doing this show.

189
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.140
And at the end of it, I was like, okay, I get it.

190
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.220
This is a bunch of unuckable white guys. &lt;laugh&gt;, that's what it really is.

191
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.020
Yeah. That's what I decided. I said, you know, I had a pit about it. I said,

192
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.421
do you want to,

193
00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:17.890
the one thing you don't find when you are looking for Bigfoot black people,

194
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.830
&lt;laugh&gt;,

195
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.410
you're more likely to find Bigfoot than you are black eyes looking for Bigfoot.

196
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.170
It is a bunch of unuckable white dudes out camping and listen to what did you

197
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:29.330
hear that? What is that? You know, it's like, it's nonsense. Like you're,

198
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:32.330
you're wrapped up in this idea that there's a mystery and there's a something,

199
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.490
there's a thing, a quality about human beings, where we want to uncover secrets.

200
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:41.000
We want to be the person that finds out the truth because then your miserable

201
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.080
life. Now doesn't matter. The aliens are real, man. They're here.

202
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:47.980
And.

203
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.640
<v 1>Aha, aha. The,</v>

204
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.480
the Mo one of the best feelings we can get probably better than coming.

205
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.560
Is that feeling of aha. I understand.

206
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.640
I've gotten a revelation and we see this all the time. Detective shows,

207
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.600
you know, Sherlock Holmes, you know, nothing to do with police work.

208
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:12.200
Yeah. But there is a feeling that wouldn't it be nice if in this hour

209
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.870
I were able to figure something out. Yeah.

210
00:12:14.871 --> 00:12:18.710
Because if you wanna understand string theory, you're not gonna do it an hour.

211
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.670
You're not gonna do.

212
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.750
<v 0>It ever. &lt;laugh&gt; I, I don't think those guys understand it.</v>

213
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:22.910
Even if they teach it precisely.

214
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.510
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;, let's take it easier. One, let's take a candle flame. Okay.</v>

215
00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:29.870
You're never gonna understand that. Right. Uh, studying that forever.

216
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.910
And there's, there's an area

217
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.900
conspiracy theories are exercising. The muscles of logic,

218
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.580
exercising, the muscles of skepticism,

219
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:47.260
playing around with the, with the haiku of if then,

220
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.380
if then playing around with, um,

221
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.890
what we feel about the government and other people and stuff like that.

222
00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:01.170
And you're playing around with all of that in kind of a semi

223
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.210
safe zone.

224
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.290
And even watching you just do it here, where you, where you,

225
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:09.970
where you bang out that stuff and say,

226
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:13.850
this is the stuff I question what's coming out of that poetically.

227
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.960
Uh, and I thought, let's not even talk about whether we went to the moon or not.

228
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.960
What's coming out of your style of inquiry on that kind of thing.

229
00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:27.880
Your style of skepticism is just fascinating and beautiful.

230
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.920
And I see the conspiracy thing as not so much a breaking down,

231
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.270
which I used to see a breaking down of science and reason,

232
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.710
but I see it as rather a, a creation of a new form of poetry.

233
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.150
<v 0>That's weird. I don't know if I agree, but my.</v>

234
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.150
<v 1>Daughter just said, my daughter just says, you know,</v>

235
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.790
I really like conspiracy theories. And I say to her, you know,

236
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.790
Paul McCartney is still.

237
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.060
<v 0>Alive. Right. But you know, she's 14, your Ette.</v>

238
00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.740
So she's rebelling &lt;laugh&gt; you understand that? Right. You're a parent,

239
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.753
you know, it's like.

240
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.060
<v 1>You may have just told me something really important. Yeah.</v>

241
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:07.900
That was too dirt dumb to realize. That's the thing.

242
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.140
Here's the thing that it's like Neil gayman's daughter coming in, uh,

243
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.090
all goed out. Yeah. And Neil say to her, I ed this, you can't do this.

244
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.330
This is not the way you can rebel. You can't rebel against me like this.

245
00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.130
You can't do with black hair and eyeshadow. You can't do it.

246
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.530
But yeah. Yeah.

247
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.250
<v 0>Well, kids, you know, they, they find their own way and they,</v>

248
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.330
they wanna express themselves. You know,

249
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.920
they want to exert pat hour over their world.
