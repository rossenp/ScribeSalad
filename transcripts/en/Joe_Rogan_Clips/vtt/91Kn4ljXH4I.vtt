1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>Dude, it seemed like we just did this. It does.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 1>Feel pretty racist it a year ago. I don't know.</v>

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.610
<v 0>It's already October. I'm scared. Let's just spark up a joint book</v>

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.910
launch. One of them Backwoods. Now one of these Backwoods, these are so good.

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.820
Just smell it. Just smell. Whoa.

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.470
<v 2>Yeah. You know, everyone was commenting on your blunt rolling technique.</v>

7
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.380
After the Elon Musk thing. Oh, I don't roll. I know. They were like,

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.570
I knew that and they were like, oh, what does he? He just,

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:32.640
he can barely roll a blunt. I was like, it's professionally rolled.

10
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:33.570
It's a pretty, real good bond.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.460
<v 0>That smells good. Smells so good. They taste good too. There's a,</v>

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.340
those are phenomenal. The I I'm a blunt, man.

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.320
I know it's probably bad for your lungs,

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.240
but there's something about the tobacco gets you a little high up and then the

15
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:52.770
marijuana sort of like spreads you out and it puts you in like a new dimension.

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.440
<v 1>Yeah. That's that's a good one.</v>

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.190
<v 0>I'm going to get blitz grieved after Halloween kids. Oh yeah.</v>

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.760
<v 1>Imagine how high you'll get to after 30 days.</v>

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.250
<v 0>Yeah. Last year I did, I did comedy.</v>

20
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.640
I had no idea what I was talking about while I was on stage. I was like,

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.230
oh my God, there's 400 people in this room.

22
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.240
<v 2>I always thought of bringing in all my marijuana and booze and here, like, uh,</v>

23
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.220
like Wyatt, like it like in the old west,

24
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.700
when you had to turn in your guns and just dumping them on the table.

25
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.180
Cause I have so much marijuana. It's ridiculous.

26
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.320
<v 0>I know. It's crazy.</v>

27
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.390
I keep a stack of whiskey over there and then we've got another cabinet full in

28
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:34.170
the back. Yeah. You can get up hard for you here in this place.

29
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.080
We're going to get ripped on the back.

30
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.440
Remember when we did the podcast on the day back? Yeah, those were,

31
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:43.410
those were fun. That was fun. It's so much more fun when he's high,

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.510
scary and grumpy. When he's sober was such a grouchy.

33
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.410
<v 1>Dog, he gets.</v>

34
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.030
<v 0>Like legit angry. Like he could joke around about anything when he's high,</v>

35
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.510
when he smokes weed. But then when he's not smoking weed, you're like, wait,

36
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:59.700
wait, wait, are you serious? He gets upset.

37
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.130
<v 2>Do you remember when you texted the three se like, all right,</v>

38
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.530
I don't think you're doing the right classes. Do you remember that?

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.440
<v 0>I think you're going to have to do them again.</v>

40
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.810
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

41
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.250
<v 0>I love you. He called.</v>

42
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.120
<v 1>You, right? He called.</v>

43
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.990
<v 0>You upset. Oh yeah. Yeah. He was upset. I don't remember if we texted or called,</v>

44
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.460
but I go Ari. I love you. I'm just joking. I'm sure you do.

45
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.080
But one thing about Arias,

46
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.410
this is one thing that you could say after all the welting talking all the

47
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:36.390
nonsense. Ari has rock solid ethics, rocks off. Yes.

48
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.840
He does. Like if Ari said he's going to do something, he does it like,

49
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.170
so if I'm with him and saying, I don't think you're doing it. Like,

50
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:44.130
I don't really.

51
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.070
<v 1>Mean, right, right. You're just kind of, you're poking at him. Right. So.</v>

52
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.690
<v 0>If you're out there Ari and you hear this Molly around, I know you're doing it.</v>

53
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.240
He can talk to you for the next 31 days.

54
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.270
<v 1>He came back. He came to our class for that last one. He was like,</v>

55
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.930
it was so much easier than my class.

56
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.380
Can't believe you questioned how hard my class was one and we didn't Encino.

57
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.290
Yes. He was like, this is so easy compared to what I've been doing in New York.

58
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.550
<v 0>Look, it's all easy. If you go easy, I guess it's all how you do it. If you,</v>

59
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:17.140
if you do hot yoga and you go 100%, every pose, it's.

60
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.930
<v 1>Hard as the man who's teaching. Yeah. It's hard. But there's this.</v>

61
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.510
<v 0>Guy that I go to here for no.</v>

62
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.330
<v 2>A hundred percent. I have a drinking problem. Legit drinking.</v>

63
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.520
<v 1>Water.</v>

64
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.050
<v 0>Okay. There's this guy that I go to yoga with, uh, who is, uh,</v>

65
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.010
he's. It seems like he just doesn't ever go a hundred percent.

66
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.670
He sorta just kind of like, you know, you put your arms above your head.

67
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.110
He always does this. He's never doing this race fully stretched out,

68
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:48.040
extend his palms net connected. When you do that, it's hard. Right?

69
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.100
If you just kind of half-ass every pose and do this. Yeah.

70
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.440
You can get through a 90 minute class. You're not doing the same thing as well.

71
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.760
<v 1>Yeah. If you do, if you do any,</v>

72
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.240
if you were to go to like a group training class somewhere, you can see people.

73
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.330
And there's like that 63 year old lady,

74
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.660
who's like doing a way she's on her knees. She's like,

75
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.960
this is hard and talking at a normal rate. You're like, you're not,

76
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.040
you're not doing it yet.

77
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.270
<v 2>The trouble with my CrossFit class. Cause I, I was just getting.</v>

78
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.940
I was throwing up every day. I was throwing up every single day.

79
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.700
I was also drinking a coffee right before it started.

80
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.270
So I was throwing up coffee every single day. And one day I just snapped. I go,

81
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:24.850
Hey, the black, guy's not doing his burpees, the black guy.

82
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.340
That's what they said, Joe. That's what they said. They go, Hey man,

83
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:29.980
we don't talk like that. You got a name. I go, I don't know it.

84
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.170
But I'm pointing to him. He's not doing his burpees.

85
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.180
And then the joke I made out of it was, Hey, uh, Wendell, the gay guy says,

86
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.610
I can't call you the black guy, but you're not doing your birdies.

87
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.030
I'd like to go to back to the CrossFit.

88
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.810
I liked the idea that we're doing this in a general heart rate sense because you

89
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:48.910
can sprinkle it in. I want to go to a spin class.

90
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.160
<v 1>And by the way, that is how,</v>

91
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.510
if you want to like get a real bump in those points, it's about a bumping heart,

92
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:57.670
like sustained accelerated heart rate.

93
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.750
So spin class is going to get you a bunch that, you know what I mean? It's,

94
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.940
it's not like Joe. I dunno. You know, he's like a way better athlete than you,

95
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.650
but it doesn't mean that we put a pin in that.

96
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.080
So it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that he'll automatically beat us

97
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:18.190
because he's in better physical condition. You can actually beat him.

98
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.460
If you're going to push it all the time.

99
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.250
<v 2>Was it in your brain that makes you do that?</v>

100
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.190
Cause like we just looked at your MVPs and you burned a thousand calories.

101
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.460
Is there some sort of, I talked to pat McAfee one time. He said,

102
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:31.330
it's about explosively.

103
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.980
<v 0>It's about rape and murder. My head's filled with it.</v>

104
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.450
Stopping rapists and stop and murderers and killing child molesters.

105
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.870
That's what I think about killing bad people when you work out. Yeah.

106
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.030
That's what I do when I get tired. If I get tired,

107
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.440
I think about like saving someone I care about. I think about stopping someone.

108
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.080
Who's trying to murder someone. I love. That's what I think about.

109
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.930
<v 1>I love your face.</v>

110
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 0>I'm not kidding. I.</v>

111
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.700
<v 2>Think about my second wife.</v>

112
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 0>I think about protecting people I care about.</v>

113
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.240
<v 1>Can you tell, you told me one time? Um, you'll if it's hard, you'll go, uh,</v>

114
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.340
pretending. Someone's trying to kill me. Yeah. Yeah. So you're like pretending.

115
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.623
Yeah.

116
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.760
<v 2>I don't have words for that.</v>

117
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.030
<v 0>That's what you gotta do.</v>

118
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.840
Cause that's that's what if you think about worst case scenario,

119
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.860
you're tired and someone's trying to kill someone you care about and you don't

120
00:06:22.861 --> 00:06:24.120
have enough energy to stop them.

121
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.360
<v 2>But do you think you learned that switch in like, uh,</v>

122
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.340
Tai Taiwan or not TaeKwonDo a.

123
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.900
<v 0>Yeah. I learned it from martial arts for sure. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah,</v>

124
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.270
because that's the scariest place you could ever be.

125
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.940
Like the scariest place that you could be is life and death.

126
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.860
So like it just putting yourself in, oh, just want to lose weight. Okay, good.

127
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.570
Yeah. That's good. But that's not, you're not going to save yourself.

128
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.520
Like you got, you got to put yourself in like animalistic fury.

129
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.440
That's how you gotta, you gotta put yourself,

130
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.030
you gotta put yourself in this state of just 100% effort.

131
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.870
I was pegged at like a hundred and eighty,

132
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.350
a hundred and seventy seven beats per minute for the last 35, 35 minutes.

133
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.250
That's really that's.

134
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.340
<v 2>Right. It's got to do it. See the, you know,</v>

135
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.620
that David Goggins guy got in my head with, uh, just embrace the suck.

136
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.120
I can, I can get there where I go and just like, look during the marathon,

137
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:22.920
I just go, this is where I'm gonna be for the next five and a half hours.

138
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:24.810
This is where I'm at. And here's what I'm doing. And I can,

139
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.140
I can wrap my head around that. I don't know if I can wrap my head around, like,

140
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.660
I don't know the explicit severity of it in going, like,

141
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.030
I'm going to save my family and then getting.

142
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.030
<v 1>Work for you. But there still could be a different tactic that works for you.</v>

143
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.163
You know what I mean? Like.

144
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.390
<v 2>I mean, even like that going that hard to where your body is</v>

145
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.480
completely giving out. There's part of me that goes, Hey man,

146
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.420
what are we doing here? You know like when I'm working out, I go,

147
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.740
that's really hard.

148
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.980
<v 0>Well, you got, you definitely have to protect your health, right?</v>

149
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.620
Like the last thing you want to be doing this and having a heart attack.

150
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.560
<v 2>That's always, my fear is I go easy.</v>

151
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.410
<v 0>Buddy. Easy buddy is a good way to look at it. Yeah.</v>

152
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.150
But I've been doing that kind of working out forever. That's how I work out.

153
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.930
Yeah. But you always go crazy. Yeah. I go crazy.

154
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.680
<v 1>Did you ever think of,</v>

155
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.730
have you ever thought about someone who like really disrespected you right

156
00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:17.170
before you lift? You know what I mean? Like right before.

157
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.750
<v 2>That's all that happens online.</v>

158
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.143
<v 0>You can't read that.</v>

159
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.050
<v 1>I've gone to like a moment where you're like,</v>

160
00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:28.590
I wish I would have cracked that dude in the face and then right before,

161
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.453
right before.

162
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.250
<v 2>No, I have not. And I know I'm definitely know what I want.</v>

163
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.020
I know who I'm thinking about. I'm going to try it.

164
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.030
<v 0>All right. Don't say any names, what does he rhyme with?</v>

165
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.500
I do in order to like, [inaudible] really get yourself into that place.

166
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.491
You, you know,

167
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:48.900
you don't have to think about something that's terrifying and negative.

168
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.640
But to me that's like,

169
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.050
that's the ultimate position that where you're going to need energy.

170
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.120
<v 2>This is so silly. That one,</v>

171
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.840
the best shape I've ever been in is when I met my wife, I was 186 pounds.

172
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.130
I look shredded Jamie type in skinny, Bert.

173
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.550
<v 0>I don't even look almost had a six pack almost.</v>

174
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.140
<v 2>And I had like side muscle. I'm going for that this year, this month,</v>

175
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.320
I'm really going here. I'm going hard this month. I've I've. I said to Jay,

176
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.990
Jamie and I made a deal with myself every day,

177
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.930
I'm going to do 50 air squats and 50 pushups. I was going to do a hundred.

178
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.633
<v 0>Skinny Burt. And.</v>

179
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.130
<v 2>That, by the way, I was posing.</v>

180
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.690
<v 0>But you were a stud.</v>

181
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.220
<v 2>That was me. That was when I was in spin class.</v>

182
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.050
<v 0>Look how skinny your face is. Well,</v>

183
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:34.320
your sphere face was super skinny after last year, sober October,

184
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.690
that photo that we, that you posted that you sent to us.

185
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.890
I look at my skinny face.

186
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.830
<v 2>I'm going back. I'm going hard this month. I really am.</v>

187
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:42.720
And I'm going to cause I'm going to enjoy it last month.

188
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.780
I think last time I did, it was out of spite. I wanted to prove to everyone,

189
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:47.790
I could stop drinking this month. I'm going into it.

190
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.320
Having not drank probably a third as much as last year. I mean,

191
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.760
meaning like I've drank three quarters as much. Does that make sense? And so,

192
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.560
um, but when I was in spin class,

193
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:01.380
we had Bob from the biggest loser was our spin class teacher at crunch.

194
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.850
This was back in the crazy.

195
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.630
<v 0>As Bob, the coach from the biggest loser testing. I never watched.</v>

196
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.160
<v 2>Uh he's he's he was amazing. His inspiration was so connected.</v>

197
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.060
Key connected to me so quickly. One time it's right before Thanksgiving and uh,

198
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.770
I'm looking good. I'm going to get to go to a wedding,

199
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:19.530
my buddy's wedding and I'm on, on the bike. And he goes, all right,

200
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:21.810
everyone out of the saddle is going to be on the saddles for two minutes and I'm

201
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:26.130
like, this. And then he says, you're going, whoa.

202
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.400
I felt like he was talking to me. He goes, you're going home for Thanksgiving.

203
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.350
You're going to see all the people in high school,

204
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.240
all the people that didn't want to have sex with you.

205
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.090
Do you want them to want to have sex with you this weekend? And I was like,

206
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:38.340
yeah. And he goes, then stay out of that saddle,

207
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.550
stand on that saddle and earn your Thanksgiving dinner and go out to bars the

208
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:43.980
night before and say, I won't you on better than you.

209
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.470
And I'm just going to want them to me. I want them to me.

210
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.740
I think of that bombs.

211
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:50.880
<v 0>I think of the heart and.</v>

212
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.440
<v 2>The paint that connected with me so hard. I'm like,</v>

213
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:56.520
I want people to want me.

214
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.510
<v 0>Isn't that funny, man? That bike motivated so many comedians. Oh, you know,</v>

215
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.410
just being a loser in high school and I'll show you guys I'll show you.

216
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.310
There's people that.

217
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.700
<v 1>Take them that takes them straight to their deathbed. You're still like, oh,</v>

218
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.950
they're still like, yeah, Sarah, I seventh grade.

219
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.490
This is for her.
