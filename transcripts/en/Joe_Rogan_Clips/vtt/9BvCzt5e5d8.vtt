00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>Let's let's talk about student loan, right? Because right now,</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.540
one of the big political issues, especially among the left, right?

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.410
They want to forgive the student loans and they want to make college free.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.490
Right? That's like a big thing.

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:18.270
Like we have all these students with all this debt and it's, it's bad,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.430
which I agree it's a terrible situation.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
But what the left doesn't want to accept is responsibility

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.250
for creating this situation in the first place.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.230
It is government's fault that all these student loans exist without government,

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.020
there would be no student loans. You know, once upon a time,

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.170
people didn't borrow money to go to college.

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.070
Nobody borrowed money to go to college. Right. My father, uh,

13
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:47.370
went to college and his parents were poor. I mean, yeah.

14
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.300
My dad said they weren't sure if they were upper lower class or lower middle

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.660
class, but you know, his dad was a carpenter. Um, and, um,

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.040
and so he went to college and his parents didn't have any money to send him to

17
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.280
college. And there were no loans. So had my dad go,

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.890
he got a summer job and he worked his way through school,

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.890
which is what most people did. You work your way through school.

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.000
So here's what happened, you know, around the 1960s,

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.670
once the 18 year-olds could vote, this was a big thing.

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.460
And they lowered the voting age from 21 down to 28, right?

23
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.430
So now you have all these 18 year olds that are about to go to college.

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.230
And so here's what the politician said to all the 18 year olds with democratic

25
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.210
politician. They said, you know, you shouldn't have to work your summers.

26
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.210
You shouldn't have to have jobs while you're in school.

27
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
You should just be able to go to school and enjoy yourself.

28
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.840
And we're going to make it possible for you to borrow money,

29
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.810
to go to school by guaranteeing the loans,

30
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.330
because normally the bank wouldn't lend you any money.

31
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.580
Cause you have no credit history, you have no assets.

32
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.960
So you're not gonna be able to get a loan.

33
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.080
What you're going to guarantee the loan and that way you'll be able to get the

34
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:53.910
loan. Now, somebody else won't get it.

35
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.790
Some businessman won't get the loan because we're going to make them loan it to

36
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.940
you. And now you won't have to have that summer job.

37
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.650
And then when you graduate and have a good job, you'll just pay back the money.

38
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.730
And it sounded like a great deal. Hey, I want a party now. I don't want to work.

39
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:09.810
I'm going to have a good time.

40
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.560
And when I get my college degree and I'm making a lot more money, well,

41
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.680
it'd be no problem that payback the loan. So that's how it all started.

42
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.690
The government came in and they basically created an incentive for banks

43
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:25.410
to make loans to kids with no assets and no credit history. What year was this?

44
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.270
<v 1>What year was this?</v>

45
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.880
<v 0>Maybe got sixties. I don't know the exact year, but anyway. So then,</v>

46
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.730
um, once the colleges saw that all these kids could borrow money

47
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.510
to go to go to college. Well, they were like, this is great.

48
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:46.380
I'm just going to raise prices. So all of a sudden tuition started to go up.

49
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.920
I mean, for a long time, and you can look back in the future in history,

50
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.410
college tuition used to be pretty stable.

51
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.440
It didn't go up very much until the sixties,

52
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.570
until the government really got involved.

53
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.680
And so as soon as colleges saw that the kids had access to all this

54
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.620
money, they started jacking up prices.

55
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.680
And then of course the university started competing.

56
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.790
Who's got the best gymnasium. Who's got the best housing,

57
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.320
all kinds of other incentives.

58
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.860
And then everything became bloated and they kept raising their prices.

59
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.770
And then in order to get the votes of the students,

60
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.600
the government kept raising the limits on how much loans they would guarantee.

61
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.640
So it became this self perpetuating cycle where the more money the government

62
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.590
guaranteed that the students can borrow,

63
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.680
the more the colleges could charge intuition.

64
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.630
And so tuition kept skyrocketing. And then as tuition goes up, it's like, oh,

65
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.940
nobody could afford to go to college. We need more loans.

66
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.740
So the loans themselves became the reason that people needed the loans because

67
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:49.810
the loans were wide. College was so expensive.

68
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.540
And so now you need it alone to go to college.

69
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.030
But without the loan tuition would have come down,

70
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.490
you see if there were no student loans at all.

71
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.770
And right now the government has actually taken over.

72
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.460
They don't just guarantee student loans. They loan directly to the students.

73
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.530
If there were no student loans at all,

74
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.720
if the government just said no more student loans,

75
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.760
all of a sudden the colleges would be, oh my God, we need to cut costs.

76
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.440
Otherwise we will have no customers.

77
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.730
Nobody could afford to go without these loans. And they would cut costs.

78
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.990
They would start looking. They would,

79
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.830
they would streamline their business like everybody else. I mean,

80
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.830
any business that could charge whatever the hell they wanted,

81
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.800
because the government could borrow the money. Right?

82
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:33.770
If you had a restaurant where the government was going to guarantee to,

83
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:36.100
to pay the bill and everybody who died there, I mean,

84
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.340
the restaurant could charge whatever it wanted. Oh, it's hamburgers.

85
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.040
A thousand dollars. Oh, the government's going to pay y'all what do you care?

86
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.820
You know,

87
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.360
it's because people are paying with their own money that they got to keep the

88
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.400
cost out. And.

89
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.330
<v 1>This situation has been going on for so long that it's just now how they do</v>

90
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:52.164
business.

91
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.990
<v 0>Right? But now see colleges now.</v>

92
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:58.770
So expensive kids think they need government to afford it.

93
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.160
And they don't realize that the only reason it's so expensive is because of

94
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:05.670
government. That's the Harry Harry Brown cripple you,

95
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.630
and then give you a crutch. You're free gummy now college. So expensive.

96
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.630
<v 1>You're free. Give me out, man. Jesus Christ.</v>

97
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.760
<v 0>Okay. Tell me, get rid of the loans. You know, let,</v>

98
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.490
let colleges lower their tuition.

99
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.080
Well then let people go back to what my dad did like work your way through

100
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:26.310
college. No big deal. We're.

101
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.430
<v 1>In this crazy situation where a lot of kids are gonna have to go back to school</v>

102
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:31.590
through zoom, even Harvard they're there.

103
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.820
They're talking about having these Harvard kids do school online for

104
00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:38.880
$40,000 a year. Wasn't that what you did look

105
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.450
at 40 it's more than 50.

106
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.100
Jamie says $50,000 a year to do school online. That's hilarious.

107
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.700
<v 0>Education at this point is a racket. I mean,</v>

108
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:54.810
most people will never recoup the cost of a college degree. I mean,

109
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.270
the colleges are out there perpetuating this myth, right? That you know,

110
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.800
um, going to college is your ticket to success. Then you have to go. And if you,

111
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:07.220
if you don't go, I think I mentioned the video on your show.

112
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.490
The podcast last time, where I was down on bourbon street in new Orleans.

113
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.910
And I was interviewing all the people there that were working that had college

114
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.100
degrees, but were doing menial jobs. You know,

115
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.310
the bartending bouncers and strip Cubs, petty cab drivers.

116
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:22.100
They all had college degrees. Some of them had two or three degrees.

117
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.960
And you know, they were doing stuff that, you know,

118
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.520
you didn't need to go to college to do.

119
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.550
And so the colleges perpetuate this myth. Look,

120
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.950
we have the internet today and the access to online classes and self-help,

121
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.510
you can educate yourself.

122
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.610
You don't need to buy this over price certificate that says that you graduated

123
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:43.700
from some college to prove that you're competent. I mean,

124
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.600
it doesn't even prove anything. Now, in fact, the government did two things.

125
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.910
They made a college degree, very expensive,

126
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.360
and then they made it practically worthless because before the government

127
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:54.920
started subsidizing college,

128
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.910
fewer people actually went because only the people that could really benefit

129
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.240
from the degree when, and so then if you had a college degree,

130
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.240
it actually meant something in the marketplace. Now,

131
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.940
since everybody goes to school, because of, you know,

132
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.580
you get the money from the government, everybody's got a college degree.

133
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:13.490
They mean nothing. So now you got to get a master's degree.

134
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.490
You got to get a PhD, you're in school till you're in your thirties.

135
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.650
It's just ridiculous that we spend so much time. It benefits the bureaucracy.

136
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.980
It doesn't benefit the kids. You know? So this bubble,

137
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:28.070
this is a gigantic bubble in higher education.

138
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
This is a bubble in lower education to, you know, I mean,

139
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.420
some of America's wealthiest men, they didn't go to college. You know, in fact,

140
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.100
way back when they didn't even go to high school,

141
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:40.400
they thought of these billionaires, you know, dropped out of grammar school.

142
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.280
But today with the internet,

143
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.580
it should be even easier for people than it ever was.

144
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:50.090
Because one of the things that the colleges had is they had the,

145
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.430
they had the libraries, but they had all the books.

146
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.790
So if you wanted to get access to these books, you needed to be,

147
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.790
get into these libraries. Well, it's all on the internet. Now.

148
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.610
They don't have a monopoly on anything, you know, and believe me,

149
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.010
you see how much they charge for these books. It's crazy.

150
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.950
It's such a good point. Professors write these books and they,

151
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.290
and they forced the kids to buy these books,

152
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.770
paying a hundred dollars for a textbook. I mean, it's ridiculous.

153
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:16.010
It is a racket, right? And it's all supported by government.

154
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.600
And the problem is if you come out against this educational racket,

155
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.470
oh, you're a bad person. You're, anti-education, I'm not a bad person.

156
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.300
I care about the kids who are getting ripped off. We're getting indoctrinated,

157
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.630
not educated and who are being saddled with a mountain of debt. Can I,

158
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.260
the government says the solution is free education, right? If you think, if,

159
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:38.510
if you think education is expensive now,

160
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.460
where do you see how much more it costs when it's free.
