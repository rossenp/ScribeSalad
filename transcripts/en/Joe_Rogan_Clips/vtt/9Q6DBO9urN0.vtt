WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 1>Experience. Flesh eaters. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>They'll they'll up a dog.</v>

4
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.560
<v 1>They're weird. I, you know, so like one of the things,</v>

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.480
I think it points to a certain amount of, uh, sociopath that I have.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.653
But

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.400
when I hear about someone losing a cat,

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.190
her dog to wild creatures,

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.710
I don't like my initial instinct isn't to be sad. Mm.

10
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.630
<v 0>I see what you're saying. You're like, wow. That's part of the, because.</v>

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.870
<v 1>You kind of view you sort of, I have this view that</v>

12
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.950
yeah. I have this view of that, that, that sort of like settlement and the,

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.540
the wildlife mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is,

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.660
is a global problem. Right. And one always wins,

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.660
like the destruction of wildlife habitat always wins. And then when you see it,

16
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.340
it, when you see it play out like that,

17
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.540
in some ways you kind of like hope like Ryan Kelly, who, you know yep.

18
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.610
Recently, uh, you know, that kid got a, a young kid,

19
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.090
it was like a nine or 10 year old girl got thrown up in the air by bison. Yeah.

20
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:13.570
Did you see that? Yeah. In Yellowstone. Yeah. And by no means,

21
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.090
as Cal hoped to see someone, you know, especially particularly a child get hurt,

22
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.970
but he is like, you know, they still got it. &lt;laugh&gt;.

23
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.800
<v 0>Yeah. You can't, you can't just close in on a bison.</v>

24
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.360
They apparently got within 15 yards of that thing, which is just ridiculous.

25
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.960
<v 1>Yeah. I think I keep thinking about making a shirt that says, um,</v>

26
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:36.720
Yellowstone national park, uh, habituating wildlife since 1877,

27
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.720
they do. It is.

28
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.400
<v 0>Weird. Uh, I've only been once. Well, I went once when I was a kid,</v>

29
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.870
but I went once recently, my family. And it was, uh,

30
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.950
very weird that you could take selfies with elk. Yeah.

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.950
These big herds of elk are so confident that people won't shoot 'em when they're

32
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:54.870
in like the public tourism area that they just go and hang out near the vending

33
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:58.270
machine. Yeah. So I'm getting a diet Coke and there's an elk,

34
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:01.230
like 30 yards away from me. It's so strange.

35
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 1>That's that's a little,</v>

36
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.620
little bit in line with what that's a little bit in line with what I'm talking

37
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:07.380
about. When I talk about like that,

38
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:11.580
when I hear someone's dog got killed by a coyote. Yeah.

39
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.660
You know, and again, man, I know like, like my brother has this little dog,

40
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:18.740
he just loves and they're inseparable. Um,

41
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.460
if that dog got carried off by a great horn owl

42
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.930
in a healthy greatho now could carry this dog off. It's like a little and dog,

43
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.330
I would feel real bad for him. Uh, so with that said, I,

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.730
I do have this thing where you kind of root.

45
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.210
And I do feel sad when I see like in a place like

46
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:44.010
Yellowstone, this is where it gets a little bit weird when,

47
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.320
when I see an wild animals, especially animals that people hunt for.

48
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.920
When I see that they've lost their fear of humans,

49
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.080
some people would look and be like, oh, this is like,

50
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:55.760
what naturally they should be like, okay.

51
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.600
So this is animals where they've had to give up their human where they've lost

52
00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:04.320
their human fear because we've given 'em this wild place.

53
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.273
I see.

54
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.400
<v 0>Old timey, old time, real steveella man. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

55
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.120
<v 1>I that's a good dude, Joe fairauto call him. He's a good guy. Uh,</v>

56
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.150
people see in, in like a Yellowstone park atmosphere,

57
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.230
you see where wildlife becomes habituated to humans and they feel like they're

58
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:29.670
seeing something more natural, right. Because outside of human hunting, they,

59
00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:31.710
all of a sudden don't have that feeling anymore.

60
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.870
I look at that and I see that it's like, um,

61
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.550
to me it feels like something's been subverted and something's wrong with that

62
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.790
situation. Yeah.

63
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.820
Because it sort of depends on how fresh your perspective is because I mean,

64
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:46.300
people have been hunting, uh, you know, people have been hunting in that area.

65
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.500
I mean, at least 10,000 years.

66
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.860
So then we take like a hundred year break and the animals become very accustomed

67
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:58.420
to people. It's, it's shocking how quickly they can get it back.

68
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.010
And oftentimes those same elk that live like the same elk that will spend their

69
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:08.370
summer in that park will migrate out of there and go into national forest and on

70
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:11.050
ranchland and then they'll be wearing where they can be hunt.

71
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.450
And they know they cross that line.

72
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.330
So the same elk that some dude could basically walk up and touch.

73
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.240
There will just something in his head switch and he enters and

74
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.040
they enter into a new mind space when they leave.

75
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.080
And they're still exposed to human predation. And if they wind you they'll bolt.

76
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.160
Oh yeah. It's, it's, it's shocking how it's shocking to the degree,

77
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:36.000
to which they, the degree to which they can keep this together in their heads.

78
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.960
And it's also pretty surprising how, how quickly they adapt.

79
00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:43.950
Like I would imagine if you were to open

80
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.110
up, this would be a pretty controversial idea, but I'll throw it out there.

81
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.550
Let's say you were to open up hunting in yellow, national park.

82
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.590
I think that it would probably be less than a year.

83
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.950
I think like us season a fall hunting season would have them right back into the

84
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:02.940
same mindset that all the other animals that,

85
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:05.820
that live with human predation, their sort of attitude toward people.

86
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.460
I think they'll very quickly get it back. That makes sense. But yeah,

87
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:15.180
people going up and Peting stuff, um, again, like referring to cow,

88
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.380
his ideas that like

89
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.490
people have gotten to where they confuse national parks with the amusement parks

90
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.970
and they feel that the animals are like on rails. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

91
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.130
they're on track stay. Yeah. They just, and it's like,

92
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.090
they're programmed to do a certain thing, but it's still wild. Well.

93
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.170
<v 0>It's one thing that I've discovered over the last seven years, thanks to you.</v>

94
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.010
And thanks to you getting me hunting is that most people have,

95
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.800
have no idea what it's like to be around actual wildlife to sneak up to them.

96
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.520
N most people have no idea about their sense of smell. Yeah.

97
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:54.880
Like to see an animal wind you and then just bounce to, to see that.

98
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.080
And to know that like you're dealing with some superhuman ability,

99
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.040
some like impossible to imagine with the

100
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.800
confines of your own biology, what these animals can do. And when you're,

101
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.440
when you're out amongst them and there's no cell phone service and there's,

102
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.040
it's just footprints and treking your way through mountains.

103
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.710
It's amazing. Yeah. I mean, it's,

104
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.390
it's not Yellowstone what Yellowstone is and what, anything like that.

105
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.270
And zoos is the worst example. Right. But when we think of animals,

106
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:31.710
like people always tell me like, like, cuz you know, I have a famous dog.

107
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.030
I run with him all the time and he's on my Instagram. And it's like,

108
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.380
everybody loves him. He's a sweet EST dog in the world. They're like,

109
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.340
I know that dog, if you love dogs, how could you, how could you hunt animals?

110
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.820
And I'm like, well that's no, that's not, he's not an animal. He's a dog.

111
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.100
He's a pet. He's, there's a science project. An,

112
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.100
an animal is a Wolf. An animal is a deer. That's an animal. What a dog is.

113
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.690
They don't outside of us. If you don't take care of them,

114
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.090
they won't know what to do.

115
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.730
They'll hope that the dog catcher comes and gets 'em and then somebody rescues

116
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.090
'em they're not wild animals. It's not.

117
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.850
And has it almost has less to do with how they're raised and more to do with

118
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.970
their ancestors. Like their, their biology has changed.

119
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.640
They've literally been bred to something different. They're a science project.

120
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.400
Yeah. And you see my dog, he's got floppy ears. He's a sweetheart.

121
00:07:24.401 --> 00:07:25.400
Everybody who meets him,

122
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:27.320
he drops through his back and he wants you to rub his belly.

123
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.200
He's just the sweetest dog in the world. That is not a dog. I mean,

124
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.240
it's not an animal, there's not an animal like that.

125
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:35.280
That would ever exist out in the wild. Cuz if he sees another dog, he's like,

126
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:38.400
hello, are you my friend? He's not like checking you,

127
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.950
the thing's gonna steal his food or, or Rob him of his mates or, or,

128
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:43.470
or kill his babies. Yeah. He's.

129
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.590
<v 1>A, it's it is the result of a 20,000 or whatever year</v>

130
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.030
experimentation with the domestication.

131
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.910
<v 0>Of an animal. Yeah. So most people, when they say they love animals,</v>

132
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.950
they don't even know any. They don't even know what they are.

133
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.260
They see the caged animals at the zoo. They see the animals on a rope that they,

134
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.820
they take to the dog park. They think they know what an animal is.

135
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:07.420
They don't even have any experience with it.

136
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.140
We've been so domesticated and so isolated in cities.

137
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.580
Most people, especially most people that have opinions on this, you know,

138
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:18.340
people that live in rural areas. I mean,

139
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:21.450
you know that you live in both man and Bozeman is, you know,

140
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.450
surrounded by these areas that are just completely wild. I mean,

141
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.370
if you're in Bozeman,

142
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.250
you can drive an hour from your house and then you're around bears and D yeah,

143
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:35.050
yeah, yeah. And Eagles, I mean, it's a completely wild place,

144
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.930
but people that are in those areas, people around Boise, Idaho, for example,

145
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.920
they have a totally different idea. People in Wyoming,

146
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.720
they have a totally different idea of what wildlife is versus somebody who lives

147
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:51.880
in Santa Monica. Like there's a video that just somebody sent me today of, um,

148
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.200
a guy in a thousand Oaks, uh, is uh,

149
00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.000
on his street and he's filming a enormous mountain lion. I mean,

150
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:03.960
it is huge. It's a big boy. It's like 150 pounds and uh,

151
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.480
they're in the car and they're looking at it through the window and him and his

152
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.960
son, it seems like, are, are filming this thing going, holy, look at this thing.

153
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.120
Yeah, yeah. Is right there on the street, a big cat.

154
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.440
And he was saying that like somebody was filming,

155
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.470
somebody was feeding it apparently. And they're,

156
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.470
they're trying to figure out what you want me to send it to you. Um,

157
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.550
I'll send it to you. Yes. But this, uh, you know, that's,

158
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.470
that's super rare. I mean, that's a real wild animal. It's super,

159
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.311
super rare that,

160
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:31.030
that anybody would have any kind of experience with one of these things.

161
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.670
And most people that are talking about animals that just really don't know what

162
00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:37.020
that he even means. They're just saying it. Yeah. I think.

163
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.300
<v 1>That there there's developed a, like a,</v>

164
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.300
a pretty big cultural division between people who, um,

165
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.940
a pretty big cultural division between people who kind of like live around,

166
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.900
work around and deal with animals and people who view them or think of them as

167
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:58.210
very other, uh, a friend of mine. Who's a biologist this, oh, there you go.

168
00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.070
Yeah.

169
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.770
<v 0>No, no. I'm sending you another one. I sent it to you. It's it's uh,</v>

170
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:06.210
from thousand Oaks, I just sent it to you. A friend of mine. That's one though.

171
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:07.330
That's a, that's a recent one too.

172
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.691
<v 1>Uh, buddy of mine,</v>

173
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.930
who's a biologist with the forest service guy named Carl Malcolm.

174
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.170
He might have heard on our, our show. Uh,

175
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.880
he just sent me a paper that was about kids' attitudes to

176
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.880
wildlife. And it was comparing rural people's attitude and knowledge of wildlife

177
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:30.520
kids with urban and, and suburban attitudes about wildlife.

178
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.960
And you, you can see the input of media when you look at this thing, because

179
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.350
people who live in an urban or suburban environment,

180
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.990
when they tell you the top of mind,

181
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.270
wildlife that they know about it's non-native stuff like lions.

182
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.190
Yeah. They're likely to know like what's, what's an animal, right.

183
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.630
And an animal will be like, oh, it'd be like a draft. Right.

184
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:59.820
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, and people who have a more, um,

185
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:05.180
rural or remote viewpoint would be,

186
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.180
are much more likely to when they think of wildlife to think of things that they

187
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.740
interact with, you know, and not like the things that are on your mobile,

188
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.180
above your crib when you're a little baby. Right. And it sort of points.

189
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.770
And also you, there there's a slight tendency.

190
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.330
I gotta look at this more carefully, but there's a slight tendency to have, uh,

191
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.330
negative feelings or think things are dangerous or bad.

192
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.690
The more urban you are in terms of native wildlife to

193
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.730
more recognize it as like a negative or bad thing.

194
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.320
And what they're pointing to is, um, again,

195
00:11:38.321 --> 00:11:41.240
I wanna look at this much more careful and pardon me to the authors of authors.

196
00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:43.560
If I'm messing this up, I was just looking at it this morning. Um,

197
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.800
what they're pointing to is the, the,

198
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.040
the stirrings of there being a, a greater acceptance of decreased biodiversity.

199
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.200
Hmm. Meaning that you're kind of like, okay,

200
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.520
with the bad things having gone and we're focused on like, what are animals?

201
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:02.880
Well, animals would be like a draft and hippotommus,

202
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.680
and the things that that Disney tells me about,

203
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.240
and not like aposums and raccoons, which are kind of gross. Hmm. You know,
