WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.200
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you fall won the ultimate fighter as a heavyweight,</v>

2
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:06.040
which is so crazy.

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.240
<v 1>I know. Cause if you look at me now, I'm like a,</v>

4
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.640
what are you weighing now by 70 fighter?

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.320
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. What are you weighing now? What.</v>

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.200
<v 1>Are you walking around now? I'm consisting like 200, 200 pounds.</v>

7
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.520
<v 0>200 Pounds. Yeah. Wow. 200 pounds. Yeah. That is like a one 70 now. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.160
In this day and age. Yeah, 200.

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.870
<v 1>200 Pounds. But, but I feel good though, man. I, I feel really, really good.</v>

10
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.750
And, um, it's, it's a level that I, I didn't expect to,

11
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.270
I didn't expect to feel this good.

12
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.430
I didn't think that a diet can make me feel this. Good. What.

13
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.590
<v 0>Is, what is particularly makes you feel so good? In what way?</v>

14
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.380
<v 1>Um, my energy, I have a energy level that I it's really hard to,</v>

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.900
to say. It kind of feels, uh, a bit supernatural in a bit, you know,

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.700
like I feel, I feel energy. Like I feel,

17
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.420
I feel like my body's energy, it feels, it's kind of hard to say.

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.220
It's kind of like, not, not hard to say.

19
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:02.250
It's kind of hard to describe without looking crazy, but.

20
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.090
<v 0>Well, you're obviously byon's vegan diet. I'm,</v>

21
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.770
I'm seeing all these supplements you're taking spilina and all these different

22
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:11.410
things. Yeah. You're obviously doing it right. Which is, you know,

23
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:13.770
there's a lot of people that they're, they're vegan,

24
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.450
but they're eating like pasta and pizza and like that. Yeah. They're just not,

25
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.370
they're not doing it correctly in terms of taking the proper amount of

26
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.440
nutrients. Right.

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.720
<v 1>And that's, and that's the thing about it. Like I, um, I read this book,</v>

28
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.480
the musless diet and it's by, uh, Dr. Arnold, Eric.

29
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.560
And this is like in the early 19 hundreds, he came up with this book and he had,

30
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.360
uh, some stomach issues and it was, you know,

31
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.360
not until he was fed up and was on like, you know, what I'm like,

32
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:45.590
he was starving himself. And then he realized he had some really, you know, uh,

33
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.470
it kind of changes his, his stomach situation.

34
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:51.950
So then he started looking into diet and nutrition and then he, um,

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.670
he became a fruitarian. Hmm.

36
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.990
And this book is talking about pretty much, you know,

37
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.630
the role of food in your body and,

38
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:05.620
and what it does and what causes mucus and what doesn't cause mucus. And,

39
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.180
um, you know, through understanding the mucus has died and just reading it,

40
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.860
it just gave me a different hold on,

41
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.940
understanding like a different understanding of the, of why I'm doing this,

42
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:20.620
you know? And, and it came, it became to me deeper than just like, oh,

43
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.810
I can't have this because, you know, the, it says I shouldn't have it. It says,

44
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.210
I can't have it because you know, this is gonna cause inflammation. You know, I,

45
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.890
I ha I know the deeper reason of why.

46
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.010
So it's easier for me to avoid the pitfalls of bad food. You know, mm-hmm.

47
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.810
<v 0>There's also a situation with people where there's</v>

48
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.450
everyone, there's biological variability where some people,

49
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.120
some diets just sink up well for them, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yes. Yes.

50
00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:47.840
Like I know,

51
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.000
I know a lot of people that they don't feel good when they eat red meat.

52
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.400
When they eat fish, they feel great. Yeah. When they eat light foods, you know,

53
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:58.160
their, their body, whatever, for whatever it is, their digestion favors,

54
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:59.400
certain type of diet.

55
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.800
<v 1>Yeah. And that, that's what I found too, because, um, uh, I don't,</v>

56
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:07.480
I don't know if this will work for everybody. It probably won't work for every,

57
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.440
I mean, it, most likely it won't work for everybody, but for me, uh, it was,

58
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.120
it was something that my body just was like, ah, it's about time.

59
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.200
You started to start to treat us the right. Way-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

60
00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:22.390
just see. And the crazy part about it is the fact that now I train less,

61
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.670
but I can train harder.

62
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:27.990
Like now I can do sparring sessions where like I spar for like an hour

63
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.590
straight. Really? Yeah. And I'm, and I'm,

64
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:35.430
and I'm sparring at a pretty good pace. Like, I'm not, um, like,

65
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.390
like it's, it's smart sparring.

66
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.620
Like we're not like bashing each other in the head and like that. Right.

67
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:44.700
We just we're we're we were being smart about it. You know, we're doing, um,

68
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.860
you know, a little bit lighter to the head, but more,

69
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.940
more heavy shots to the body, you know, mm-hmm,

70
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.420
&lt;affirmative&gt; making those ones count. Um, and just kind of like touching,

71
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:56.860
you know, giving an, a nice shot to the head, but not a, like a,

72
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.260
I'm gonna knock you out the shot to the.

73
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.490
<v 0>Head. Right. What type of foods are you eating? Like, how are you, what is, uh,</v>

74
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.010
like gimme a typical meal for you?

75
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.890
<v 1>Um, typically speaking, uh, it, uh, depends on the time of the day, but,</v>

76
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.890
but I don't eat no more enough,

77
00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:14.530
fast up until noon or until like one o'clock. And then my first.

78
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.650
<v 0>Are you on like a 16 hour or 14? Hourmitt fast, like.</v>

79
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.320
<v 1>16, uh, in bit fast. And then, um, once I eat,</v>

80
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.960
I usually eat like, uh, like I come home and I'll eat, you know, maybe like a,

81
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.960
a Hardy, Hardy shake that I make a fruit, and then I'll put some, um,

82
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.880
you know, some, some mushrooms and stuff in it. And just like, uh, you know,

83
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:41.190
the corticeps the, the lions MaDee and, you know, from this, uh,

84
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:44.710
brand life cycle. Sure. You, you, life cycle-hmm with k-hmm.

85
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.470
So that brand right there makes us, you know,

86
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.350
really good tincture that you just drop it in there and you,

87
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.990
don't gotta worry about changing the flavor of too much of, of your shake.

88
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.310
So I drop that in there with my shakes and stuff like that. And, um,

89
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.990
I usually take that that'll be my first meal.

90
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.820
Then the second one would be a little bit more hearty.

91
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:05.380
It'll be something with vegetables and maybe some potatoes or something.

92
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:10.180
So it's a little bit more hearty and then I'll have another hearty, uh, meal,

93
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.220
like a vegetable type meal, vegetable based meal at nighttime. And then, um,

94
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.940
then I'll usually be done for the day.

95
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.300
<v 0>Are you, uh, using any protein powders, P protein, hemp, protein,</v>

96
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.490
anything along those lines? No, I don't. I don't use any just vegetables,

97
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.690
raw vegetables. Yeah. Just.

98
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.290
<v 1>Raw vegetables, raw vegetables and fruit. Interesting. Yeah. And, and I don't,</v>

99
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:33.450
and I don't really feel like I, uh, like I have it, like, I have a need for,

100
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.650
like, I, I feel like, um, my muscle mass is, is pretty good. Like,

101
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:42.440
I don't feel like I'm, I'm too skinny or like, I don't, I'm not gain any muscle.

102
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.360
I feel like I can gain muscle and, uh, you know, it,

103
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:47.680
it is just been working for me and.

104
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.160
<v 0>It's, so basically you just eat to feel good. Like,</v>

105
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:53.400
however it makes you feel good. Yeah. High. Right. And you've got it down now,

106
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.440
you know, like what kind of foods it's, um, the,

107
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.320
the supplement thing gets strange with vegans. You know,

108
00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:03.640
there's a lot of folks that they're mixing a lot of different dietary yeasts and

109
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.920
a lot of different powders and different things and blending these different

110
00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:12.320
things. And it's, uh, some people don't like the way that feels when you're,

111
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.240
you're eating like that.

112
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.000
But it sounds like what you're eating is much more whole food based. Yeah.

113
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.670
<v 1>Mine have just whole food base. Like a lot of the foods that I,</v>

114
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.990
I became actually a good cook now because of the fact that I had to learn to

115
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:26.070
cook my own food. Uh, my wife, she was, she was busy, uh, becoming, you know,

116
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.870
busier on her own, doing her own thing.

117
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.270
So she wasn't able to cook me like she was before, but then I,

118
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.950
I learned myself and, uh, through learning myself, it just completely just like,

119
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.980
took the shackles on off of, off of me.

120
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.100
You know what I'm sayinghmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

121
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.100
<v 0>You cook took your own nice.</v>

122
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.740
<v 1>Meals. Yeah. So now I, um,</v>

123
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.460
I cook a lot of like west Indians type of foods because they have a really good

124
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.060
oh, okay. Vegetarian, uh, menu, like a lot of chickpeas mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

125
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.540
and, and things of that nature. There's a really.

126
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.380
<v 0>Good vegetarian Indian place around here that I go, go to see, I,</v>

127
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.370
I love Indian food. Yeah. It's really good.

128
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.770
I haven't gone a month cause I've been on this carnivore diet, but this, uh,

129
00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:06.130
this place was fantastic. Really interesting, weird, you know, vegetable dishes,

130
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:10.170
everything's vegetarian, you know, it's, uh, I guess it's, uh, with them,

131
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:13.570
it's a religious thing. A lot of, uh, a lot of Indians are vegetarian. Yeah.

132
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.970
<v 1>Vegetarian. Yeah. And that, and that's,</v>

133
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:17.450
and I like a lot of Indian food just because of that, you know,

134
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.800
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, uh, that whole food diet, it just,

135
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.360
it just works for me, but like, um, like you said, like these supplements,

136
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:26.920
like this, this makes me, like, I feel like when I drink this, like,

137
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:31.560
thepilina eat a lot of greens and, uh, even, even like the mushrooms, you know,

138
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:33.000
the corcept mushrooms and stuff like that,

139
00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:36.760
like I just have energy to just go and go and go that.

140
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.630
<v 0>Lifestyle cycle tincture. So hate me some of that recently. Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.590
<v 1>Very good. I, I gotta have, 'em send you some, I gotta have ' sing some, they,</v>

142
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:43.910
they send, like, they have like a,

143
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.310
a really nice tincture set that they send out. I should bring it, but, um,

144
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.830
it, it has like, like it has, um, uh, hi, it has Turkey,

145
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.790
tail lions main, uh, that corticeps, and, and it even gives you,

146
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.140
you know, a schedule on, on when you should take it and when,

147
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:05.940
when it's best for, but it is, um, it's a really, really good,

148
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.980
good mushrooms because, you know, they, they, they put,

149
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.460

151
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:18.100
It's a funny name. Yeah. I know.

152
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:21.410
It's it's cockaddu plum is from a Australia and it's,

153
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:24.490
it's like one of the most high, uh,

154
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.490
highend vitamin C fruits. There, there is like,

155
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:31.090
it's way higher in vitamin C than oranges and everything else like that.

156
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:35.650
And then cockoo plum. Yeah. Kakadou plum. Okay. Yeah. K K a.

157
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.971
<v 0>D U plum.</v>

158
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:41.400
That sounds like something that a little kid &lt;laugh&gt; cockadoo plant do. Yeah.

159
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.340
What.

160
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.240
<v 1>But that's, I mean, they, um, it's, it's a really, really good supplement and,</v>

161
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.400
uh, I don't really like to recommend supplements too much,

162
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.280
but that's one that I, I take and I'm like, man, I feel,

163
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.760
I feel way better off.

164
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.800
<v 0>Do you eat a lot of beats?</v>

165
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.760
<v 1>I do. I do eat. I, I do eat beats.</v>

166
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.360
<v 0>Are really good. Beats are supposed to be really good for endurance. Yeah.</v>

167
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:02.720
Beats.

168
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.640
<v 1>Are really good, but it's, it's crazy. Like just eating greens,</v>

169
00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:09.440
like I've been eating greens. I just don't. I, I feel like I don't get tired.

170
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:13.120
Like I used to, like, my body's just instantly recovering. Like,

171
00:09:13.121 --> 00:09:13.960
what was your old diet?

172
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.550
<v 0>Like? What would you, what was it like when you're training for a fight?</v>

173
00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:18.310
What would typical meals be like? Um.

174
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.070
<v 1>It was pretty clean, but it was, uh, I, I would eat a lot of meat.</v>

175
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.270
I would eat a lot of meat and, and, uh, I'm O positive.

176
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.230
So I'll eat like a lot of red meat and I felt really good when I ate red meat.

177
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.990
Like, it felt as if, like, when I eat red meat,

178
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:38.940
it almost felt like I can feel it like within like the next 20, 30 minutes.

179
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:42.660
Like my body breaks it down really fast, you know? Yeah. So I felt,

180
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.820
I felt good eating it, but I didn't feel like I, I had the, uh,

181
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.460
like the endurance. Like, I,

182
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.420
I didn't feel the endurance aspect like I do right now. Mm. You know,

183
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.860
I see what you're saying. So that that's been a, like,

184
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:57.530
the best that I ever felt was when I, um, fought teato Ortiz,

185
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.010
I was eating, I was eating red meat, but I also was coupling that up with, uh,

186
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.570
a lot of spinach. I was eating a lot of spinach.

187
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:08.970
Like I would go and get for Popeye. Yeah. Get a big bag of spinach. Yeah.

188
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:10.090
That's exactly what I was doing.

189
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.050
I'll get a big bag of spinach and ill just put it in a blender and just grind it

190
00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:15.890
up and then throw like some apples in it,

191
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.560
make it a little bit sweeter to change the taste. So it wouldn't be so,

192
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.080
so greenish. Right. Like I eating grass. Right.

193
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.920
And then I would just drink those all the time,

194
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.760
but it just made me feel so strong.

195
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.280
<v 0>Interesting. Interesting. Now,</v>

196
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.840
did you used to work with the nutritionist at all?

197
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.880
<v 1>I did. Yeah. I, I did. I worked with, um.</v>

198
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.230
<v 0>Because when you were cutting weight, like how many fights did about 85?</v>

199
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.590
<v 1>Uh, two, two.</v>

200
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.150
<v 0>Fight to 85. Was that too much of a struggle?</v>

201
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.990
<v 1>Yeah, it was too much of a struggle. Like I'm,</v>

202
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:45.750
I'm in a weird position cuz I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a very big person.

203
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.110
I'm not big enough to be a light heavyweight,

204
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.870
but I'm not small enough to be a middleweight either.

205
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.190
Like in feel like I can, you know, like, so I was in like in that weird,

206
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.060
weird space. So when I cut the down to 180 5,

207
00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:01.900
it felt like it felt drained that drained. I just didn't have the,

208
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.980
the movement in the pop, you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but then at 2 0 5,

209
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.340
I kind of felt undersized, you know, back.

210
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.020
<v 0>Back then, what did you walk around at.</v>

211
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.940
<v 1>Back then? I was walking around, around like 2 25, 2 30.</v>

212
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.940
<v 0>And what was different because it was from eating the meat, you.</v>

213
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.770
<v 1>Think, from eating to meat, from eating the meat, I, I will get that.</v>

214
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.010
<v 0>Alone has gotta probably increase your endurance.</v>

215
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:24.170
Just the loss of that much body mass. Yeah.

216
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.330
20 plus pounds that your body doesn't have to pump blood through. Yeah. You.

217
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.370
<v 1>You're absolutely right about that.</v>

218
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.330
<v 0>You know? Yeah. So that just came off naturally when you stopped eating meat.</v>

219
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.343
Yep. And.

220
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.280
<v 1>And, and another thing too, like I would, I would, um, you know, &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

221
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.040
this is another reason why like, cuz when I wasn't fighting,

222
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.680
that was the problem because I,

223
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.400
I would get into these bad eating habits because I would always know that when I

224
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:52.040
had training camp, I could just cut the weight and just right.

225
00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:56.120
Lose it like that. But uh, after a while that just becomes your habit.

226
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.120
Anything you do over time that becomes your habit, it becomes your lifestyle.

227
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.600
And I was eating a lot of sugar, drinking, a lot of boos and like that.

228
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.840
So I was like, man, I need to make a change for my life,

229
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.720
for the rest of my life, you know? Right.

230
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.400
And that's why this whole lifestyle fit so much better in me. You know.

231
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.550
Do you think that would've changed your career?

232
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.910
Had you eaten this way back when you were competing? I think so.

233
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.870
I think it would've but at the same time, I don't, I don't know. In which way,

234
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.030
you know what I'm saying? Right. I feel been too chill. Yeah. Yeah. I feel,

235
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.510
I feel like, cause you's so calm now. Yeah. I feel like I, I was,

236
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.950
I was what I needed to be at the time I needed to be it, you know? I see.

237
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:42.780
<v 2>I.</v>
