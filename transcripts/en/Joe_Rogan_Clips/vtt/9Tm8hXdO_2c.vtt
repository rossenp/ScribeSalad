00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 1>Experience. Yeah. I mean, there's a, there's a great Tony Saba, the futures.</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:11.640
He shows a picture of the 19, oh, the 1900 Easter parade in New York city.

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.840
And it's all horses. Hmm. Looking down from a building. I dunno if you find it,

5
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:21.190
Jamie 1905 or 1900 Easter parade, and it's like, there's a one car.

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.670
Oh. And then 13 years later it's like find the horse. Wow.

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.190
And that these transitions, they take, you know, about 10, 12 years, you know,

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.670
uh, you know,

9
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.950
12 years ago we were punching the number two key on our flip phones,

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.590
six times to text a capital C mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, and I,

11
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:44.220
and I think we're, you know, we're gonna be doing the same thing with, you know,

12
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.940
with, uh, with, you know, the transition with food.

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.740
I think it's gonna be going that way. Do you know what you said?

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.860
<v 0>Do you think that they're gonna be,</v>

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.220
do you have hope for all this lab created meat? What do you,

16
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.580
what do you think about, I mean, I know there's,

17
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.940
there's some process that I don't totally understand where they're able to make

18
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:04.770
actual biological, like bison meat.

19
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.450
<v 1>Cow meat. I'm doing a, a, a film series right now called food 2.0.</v>

20
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:12.930
And I had dinner on Saturday night, two nights ago with Uma,

21
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.490
the guy that founded me Memphis meets. And, you know, I,

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.410
I have the same sort of ickiness about, you know, going that direction,

23
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.720
but he showed me these pictures on his flip on his phone of, um,

24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.080
of this chicken breast that he's making. And, you know,

25
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.640
I stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, but I thought it didn't look bad.

26
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.520
You know, it looked, he had like, it, it chopped, you know, so that,

27
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.000
and it was grilled and it thought, you know,

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.270
I I'd have this sort of repulsion and against it myself cuz I've um,

29
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.830
you know, got myself off of it. But I looked, I looked at that and I thought,

30
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:50.750
you know what? That, that looks really edible looks good. Somebody that,

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.790
that could eat meat, you know, that, that would be appetizing.

32
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.590
<v 0>Yeah. It seems like the science it once, whatever it is, right.</v>

33
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.470
It's tissue and whatever that tissue is,

34
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.180
it's comp of a bunch of different natural ingredients, right? Whatever, uh,

35
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.940
whatever creates a Turkey breast,

36
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.820
it seems like it's just a matter of innovation and technology proving to the

37
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:14.980
point where they could recreate that.

38
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.700
<v 1>Yeah. No, the, the question is, you know, is that,</v>

39
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.530
you know, is that better for you than, you know,

40
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.730
the whole foods plant based diet or that's.

41
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.530
<v 0>The real question, right? Cause that's where things get convoluted. Like what,</v>

42
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:34.770
what is healthy versus what is ethical versus what makes you feel like you're

43
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:35.930
doing the right thing morally?

44
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.410
<v 1>Yeah. You know, the way, you know, I stopped eating, you know,</v>

45
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.440
meat about 1986. I went to a, a, I was doing a,

46
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.600
a story for fortune magazine on the biggest independently owned cattle ranches

47
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.440
in America. And there's one that was so big in Oklahoma,

48
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.520
they had their own slaughterhouse and they supposed to, you know, they,

49
00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:57.880
they kill the animal with this captive bolt to the brain it's supposed to happen

50
00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:01.400
instantly. But there was one animal that came around and it was still alive.

51
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.840
And it was at that point,

52
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:05.880
it was hanging upside down and it flesh and it's hide was stripped off.

53
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.800
And it's looking at me with its eye and it's following my eye as it's it hide

54
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.520
was stripped off and it was still alive. Yep. And it's, and it's,

55
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.400
as it's turning around, it was turning his head and it's still held my eye.

56
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.550
And I thought the son of a is alive and I'm part of part of this.

57
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.790
So I stopped eating meat shortly after that. And so I thought, well,

58
00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:27.110
I have to eat something, right.

59
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.510
I have to eat an animal product because you know,

60
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.910
you're gonna Shivel up and die if you don't. And then, uh,

61
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:36.750
so I became a pescatarian. That's all I ate for animal protein. Well, you know,

62
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.590
milk and dairy, but I didn't eat.

63
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.860
I limited myself to things that, that didn't walk, that didn't walk.

64
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.900
So Phish was like fair territory for me. And then when we made the Cove,

65
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:51.100
there's a scene in it where we take a,

66
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.900
a sample of hair from the deputy minister of, of fisheries there. And, uh,

67
00:03:55.901 --> 00:04:00.850
we tested for mercury. And when we, you, why it was out at the lab? I thought,

68
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.250
well, I get mine tested too. Cuz I was, I ate a lot of fish. I loved it.

69
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:05.970
My son's still a professional fisherman.

70
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.210
And I had a freezer full of fish all the time stocked up of, you know,

71
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.090
fresh ocean, whether not fresh but frozen ocean fish.

72
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.130
And I had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner all the time. Then when, you know,

73
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.080
we got his labs back sample back, it was eight times higher than was high,

74
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:25.880
which is like, you know, you don't want any mercury in your body.

75
00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:29.360
Mercury's the most toxic, non radioactive development in the world. And my,

76
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.720
my levels were 44 times higher Jesus.

77
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.520
<v 0>Now, were you experiencing any physical.</v>

78
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.720
<v 1>Effects of that? I was having, um, trouble with my short term memory.</v>

79
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.990
I had an a in my shoulder that was there for probably decades and I, you know,

80
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.910
I try to get it massaged out. And then if you start looking through the, um,

81
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.510
you know, the problems with, with mercury, you notice that there's,

82
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:56.270
there's a whole litany of things that are causes depending on how bad you have

83
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:59.710
it. But my doctor said, it's the worst he'd ever seen in Colorado.

84
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.140
So I had to get off of it. And then I, you know, this is so we're,

85
00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:08.620
we're here in LA for the academy awards. And I met my first vegan and I said,

86
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.420
what do you eat? And she goes, everything else, you know,

87
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:15.580
all protein originates with plants. And that was how I got started.

88
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.980
And it took a, you know, I thought, okay, well mercury has a halflife in,

89
00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:22.050
in your body of about 70 to nine days.

90
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.330
And so it took me about two years to get it down and I thought, well,

91
00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:27.490
I'll just try a little, two years.

92
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.490
<v 0>To get it down. Why did.</v>

93
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.010
<v 1>It take so long? It's cause it has a halflife in your body of 70 to 90 days.</v>

94
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.450
So 44 goes to 22 0 90 to 180, so, okay. Yeah. So it's, I thought,

95
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:39.490
okay then I'll start eating a little bit of fish and then it Jack, you know,

96
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.720
I had a tester right away and a Jack back up and I thought, okay, I can't, oh.

97
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.623
<v 0>Fish is poison.</v>

98
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.200
<v 1>Oh, big fish is poison for sure. You know, big fish like tuna, tuna, swordfish,</v>

99
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.713
Marlin. So what.

100
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.841
<v 0>Are the,</v>

101
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:53.960
what are the recommendations they tell you're not supposed to eat it more than a

102
00:05:53.961 --> 00:05:55.200
couple times a week or something like that.

103
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:57.720
But it seems like if it's got a halflife of.

104
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.400
<v 1>I don't trust any of that. I mean like, like, I mean,</v>

105
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.400
I can't mess with it. I mean, if you, when I was in Japan,

106
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.720
I went to Miata where they had the, they call it Miata disease,

107
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.480
but it's not a disease it's poisoned. This there's a, um,

108
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.920
a company that was intentionally polluting the bay where there's a lot of

109
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.110
fishermen and the kids of course got, well,

110
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.990
the cats got affected first cuz the people give the, uh,

111
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:24.830
the fish to the cats and the cats would've had called dancing cat disease.

112
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.950
Now you heard the, the expression, Matt, a Hatter that's because they had the,

113
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.510
the felt from a hundred, 150 years ago,

114
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:34.750
they used to cure the felt the beaver felt on, on top hat,

115
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.260
but they would use the mercury and the patterns would go mad

116
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.060
in Miata. The cats got affected in the kids. And then, you know, the,

117
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.140
the people, a couple hundred thousand people got affected and these were,

118
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.940
remember this is 1950s, a remote remote villages.

119
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.500
And an American researcher went there and saw that everybody looked weird

120
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.410
and said something going on here. And he found out that they were dumping,

121
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.370
you know, mercury into the bay. And I saw,

122
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.530
I visited a doctor there that studied Miata disease.

123
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:09.810
He was the guy that was in charge of figuring out compensation for what,

124
00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:12.490
what they owe people. And he showed me these brains of, you know,

125
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:16.690
they sliced open and it looked like Swiss cheese. What we're talking about,

126
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:20.320
the convolutions of, of the brain and how dolphins have more of 'em,

127
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:21.600
same thing with people. But you know,

128
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.840
and the ones with the slices that look like Swiss cheese with the holes that are

129
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.560
it's, the Mercury's eating up in the brain. And so you don't want, you know,

130
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:34.440
once you see that you said you don't want that in your body. So, um,

131
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.910
I had to get off fish and become a vegan, not by for ethical reasons,

132
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:43.310
but because of, I just couldn't eat it. I just, for health reasons. Um,

133
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.870
but I'm doing just fine. How.

134
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.710
<v 0>Crazy is that that most fish is poison.</v>

135
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.590
Like that is, that is such a crazy thing to think that the ocean is so up,

136
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.580
that most of the food you pull out of the ocean is a mess. Well.

137
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.100
<v 1>I mean, most of the fish that we're eating, I think 54% is farm raised.</v>

138
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:10.100
And what I read again, I just read it this morning in Los Angeles magazine,

139
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:13.820
but that's worse. Right? It's worse. Yeah. And you know,

140
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:17.580
the ecological damage it's doing is, is crazy. The, the,

141
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.570
the health consequences is crazy. See, so the,

142
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.730
the question is then what do we eat? I know what.

143
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.890
<v 0>About mals? So one of the things that someone told me that was, uh,</v>

144
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.650
actually someone who's a vegan told me about Malus.

145
00:08:28.651 --> 00:08:30.570
They said you can make an ethical argument.

146
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.690
That mals are actually less complicated life forms and even plants.

147
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.090
And they don't have the same nerve endings. They don't really move,

148
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.840
they open and shot and a, a viable form of animal protein.

149
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.520
That is just so primitive. It's I heard that too. Yeah. It's just,

150
00:08:47.521 --> 00:08:50.720
they're just not like we think of them as life forms, but so is broccoli.

151
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.880
That's a life form as well,

152
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.800
but there there's actually more evidence that plants

153
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.560
are intelligent than there is that mosks are MOS are an

154
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.560
incredibly ancient life form. But then again,

155
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.160
don't you get some sort of mercury poisoning from them as well.

156
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.960
<v 1>Well, they're, they're on the bottom, right? Usually. And they're,</v>

157
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.550
they're filtering. So you're, you're getting whatever PO whatever toxins are.

158
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.270
I'm not gonna say that, you know, Molis are, are poison. I just wouldn't eat.

159
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.230
I I'm going a completely different direction,

160
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.430
but I've heard that before that MOS.

161
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.870
<v 0>Are, you can farm them too. Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you can. Yeah. I mean,</v>

162
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.070
if we really can break down that they're even more primitive,

163
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.580
but yet more nutritious.

164
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.260
<v 1>God, you know, like, you know, I, I did a story in Polynesia on,</v>

165
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.260
on oysters and they have the big oysters that they get, you know,

166
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.420
put through for pearls, giant oyster. And they, they don't,

167
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:49.340
they just eat the muscle that holds all the, the organs and stuff on, you know,

168
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.300
when I said, oh, in, in America we eat the whole oyster. They're like what?

169
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.250
You know, because the muscle tastes like, like fish, flesh.

170
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.290
It's actually pretty good. But you know,

171
00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:02.610
the idea that we're eating all those other filtered or organs and stuff,

172
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.330
I just don't know. I don't. Uh.

173
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.610
<v 0>But you don't know, you know, I don't know. You don't know.</v>

174
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.520
<v 2>I.</v>
