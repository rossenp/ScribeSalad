00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 1>Well, that's the other thing that's going on with people is the fear, man,</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.130
when you, you have a hard time dealing yang, you have anxiety,

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:12.900
you have apprehension,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.410
you just fearful of the future and fearful of the disease.

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.670
Some people that anxiety before this, this can accelerate everything.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.960
That's going to be real hard for, just for mental health of people.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.020
It's going to be people that are going to have a really hard time. Um,

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.340
also accepting that this is just something that happened to them.

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.860
This is not something that they did wrong. You know,

11
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:38.460
when something goes bad and you did something wrong, it kind of like, ah,

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.040
I made a bad decision. I should have done it that way.

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.100
I up and we should have had that meeting. And then, you know,

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.600
you might know why your business fell apart, but if it falls apart now,

15
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.280
it's like, you didn't even do anything wrong.

16
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.950
And the government gets to tell you, they have to sit back. Now,

17
00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.570
if you are a conspiracy theorist and so many of them are,

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.550
you would think what would be the best way to gain more control of the people

19
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:06.780
the best way. First of all,

20
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:11.040
to accelerate despair and accelerate, uh,

21
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.933
unemployment,

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.760
you would do all the things that are just going to happen from the,

23
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.650
what naturally happens in a disease.

24
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.250
People are willing to give up certain civil liberties. If they,

25
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.780
if they think they can get more safety and it's true,

26
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.140
we should stay home. It's true. It will be better for everybody.

27
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:30.180
It's true that we need to take precautions.

28
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.210
It's true that we need to self isolate. All those things are true,

29
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.200
but it's also true that you're giving a certain amount of power to the

30
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:41.010
government to lock things down and control you.

31
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.880
They're giving people tickets in New York. If they catch them walking around,

32
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:49.560
they give them $500 tickets and they're doing it in other places too. I'm sure.

33
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.850
And that's where it gets weird, man, because who are these people?

34
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.310
These people that are telling you can't go anywhere.

35
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.980
They're just the government. They're just people.

36
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.930
They're people telling people that they can't go somewhere, which is fine.

37
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.880
If we need to do that like right now.

38
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.890
But what if it just sort of stays that way?

39
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.190
What if it stays that way to a lesser extent? What if they say, you know,

40
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:13.410
how are we going to stop coronavirus from really taking place?

41
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.560
I want to know where you're going. I want to know where you're going.

42
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.230
I want to know. I want, when you go through each state,

43
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.350
we're going to have checkpoints. We're going to pull you over.

44
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.350
It's going to be a heightened police state, sir.

45
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:29.220
Have you been tested for the coronavirus and you put a thing on your forehead?

46
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.910
What if,

47
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.690
what if this thing really does start coming back the way it has in Woolwine,

48
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.920
where people tested negative and then they later tested positive.

49
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.700
If that happens here, we're going to keep this lockdown thing going on.

50
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.830
What if it's something that we all have?

51
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:47.490
And it comes back like when John Jones had those steroids in the system and the

52
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.040
Pika grams, and it just kept flashing back. But what did,

53
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.143
that's what this stuff,

54
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.060
what if we test positive for coronavirus every couple of years?

55
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.700
What if it's like herpes? What if you keep it for life?

56
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.690
What if we're assuming we got rid of it? We're going to just accept martial law.

57
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.560
We're just going to accept tanks in the streets. What are we going to accept?

58
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.290
It's a real good question. So if you were a nut right now,

59
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.000
you would be going crazy because you'd be saying all the pieces are in place

60
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.250
for like a hostile takeover and they're in place because they

61
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.000
really truly are the best ways to save people's lives. Like it's all,

62
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.330
it's all a smart thing to do. But if you were a conspiracy theorist, you'd say,

63
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.110
this is exactly what I would do if I wanted to take over.

64
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:30.790
And that's what we have to be really careful of.

65
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.900
We gotta be careful of somehow another walking that very fine balance of

66
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:37.930
protecting people from a disease,

67
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.970
this invisible killer and preserving our freedom and preserving

68
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.870
rights. All those things are very important that we don't just give that up

69
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.460
because it's not the way to go. It's just not.

70
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.220
We have to figure out our way through this disease.

71
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.080
And then we have to figure out some way to return to normalcy and that's

72
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.920
got to happen. We can't just stay like this where no one works anymore.

73
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.980
We can't just not ever take risks. We can't just not go out.

74
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.790
So once this does get rolling again,

75
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.820
it's going to be real interesting to see how much,

76
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.050
if any control the government retains, how much,

77
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.970
if any restrictions get, get imposed,

78
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.090
how much of these restrictions we just absorb? And they become newer, uh,

79
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.090
new things. I got normal thing rather. Where'd you just go to the airport,

80
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.880
you have to take a temperature test and you go to the airport and they want to

81
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.714
test you.

82
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.420
<v 2>I have to start wearing suits, like kind of like star wars,</v>

83
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.050
like these kinds of states of helmets and breathing apparatus in everyone that

84
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.630
works at the grocery store. It's going to be robots, you know?

85
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.350
<v 1>And I imagine that you get to the hotel and you get sheesh</v>

86
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.610
Decompress and unzip, and you can enjoy New York city from your balcony.

87
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:50.170
Look so pretty out there with all the murderous viruses, swarming around,

88
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.830
killing people with the virus, got together, made virus.

89
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.860
Tornadoes started just throwing people against walls or.

90
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.780
<v 2>Virus babies. If I'm not born.</v>

91
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.913
<v 1>Listen, man, if a,</v>

92
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.630
if a wind can pick up a semi and make it fly through the air,

93
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.490
like we've seen why can't a virus tornado to slam you

94
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:13.680
into a wall. Imagine if like viruses accelerate billions of times. And they,

95
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:16.150
they form colonies and they become intelligent.

96
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.850
And they realize if they move quick enough, they can actually like,

97
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.700
they could knock you off your feet. And then they go down your throat,

98
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:22.534
like a demon.

99
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.680
<v 2>Know that's.</v>

100
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.030
<v 1>Not happening already. It's crazy for sure. But so is a regular virus.</v>

101
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.240
So it was a regular virus that we need to just what we're reading about.

102
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:38.470
The H one N one and all these other fluids that kill so many countless thousands

103
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.580
of people, not countless. They counted them. They're actually pretty accurate.

104
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.400
Right? We had a double check. I mean,

105
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.940
just think about the sheer numbers of people that have died from those things.

106
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.350
If those were demons, instead of diseases, how freaky would that be?

107
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.293
If we're like, look,

108
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.010
we're going to lose a certain amount of people every year to demons.

109
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.260
I don't know why we do. Why is it better to lose to a virus than a demon?

110
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.930
<v 3>Little cutscenes.</v>

111
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.320
<v 1>A little gods,</v>

112
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.890
a little Godzilla is just running up into your window and killing your grandma,

113
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.080
PB, God, God. You go in there and she's just bone.

114
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.010
It's just white bone sticking up. There's a hoard of little guns in,

115
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.480
let's just chewing through her meat.

116
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.750
Why would that be more horrific than a virus?

117
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.210
The silent thing that chokes you to death? I need to know.

118
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.850
<v 3>I've been thinking that like, it's hilarious.</v>

119
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.330
There's been that talk when we've talked about UFO's that all M all the world

120
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:46.940
needs to get to come together as like that alien invasion.

121
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.440
This is not too different than what that would be. It is an alien Texas.

122
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.490
<v 1>Yeah, it is. It's foreign to us. Action Bronson had it right the whole time.</v>

123
00:06:55.491 --> 00:07:00.230
Just get high and watch it in ancient aliens and try to get so

124
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:04.610
high. You just try to sort through what they're saying. He figured it out.

125
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.650
<v 2>It's interesting to think what if this did come from Spain?</v>

126
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.760
<v 1>Yeah. They're sick of us. Yeah. Imagine, yeah.</v>

127
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.200
Just try to some something that's the real fear is that they're eventually going

128
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:22.340
to have something that you can't fix. Not anymore. Now.

129
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.040
No one's going anywhere. If you want it to take over the world,

130
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.990
isn't that the way you would do it. I'm not saying that that's what's happening.

131
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.801
What if, and I'm saying,

132
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:35.450
if you were writing a book on a takeover of the world by another

133
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.510
nation, what better way to do it than that? What if North Korea.

134
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.493
<v 2>Was behind all this?</v>

135
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.400
<v 1>Well, I don't think they have the resources. China, since it's in China,</v>

136
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.340
it's much more likely we'll get started from China,

137
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.600
whether it was intentional and unintentional that's beside the point.

138
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.050
I don't think it was intentional, but I think that when things like this happen,

139
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.300
people do take advantage of opportunity and you gotta be real careful

140
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.990
who gets the better hand when they're taken advantage of opportunity.

141
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.050
It's just, it's an, uh, it's new ground. It's weird for people.

142
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.930
They know where it came from. They, they,

143
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.590
they have isolated that this thing did come from this market and [inaudible]

144
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:15.590
, they know it's just, it's the way things like this can play out. If there's a bunch of these is almost just like someone starting a conspiracy. It's not, it doesn't have to be done. Like it just actually naturally exists. And the same people that would benefit from a conspiracy or who would engage 

145
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.423
in a conspiracy to defraud people or people over in the first place.

146
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.710
They're the ones who are going to jump in and take advantage of it.

147
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:44.990
The quickest that's, what's so scary about it.

148
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.550
Totalitarian ideas thrive. When people are scared,

149
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.460
they want someone to take over the reins. They want someone to take over.

150
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.410
I'm going to block the streets, no more travel. We're going to block this.

151
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.490
You can't go to work. Can I block?

152
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.850
Then you're going to be poor and broke and scared. I'm not saying that.

153
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:00.684
That's what they're doing.

154
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.340
What I am saying is if you wanted to do something to really take

155
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:09.750
over a civilization, it would be this way.

156
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.690
That's how you would do it. You would do a diseases.

157
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.870
I'm not saying they're doing that. I don't think they are.

158
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.660
I think this is just a horrible, natural disaster.

159
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.680
I wanna be really clear on that,

160
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.420
but we might come out of this different than we went in.

161
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.940
That's real there's tanks driving down the road in

162
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.760
California tanks. And they're like, oh,

163
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.360
they're just getting supplies or something like what?

164
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.240
You there's tanks rolling through New York city. My friend, John Joseph. Wow.

165
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.470
He sent me a video from his phone of tanks. Rolling down New York city,

166
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.940
like armed Humvees and tanks. That's ridiculous. Yeah.

167
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.040
Freaky like military vehicles. And cammo like, where are you hiding?

168
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.670
You're in New York city. What are you hiding from? What kind of cammo is that?

169
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.930
Is it where they, even when they use them in cities, they came all up. Yeah,

170
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.760
it seems so rude. It is so like, to let you know, they might hide in the Bush.

171
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.320
It's too. But they drive through the cities to lock everybody down.

172
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.030
They had those murdered out matte black and shops. Instead.

173
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:13.620
It would be a little bit more intimidating.

174
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.120
Maybe pieces of pizza slices and stuff. Well, it's at least with cammo.

175
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.960
If you have your car is all cam mode up and you're not in the military,

176
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:25.470
you know, they're going to have an eye on you anyway. Like what are you doing?

177
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:26.940
Right.

178
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.890
Unless you're in like West Virginia to have like cam mode up H ones Hummers and

179
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:34.380
they're driving those real military style hammered around,

180
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:38.610
like please check dot guy's house. You know, please,

181
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.780
please read his Facebook police. You just got to give up a microchip.

182
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.810
They just put a microchip in your hand and you're fine. And it's also,

183
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.850
it doubles as a Corona tester.

184
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.390
So you make sure that you never get mistaken for someone with Corona.

185
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.540
They just have to scan you. Hey, are you going into this bathroom?

186
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:56.970
Can I have your hand please pop green,

187
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:59.970
go ahead and urinate with peace and harmony, go ahead.

188
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.900
Or putting those UV lights might be freaking out. I mean,

189
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.410
really I'm trying not to sound like a conspiracy nut because I'm not accusing

190
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:10.620
anyone of creating a conspiracy. But what I am saying is if,

191
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.810
if I was a conspiracy nut,

192
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:16.830
or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world,

193
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.570
this is not a bad way to do it. I don't think that's happening right now.

194
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.740
I want to be real clear,

195
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.760
but it's kind of the same result that we're experiencing right now,

196
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.010
where everyone's being forced to shut down with, who knows what consequences,

197
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.170
but it's also the right thing to do. So we're all like, whoa, how do you,

198
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.800
you know,

199
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.640
it's another one of those things about being a person where the right thing to

200
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:44.760
do still feels crazy. Still. It feels like, all right,

201
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:48.300
we're just going to sit around. Well, yeah, I guess that's what you have to do.

202
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.360
I know it's kind of in one way,

203
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.450
encouraging there's so many are willing to stay home and people aren't

204
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:58.390
rebelling. They're like, you. This is my country. I'm going to go to work.

205
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.810
I'll take a chance. Everybody's going to get it anyway. you.

206
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.790
There's way less people doing that.

207
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.620
And when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people,

208
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.220
pretty crazy. Almost everyone's complying with staying home.

209
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.960
There's only a few essential businesses.

210
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.061
<v 2>Yeah. We're going to have to,</v>

211
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:21.610
I think really have spacesuits to leave the house and work.

212
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.500
And they're going to have probably be like this,

213
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.200
this metal plastic thing that would wash off, really.

214
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.270
<v 1>Dudes are going to put socks in their space suits. It's going to be a mess.</v>

215
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.370
Are you worried, Jamie? Yeah. I've never seen you this word. Okay.

216
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.070
<v 3>Because I've, uh, everything. You're sort of saying, like, I,</v>

217
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.660
I look into the future and sort of see where we're headed and I don't see a,

218
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.420
I don't really see much out there cause I don't know where it is,

219
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:51.640
but that's not anything good because there's nothing there.

220
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:54.070
I don't see like going into the movies again.

221
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.170
It seems like that's probably close to out.

222
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.370
Movies were already dying anyway. They might not survive this.

223
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.250
They've already opened up the ability to like put those right into your house

224
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:06.670
for 20 bucks. Perfect way better suite. So winter movie theaters can open again.

225
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.990
All right. What's next concerts. Sporting events.

226
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.460
I don't know. That's just, those are all the fun things we used to do. So like.

227
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.550
<v 1>It's also once everything's in place where they can treat</v>

228
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:25.930
people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators,

229
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.170
then are we going to go back to the way things were?

230
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.250
Or are we going to have new standards in place? I don't know.

231
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.390
I don't know, man, that they look, they did an unprecedented thing.

232
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.570
They locked down the entire country to save people's lives.

233
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.070
Never happened before we're in new territory and you know,

234
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:48.850
it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense when I'm,

235
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.310
when I'm one of the people was talking about something like this.

236
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.000
<v 3>I try to find it. Like I just read yesterday. I don't know if someone shared,</v>

237
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.520
this was a F F Scott Fitzgerald wrote.

238
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.470
I think this was a letter found from 1920 when he was living in France during

239
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:06.460
the Spanish flu. And like he was talking, I don't know who is writing to,

240
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.390
I'll try to find it right now,

241
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.730
but he's talking about how they stocked up on a bunch of alcohol and people were

242
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.730
being told almost like now, like you're, you're not,

243
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:15.070
you're told not to go anywhere, but some people don't believe it.

244
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.780
I forget he was talking about another writer,

245
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:20.410
friend of his who wasn't taking it seriously and like, whoa.

246
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.243
<v 1>So it was like real.</v>

247
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.980
<v 3>Sound. It sound, it sounded very similar.</v>

248
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.910
<v 1>Yeah. I guess that's how people always have been. Right.</v>

249
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:31.150
Especially back then when it's real hard to get information,

250
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.930
imagine people are dying and everyone's just like, what's going on?

251
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.040
You've got to read the newspaper, like. What happened? It's fake.

252
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.440
<v 3>I just saw that this note was going viral during the pandemic.</v>

253
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:46.120
And a lot of people have been falling for it.

254
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.190
<v 1>Son of a. I was wondering, well, what a good way to end?</v>

255
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.340
<v 2>Everything's fine. Everything's fair.</v>
