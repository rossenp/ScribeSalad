00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, fear.</v>

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.350
<v 1>That people have here in the United States of competing with China is that China</v>

3
00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:13.820
has these advantages because their businesses are so their corporations are so

4
00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:17.510
intertwined with the government that we might do the same thing here.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.881
I mean, it's just,

6
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:24.860
it's a weird sort of slippery slope as sort of as laws

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.160
and all your different rights get eroded.

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.220
You get closer and closer to the government being in control.

9
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:34.910
Things like these new laws that they've passed recently,

10
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:37.940
where the government can just look into your internet,

11
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:40.130
searching with no warrant whatsoever.

12
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:43.760
This was something that I don't know if you know about this part of the Patriot

13
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:46.790
act that, um, this was one of the things that was,

14
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:50.360
people were furious at Senator Sanders because Bernie Sanders didn't,

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.070
he wasn't there. He didn't show up for the vote.

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.340
And if he had shown up and voted the other way, it wouldn't have passed.

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.760
Why would he show up? He won't comment. Oh, wow. He won't,

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.480
he's been reached out for, uh, to comment on it. He won't comment on it,

19
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.590
but it's very disheartening.

20
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.340
And a lot of people who are progressives are furious at them and they feel very,

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.540
very betrayed by this because now no one even knows like, well, you didn't know.

22
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.830
Right? Most people don't even know. Well,

23
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:16.340
the government can now look at all your dirty little searches.

24
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.220
<v 2>Care about that though. Like I, but.</v>

25
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.460
<v 3>It's a slippery slope, right? Is that the fear?</v>

26
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.650
<v 4>Well, here's the fear. The government is just.</v>

27
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.830
<v 1>People, you know, I don't want any, I don't,</v>

28
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.000
I don't think like I should be able to just go look in a Jamie search.

29
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.200
Like just for whatever reason I know Jamie's at home. What if I have some code?

30
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:39.290
I can go, just look what it was. Jamie looking at. What is,

31
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.640
what are you searching for? That's.

32
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.920
<v 2>That's creepy, right? It's creepy.</v>

33
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.590
<v 1>Like privacy is privacy. It's important. You should be,</v>

34
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:48.740
should be able to reveal what you want to reveal. And if the government,

35
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.080
which is just a bunch of people can peer into your life,

36
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.620
but you can't peer into their life. It sets up abuse. It's the same.

37
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
It's the same, like it's power. It's the same thing you see with cops, right?

38
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.190
All this that you see with cops, for sure racism is involved,

39
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.130
but you know what else is involved? Power. When you see that,

40
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.150
that old man get thrown to the ground. The one that Trump said is faking it.

41
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.820
That bashed his head. Yeah. Bleeding out of his head.

42
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.570
And Trump's like very good actor, by the way. I mean, that's what Trump said.

43
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.220
He said that it seemed to have fallen too easily, but yeah, he's dead.

44
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:23.570
He's an old man. God, the fact that he said that, that it's, this might,

45
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.190
he might be in TFA. Like.

46
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.300
<v 3>All of these conspiracy theories out there as an actor.</v>

47
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.570
I must say if any of these people are conspiracy guys,

48
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.330
they're they they're Daniel Day Lewis. Like.

49
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.700
<v 2>They are great actors.</v>

50
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.020
<v 3>Like, you know, like certain times I even send like dumb YouTube videos of, uh,</v>

51
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.220
there's a funny YouTube video of, um, uh, uh, somebody,

52
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.140
his girlfriend leading his two K NBA account and he just destroyed.

53
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.460
You can tell it took every thing for him. Like not to like hit her or like,

54
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:58.670
whatever. Right. He just, he was just destroyed. He was crying.

55
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.570
And some of my buddies like, oh man, I don't know, man. That's fake dude.

56
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.070
I was like, yo, that guy, that guy is a, uh, Emmy award,

57
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.870
Oscar winning actor. That is fake. Cause that is not easy. Easy to do. No.

58
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.130
<v 1>People think everything is fake. You think so many things are fixed.</v>

59
00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:17.040
So many people have sent me things. So you think this is fake? And I'm like,

60
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.180
oh Jesus Christ.

61
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.240
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Some things are fake. Yeah. That.</v>

62
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.080
<v 1>Old man falling the way he did and bouncing his head off the concrete in the</v>

63
00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:28.830
middle of a huge protest. Yeah. That was real dude. Yeah. That's real.

64
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:30.360
That's what happens when you push an old man?

65
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.650
That's to say the fact that this is the president of United States,

66
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:37.110
say that like, Hey bro, you would fall that way too.

67
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.520
<v 3>He's a Meisner trained actor. And he has a blood pack in the back of his head.</v>

68
00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.900
Like how can that pro-wrestling.

69
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.273
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

70
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.480
He fell onto a mat that was placed cut himself with razors.

71
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.030
<v 3>For years. So that wound bleeds easy. I don't.</v>

72
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.220
<v 4>You can hear the guy's head bounce off the ground. Oh.</v>

73
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.570
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It's a thunk.</v>

74
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.650
There's a S a hollow coconut like thunk when someone's head bounces off

75
00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:00.720
concrete. Yeah. It's terrible.

76
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.690
But the fact that the president of United States didn't just think that,

77
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.130
but he thought it would be a good idea to tweet that like he's falling apart,

78
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.590
all this protest he's falling apart.

79
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.730
And also the fact that they denied that they use tear gas to clear out that

80
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:18.240
square so that he can go to the church. Like, Hey man, there's video,

81
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.560
there's video of tear gas, you know? Oh, you want to call it's pepper, gas.

82
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:24.870
Okay. You know what? That pepper gas they're using.

83
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:25.890
You're not allowed to use that.

84
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.400
<v 2>Yeah. You know that. Oh really? Yeah. Allowed.</v>

85
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.810
<v 1>To use that in war.</v>

86
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.220
You can't use tear gas and it violates the Geneva convention.

87
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.470
<v 2>It's like a bile bile, Google that makes sure I'm.</v>

88
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.850
<v 1>Right about that. But I'm pretty sure I'm right.</v>

89
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.020
I'm pretty sure the argument that they're making is you can't use tear gas and

90
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:45.540
war, but you should be able to use it in protests.

91
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.650
And these cops are shooting rubber bullets and you know,

92
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.380
people are losing their eyes. Here. It is.

93
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.710
The military is banned from using tear gas on the battlefield,

94
00:04:55.711 --> 00:05:00.210
but police can use it on crowds at home. Here's why, and this is on CNN.

95
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.670
Just think about that. The military is banned from using this,

96
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.470
but you're using it on civilians that just want to protest the

97
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.170
tortured death of a guy who was being detained by a cop who had a

98
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:21.150
14 year history of being a piece of and dozens of,

99
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.720
I mean,

100
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.070
he had more than a dozen complaints of abusive behavior and they're going to use

101
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:30.270
tear gas in these people and just shoot rubber bullets, randomly folks.

102
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.700
<v 3>I, I don't know what it takes.</v>

103
00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:36.750
What is the lowest common denominator like he has to murder someone like in

104
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:39.590
front of you and people would still be like trouble. Yeah, yeah. Or whatever.

105
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.290
<v 1>Cause I think he's, he's, he's on the way out. I think it's, uh, it's,</v>

106
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.430
it's slowly but surely stuff like this. He can't help himself.

107
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.470
And under pressure when there's,

108
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.600
when people are angry at him because of all this.

109
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.400
And I think one of the it's kinda crazy,

110
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:57.270
but one of the big things that started at off where he really lost his composure

111
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.960
was all that that he said about Lysol.

112
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.610
Like maybe you could get disinfectant and put it in the body at cleansing. Oh.

113
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.420
When he started doing that. And then the next day they were asking him about,

114
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.170
he goes, I was being sarcastic to see how you reporters would call on it. Like,

115
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.890
no.

116
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.680
<v 2>You weren't, you were rambling. You were rent.</v>

117
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.100
<v 1>Like, I I've done that before. I've caught rambling, but I would say the,</v>

118
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.860
am I talking about, I don't know how you use the Lysol on a person.

119
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.430
Why am I saying.

120
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.370
<v 3>This? He's pitching, he's pitching as if like you're in the writer's room.</v>

121
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.140
And he's like, yeah, have you tried this idea?

122
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.530
What about you pair this character with that character,

123
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:33.800
but you don't do that as the president in public about health.

124
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.870
<v 1>Issues. See you look at this CDC.</v>

125
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:40.370
Some Americans are gargling with bleach or putting it on food to fight COVID-19

126
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.820
isn't that real really?

127
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.970
<v 5>I read, they did like a survey of a couple thousand people.</v>

128
00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:50.890
And somewhere in the range of like 4% of people admitted to gargling or

129
00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:55.390
brand or washing stuff with bleach, this is Darwinism.

130
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.930
<v 1>If you're over 18, go do it.</v>

131
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.260
<v 3>Way. Don't say that, Joe, if.</v>

132
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.130
<v 1>You're younger and you're young and you don't know any better and you just,</v>

133
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.860
you're not uneducated, but at a certain age,

134
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.010
like you should know not to gargle with bleach, right.

135
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.750
Tide pod challenge all over again. It's tide pod challenge, but it'll kill you.
