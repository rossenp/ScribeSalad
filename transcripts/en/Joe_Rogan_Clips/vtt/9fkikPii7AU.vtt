00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 1>Do you remember the bloom boxes? No, really? What is it?</v>

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.040
You it's been thinking about them lately. I remember seeing 'em on 60 minutes,

4
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.800
years ago, and I think Google headquarters was powered by one. What does it,

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.280
they were these funky little black boxes that had some chemical process of

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.510
creating energy and they were early on massive news,

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.190
promising tech in their super groovy, little simple boxes.

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.590
And they originally did it for like campuses and military, like large,

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.830
um, large, uh, installations for, you know,

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.710
multiple complexes and stuff how'd they were,

11
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:40.870
but then they were also making them for automotive.

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.660
They had a prototype and I was so excited. I, I don't remember it's been years,

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.020
but it was some sort of,

14
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.860
I think it was a ionic transfer process that went through a series

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.940
of elements within the shielded box to create the energy.

16
00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:01.100
But they were like self-sustaining and super groovy. It was called a bloom box.

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.450
<v 0>Anything? Yeah,</v>

18
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.970
literally it's just a big black box doesn't what's in there and.

19
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 1>I don't know what happened with them. They went belly up or someone there,</v>

20
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.570
it selling 'em. Yeah.

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.410
<v 0>So that 60 minutes. So that was powering Google at one point in time,</v>

22
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.650
those things. Yeah. And what's.

23
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.010
<v 1>Inside and I think Stanford was getting into it. I don't know,</v>

24
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:23.760
major mental flash back for me, even though I'm remembering it.

25
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:27.360
It's just one of those things that seems so promising that then went by,

26
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.560
by same with like Toro deal engines.

27
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:34.160
There was a great engineer up in Lodi that was revisiting Toro deals

28
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.160
and he had a, he had a Ford focus that would do his,

29
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.080
like his daughter's old car with a blown up motor. He had his own Turro deal.

30
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:46.870
Motor had developed that could run from the energy in the

31
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:48.910
charged particles, in the air.

32
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.510
What this thing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat test track

33
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.070
running on air.

34
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.430
<v 0>Charged particles in the air. Yes.</v>

35
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.150
<v 1>Ally charges.</v>

36
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.220
<v 0>As the technology improved that 15 miles an hour could be a,</v>

37
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.500
a real speed. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

38
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.420
<v 1>And then that same guy,</v>

39
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.900
I saw him once at a trade show and I was exhibiting at the show as well.

40
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.580
So I was there on setup day. I was bored outta my go. We were,

41
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.620
I was already set up on the Ford booth. So just walking around,

42
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:24.490
sort of sniffing around and see this trippy scientist guy in his lab coat

43
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:27.890
and this little booth that was like, you know, six by 10 foot booth.

44
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.330
And you know, at a show where people have like 200 by 60 foot booths,

45
00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:34.730
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he's got this odd little Toro thing and then a bigger

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.330
Toro thing and literally like a chalkboard. So I'm like, dude, what's going on?

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.810
So I started talking to him about,

48
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:44.010
he starts explaining the technology and what he was doing, and like this small,

49
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.160
all one had 300 foot pounds of torque.

50
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.600
The larger one had 2000 and he was looking to develop it for

51
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.680
rail cars, for semis, for cars, like, and on and on and on. He is like, yeah,

52
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.280
the biggest problem is stopping it once it gets going,

53
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.880
because the deal structure meant that the compression cycle from, you know,

54
00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:07.480
12 to two of that first cylinder was such that when the combustion occurred and

55
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.720
it propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going.

56
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.320
So getting that power out of the central crank was a challenge.

57
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.440
And then how to stop the thing was like the bigger cha,

58
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.790
but they'd run on like horse,

59
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.270
ionic charge particles, uh, diesel gas,

60
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:29.870
like they didn't even need spark PL plug. So I'm like blown away by this.

61
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.910
I go back the next day. Where'd you go booth, gone, empty, done.

62
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.100
And I have the guys in info line, try to reach out to 'em gone website.

63
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660
I'd looked at the night before gone got gobbled up

64
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.843
five years later.

65
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.300
I see him again at another trade show with another kick design. And man,

66
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.420
was he a bitter man? He's like, yeah, never again.

67
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.340
Cause they bought it and they shelved it. I'm never selling anything again. him.

68
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.410
I'm licensing to specific channel of applications and that's it,

69
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.663
his new product.

70
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.690
<v 0>So what do you think happened if you're a conspiracy theorist?</v>

71
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:08.050
Do you think someone bought him out and just I'm.

72
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.770
<v 1>I'm I'm a small, independent business owner,</v>

73
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.250
real realist in that hell yes. Someone didn't like that and they shelve that.

74
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.730
So.

75
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.650
<v 0>They bought it and then just shoved it. Yep. Wow.</v>

76
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.520
<v 1>So his next product who did that? Um,</v>

77
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.320
I don't know. And he was very cagey about it. Um,

78
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.440
then you had another product where you would replace the alternator in your car

79
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.960
with a generator and you had a small battery in the vehicle, right?

80
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.400
So this is a retrofit system. The retail model was brilliant,

81
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.150
cuz you'd have like a cheesy and expensive three axis mill,

82
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.710
a ton of CAD files and one product on the shelf. So in a lightweight car,

83
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.670
it was like an electric supercharge.

84
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.150
So you'd replace your a alternator and it had a tooth cog for the pulley.

85
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.150
And then your crank pulley would add a tooth cog to it and then tooth belt.

86
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.910
So the idea was it would,

87
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.780
is assist the internal combustion engine through its compression cycle.

88
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.060
It would negate the parasitic load of all the Fiat, all the front engine,

89
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.740
accessory drive mounted things, you know, your alternator, MOG pump or whatever,

90
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.540
by pushing the engine through the cycle with the captured electrical energy from

91
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:19.380
the deceleration, whoa.

92
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.090
And then in bigger cars it gave you like passes this and range, uh,

93
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.610
increase and, and did great things for PG.

94
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.770
And then the story I got on that one was BMW.

95
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.610
Put him under a big contract for it to license it and use it.

96
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.970
And then the guy disappeared off the face planet again.

97
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.010
<v 0>Geez Christ. This guy happens.</v>

98
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.650
Do you remember there was a video that was, uh,

99
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:45.960
search many years ago about a guy who created a car to run on air.

100
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.640
Uh, no, excuse me. Water created a car that runs on water.

101
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.520
And then this car that ran on water,

102
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.560
I mean apparently had a viable engine and it was really working. And uh,

103
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.400
and then he, he, he had a hard attack and as he was dying,

104
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.360
he was saying they killed me. They killed me. And then he died &lt;laugh&gt;.

105
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.280
<v 1>And even.</v>

106
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.480
<v 0>From the, nobody heard from the, the water engine again, but, uh,</v>

107
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.790
he's from Columbus. He's from Columbus too, from San. Yeah.

108
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.470
<v 1>See that happens.</v>

109
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.950
And I don't even like the term conspiracy theory because I think that's

110
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:26.190
something created by the machine to negate things that are disruptive and

111
00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:26.890
innovative.

112
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.790
So we can put 'em in a little box and call it a conspiracy theory or whatever.

113
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.310
And therefore it never happened.

114
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.990
<v 0>Well, anyone who doesn't believe in conspiracy theories? I say,</v>

115
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.980
look at Jeffrey Epstein. Yes. It's real clear. Uh,

116
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.300
Meyer said that his invention could do what physicists say is impossible.

117
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.620
Turned water into hydrogen fuel efficiently enough to drive his dune buggy cross

118
00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:49.740
country on 20 gallons, straight from the tap. Wow.

119
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:52.820
He took a sip of cranberry juice. Then he grabbed his neck, bolted out the door,

120
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.700
dropped to his knees and vomited violently.

121
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.370
I ran outside and asked him what's wrong. His brother or Ste Myer, uh, recalled.

122
00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:04.370
He said they poisoned me. That was his dying declaration. That's up.

123
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.290
That's up. I don't know if it's true. He might've been nuts. Um,

124
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.690
or.

125
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.650
<v 1>Both or both. That's, you know,</v>

126
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:14.450
that's another thing like we like to just call people nuts and write 'em off

127
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.250
some of the greatest innovators, uh, you know,

128
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:21.440
throughout the history of mankind have been a little off the rocker ne Tesla.

129
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.080
<v 0>Tesla was in love with the pigeon. Yeah. He was in love with the pigeon.</v>

130
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.000
<v 1>Love that story. Yeah. His final days, man.</v>

131
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.160
<v 0>And that, well, there's also a story that I read that I'm trying,</v>

132
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.760
I've tried to substantiate that. Apparently he was, uh,

133
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.800
he was so frustrated by sexual desires and uh,

134
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.000
a love affair that he had and the distraction that it presented,

135
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.910
he quotes destroyed his sexuality. I do not know what that means.

136
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.270
You know what I'd like to look into.

137
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.590
<v 1>It himself. I gotta say, man, I'm kind of tired of my penis,</v>

138
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.390
still ruling my brain, you know, at 50 it's like,

139
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.510
I wouldn't mind to be able to take it off and leave it at home. Jesus. Well, no,

140
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:57.750
I mean just like enough already, like enough.

141
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.420
<v 0>Already, you know, I get it. Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.140
<v 1>I mean like turn it on, turn it off as needed.</v>

143
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.100
And when appropriate maybe engineer or something like,

144
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:06.380
I don't wanna be walking around like a, maybe.

145
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.253
<v 0>I have a hip switch.</v>

146
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.460
&lt;laugh&gt; just like something you could just like set it aside and become a UN for

147
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:12.294
a little bit.

148
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.060
<v 1>Yeah. Or if these make it useful, make it like a GoPro Mount or something.</v>

149
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.060
I don't.

150
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.500
<v 0>Know. Yeah. I see what you're saying. There's uh, there's a lot,</v>

151
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.650
lot of in innovation that does sort of get swept aside that you wonder,

152
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.370
like there's a documentary who killed the electric car.

153
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.810
<v 1>Yeah. Again, Steven, uh, really interesting cat. The guy who, uh,</v>

154
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.290
produced and developed that. Yeah. Lovely.

155
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:38.730
<v 0>Guy. Yeah. I don't know who he is, but that is another example of, you know,</v>

156
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.880
that that was an innovation and that was a little bit ahead of its time.

157
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.760
And the powers that be were like, you. Yeah.

158
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.440
<v 1>They were not ready for it. Yeah. And that goes way back. I mean, you know, the,</v>

159
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.560
have you heard of the, the Seldon patent, very interesting piece of American,

160
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.280
uh, transportation history,

161
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.360
this prick named seldom was one of the richest people in the country because he

162
00:08:58.361 --> 00:09:02.120
was like one of your early patent trolls, ah, who like sat back one day, went,

163
00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:05.600
you know, we got these horse carriages and then we got these new motor things.

164
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.800
And you know, at some point there could be a horseless carriage.

165
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.040
So he like literally did like a chicken scratch,

166
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.750
drawing and filed it and got awarded the patent.

167
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.150
So Henry Ford in his first two companies, as well as the Dodge brothers,

168
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.870
all the early pioneers in the transportation sector in the us had to pay this

169
00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:26.590
prick a massive royalty to even produce the vehicle.

170
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.230
And it was Henry when he re when he,

171
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:33.150
after he went down and under and he goes reborn and came back out with Ford

172
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.060
motor company the second time &lt;affirmative&gt; that, uh, he said, you know what,

173
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.300
him, that. I'm not paying this.

174
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.980
And it was like eight years of court battles to overrule it in the national

175
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:48.300
automotive dealers association originally didn't want any trouble.

176
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.220
And everyone was paying.

177
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.460
And Henry was the one who had the gall and the balls to say, no, no,

178
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:55.770
where you not pay this prick. And they finally got it kicked to out,

179
00:09:55.771 --> 00:10:00.290
but they say that hindered innovation and transportation for a good decade.

180
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.240
Wow.

181
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.010
<v 0>Yeah, no, I.</v>

182
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.690
<v 1>Didn't know about that. Yeah. And it was only the electric starter,</v>

183
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.610
the Magneto starter that Henry Ford integrated into his cars that really made

184
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.280
the massive shift away from predominance of electric cars to her

185
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:17.114
combustion.

186
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.360
So when you flash forward and you look at Mr. Payne's film who killed the

187
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.440
electric car and you look at Firestone and, uh, who was it? Um,

188
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.680
Pacific oil, but it was oil company tire company.

189
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.440
And they created that bus company.

190
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.400
And then they did all the lobbying to privatize municipal transport so that then

191
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.670
they could slowly buy 'em all up. And, you know,

192
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:42.630
California had an incredibly successful electric trolley system through the west

193
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.470
side. It was brilliant. It was pioneering. It was, they had everyone,

194
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.150
they're the ones that ended up stacked in the desert. You know,

195
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:50.990
there's some of that footage in the film. Yeah. Cuz they, they,

196
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:54.150
we're not gonna sell tires or oil if this goes down. So let's tank it.

197
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.460
<v 0>Yeah. They do that. Yeah. They buy a company that's doing amazing.</v>

198
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.580
Yeah. And then just put it on the shelf.
