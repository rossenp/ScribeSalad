WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>Tickling balls anyway. Yeah. So the Chris Christie thing. Yeah. So,</v>

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.240
um, in Politicon he's what, what was he doing exactly. There you are.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.280
<v 1>Yeah. You want, you could play it if you want. Okay. Place.</v>

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 0>That Kyle questions. Chris Christie, anti.</v>

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.320
<v 2>Hello, go. First of all, I wanna say thank you for single handedly,</v>

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:20.154
destroying little.

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.510
I think I watched that clip like 40 times over and got anybody.

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.350
<v 1>Could you pause that for a second? I just wanna explain that to Joe.</v>

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.430
I don't know if you know what I'm referencing there, but, uh,

10
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.710
during the Republican primary,

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.870
there was one debate where Chris Christie just totally destroyed Marco Rubio's

12
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.790
chances at becoming president because he kept repeating himself over and over

13
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:40.790
given the same talking points.

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.140
And Chris Christie pointed that out and then Marco Rubio did it again.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.700
And Chris Christie was like, there he goes again. There he goes again.

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.100
And the room exploded and it was that interaction where everybody where Rubio

17
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:53.980
tanked in the polls and finished him off.

18
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:57.860
So my strategy with Christie was I'm gonna start this off by giving him credit

19
00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.500
on something to disarm him,

20
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.050
and then I'm gonna hit him with the real question for very smart.

21
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.370
<v 2>Um, my question is in regard to the opioid epidemic, I know that, uh,</v>

22
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:09.850
you care deeply about that. In fact,

23
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.730
you've gone as far as to call the needs of our generation. Um,

24
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.251
there,

25
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.290
according to two studies in the journal of the American medical association,

26
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.770
legal recreational marijuana would help fight the opioid epidemic.

27
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.480
&lt;affirmative&gt; so knowing that and knowing that 62% of Americans now favor,

28
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.360
favor, full legalization. Why not come out in support of it? Yeah.

29
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:31.194
Cause it's wrong.

30
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.973
<v 1>So.</v>

31
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.680
<v 0>Let it play out, let it play out. Okay. I can.</v>

32
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.560
<v 3>Cite you epidemiological studies from both Harvard medical school and</v>

33
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:43.470
from Stanford to tell you you the exact opposite.

34
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.110
<v 0>Okay. Pause right there. Pause right there.</v>

35
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.670
This giant problems with epidemiology studies and he should know that. Yeah.

36
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.190
So my studies were better studies. Yeah, for sure. Epidemiology studies,

37
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.990
you know, they're basically like questionnaires, you know, you don't,

38
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.750
you don't take into account all sorts of other issues that these people do in

39
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:02.990
their lives. And also like when you,

40
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.660
when you're dealing with those kind of studies,

41
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.500
a person could be doing marijuana, but also be drinking a lot,

42
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.140
but also be doing other things. Yeah. So if the,

43
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:13.380
if what the argument is is that it's a gateway drug.

44
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.180
The only way that argument works is if you somehow or another

45
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.810
tracked someone and saw that marijuana made them change their opinion in,

46
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.330
on doing other drugs. Cuz a lot of these people are just doing drugs. Yeah.

47
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.210
And they do marijuana as well. So they say, look,

48
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.010
we've showed these through these epidemiology studies,

49
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.050
that marijuana is a gateway drug because they started smoking marijuana.

50
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.570
And then they went to do heroin. They probably gonna do heroin anyway. Yeah,

51
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.360
exactly. That's really what's going on. There's no gateway drug drug.

52
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.320
That whole idea has been dismissed.

53
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.320
That's like saying water is a gateway drug to rape &lt;laugh&gt; cause every rapist,

54
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.280
drinks, water, you know, it really is the, almost that stupid. So.

55
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.560
<v 1>Do you think that when there was a little bit of applause cuz he answered me</v>

56
00:02:58.561 --> 00:02:59.394
quickly. Yeah.

57
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.800
Do you think that that beginning of the applause was for my question or for him,

58
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.520
him saying no in response a hundred percent for you. Okay.

59
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:07.400
Cause we were debating that. I wasn't sure. Um.

60
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.360
<v 0>No. Do it again. Play it again. It's really clear.</v>

61
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.840
<v 3>Why not come out in support of it? Yeah. It's wrong.</v>

62
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.830
I couldn't tell epidemiological studies from both Harvard medical school,

63
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:25.450
let's hear this.

64
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.190
And from Stanford that tell you the exact opposite and say that marijuana is

65
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.510
still a gateway drug and that people who try marijuana between the ages of 14

66
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:35.950
or, and 18 are three times more likely,

67
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.940
three times more likely to try opioid or methamphetamines, um,

68
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.060
than people who don't.

69
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.620
And I just don't believe that when we're in the midst of a drug addiction crisis

70
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.580
that we need to legalize another drug. Now, you know.

71
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.420
<v 0>Clearly he's got a food addiction.</v>

72
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.100
His food addiction is far more dangerous than marijuana.

73
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.810
Marijuana on a its own has killed no one ever half a

74
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:08.650
million people die every year from being a fat that's that's the facts.

75
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.410
Yeah. This guy is a part of a real death epidemic.

76
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.250
And if you were mean you would bring that up. This brings a

77
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.200
bank, robber size bag of EV and MSS to a football game. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,

78
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.520
he's ridiculous. He's ridiculous.

79
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:28.120
Talking about marijuana and marijuana being a gateway drug,

80
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.360
the whole idea of it is stupid. Like smoke marijuana or don't smoke marijuana.

81
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.240
But the point is marijuana doesn't kill you. It's really that simple. Now,

82
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:40.080
if you're saying that marijuana causes you to do all sorts of other things,

83
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:42.670
you've got to have some direct pathway. Yeah.

84
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.750
That shows that it changes your inhibitions.

85
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.550
It changes the way you think about things that's never been done.

86
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.283
If anything,

87
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.230
what gets people to try drugs is when you tell them that marijuana's dangerous

88
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.150
and then they smoke marijuana. I go, this is. Ain't dangerous.

89
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.790
Not doing anything to me. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I feel great.

90
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:03.340
The next day's nothing wrong. All I did is eat a pizza. You know, I, I got,

91
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.540
I giggled. I watched a bunch of cartoons with my friends. We had a great time.

92
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.300
That is the disinformation aspect of it is more dangerous than the idea

93
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:14.020
that it's a CA some sort of a gateway.

94
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.180
<v 1>I agree with all of that. Now I wanted to pounce when he said that,</v>

95
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.490
but you have to understand this was his town hall. So I knew that I was,

96
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:24.530
first of all, I was gonna be shoved to the side very quickly anyway,

97
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:26.530
because there was a whole big line behind me. I.

98
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.370
<v 0>Might be wrong about people clapping. They might have really clapped.</v>

99
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.450
<v 1>Yeah. Because he said it was wrong.</v>

100
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.050
I'm sure some of the people in the room were there to see him.

101
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.170
And they agree with him because it was his town hall. Yeah. But, um,

102
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.970
I wanted to pounce, but I knew I can't really go back and forth.

103
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:39.810
Like it's a debate.

104
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.640
So what I did is whenever I knew could interject just a little bit,

105
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.600
I pushed him on it and you're gonna see that in a second. What is that weird.

106
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.720
<v 0>Background with like a.</v>

107
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.600
<v 1>Bird it's a 1980s backdrop that they put up.</v>

108
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.280
<v 0>But what is it? What is it saying? It's like, it says.</v>

109
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.920
<v 1>Politicon it says Politicon on it with a weird, with a weird, uh, drawing.</v>

110
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.600
It is weird, right? Yeah. Okay. Keep, you know.

111
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.720
<v 3>People say, well, we have alcohol already.</v>

112
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.680
We have alcohol already and all the rest of it. I get that. Uh,

113
00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:09.320
but I wouldn't hear when we do iced alcohol, right. Would you ban or no,

114
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.280
I wouldn't ban it. You don't, you can't the toothpaste back the tube.

115
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.760
And that's a big,

116
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.710
important argument about marijuana because one it's you legalize this,

117
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.390
that toothpaste never goes back in the tube. You can't. So in California,

118
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.270
you tried it by the way, reason I know we can't do it is we tried it.

119
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.790
It was called prohibition and didn't work. Should ITT stay legal in California?

120
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.350
Cause it, well, I, I would listen.

121
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.190
I think the states have the right to do what they want to do on this. But,

122
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.820
but what I would tell you is that all legalization of marijuana

123
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.500
won't in my view, um,

124
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.340
alleviate or even minimize the opioid crisis. And in fact,

125
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.900
in some ways may add to it.

126
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.220
And I will also say that I almost never agree with the teacher's union in any

127
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.054
state anywhere,

128
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.850
but the Colorado education association has said this year

129
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.130
that the single biggest challenge for their members to educate

130
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.250
middle schoolers and high schoolers in Colorado as legalized marijuana,

131
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.450
that kids are coming with gummy bears and other type of edibles and they're high

132
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:16.130
in school. And that they're high, a good part of time.

133
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.280
And it's making it much more different, go.

134
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.720
<v 1>For them to teach. Yeah. Cuz they're laughing all the time. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

135
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.720
<v 3>That's the Colorado education association. I'm sure at this very moment,</v>

136
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.080
if they were watching would be appall to know that I agree with him, but I,

137
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.720
but I agree with him on that one.

138
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.680
And I respectfully disagree with your point of view.

139
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.513
<v 1>Thank you, sir.</v>

140
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.760
So he actually changed his position slightly because when he ran

141
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:40.990
for president said not only am I against marijuana being legal at a federal

142
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.833
level,

143
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.190
I wouldn't even let the individual states decide whether or not they want legal

144
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.231
marijuana. So in other words,

145
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:50.670
he would prosecute the states like Colorado and California that have legal

146
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.550
marijuana using federal law. And right there, he softened disposition slightly.

147
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:57.510
And he said, well, leave it up to the states and let them decide. So,

148
00:07:57.511 --> 00:08:00.660
but don't you think that's because he knows he never be president. No,

149
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:03.380
I think he still wants to be president. Oh, there's no way. He,

150
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:06.500
I think he's gonna run again. No, I don't know if he's gonna run in 2020,

151
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.380
but 20, 24. No, I'm serious. First of all, the odd, the odds that,

152
00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:14.020
that guy's gonna make it eight more years with that fair point.

153
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.500
Morbidly obese. Carcas he's moving his mind around with, I mean, isn't he,

154
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.930
he get a stapler, didn't he get his stomach suture. You know,

155
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.290
somebody pointed that out. I didn't know that. I never saw those stories.

156
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.810
I'm not denying that. It's true, but I just never heard it.

157
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.050
But if he did didn't work well, I had a friend who ate through two of those.

158
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.730
He, he, uh, when you're addict, that's what I'm saying anyway, about food.

159
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.960
He's addicted to food. That's like this, this is unquestionably.

160
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.880
He's an addict. Do you think anybody said that to him in his life or no? Look,

161
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:48.840
look how much thinner he got. Oh, okay. Okay. And he did this. Oh,

162
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.200
I guess he did this before the presidential race. Cuz he wanted to uh mm-hmm.

163
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.360
&lt;affirmative&gt; make it, but then he got fat again. Yeah mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

164
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.080
<v 0>So he was rot before he was like a,</v>

165
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.160
a bag of water before and then, you know, he,

166
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.520
he trimmed himself down.

167
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.720
And it's funny because I don't think in any way he realizes the hypocrisy of

169
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:14.320
having his own, um, you know, issue with food and he would argue, Hey man,

170
00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:16.270
let's I'm gonna eat what I want. It's a freedom choice.

171
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.910
But when it comes to freedom for somebody to decide,

172
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.350
to tweak their consciousness slightly,

173
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.590
all of a sudden he says you shouldn't be allowed to do that. Well.

174
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.230
<v 0>That's what it's preposterous. The idea that you mean,</v>

175
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.550
even with what he said about alcohol didn't make any sense. Like,

176
00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:31.110
would you make alcohol illegal? Would we tried already? It's called prohibition.

177
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.790
Okay. But let's pretend that you had some sort of an,

178
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.660
to keep that from, you know, going sideways again,

179
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.020
let's start from the beginning. Would you want alcohol to be legal or not?

180
00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:45.260
If you could wave your hand and,

181
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.620
and there would be no more problems that are alcohol associated,

182
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.780
would you do that and make it illegal versus give a

183
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:58.770
grown adult the possibility of deciding whether or not they want drink

184
00:09:58.771 --> 00:09:59.050
or not.

185
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.290
<v 1>Drink? Yeah. He's not being consistent in his logic.</v>

186
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.850
That's the point is that he's willing to say, um, he's thinking.

187
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.810
<v 0>About donuts, but.</v>

188
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.610
<v 1>He even &lt;laugh&gt; he even mentioned prohibition there mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but</v>

189
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:10.330
that makes my point, not his point. Yes.

190
00:10:10.331 --> 00:10:14.090
Because that's when the mafia got incredibly powerful because you pushed all the

191
00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:17.360
alcohol sales underground and they all the power and the money as a result of

192
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:19.360
it. And that's when crime is shot through the roof.

193
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.720
So if you wanna decrease violent crime and the drug war. Yeah.
