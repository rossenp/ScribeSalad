00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 1>Experience. You guys have put together is pretty remarkable. Cause thank you.</v>

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.040
The food there is so good. It's kind, it's kind of ridiculous.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.160
Like your pasta's got voodoo in it. I don't know what you're doing.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.040
It is voodoo and I guess it's because it's handmade, right? Because, uh, one,

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.440
the first time my wife and I ate there, we sat right next to the,

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.430
that open area where you can watch yeah. You guys make the pasta and it's, uh,

8
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:29.590
such a painstaking process. And you, you realize you really,

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.790
truly appreciate that. It's an art form, you know,

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.590
that like making stuff like that, like cutting no corners,

11
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:38.430
making it as good as it could possibly taste. Well.

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.951
<v 2>That, I mean,</v>

13
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:43.780
that's the ultimate goal is to create that extra between pasta maker and someone

14
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:44.940
who's eating the pasta.

15
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.100
Like if you look through the glass and you see a pasti or pasti in there

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.100
banging.

17
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.580
<v 1>Out what's difference, a pasti and past.</v>

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.140
<v 2>Is male gender. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; so, you know, they're banging out trophy,</v>

19
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.020
which is like a coil from Lauria and you look down to your plate and there's

20
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:04.370
like a and 60 to 180 pieces in your pipe. You're like,

21
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.370
this guy's rep this. He's got pictures of it.

22
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:12.410
This guy's doing 180 reps just for me. Mm that's a connection.

23
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.690
And once you get it, sometimes a bull pasta is a bull pasta. I get it.

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.210
But this is something different. This is, this is craft. This is tradition.

25
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:25.840
This is continuing this conversation of that's been passed on from

26
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.920
generation to generation. Uh, and all I'm doing,

27
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.880
all we're doing at at Felix is just a small spoke in a, in a,

28
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:37.000
in a massive wheel of, of Italian culinary tradition. Well.

29
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.560
<v 1>You know, just exactly how long to cook it too, which is amazing.</v>

30
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.270
Like the I'm maniacal, Joe. I get it, man.

31
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.750
You must be cuz the, just the way your teeth sink into it, it's like,

32
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:50.870
everything is amazing.

33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.710
<v 2>I like to call toothsome.</v>

34
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.990
<v 0>ENT. That's what aldente means to the.</v>

35
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.750
<v 1>Tooth. Is that what it means? Dental. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:03.660
Toothsome toothsome toothsome so that's part of the experience, right?

37
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:06.540
Is the right amount of chew, just right. Amount of chew and.

38
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.500
<v 2>Each pasta satisfying each pastas cooked region specific cuz they</v>

39
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:16.060
cook pasta very different in Naples versus Rome versus bologna versus versus is

40
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.500
the difference. Yeah, it's just preference. It's based on tradition.

41
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.500
And the thing is this authenticity is very personal, right?

42
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.690
Your mom makes macaroni and cheese with Veda.

43
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.690
My mom makes macaroni and cheese with till MC cheddar that authentic to me.

44
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:33.530
It may not be authentic to you. Italy's no different,

45
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.330
but the differences in the diversity are so specific,

46
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.090
not only per region, but town and then house to house.

47
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.640
And it's, it's been that way for thousands of years.

48
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.040
That's why I think Italian food next to Chinese food is the most

49
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:52.400
diverse there is. Mm.

50
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.440
And you could literally study your whole life and not even scratch the surface.

51
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.420
Yeah. Not.

52
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.100
<v 0>Not every,</v>

53
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.640
not every chef operates from being an artist and there's different levels of

54
00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:05.720
food. Um, I do have to say, you know, Evan is an absolute master, you know,

55
00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:08.200
he's, Evan's obviously not Italian, um,

56
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.480
but has studied all over Italy and it's really the dying art of handmade

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.120
pasta. And Evan is a custodian of keeping this art alive.

58
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.910
Like a he's a, he's unbelievable. Is.

59
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.830
<v 1>There a specific type of flower that.</v>

60
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.110
<v 2>You use? Uh, we import six different types from four different regions.</v>

61
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.390
<v 1>And now is the word about pasta and about bread</v>

62
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.230
and wheat in general is that American wheat is a different kind of wheat.

63
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.500
<v 2>It's, it's a different kind of wheat. It's also processed completely different.</v>

64
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.180
I don't, I don't use a lot of American wheat just because it's,

65
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.660
it's just been manipulated so much. And a lot of the,

66
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.100
the digestibility of, uh, in my opinion,

67
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.180
people are gonna freak out. But in my opinion,

68
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.690
the amount of work that goes into Dena past or to get it

69
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:04.170
flat via machine has a lot to do with its digestibility.

70
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.010
Just like sourdough bread is more digestible because it's broken down in a

71
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:08.844
different way.

72
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.690
The handmade pasta is less manipulated than machine made

73
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.770
pasta in my opinion. So, um, also the, the types of wheat,

74
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.240
the amount of wheat Germans in it, the new traditional value, it all has to do,

75
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.200
uh, with those elements within the, in the flower. And to be honest,

76
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.800
like I've developed a, uh,

77
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.320
a gluten intolerance because I've been breathing raw flower for the past,

78
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.320
you know, 12 years. Oh really?

79
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.190
As soon as I step in step foot in the lab and I start rolling a APH Follia,

80
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.390
my stomach, just start its acid straight up. That's crazy.

81
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.710
Just from the breathing RO yeah. Wow. Cause it's like, Taal, you know,

82
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:52.550
double zero flowers, extremely fine. So we have to throw it in order to,

83
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.030
you know, put some on the table to roll it out.

84
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.070
So you breathe it in all day long and we've got distrac, we've got, you know,

85
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.980
humidity control and air conditioning and all that, but still.

86
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.540
<v 1>But so you've developed an intolerance because of that. Yeah. It's.</v>

87
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.300
<v 2>Called white. It's called white lung or Baker's lung.</v>

88
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.340
<v 1>Baker's lung. Yeah. So do you wear a mask? Uh.</v>

89
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.140
<v 2>I do not. Why don't you wear a mask? Um, I don't know. Suck it like,</v>

90
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.940
well, like I dunno, you know, seems like that.

91
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.810
<v 1>Would be a good thing to do. Sure. But you don't want that Baker's lung on,</v>

92
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.370
right?

93
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.730
<v 2>I don't, I, I don't like masks. Oh, okay. This.</v>

94
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.563
<v 1>Whole experience.</v>

95
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.850
<v 2>This whole experience is very, has been very enlightening wearing a mask, right?</v>

96
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.890
Yeah. It's gross. I, I have another friend who also has a, a Koka who's, uh,

97
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.160
instrumental in my kind of understanding of uh, of modern. I met him in Balog,

98
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.200
a Japanese guy who has a lab in Tokyo called uh, bass.

99
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.720
And he has the same thing. He wears a mask all the time.

100
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.720
Cuz he's just breathing in raw flour all day.

101
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.640
<v 1>I never would've thought of that, but it makes total sense. I never thought,</v>

102
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.400
oh yeah. Hmm. Yeah. I, you flower. It's like a guy works at a,

103
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.560
a paint shop. Like you're gonna get sick.

104
00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.920
You gotta get one of the painter things. &lt;laugh&gt; the big tubes.

105
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.480
That'd be so weird. People be like, I'm not eating that pasta.

106
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.280
I don't know for me. It's.

107
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.120
<v 2>Part of, it's part.</v>

108
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.040
<v 1>Of the experience. It's crazy. What's in there. It's preservatives, man. Well,</v>

109
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.430
whatever you're doing, keep doing it. We want whether it's the white lung,

110
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.790
whatever you gotta clean that out. Whatever it takes. I.

111
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.070
<v 2>Don't know what you can do to get that. Can't stop.</v>

112
00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:24.550
Won't stop baker around of you.

113
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.270
<v 1>Just keep going. Yeah. It's just the pasta's insane. It's so good.</v>

114
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.310
It's and it's such a,

115
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.470
when you have really good pasta and then you have pasta that maybe you enjoyed

116
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:36.270
before you had the really good pasta. It's like, it's really,

117
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.860
it's like having one water in your ear. Like you think that's it people up.

118
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:39.980
Yeah. It people up. It.

119
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.700
<v 2>Does. I'm sure. I've like,</v>

120
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.140
I cannot tell you how many people DM me or come to me into the restaurant.

121
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.260
They say you've completely ruined me. Thank you so much.

122
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.060
Now I can't eat pasta anywhere else.

123
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.820
And I don't eat pasta in north America whatsoever.

124
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.610
I don't eat fresh pasta north America. I only eat past in Italy.

125
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.090
I dried past America, but I don't eat fresh pasta. Why.

126
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.923
<v 1>Not?</v>

127
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.010
<v 2>Most people don't know what they're doing, but.</v>

128
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.450
<v 1>There's gotta be some people other than.</v>

129
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.770
<v 2>You guys. Certainly. Absolutely. Like.</v>

130
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.603
<v 1>What are good spots?</v>

131
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.490
<v 2>Like if you, Ms. Robbins is, is exceptional. It's.</v>

132
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.960
<v 1>New York city. Oh, Brooklyn, Brooklyn. Oh, okay. all the way to Brooklyn.</v>

133
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.840
<v 2>Um, you know, Rob gent in Toronto is great.</v>

134
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.920
<v 1>So there's a very small amount of people that are doing it. I mean.</v>

135
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.840
<v 2>There, there's a handful of people who make pasta by hand period and</v>

136
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.680
even fewer people who know how to make pasta with the mozzarella,

137
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:40.230
which is the long rolling pin &lt;affirmative&gt; even fewer. And when I started,

138
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.590
I started doing this 11 years ago, there was nobody, there was nobody.

139
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.070
I checked, you know,

140
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.070
I moved to bologna in 2007 tail in 2007 and started this journey

141
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.910
with, uh, my Matra,

142
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:58.830
Alessandro SQUI Y and she kind of opened up the door for me to start

143
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.300
seeking out other pasta makers throughout Italy.

144
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.140
And when I came back in oh eight,

145
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.780
I ran a restaurant called rustic canyon for about four years. And you know,

146
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.100
not a lot of people were serving the style of pasta that I wanted to serve.

147
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.140
So I started giving it away like a gateway drug &lt;laugh&gt; I was just like,

148
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.290
send it to tables for free. And then like, what the?

149
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.770
&lt;laugh&gt; and it just started gaining momentum, gaining momentum. Wow. So.

150
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.690
<v 1>So when you moved to Italy to, to learn how to do, like what,</v>

151
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:32.090
what is an apprenticeship like in, you know, learning how to make pasta?

152
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.810
<v 2>I mean, it's an apprenticeship. You have to put yourself in the,</v>

153
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:41.400
in the student's chair and, and be as sponge. I didn't speak any,

154
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.360
not a lick of Italian. Um, but the Italians are very expressive.

155
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.640
So you're able to communicate through just being Italian, I guess. And um,

156
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.280
I spent three months, you know, six days a week, 10 hours a day,

157
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.760
just making pasta. Wow. Period.

158
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.440
<v 1>See, this is what's fascinating to me. Things, you just, you,</v>

159
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.280
you just take for granted, oh, here is a plate of pasta, like, but what,

160
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.920
what is involved in learning how to make it that good.

161
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.640
<v 2>It's not just ingredients. When people sit down at a, at a restaurant,</v>

162
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:15.270
people aren't paying for,

163
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.390
for the experience of sitting there and the cost of food, they're,

164
00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:22.830
they're paying for the experience of the people that are making the food.

165
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.430
Mm that's a big part of it. That's the way that I look at it.

166
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:31.070
And 11 years of making pasta by hand,

167
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.540
there's a lot of depth that some of the younger guys

168
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.420
just aren't willing to pay the time cost. Mm.

169
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.060
And a lot of the younger cooks out there.

170
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:45.220
They bounce around from job to job six months here, three months here.

171
00:09:45.221 --> 00:09:48.100
And they think that they've mastered it, but there's just no depth.

172
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.380
There's no depth.

173
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.260
<v 0>You know, you have to also consider how labor intensive it is to, you know,</v>

174
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.010
hand roll out the pasta. And you know what Evan was saying before,

175
00:09:57.011 --> 00:10:00.370
like each one rolled by hand, you know, when you, when you eat a bowl of pasta,

176
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.730
you're not thinking that each one was like pressed out by hand.

177
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.850
So it's like extremely labor intensive.

178
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.890
And a lot of people when we were opening, um,

179
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.850
Evan did have his own restaurant BCA before, which was also, um,

180
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.840
a basically focused around pasta as a, well, that's a whole other story.

181
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.140
Um,

182
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.360
but when we were going to open up this restaurant and we put in the middle of

183
00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:26.320
the restaurant, the temperature controlled pasta lab, which is taking up tables.

184
00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:28.520
So if you're a business person, a restaurant tour,

185
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.280
you say how many tables could fit in there?

186
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.320
How much is each table worth to your, your bottom line?

187
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:38.310
You're using up that space to put in using that space to put in a

188
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:42.670
pasta lab. Are you crazy? Um, also, you know, when you're thinking about,

189
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.830
you know, training the people and how labor intensive it is,

190
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.030
people were saying like, we're, we're crazy doing, doing this.

191
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.790
<v 2>Again. Yeah. They don't think we could make money. Yeah.</v>

192
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.310
<v 1>Well, it is a lot of space that pasta lab is a big space,</v>

193
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:59.020
but it's so cool to be sitting. Right, right there. It's a show stopper. Yeah.

194
00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:00.780
It really it's. It's something special.
