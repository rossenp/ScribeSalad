WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>So, for example, at one point I argued that I wanted to compete, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.120
in the octogenarian under 120 pound category

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.560
in, uh, judo, because you identify first because I identify 80,

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.120
20 pound and also I'm trans gravity. I, I, I set my weight at, you know,

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.320
whatever my weight is, therefore yes. And then,

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.270
cause I can change my identity on a daily basis cuz Harvard university taught us

7
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:30.190
that, uh, I'm later going to fight in the under 80 year old category.

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.350
<v 1>Hold on. Harvard allows you to change it on a daily.</v>

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.790
<v 0>Basis. Harvard university came out,</v>

10
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:37.150
that's actually discussed this in my Canadian Senate testimony,

11
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:39.790
Harvard university's LGBTQ, uh,

12
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.220
a plus plus star double star, infinite to the hashtag mesen prime.

13
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.620
Exactly. They came out, uh,

14
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:51.940
with a pamphlet that said not only can we change, you know, our, our,

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.740
our gender identity, but it can fluctuate on a daily basis.

16
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.650
Right. So I could be, he, she Zeer Monday, Tuesday day, Wednesday. Right?

17
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:07.490
And so I took this idea and I said, well, I, I identify as an 80 year old,

18
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.410
under 120 pound Monday, but then I'm going to fight in the Jule competition.

19
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.490
I use Judah because my brother was an Olympian and Jule,

20
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.130
as I think we might have discussed. Yeah.

21
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.250
I'm going to fight in the under eight category on Tuesday because I

22
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:24.600
self-identify on Tuesday as being a child. Now it sounds satirical and insane.

23
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.360
A Dutch gentleman who's 69 years old. Did you know this case? Yeah, I did.

24
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.960
&lt;laugh&gt; that's trans.

25
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.813
<v 1>Ageism. He,</v>

26
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.920
he decided that he identifies with someone 20 years younger and he wants to use

27
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:38.720
it on dating apps. Ly wants to.

28
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.000
<v 0>Change his birth. And then that would change his pension thing, whatever it was.</v>

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.070
I so, so I mean where then,

30
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:48.990
then I introduce a new term and then that proved to be prophetically satirical.

31
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.630
Uh, I coined a new, uh, condition called transgenderism by proxy.

32
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.670
So, so if, if, if, if you're watching now enjoy this, uh,

33
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.750
if Joe and God have sex,

34
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.180
if I self-identify you as a woman,

35
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.340
then I'm engaging in heterosexual sex. So it's not about me.

36
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.420
<v 1>You be self-identify me. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.300
<v 0>I, I, I, you.</v>

38
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.060
<v 1>Can change my identity based on your own interpretations of me.</v>

39
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.340
<v 0>Exactly. So it's not, it's not that my self-identity changes into woman. The,</v>

40
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.210
the guy that I'm having sex with, I self-identify as a female. Well,

41
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.490
a few weeks, maybe not even a few weeks later,

42
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.370
some trans activist on Twitter came out and said, you disgusting.

43
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.210
Transphobes just because you have a excuse, the term,

44
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.210
a Dick in your mouth doesn't mean that that's a Dick.

45
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:43.770
If it's a woman and I call this trans, uh, uh, kind Lingus,

46
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.913
wait a minute.

47
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.960
<v 1>Wait a minute, wait a minute. It doesn't mean it's a Dick.</v>

48
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.240
If that person it's a womanize as a woman.

49
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.840
So just because you have a Dick in your mouth,

50
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:55.480
it doesn't mean it's a Dick because that's a woman. You are.

51
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.880
<v 0>Giving sex to a woman. Do you know? Yeah. So there's a nine inch penis in your,</v>

52
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:00.320
in your thing, but it's a vagina.

53
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.000
<v 1>Yale put, they put tampons in the men's room. Yes, sir. Of course.</v>

54
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.640
I know they said that not only women. Of course I do.

55
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.080
<v 0>That's men's that's my daily life. That's called Tuesday for me, man.</v>

56
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.880
<v 1>I have a hard time getting that out because I'm like what women?</v>

57
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.950
Aren't the only ones who men's straight. What? Yes they are. Yes they are. God.

58
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.630
Boys can have periods too children to be taught the latest victory for trans.

59
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.230
There you go. I love how they say that. The latest victory's right.

60
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.590
Latest victory for who wrote that story? Who wrote that? Vox?

61
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.430
Who Helena, Hey Helena, off. That's not a victory.

62
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:41.860
That's no nonsense. That is God nonsense. But.

63
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.980
<v 0>Can I tell you what? It's.</v>

64
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.940
<v 1>Not victory. That's crazy. Kids.</v>

65
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.260
Kids don't know if you want to tell kids that sometimes people are

66
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:52.300
born in the wrong bodies. That seems to be true.

67
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.500
There seems to be real evidence to that in terms of the way the brain works.

68
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.700
Sure. I mean, you, if you want to call it,

69
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.770
the problem is distinguishing it from

70
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.850
normalcy in a way that makes it look inferior. Right? Right.

71
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.690
Isn't that the real problem. So if someone has this condition,

72
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.170
they shouldn't feel inferior.

73
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.890
<v 0>And you shouldn't be bigoted towards them and they shouldn't live being exposed</v>

74
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:19.130
to any discrimination. Right.

75
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.920
But we shouldn't change our understanding of reality to celebrate your unique

76
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:26.640
personhood. Exactly. And incidentally, one,

77
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.680
one of the things I talk about in the book, all of these idea pathogens,

78
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.480
I argue some of them come from really noble places. I think so as well. Yeah.

79
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.440
So let's cover a few of these. So for example, the empty slate, premise,

80
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.641
tabula Raza,

81
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:43.430
we're born with mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is a profoundly idiotic position,

82
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.870
but it really stems from the noble hopeful position that if we're all born with

83
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.350
equal potentiality, we could all reach the same end trajectory, right?

84
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.070
If only the environment were conducive for us being top athletes,

85
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.190
top scientists, top mathematicians, then we would've reached it.

86
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:05.020
There is nothing inherently at the start at T equals zero that differentiates

87
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:09.380
any of us. Now that's in insanely stupid and wrong, but it is a hopeful message.

88
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.420
Now extend this to other contexts, right? Uh,

89
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.220
it shouldn't be that you are defined by your biological sex.

90
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.580
You could change it in any way you want. That sounds very liberating. Right? Mm.

91
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.570
So I think a lot of the, these idea pathogens, what I call these,

92
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:28.330
these parasitic ideas really come from a notion of trying to liberate

93
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.690
people from otherwise. They're the shackles of reality.

94
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it's insane. Yeah. It's a form of,

95
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.850
of delusional thinking, but that is rooted.

96
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.370
It's Genesis comes from a good place.

97
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.760
<v 1>I, I couldn't agree with that more.</v>

98
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.200
And gender dysphoria used to be considered, uh,

99
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.560
used to be considered a mental disorder. Right. But isn't it.

100
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.120
Right? Well listen, but, but what is it? Okay. But let's be honest if it's not,

101
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.600
if it's, is it a physical disorder? What is.

102
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 0>It? I'll put it in a very okay. Charitable politically correct way.</v>

103
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.280
It's certainly not part of the default value of human expressions.

104
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.240
Do you see what I'm saying? Yes. Male and female is the default values.

105
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.640
We are a sexually dimorphic species now for all sorts of reasons.

106
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.990
Genetic developmental reasons. When the brain is getting typed in utero,

107
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.270
things can happen that alter those default values.

108
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.070
Now you come out with gender dysphoria, you shouldn't be discriminated against,

109
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.990
you should be treated with complete respect. You should be free of bigotry.

110
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.380
Agreed. That doesn't mean that there is a spectrum of possibility of

111
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:40.780
which that one is one of the default values. It simply isn't,

112
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.340
it's wrong to argue that,

113
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.180
but in the same way that feminists like to argue that there are no innate sex

114
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:51.180
differences because that they think would help alter the sexist status quo.

115
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.340
This is what's happening with trans activism.

116
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.170
That's why they are consequential when it comes to truth, screw true truth,

117
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.450
screw reality,

118
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.690
screw biological common sense in the pursuit of

119
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:06.330
freeing the world of bigotry,

120
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.970
you should be able to free the world of bigotry without constantly attacking

121
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:11.804
truth.

122
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.850
<v 1>Well, and here's the other question. If it is not,</v>

123
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.240
this is what I was getting at. If it is, if, if it's not a, a mental disorder,

124
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.600
what is, is it a physical disorder? Is it a disorder at all?

125
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.560
And if it's not a disorder, why must it be treated medically?

126
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.040
Why must there be gender reassignment surgery?

127
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.480
Why must there be exogenous hormones introduced into the body?

128
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.200
Why is all that happening?

129
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.440
<v 0>It rhetorical question or, or you're asking.</v>

130
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.150
<v 1>Me to, just to them. I mean, it's kind of rhetorical. There's no one here,</v>

131
00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:43.390
but if it's not a disorder,

132
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.590
then why are these gender reassignment physicians here? Right. If you,

133
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.550
if you don't have to have a sex change to be a woman,

134
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.470
if you're a woman with a big Dick and broad shoulders and a big, hairy chest,

135
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.910
but you're a woman, right. Well,

136
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.780
what is the need for the doctor then if you're already a woman,

137
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.100
if we decided that you're a woman,

138
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.860
so you just wanna change your appearance to outwardly match

139
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.020
how you feel inwardly. Well, exactly. It seems a disorder.

140
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.580
<v 0>There. Well, right there, I, I wonder I'm not sure. So I don't wanna misspeak,</v>

141
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:16.414
but I wonder if,

142
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.170
I think in the DSM five gender dysphoria is listed as a condition. Is that,

143
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:21.790
is that correct?

144
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.330
<v 1>It is listed as a condition, but it's not accepted by that in,</v>

145
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.170
in terms of like public perception. Right.

146
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.130
And certainly in terms of trans activists or L B G T activists

147
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.450
or anybody who talks about these things in a progressive way, that is a taboo,

148
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:36.811
right?

149
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:41.520
Like the actual medical nomenclature that's used to describe those conditions is

150
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.800
taboo. Well.

151
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.120
<v 0>There's, I don't know if you heard about this case.</v>

152
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.320
There was a physician research scientist at brown university who

153
00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:53.240
published a paper, very serious data, scientific data.

154
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.320
I think her name is Lisa li or lip. I can't remember her name. Uh,

155
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.120
it was published, I think in, uh, plus one, you know,

156
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:04.720
very serious scientific journal where she looked at the social contagion.

157
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.600
Do you know what I'm talking about? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; do you know of, uh,

158
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.720
sort of transgenderism? How, if, you know, there definitely seems to be, well,

159
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.361
well,

160
00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:16.990
literally that a social contagion effect mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; now that paper was

161
00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:20.630
published, brown had, uh, advertised it, uh,

162
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.390
it was published in a top peer review journal. Well,

163
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.030
the trans activist came after that paper and brown decided

164
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.870
to at least pull it off of its sort of promotional platform. Yeah. Uh,

165
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.140
I reached out actually to, to at think her name is Lisa to get her on the show.

166
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.860
But as you might imagine, she was a bit tepid. Yeah.

167
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:41.740
She's probably shell shocked. She's shell shocked.

168
00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:43.740
And so I'm not sure if she'll come, but again,

169
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.020
here's a serious person who probably is a, is liberal mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

170
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:47.261
she's a,

171
00:09:47.261 --> 00:09:51.100
she's a physician who deals with these issues who is simply talking about the

172
00:09:51.101 --> 00:09:55.810
fact that there's definitely a social Contagent effect that is taking place.

173
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.810
She's a not.
