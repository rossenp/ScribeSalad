00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. This is the.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.410
<v 1>Other paper I wanted to tell you about it. It does mention alien. So it's a,</v>

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.060
it's it is a recalculation of trouble for having no, no, no,

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.830
they're not classified. It says unclassified.

5
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:15.750
It just hasn't been released out of this room right now.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.390
It just recalculates how likely it is.

7
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.720
There are alien civilizations in our solar system or how likely.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.410
<v 2>So it's about the Fermi paradox. It's the Drake.</v>

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.810
<v 1>Equation. So they had done this years ago about,</v>

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.230
they tried to figure out how many planets are out there, how many are on it?

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
And habited, this is a reworking of the calculations. And again,

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.810
I can't read it. I became a general.

13
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.640
<v 2>Intelligence reference document introduction to this statistical</v>

14
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.850
Drake equation. So this is something that they,

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.320
they created for the defense department. So they could get an understanding.

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.510
<v 1>What the baseline of our information is about all those different topics I told</v>

17
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:54.900
you about.

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.250
And then this one is how likely is it that we have galactic neighbors and how

19
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.660
close might they be? Yeah.

20
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.660
<v 2>The key question. How far are they?</v>

21
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.260
<v 1>It comes to an answer it's like 30 pages into that,</v>

22
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:11.190
but you're the first person outside the program to see it. You better address.

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.370
<v 2>The sure. This is okay. Yeah. It's okay. I'm going to get visited.</v>

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.403
<v 0>There. Um.</v>

25
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.830
<v 2>Yeah. Well, how far do they think they are? I hope they, they get it for you.</v>

26
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.391
<v 1>And again,</v>

27
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.350
I'm one of the reasons I become a journalist is so I don't have to do math. So,

28
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.930
um.

29
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.300
<v 3>That's one of the cool things now that's happening is, um,</v>

30
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.690
because of the New York times article and really cause you know,

31
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.430
you had Bob on and matter of favorite,

32
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:38.120
people are talking about this and the zeitgeists, I've had more people,

33
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.950
serious people come forward to me in the last year of my life

34
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.150
than ever before. And it includes soccer moms and just people that just say,

35
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.150
I want post the documentary. Yes.

36
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.310
Ever since the Lasar documentary, you know, and,

37
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:57.500
and people found out that I kept my word to Fravor and didn't tell his story.

38
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.260
New York times told it I kept all that. You know,

39
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.290
people started to trust me with, Hey, we can keep his mouth shut.

40
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:08.030
If he needs to, people have come forward to me and drove since the Lasar movie.

41
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.210
And of course it's like soccer, moms and people that just say,

42
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.110
I don't want to be known.

43
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.350
I just want somebody to hear this because my husband would think I'm crazy.

44
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.060
Let me just tell you what happened to me and I'm out of your life.

45
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.400
What are they telling you? I mean, Joe hits,

46
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.500
'em everything you can imagine from seeing craft that are right

47
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:28.790
there, right in front of him to, you know, abduction stories,

48
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:30.800
which I don't get into. Cause it's too crazy for me.

49
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.960
But the reporting sightings encounters, all UFO stuff. That's why they call me.

50
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:39.650
They don't call me for other stuff. Right. But also very serious people,

51
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.720
people that have worked or do work within our military and say I had an

52
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:47.840
encounter, I, there was an incursion.

53
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.810
I know George has dealt with this for 30 years. It's just,

54
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:52.490
it's just new for me that the,

55
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.180
the amount of people coming forward to me and telling me their stories and

56
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.150
giving me documents and stuff like that, I gotta be careful.

57
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.580
A lot of it's gotta be. Right. But a good handful of it is powerless.

58
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.860
<v 1>A lot of it is, you know, it's um, like bait to really discriminate as credit.</v>

59
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.580
Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.100
<v 2>Do you think, is that what you think or do you think it's just crazy people.</v>

61
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.760
<v 1>That's crazy people and some of it might be more organized than that at the rate</v>

62
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:18.660
your, your show Joe sent when Bob was on there. I know what,

63
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.670
what happened to Jeremy as a result of it?

64
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.120
I get a little bit of the blow back because people are interested in the topic,

65
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:28.890
but it's amazing how much of an impact that's had to Kindle people's interest.

66
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.000
Not only in that story, but in others and the general topic, by the way,

67
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:37.260
this paper says with a 75% probability,

68
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:41.610
the nearest extra terrestrial civilization is located in between

69
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.350
1,361 and 3,979 light years from us. So there,

70
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.100
there you go. Wow. And the way they travel, that ain't. No.

71
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.880
<v 3>That's, that's lunchtime. And that's such the important part of it. Remember,</v>

72
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.580
we're talking about non reactionary, propulsion systems,

73
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.460
everybody like 10 years ago, everybody's like, okay,

74
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.150
the universe is vast is probably an intelligent life forms out in the soul,

75
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.180
in the solar systems in the universe, but they ain't coming here.

76
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.470
But then you look at what Bob said and how gravity wave amplification would.

77
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.800
And then you look at the testimony of like commander Fravor and how those craft

78
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.670
move. You see how the gimbal moves and then you start thinking, well,

79
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.900
distance doesn't matter anymore. That's just us saying physicists were right.

80
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.500
Well, hold on. Physics has changed as our understanding has changed.

81
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.360
So now we're looking at a propulsion system where distance doesn't matter,

82
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.100
man. That brings us all much closer together. If any of this is true.

83
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.620
<v 2>Yeah. If any of this is true, this, I mean,</v>

84
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:42.090
there was a lot of naysayers back in the day that were quote unquote UFO experts

85
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:45.780
had had more traditional ideas of how they traveled here. Like Stanton Friedman.

86
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.560
He had his hot potato theory that they just did it in short bursts.

87
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:53.790
Like very fast travel in short burst. So you could tolerate. But if they,

88
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.010
and he didn't believe in Bibles are two,

89
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:58.530
but I always felt like there was some weirdness there, like

90
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.370
UFO guys and researchers are so used to people being full of

91
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.690
that everyone, but them is full of. That's right.

92
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:13.470
And that's what I felt like with Stanton and Stanton would discredit Bob's, uh,

93
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.830
education pass and all these different things. I be like, yeah.

94
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:19.980
But I don't know. I don't think you know him. I don't think you talked to them.

95
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.160
I don't think you get in the room. Like if you just, just empty out,

96
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.020
empty out all your predisposed notions of who the guy is

97
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.890
and look at it. What if he's telling the truth? Like,

98
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:35.160
what if he's telling the truth, does that place actually exists areas for yes.

99
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.230
Does he have some weird knowledge of it? Yes.

100
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.710
Did he really work at Los Alamos lab? Yes.

101
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.920
Did people who work there remember him? Yes.

102
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.760
Does he know how to navigate the building from the inside? Yes.

103
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.890
Was there a article in the newspaper where he built a jet car and it said

104
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:56.610
he was a physicist at Los Alamos lab. Yes. These things are piling up.

105
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:58.100
Stanton wish you were alive.

106
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.030
I wish you were alive because he was a really smart guy who was also obsessed

107
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:03.710
with UFO's. But again,

108
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:08.160
these UFO experts all believe that everyone else is full of. I.

109
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.280
<v 1>I had a 20 year dialogue with Stan Friedman and I respect the hell out of him</v>

110
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:16.240
because he really plotted away and really plowed the ground on the topic in

111
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:17.800
general and tried to make it respectable.

112
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.570
But he had a blind spot about Bob and we had multiple face-to-face conversations

113
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.460
and exchange letters over the years.

114
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.760
<v 2>Did you ever say what if he was telling the truth? Yeah, I have said.</v>

115
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.110
<v 1>That to him and he can't get behind beyond the college degree stuff.</v>

116
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.290
That's the stopping point for him. And.

117
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.590
<v 2>Did you bring it up? Like I'm sure Bob told you the same story.</v>

118
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.610
He told me about working at Los Alamos lab and his education at.

119
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.290
<v 1>MIT. I did not tell him that story,</v>

120
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.100
but it would not have mattered because Stan didn't hear any of that stuff.

121
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.880
All the things about how does he go out and know it's going to fly on Wednesday

122
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:55.180
night and take friends out there three weeks in a row and then record it on

123
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:58.090
video. Right? It doesn't want to hear that. Why just, just didn't hear it.

124
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.450
Why not? He'd already made up his mind. That's not good. That's not scientific,

125
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.540
right?
