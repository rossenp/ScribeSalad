1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.491
<v 1>By the way, Joe,</v>

3
00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:08.510
this is an interesting thing I want to talk to mentioned to you too. Cause um,

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.480
you brought up this point where like, I like living my life.

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.780
I live a great life. Why wouldn't you want to do that again? Because,

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.520
and I don't know, I didn't sort of

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.160
challenge it a little because you were saying in retro back to.

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.850
<v 2>Helio dealio said, why would you want to do over? Because the whole.</v>

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.230
<v 1>Buddhist and Hindu thing is that I don't want to take birth again. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.160
And since we were talking about these higher planets and higher beings,

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.260
they say that that planet like earth and they said,

12
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:40.010
there's other ones like this as well.

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.200
There is some pleasure and some pain there's people who live in a penthouse

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.490
and these people are sleeping on the streets or you can be on the hundredth

15
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:52.670
whatever floor it was at the world trade center and be a CEO.

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.470
And then a plane can be wrapped, you know, two floors underneath you.

17
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.090
You can go from pleasure and pain,

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.360
the most excruciating plane and the most incredible,

19
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:07.340
highest of pleasure in a moment. So in this sort, I mean,

20
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:10.610
we've got plenty places that are like places in the world.

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.410
They're like the rape capital of the world.

22
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.750
And then you've got places that are sort of like, you know,

23
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:17.750
go to Switzerland or Norway where the currency is strong and the people are

24
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.100
beautiful. And the everything you see is like, it's from like a postcard.

25
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.150
So we have like great mounts of pain and great amounts of pleasure on this

26
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:26.984
planet

27
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.070
in such a condition, you could start to question like, why am I here?

28
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.380
What is life about? It gives you a window to even ask those questions.

29
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.320
Now, if there's just so much pleasure in your life,

30
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.660
they say that higher beings don't have the impetus to evolve

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.800
because there's so much pleasure, higher being.

32
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.650
<v 2>Higher being. So according to the Vedas, there's higher questions.</v>

33
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.160
<v 1>There's higher, higher planets. And I don't want to say Ganash,</v>

34
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.050
but there's a higher planets with higher beings who just living a high life and

35
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:06.710
therefore the impetus to get out of Samsara, you know, this word,

36
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.160
repeated birth and death. There is no impetus to get out.

37
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.290
Sometimes people are suffering so much.

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.660
There's no impetus to even see a spiritual light.

39
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.080
People are suffering tremendously, maybe go to prison or they get to,

40
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.200
they get caught up in more degraded activity.

41
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.560
Sometimes people will have so much. So I'm like saying in your life,

42
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.140
you have so much good karma, so to speak,

43
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.230
but because you're still embodied,

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.400
there'll always be sort of like a pinprick because that's part of having a body.

45
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.640
<v 3>Right. But my point was,</v>

46
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.890
this journey is enjoyable and that I, um, for you, you.

47
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
<v 1>Got good. Got good karma. Is that all it is?</v>

48
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.960
<v 3>Cause I've had bad moments. I mean, is.</v>

49
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.040
<v 1>Is it all just [inaudible].</v>

50
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.600
<v 2>It is choices. Was it Karma's like the direction.</v>

51
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.580
<v 3>Did you choose to push forward in the understanding of push and pull the</v>

52
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.630
understanding of the discipline and the work and then the kindness and the

53
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.690
generosity and that all these things are connected together.

54
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.220
And then also the expression,

55
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.210
the ability to express yourself through podcasts or through stand up comedy,

56
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.940
but all these things are enjoyable and that there's a pursuit in that.

57
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.200
And that the real benefit of it is that other people get entertainment out of

58
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.030
it. And that.

59
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.330
<v 2>No, this is your choice. Your choice is perpetuated obviously,</v>

60
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.680
but there's other people who've done.

61
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.940
<v 1>Podcasts. Who've done comedy and they're just not successful at it.</v>

62
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.000
<v 3>Yeah. But it's a puzzle though. It's like,</v>

63
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.150
it's like saying other people sing songs, but people don't play them back.

64
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.990
There were bands before green day, like the Buzzcocks from the seventies who.

65
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.270
<v 1>Who my opinion was better than green day,</v>

66
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.850
but they just weren't at the right time historically or.

67
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.090
<v 2>Right. Publicists. Yeah. Look, there's always.</v>

68
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.540
<v 3>Going to be that. But my point is like, you don't have to be famous to be happy.</v>

69
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.650
It's just, life is interesting. Life is enjoyable.

70
00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:57.540
Sometimes it's hard and sometimes it's painful.

71
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:02.310
Sometimes it's emotionally devastating for sure. But the idea,

72
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.270
if you are alive and enjoying life,

73
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.510
the idea of doing it forever is terrifying to people.

74
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.220
That was what my point was like,

75
00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:13.890
why is it terrifying if it's not terrifying to do it now?

76
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.130
Why is the eternal existence so disturbing?

77
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.573
Right.

78
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.430
<v 1>Unless they have had a traumatic life.</v>

79
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.110
<v 2>Yeah. A lot of people have, yes. A lot of people. Yes. A lot of people have.</v>

80
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.560
I don't know. My.

81
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.650
<v 1>Life was so traumatic. I think I got some, let's leave them out that.</v>

82
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.251
<v 3>Equation.</v>

83
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:35.550
And let's just talk about people who have not had a traumatic life who have a

84
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.440
fair look if you're in America and you're not sick and you have

85
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:44.250
friends you're doing infinitely better than most people on planet. Sure.

86
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.383
You know, that's just,

87
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.160
we're really fortunate in terms of like the environments that we exist in.

88
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.390
If you're not being abused and you have a job and you have, uh,

89
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.540
hobbies and things to do, God, are you lucky?

90
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.200
You could be born in Afghanistan. You could be living in the Congo,

91
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:06.150
suffering from a host of different pathogens and bacteria and viruses.

92
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:06.984
And so.

93
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.340
<v 1>But your thing is, according to that person, was it Helio made up that? Well,</v>

94
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:11.970
I don't think he made.

95
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.740
<v 3>It up. I think Helio obviously was a great warrior as well as a great</v>

96
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.971
jujitsu teacher,

97
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:22.920
but he had this philosophy on existence and that you

98
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:27.150
had to live your life and do the right things always.

99
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.880
And if you didn't, you would come back again and do it all over again.

100
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.480
<v 1>Well, the Vedic system is, is similar, but it's not the exact,</v>

101
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.750
you don't get born as Joe Rogan, again, living in a parallel life and like, oh,

102
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:37.980
I didn't take out the garbage that day.

103
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:40.290
I should have taken out the garbage it more be like,

104
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.000
according to your desires and your activities and your thoughts and the people

105
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.570
you associate with you moved up, um,

106
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.270
psychically, you got a little more degraded. W w you know,

107
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.280
either upgrade or degrade, basically it was SIM.

108
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 3>Similar. Do think of yourself like that. Do you think,</v>

109
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.820
like when you think of yourself and you're,

110
00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:04.370
you're fortunate in the interesting life you've carved out,

111
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.020
do you feel like your past life has had some sort of an impact on who you are

112
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:09.730
right now?

113
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.860
<v 4>For sure. For sure. For sure. Really? Why are you so sure.</v>

114
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.150
<v 1>Um, well, it's just sort of like my, uh,</v>

115
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.290
worldview is that there's not a randomness,

116
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.850
that everything is building upon something in the same way I'm building upon

117
00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:25.391
tomorrow,

118
00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:30.220
today building on next week by Y act this week.

119
00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:33.610
And it could take a bigger and bigger and bigger. So that, in that sense,

120
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:37.150
it makes sense. But there's a, there is a little bit more of a leap of faith.

121
00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:37.984
Like,

122
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.160
and I'm building up to a climax where we'll take another body,

123
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.090
or I'm coming from a place where I have some talents. You know,

124
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:49.420
we call them your God given gifts or your, my, my, you know,

125
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:52.060
my daughter is a gifted art are artists,

126
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.070
but the idea is that it's been a practice that we've been practicing and

127
00:06:57.071 --> 00:06:59.320
bringing with us for lifetimes,

128
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.040
and both are both good and bad. And this is.

129
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.040
<v 3>A belief system that you just sort of adopt because there's not really any</v>

130
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:06.874
evidence.

131
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.910
<v 1>It it's, it's not that I've adopted it. It's, it's, that's the,</v>

132
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.480
that's how the yogis view. Right. Karma and yeah. And.

133
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.730
<v 3>I understand, but you taking this in yourself.</v>

134
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.050
<v 1>Take it myself because I see it in this lifetime. Now, like I said,</v>

135
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.210
that, I don't know, there's, there's blind faith,

136
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:29.140
and then there's reasonable faith. So my reasonable faith wise in this lifetime,

137
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.570
I've witnessed my body change.

138
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.780
I witnessed my mind changed my intelligence change.

139
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.000
I've witnessed myself cultivate desires that heal me, make me stronger,

140
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.800
make me lighter, make me more connected.

141
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.820
I've witnessed myself choose bad choices, things that are addictive,

142
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.690
things that are, um, defiling my consciousness or my body or my health.

143
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.860
So in this life the time I know I ha I can steer my karma.

144
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.470
And at the same time, there's certain things that are out of my hands.

145
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.430
Like you and me are on a flight to San Diego. Um,

146
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.230
and the planes going to San Diego. What I, what we do on that plane,

147
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.210
the plane journey is our karma. What we do on that plane, that's our freewill.

148
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.110
So that's the difference between free will and destiny. There is,

149
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.750
there is a difference of the two,

150
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.970
just because there is karma doesn't mean you're bound to it. You can move it.

151
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.880
But the yoga system is to bring us to this.

152
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.770
I'm trying to think, keep it simple through this. It's called sativa,

153
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.400
or it's a state of self control, a peace balance.

154
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.140
So all the things of the whole culture is based to keep the mind peaceful.

155
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.060
And from when the mind is peaceful,

156
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:44.680
I act less on impetus and more from a higher chuckers or higher

157
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:48.460
thoughts or higher intelligence. Um, for example,

158
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:53.170
if I slap a Panther, Panther is going to bite me. Why? Because Panther's bite.

159
00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:58.110
When you slap him. If I slap Joe, you could act from a different place,

160
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.570
Hey man, what's up. Or you can be like immediately.

161
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.200
And sometimes I feel that also, I feel like I'm acting from a lower place.

162
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:07.830
I'm angry. I'm going to kick back. Right. Right. And sometimes I feel like,

163
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.330
I mean, do this with parenting. Sometimes I get angry at my child. I said,

164
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.010
don't you understand? He's just trying to talk to you.

165
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.050
He's just trying to share how he experiences.

166
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.090
And I have to pull myself back and let go of any way I was parented and try to

167
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:24.660
like, um, act from a higher place. So there's always an,

168
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.070
they say in the human species,

169
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.910
there's always this chance to either upgrade your activities or degrade your

170
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:33.360
activities. And they, and they, and they snowball off of each other,

171
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.180
like every good choice helps you make a better choice. You know, we,

172
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:41.730
we said that with diet, with exercise, um, how do we get,

173
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:42.564
talk about that, Joe?

174
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.730
Is this we're talking about just massive detours that we're taking? No, no, no.

175
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:47.000
It's.

176
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.020
<v 3>We're getting to places.</v>

177
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.640
We were talking about your belief that your karma is

178
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.950
connected to what you've done in the past life.

179
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.210
<v 1>Sure. So that's a, that's a bigger leap of faith. And you say,</v>

180
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.230
I see it in this life.

181
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.320
<v 3>You see it in other people as well. So when you see people,</v>

182
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:07.910
you look at their life and you think this person where they are right now

183
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.580
is directly connected to what they've done in the past life.

184
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.450
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

185
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.600
<v 5>It's an interesting philosophy. It's an interesting thing.</v>

186
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.870
<v 1>Interesting lens. And you know, it's an honor, you know, what's nice about it.</v>

187
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.400
Even in Western psychiatry,

188
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.330
if I go and complain about my husband or my wife,

189
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.830
a good psychiatrist will go, well, what's your responsibility in this?

190
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.070
Is it all your wife? Or is it you, they take you back.

191
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.770
And when you really study this Vedic thought,

192
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.570
you realize that there is no more blaming anybody. Yeah.

193
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.950
I've just got what I've got for whatever reason now,

194
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:49.520
what am I going to do with that? What am I going to do today? It's also,

195
00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:51.520
what am I going to do tomorrow? Why the,

196
00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:56.510
why me never happens because I've got what I got.

197
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.630
I probably did something and people don't like to hear that,

198
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.250
but we don't know our backstory. And

199
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.620
to be truthful, I have a blind side,

200
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.360
a blind spot when it comes to anything atrocious I've done in this life.

201
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.020
I forget all the times I've hurt. People, broke people's parts. You know,

202
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.970
it was rude or cruel or a thought was. So I got to get some karma too,

203
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.710
in this life, what to speak of a previous life, where I'm oblivious to. Right?

204
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.590
And if I just want to blame the circumstance,

205
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.050
here's your option. You can either be free from that.

206
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.760
Be acceptance and accept that there's benevolent forces that are trying to teach

207
00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:46.460
us lessons to get out of the birth and death.

208
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.420
Or you can just be bitter at the world. Why me unfair. So this idea.

209
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.770
<v 3>Of benevolent forces that are trying teach us,</v>

210
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.210
do you feel that this spiritual quest

211
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.260
is almost like a divine puzzle,

212
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.580
that human beings are proposed and that you're,

213
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.900
you are given this infinite series of options.

214
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.460
And in choosing the right way of thinking and behaving,

215
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.680
you can carve out the righteous path as best you can, you will make mistakes,

216
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:21.850
but that there's,

217
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.770
there's a spiritual undertaking that is a part of

218
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.380
operating this puzzle correctly.

219
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.060
And that this is what all these teachings are about. And that's trying to,

220
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:37.770
we're all trying to relay what we've learned and what,

221
00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:39.610
what we've experienced personally.

222
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.340
And we're trying to relay it to other people so that they can relate.

223
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.260
And so that they can also make choices that will allow them to more

224
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.670
refined their approach to life, to achieve better spiritual balance.

225
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.303
Yeah.

226
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.140
<v 1>It's well said. I th th there's there's, you know,</v>

227
00:12:58.141 --> 00:13:01.500
the yogis called me yamas and niyamas sorta like, say it again,

228
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.180
yamas and niyamas diplomas, yamas, yamas,

229
00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:09.270
and niyamas things you do and things you don't do. Okay.

230
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.040
And it's the equivalent of like a sort of guardrails on a road,

231
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.940
right? You drive a little bit off too far, you scratch your car, right.

232
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:21.210
There's the guard rail. But if it wasn't there it'd be complete tragedy.

233
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.370
So there's sort of like things that we pull in, um, with our, uh, sexuality,

234
00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:28.670
with our thoughts, with our words, it's,

235
00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:32.160
it's how to use the vehicle in this lifetime.

236
00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:36.450
So the vehicle being the body, right. What we do, what we don't do, what we,

237
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:40.950
don't, what we do, you know, what to eat, what to, what to think, what to speak,

238
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.520
how to speak, how to relate to people, how to relate to juniors,

239
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:48.600
how to relate to seniors. So the whole beta culture is carved out like this,

240
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.640
that in itself is not spiritual. It just assists you in driving a car.

241
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.720
I still got to go north. And so once I can take care of how to like,

242
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.300
take care of this machine and keep it on the road,

243
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.020
then I've reached out for connection. Yeah. And that's the spiritual,

244
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:04.890
so there's Dharma,

245
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.210
but then there's Dharma that that's supposed to get us connected with genuine.

246
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.620
<v 3>Yoga to Dharma. What is that? The definition rather of Dharma again, I mean.</v>

247
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.720
<v 1>Sort of like a rent right? Living.</v>

248
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.800
It's not some people confuse it with while doing what you're born to do,

249
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:22.350
because I don't think it's just doing what you're good at,

250
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.720
because you could be good at leadership and be a dictator. And, and, and,

251
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.600
and, and, and you're.

252
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.230
<v 2>A great leader. Everyone's going to do what you do,</v>

253
00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:32.970
but Hitler was a great leader, great leader.

254
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.760
<v 1>Great leader is probably going to chart, but then you also have great,</v>

255
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.650
great leaders, like a Christ who was like a great leader. Right. Also.

256
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.150
So it's not just leadership,

257
00:14:42.151 --> 00:14:47.120
it's leading person towards connection so that your activity has a

258
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.290
benevolent effect on everyone in touches. That's Dharma, that's,

259
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.050
that's Dharma and its true sense. And that's the Dharma of your body.

260
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:58.880
Like your Dharma is you entertain. Um, you're you could say a warrior.

261
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.330
You could all say you have also Dom as a father. So that's it.

262
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.020
Those are all type of like, you're carved out for that. You know,

263
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.860
if you weren't doing that, you'd always feel like a little lack in your life,

264
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.750
but then there's like a nitty Dharma or what you and the nitty Dharma is

265
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:18.710
actually the Dharma of the soul. And that's why in the Vedic system,

266
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:23.030
it's not like you're trying to convert somebody to be

267
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.050
of your religion. It's not like a home run to say, okay,

268
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.970
I got a Christian to become a Hindu. That's not what it is.

269
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.830
The idea is that everybody's a spirit soul. You can change.

270
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.710
It's not about joining the same church or the same.

271
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.930
Uh Ostrom it's like a soul is a soul. It's a truth. Truth is truth. There's no,

272
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.300
no, no. One's got a monopoly on truth.

273
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.580
There's no such thing as a it's like math,

274
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.480
it's that Jewish math or Hindu math or Christian it's like math is math, right?

275
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.630
So we want to apply truth to the life, to the vehicle.

276
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.000
And that's going to give direction to the vehicle.

277
00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:57.530
That's going to be the food for the soul.

278
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.560
And that's what the genuine meaning of yoga people say,

279
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:01.490
it's a balanced the mind.

280
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.010
It's not the ballot it's to connect the atmo or the soul with divinity to,

281
00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:08.330
but with Bhagavan that's the real yoga.

282
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.990
And that's when the yoga means to come together. But in the original text,

283
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.440
in the original ancient teachings of UConn, Rashad's Bhagavad, Gita,

284
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.980
it's all about is here. I am lost in this crazy plan.

285
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:23.720
I'm driving my car everywhere, how to keep it on the road and where do I go?

286
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.580
And that's, that's, that's the classical concept of what yoga is.

287
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.440
<v 3>How do we keep it on the road? And where do I go?</v>

288
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.880
I liked that way of looking at it.
