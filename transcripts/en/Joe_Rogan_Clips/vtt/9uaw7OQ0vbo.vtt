00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. We watched contact.</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.520
<v 1>Again. Now I haven't seen contact in forever. And, uh, first of all,</v>

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.760
God what a good movie that was movie.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.560
That's a good movie and a great movie about

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.520
aliens. Like,

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
like a movie that it gives you a different

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:25.020
perspective on the possibilities of contact. And,

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.750
and just the fact that it was a Carl Sagan book,

9
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.580
and there's just so much good to it. That character that you played was,

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.920
uh, as a fascinating guy.

11
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.570
And I kind of feel like there's some of you in that guy. Sure.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.490
I mean, you are, you are, am I wrong here?

13
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.450
You are religious in some way. Yeah.

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.030
<v 2>Absolutely. And I wanna,</v>

15
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.090
I want to bring this up in this day and age when people go, no,

16
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:54.740
I'm not religious. I'm only spiritual.

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.670
You know what the Latin root of religion is

18
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.480
[inaudible] and [inaudible] means to bind together. Re means again,

19
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.380
well, in a world they're saying I'm only spiritual because I want unity.

20
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.150
That's exactly what religion means.

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.130
We bastardized the meaning of it over time and we've excluded people and

22
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.560
we've corporatized it as such. But yes, I am religious.

23
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.690
I'm that character, you know, I had written stories,

24
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:26.120
I'd written a college paper called John Wayne goes west,

25
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.910
and it was about how do you, how do,

26
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.310
how can you be a believer in a world of science?

27
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.400
And I remember writing things like during the making of that movie,

28
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:38.900
like science is the practical pursuit of God. Um,

29
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.340
the two are not exclusive. Uh, th th they, they, they danced together. They're,

30
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.090
they're, they, they go together, um, belief in science,

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.380
and I never saw those as contradictions. And that's part of what,

32
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:55.160
the reason I attacked that role and became a part of that, that movie.

33
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:59.870
I wanted to play a person that had that point of view of a believer in a world

34
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:00.704
of science,

35
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.180
not at the exclusion of science and not the exclusion of belief.

36
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.300
<v 1>Yeah. It's a confusing role for a lot of people.</v>

37
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.770
If someone is a believer and also a proponent of science,

38
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.720
um, because they want to know what are your literal beliefs like?

39
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.800
D are you taking the Bible at its literal word,

40
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.120
or do you use it as some sort of a guide book of the

41
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:30.590
experiences of these people that lived thousands of years ago that have been

42
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:33.680
translated from multiple different languages back to English?

43
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.740
And is there wisdom in those translations?

44
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:38.570
Is there wisdom in those original thoughts,

45
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.790
these thousands of years of people contemplating and,

46
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.200
and mulling on these things and that so many have used these

47
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.120
as a scaffolding for morals and ethics and for

48
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:54.980
societies. Yeah.

49
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.640
<v 2>It's, it's it's I mean, you know, for people that go, oh, it's,</v>

50
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.200
it's, it's, it's, uh,

51
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.860
it's a circus book or people that are non-believers and I'm like, well,

52
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.830
it's still the best one going. Um, there's a lot of great truths that,

53
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.190
that, that, that come out of the Bible and it is open for a lot of people.

54
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.160
It has been interpreted and reinterpreted, it has been translated,

55
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.340
has been handed down. Um, I, for myself,

56
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.620
I don't know what to do in my daily life with the burning Bush.

57
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.780
I don't know what to do with that. Um,

58
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.730
I do know what to do with love your neighbor like yourself.

59
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.190
I do know what to do with Matthew 6 22.

60
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:39.040
If they IB single that whole body will be full of light.

61
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.030
I do know what to do with some Proverbs that I can take into daily practice and

62
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:47.710
go, oh, I felt my life. I felt improvement.

63
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.000
I felt success in my relationships and my relationship with the day with my

64
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.400
career, by following that, um,

65
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.550
by treating others how I wanted to be treated the golden rule. So I,

66
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:00.030
I take the practical stuff myself, um,

67
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:03.040
and try to try to utilize it and then pick out what can work for me.

68
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.690
<v 1>When you say you don't know what to do with the burning Bush, like,</v>

69
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.270
what do you mean by that? I.

70
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.140
<v 2>Don't know what to do on a daily basis with the teaching of, um, and,</v>

71
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.990
and then he, you know, and then he here, he showed up as a,

72
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.920
as a burning Bush or the magic tricks. And I don't know what to do with,

73
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.220
and Jesus healed everyone that,

74
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.390
and then he couldn't walk and now he does it when he can walk.

75
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.200
I don't know what to do with that. I don't,

76
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.270
I don't know how to take that into my life and go, oh,

77
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:33.000
there's something useful and practical and healthy for you, Matthew,

78
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.840
that you can practice there. So the magic, um,

79
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.110
that leans in towards, you know, what we would call now more fantasy.

80
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:43.050
I don't know what to do with that. I there's, there's philosophies,

81
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.130
there's Proverbs and there's teachings that I think are very valid and very

82
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:48.300
helpful, um,

83
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:51.120
that we could all be reminded of that are in the Bible that I do find quite

84
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:51.954
useful.

85
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.330
<v 1>Yeah. I think it's almost impossible to figure out what they were trying to</v>

86
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:01.290
say with a lot of the things. It's why it's, so it's open to interpretation,

87
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.750
but also open to manipulation.

88
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:08.040
And that's where people have a real problem with it when it's used for, to,

89
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.670
to separate people, to exclude people,

90
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:16.030
to marginalize people, to judge people. But it's,

91
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.930
it's hard for people that understand that,

92
00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:22.890
those aspects and that those things happen to actually parse out that there's

93
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:24.390
good about it too.

94
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.520
And that there's a lot of really valuable lessons in these books.

95
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.360
<v 2>A hundred percent. Um, I, I get it. I mean, you, you know,</v>

96
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.550
it's like, uh, what are our, what are our fathers teachers?

97
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:40.230
So your father shall live.

98
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.000
<v 1>Hmm. Well, I don't really know him. I've have complicated family history.</v>

99
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.210
<v 2>Okay. Well fathers or father figures.</v>

100
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.290
<v 1>Father, he's still alive and I'm close to him. Well.</v>

101
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.730
<v 2>That brother, and when he goes,</v>

102
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:57.980
you'll find that some things where the messenger and the message weren't born in

103
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:58.850
simpatico,

104
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.630
you know what I mean is that if you throw the messenger app and you're like, oh,

105
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.060
you weren't following all that stuff. No,

106
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.060
you take the message that this is the stuff that you can, that,

107
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.580
that could work for you, that maybe they wanted it for you.

108
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:12.290
They couldn't follow through on it themselves.

109
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.110
There's certain parts of the Bible that had that too.

110
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.220
You don't throw out the whole, you can't,

111
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.830
I don't think it makes any sense to throw out the whole book.

112
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.220
It's what we're doing in society now. I mean, we're, we're, we're, we're,

113
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.850
we're making people persona non grata, uh,

114
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.800
because of something they do or, you know, and, and that is,

115
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.140
that is right now deemed wrong. Uh,

116
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.420
or it's the hot point and a hot topic right now.

117
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.430
You can't erase someone's entire existence where the heck does some

118
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:42.950
forgiveness go. And again, that like optimism,

119
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.630
it's not erasing the crisis. It's not saying there wasn't a problem. First.

120
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:51.020
It's not saying that there's verge parts of the Bible that had been people have

121
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.410
bastardized and used in the wrong way. Um,

122
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.100
but you don't throw the whole book out and say, well, it's all, it's all bad.

123
00:06:58.101 --> 00:06:59.990
Then it's all of these because it's false.

124
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.740
<v 1>D have you encountered difficulty expressing</v>

125
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:08.290
this? Uh, in Hollywood,

126
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.970
Hollywood is a predominantly left wing and very

127
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:16.840
secular or Jewish in some circles,

128
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:21.070
but it's not like a place where Christian fundamental

129
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:24.520
values are espoused openly. You know, a lot,

130
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:26.140
a lot of Jewish folks are in Hollywood.

131
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:28.600
And that seems to be okay with a lot of people,

132
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:31.330
but some other religions,

133
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.420
particularly if you're a fundamentalist Christian,

134
00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:38.720
or if you have Christian values, a lot of people frown upon that. Why, why,

135
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.710
why do you think that is? And have you, have you had difficulties with that?

136
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.140
<v 2>I don't know. I haven't had difficulties. I have had,</v>

137
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.760
and I won't throw any people under the bus, but I have had, um,

138
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.870
moments where I was on stage receiving an award in front of my peers in

139
00:07:58.871 --> 00:07:59.704
Hollywood.

140
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.890
And there were people in the crowd that I have prayed with before dinners,

141
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.800
many times. And when I think God,

142
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.030
I saw some of those people go to clap, but then notice that

143
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.100
bad thing on my resume and then sit back on their hands.

144
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:19.863
<v 1>Oh, wow.</v>

145
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.550
<v 2>And I've seen people read the room and go, whoa,</v>

146
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:27.700
that wouldn't bode well for me in the future,

147
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.880
if forgetting a job or you're getting votes or what have

148
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:37.900
you. Um, I have seen that I've witnessed that. Um, I don't,

149
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:41.530
I don't judge him for it. I just wish, you know, th th that,

150
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.000
it seems like a silly argument that there's a,

151
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.830
you know, one of the things that are, are, are people,

152
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.210
some people in our industry, not all this,

153
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.850
there's some that go to the left so far as,

154
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.690
uh, our friend Jordan Peterson, who back. Um,

155
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.610
so I was video being back that go to the air liberal left side

156
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:10.470
so far, that is so condescending and patronizing to

157
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.780
50% of the world that need the empathy

158
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.240
that the liberal side gives and should give, um, to,

159
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:25.860
to, to, to throw somebody illegitimized them,

160
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:28.110
because they say they are believer

161
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.460
is just so arrogant. Uh, and in some ways hypocritical to me.

162
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.840
Um, yeah, so I haven't run into, you know,

163
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.230
I haven't had budded trouble on that, but I've always looked my, my career.

164
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:44.550
I've pretty much gone my own,

165
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.750
my own path and by hook or by crook,

166
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.010
trying to figure out a way out and to, into what I was doing. And I haven't,

167
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.090
I haven't measured or noticed where it has harmed or gotten in my way of what I

168
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.340
wanted to achieve in, in Hollywood.

169
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.180
