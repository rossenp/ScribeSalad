00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you think that you could do Tropic thunder today?</v>

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:05.834
Would that be possible?

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.760
<v 1>Oh, you could do it. &lt;laugh&gt; And again,</v>

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.720
like Eddie, you know,

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.840
I look back to me that movie to me was a circle back to my

6
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.870
dad's movie called Putney school Oak, which I highly recommend, uh,

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
anyone who hasn't seen to see about a black guy who takes over an ad agency in

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:31.790
the sixties, cuz everyone votes for him. Uh, when the, uh,

9
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.470
head of the company dies because they think no one else will.

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.710
And it's about what happens when someone who is free spirited takes over and

11
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:41.500
essentially corrupt endeavor.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.260
And then he realizes and confronts his own corruption. But, um,

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.700
I remember I was probably two or three when that was being shot and when it came

14
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:55.460
out and it was so a part of my upbringing and I just remembered some of the,

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.380
the folks that were around my dad at that time.

16
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.330
And so when Ben called and said, Hey, I'm doing this. And you know,

17
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.170
I think maybe Sean Penn had passed on it or something like that.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.090
&lt;laugh&gt; possibly wisely. And um, I thought, yeah, I'll do that.

19
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:12.290
And I'll do that after Ironman. And then I started thinking,

20
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:16.010
this is a terrible idea. &lt;laugh&gt; we wait a minute? And then I thought, well,

21
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:18.930
hold on, dude, get real here. Where is your heart?

22
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.520
And my heart is a, I get to,

23
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.080
I get to be black for a summer in my mind.

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.880
&lt;laugh&gt; so there's something in it for me. &lt;laugh&gt;

25
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.920
The other thing is I get to hold up to nature,

26
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.960
the insane self-involved hypocrisy of artists and

27
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.230
what they think they're allowed to do on occasion. Just my opinion.

28
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.270
And also Ben, who is a masterful artist and director,

29
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.390
probably the closest thing to a Charlie chaplain that I've experienced in my

30
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.670
lifetime. He writes, he directs, he acts, he, if you had seen him,

31
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:01.950
when he was directing this movie, you would've been like,

32
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.780
I'm watching David lean, I'm watching chaplain, I'm watching cop. He,

33
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.940
he knew exactly what the vision for this was. He executed it,

34
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.180
it was impossible to not have it be an offensive nightmare of a movie &lt;laugh&gt;

35
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.060
and 90% of my black friends are like, dude, that was great. &lt;laugh&gt;.

36
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.650
<v 0>What about at the other 10%?</v>

37
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.170
<v 1>Um, you know, I, I can't disagree with them,</v>

38
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.810
but I know where my heart was. Yeah.

39
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.850
And I think that it's never an excuse to do something that is out

40
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:40.690
of place and not of its time. But to me it was just putting a,

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.840
it was a blasting cap on and by the way,

42
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.720
I think white chicks came out pretty soon after that. Yeah. And I was like,

43
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.400
I love that. Yeah. I was like, that was great. Yeah. So.

44
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.320
<v 0>You know, well, it might be the last time we see that,</v>

45
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.680
unless things change, it seems like no one can really,

46
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.760
I don't think you could do blackface anymore. I mean,

47
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.440
we almost lost the prime minister at Canada cuz he did brown face.

48
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.480
He pretended to be Saudi Arabian, right? Yeah.

49
00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:10.760
He did Arabian nights in high school or something like that.

50
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.910
<v 1>It's uh,</v>

51
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.760
it's an interesting and necessary meditation on where

52
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.710
is the pendulum &lt;affirmative&gt; why is the pendulum, right? Yeah.

53
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.550
Where is the pendulum? Uh,

54
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:28.430
maybe cutting a little into what could be perceived as,

55
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.310
as heart in the right place. Openness of its time. But again,

56
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.590
I mean, you know, there's a morality clause here on,

57
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.700
on this planet and it's a big price to pay.

58
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:45.140
And I think having a moral psychology is, uh, is job one.

59
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.500
So sometimes you just gotta go. Yeah. You know,

60
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.700
I F up again, not in my defense,

61
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.460
but Tropic thunder was about

62
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.130
how wrong that is. Yes. So

63
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.170
I take exception.

64
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.370
<v 0>No it's I think you could do it today.</v>

65
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.490
I think you could. I think it could be done today.

66
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:15.010
There would be so much outrage, but there would also be people cheering.

67
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.370
And if you, if we got,

68
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.800
we boiled down all the and got to the actual result of what the film did,

69
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.760
it's hilarious to this. I watched it again about a year and a half ago.

70
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.560
It's a great movie. It's a great fun movie. I mean it's,

71
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.160
it's ridiculous. Over the top. Hilarious.

72
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.240
And it worked and, and your portrayal. I mean it wasn't, it wasn't egregious.

73
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.750
It wasn't, it was, it was ne it made sense.

74
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.510
All of it fit it all there's square pegs and square holes.

75
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.030
<v 1>I was just thinking square peg. I don't know why I was thinking, oh,</v>

76
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:50.070
I was thinking about Sarah Jessica Parker on the ride over here.

77
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.030
&lt;laugh&gt; isn't that crazy? I think I drove by that Warner park near here. Uh,

78
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:55.750
yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.870
I think she went to school over there when she was doing a show anyway.

80
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.703
Interesting. Yeah.

81
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.300
<v 0>It, it worked and, but it was,</v>

82
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.820
it might be the last time we'll ever see a studio,

83
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.020
take a chance on a guy wearing black face and the,

84
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.180
the prolific use of the word retard. Those are two.

85
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.220
<v 1>Things. And by the way, that's a Ben, the funny thing too,</v>

86
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.930
was all the heat got deflected to Ben and simple Jack. Yeah.

87
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.490
That's what people were off about. And I go, woo. &lt;laugh&gt;.

88
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.813
<v 0>Great.</v>

89
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.290
<v 1>But you never know when it's gonna be your time in the barrel. You know,</v>

90
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:33.730
sometimes, sometimes life just says, you know what? And,

91
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.610
and I've been on both sides at that coin. Sometimes life just says,

92
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.250
you're a symbol. Now, did.

93
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.370
<v 0>You have anybody that was telling you not to do it?</v>

94
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:43.760
Were there a bunch agents or anyone who was like, my mother.

95
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.440
<v 1>Was horrified. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

96
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.360
Really Bobby. I am telling you,

97
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.600
I have a bad feeling about this &lt;laugh&gt; I was like, yeah, me too, mom.

98
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.200
&lt;laugh&gt;. But, uh, anyway, how are we.

99
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.920
<v 0>First handset? When I putting the makeup on you? How, how hard are you sweating?</v>

100
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.000
<v 1>There's been a couple times.</v>

101
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.960
I was all the night before and we were on Kauai

102
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.360
and I was like, well, here we go. And I was just running.

103
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.270
I think I had six that day,

104
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.510
but I knew that there was gonna be choppers. There was gonna be, uh,

105
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.750
squib fire. There was gonna be choreography. There was gonna be, you know,

106
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.470
it was gonna be coffins.

107
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.950
And the only thing that mattered to me again, what's my action. My action,

108
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:35.830
as an actor in this movie is to know what I'm doing,

109
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.620
even if what I'm doing is insane.

110
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.820
So I ran those six or eight lines.

111
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.820
I had a thousand times lying in bed over and over and over

112
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:48.740
and over and over and over and over and over again.

113
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:53.500
So the next day I was free to enjoy myself

114
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.770
and not be struggling to wonder what it was. I was supposed to be the doing.

115
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.570
And then that's what it is. It was just, you know,

116
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.370
it was one little mosaic after the next and,

117
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.370
and by the end of it, I had some, um,

118
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.490
pride that AI had made it through, forget that it was, you know, black face.

119
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:15.850
It was special effects makeup day after day after day after day after day after

120
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.970
day after day, except for the off times when,

121
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.720
and I would have my bleached hair and blue contacts in my eyes, or, you know,

122
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.280
other characters and it was just a, uh, it was a piece of work I was doing

123
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.520
and I cared about doing it as professionally and as honestly as I could.

124
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.760
<v 0>So when you memorized lines,</v>

125
00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:40.710
that's an interesting thing that you said that you were free to, to do it.

126
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.870
Like when you memorize lines, is there ever a part,

127
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.630
like when you're acting where you have to think like, okay,

128
00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:53.230
what am I supposed to say next? And how much does that get in the way there's.

129
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.110
<v 1>I look, I have a very broad band of, uh, of tolerances.</v>

130
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.220
I don't care if the people I'm with happen to not know what they're doing,

131
00:08:02.221 --> 00:08:05.900
or don't know their lines or stepping on my lines or, or whatever,

132
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.860
or want to change their lines and my lines. And it's always a different,

133
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.580
uh, thing. It's like reading the room. It's like, you know, if I was a fighter,

134
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:17.460
you go into the octagon and they go, you ready? You ready? And you go,

135
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.290
and then you just do it. You go in.

136
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.130
But so I've had it where I would try to be off book before everyone else

137
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.330
I would get it down to an acronym.

138
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.050
So if there was a thousand words I had to remember,

139
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.450
I would just remember the first letter of each and I would put it on a piece of

140
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:39.010
poster board, and then I would stand away from it. Not as far as you and your,

141
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.840
your, uh, archery, he set up over there,

142
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.600
but far enough away to where I can see it,

143
00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:46.880
but kind of can't see it back when my vision was a little more clear and I would

144
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:50.400
just run it and run it and run it. Um, when I did the first Sherlock,

145
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.800
we were rewriting it so much and I would have pages and pages of stuff.

146
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.560
I was like, give me a ear wig. And it helped me with my accent.

147
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.040
And then I started getting into like, you know, what's so great.

148
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.120
I can finish work, go home,

149
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.160
hang out with my kids or do whatever I wanna do go train.

150
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.960
And in the morning they can change it all they want.

151
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.960
I don't have to trip if at all, if, you know,

152
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.160
unless it's some monologue that you want to really be committed to,

153
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.830
that's not going to shift. I'd just go like.

154
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.150
<v 0>That. So you'd put one of those little ear pieces in and they would feed you the</v>

155
00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:19.980
lines. Yeah.

156
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.270
<v 1>Yeah. And now I've kind of gone as far as you can go with that.</v>

157
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.390
And I'll probably go back to a new method or a new version of the old method.

158
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.950
<v 0>So it's basically improvisational like you in, in the moment, like you,</v>

159
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.870
you decide with whatever preparation you're gonna do for each role,

160
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.221
how you gonna do it,

161
00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:40.500
whether you're gonna go and memorize everything obsessively or whether you're

162
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:42.780
just gonna be a little bit more loose and free with it. Yes.

163
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.820
<v 1>It depends on the script too. Like Tropic thunder.</v>

164
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:49.420
Justin Thoreau wrote that script with, uh, with Ben really good script.

165
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.700
I mean, my misses who next to my mother, you know,

166
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.290
probably more so is the opinion I was really waiting on.

167
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.370
And she was reading in the kitchen, laughing her off. She goes,

168
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:03.850
this is so wrong. &lt;laugh&gt; this is so wrong. And she goes,

169
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.090
and it's so true. Oh, if you do this right,

170
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.650
you're, you're doing something that's,

171
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.080
it's about a bunch of self-involved idiots, somehow other becoming heroes.

172
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.720
And she goes, I love that. If that's what it stays, then it's gonna be good.

173
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:25.600
And so like, for instance, the, uh, you know, never go yeah. Uh, full blah,

174
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.040
blah. Don't you wanna say it? &lt;laugh&gt; no, by the way,

175
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.080
I guarantee you I'm getting outta here. My stock is not plummeting.

176
00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:34.440
When I leave here, I'm not smoking dope. I'm not doing a Musk.

177
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.480
I'm gonna do everything. Right. His stock went up the next.

178
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.830
<v 0>Day. All right. Drop six, went up nine with who? &lt;laugh&gt;. I don't know.</v>

179
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.230
I don't understand it. I love that. You.

180
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.150
<v 1>Now have it. Now it's a piece.</v>

181
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.510
<v 0>Of art. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; with 6% in the smoke.</v>

182
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.910
&lt;laugh&gt; God bless his.

183
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.590
<v 1>Heart. Yeah. It just changes.</v>
