<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Totally. Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.400
another crazy thing about you that people might not know is that you're a

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.313
comedian.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.400
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.920
<v 0>That's right. You're a standup comedian. Yeah, that's right.</v>

6
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.840
Which is hilarious before, before, but the,

7
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:17.880
you for you to be a world champion kickboxer and a standup comedian,

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.240
that is a very unusual combin.

9
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.510
<v 1>That's right. Because first, my first dream and that's still, still,</v>

10
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:30.510
my dream today is to become an actor a imagine. And, uh, before,

11
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.470
before I started, uh, combat sport, yeah. I was doing standup. I was,

12
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.870
uh, I was in high school also. I was, uh, learning, um, uh,

13
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.020
convention stuff, uh, actor acting. Uh, I really, I really like it.

14
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.770
And then, uh,

15
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.260
come the compass sport and then I started to improve myself to become yeah.

16
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.740
More to fight, to fight, to fight. And then I, I stopped it a bit, uh,

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.820
yeah, stand up acting. But three months ago I was, uh,

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.610
I played in a small movie, short movie in France. Yeah. I play,

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.970
it's gonna, it's gonna go out in a few in a few, few.

20
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.130
<v 0>Weeks. Now, when you do stand up in Paris,</v>

21
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.690
are you working at comedy clubs? Like,

22
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.690

24
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.880

<v 1>In French. Of course. Yeah. Not in English.</v>

28
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.480

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.200
<v 0>YouTube.</v>

36
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.740
So is that something you would think of doing once you retire from fighting?

37
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.683
Yeah. That's.

38
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.300
<v 1>I really want to do it. That's my first, my first, um, my first way.</v>

39
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.500
That's what I really, really want to do from, yeah. In the top of my bottom of,

40
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.340
um, in the top of my heart. That's that's what I wanna become. Yeah.

41
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:20.980
Cause I read.

42
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.320
<v 0>That you,</v>

43
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.370
if you had to choose between being a famous comedian or a famous fighter,

44
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.170
you would choose to be a famous comedian. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Really? Yeah.

45
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:30.570
Really. But that's so crazy when you see how good you are fighting. Yeah.

46
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.850
<v 1>You know, people, people doesn't believe me when I say that, but if,</v>

47
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.450
if I didn't find a, uh,

48
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.490
if kickboxing didn't found me, because I think I didn't find,

49
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.200
I didn't found kickboxing, kickboxing front of me,

50
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.160
if kickboxing did never found me, I will follow my, my way in,

51
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.520
in comedy stuff. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, for sure.

52
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.280
And so now I'm good in kickboxing. So I just follow myself. Well.

53
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.960
<v 0>You're better than good. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; thank you. Now, how did you become,</v>

54
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.600
how did.

55
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.480
<v 1>Tick boxing find you? You said it found you because I was, I was,</v>

56
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.720
uh, 16, so 10 years ago I was 16 and uh,

57
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.640
I was playing soccer. I was playing soccer and uh, I wasn't that good. I was,

58
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.230
yeah. I just, I was just fast, you know, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; fast.

59
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.670
And in front of the goal, I was falling &lt;laugh&gt; no, I wasn't that good.

60
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.670
You know? And um, one, one day my cousin just,

61
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.430
just call me and he say, Hey, in front of the house, in the neighborhood,

62
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.580
there is a gym, uh, boxing is there. Uh,

63
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.540
I thought, I thought, I thought I was boxing, like Muhammad Ali MC Tyson.

64
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:47.540
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. I said, yeah, if yes, but so what he said, yeah,

65
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.260
let's go try. It is gonna be, maybe it's gonna be funny. You know, I saw,

66
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.380
I saw people goes out from there. The they hard, how you,

67
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.020
how you call black guy. Yeah. Black guy. He says, it's going.

68
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.610
It should be funny. I say, okay, once we gonna do we gonna go there.

69
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.490
So after my, um, my soccer training,

70
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.770
I went there once I tried. And I,

71
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.690
I discovered that it was full contact with legs. With high kick,

72
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.050
middle kick was a little bit strange, but I just follow. I just trained,

73
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.360
getting better and better and just, I, I like it. And so.

74
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.240
<v 0>Immediately, like.</v>

75
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.800
<v 1>You caught the bug. Yeah. Immediately after my first training,</v>

76
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.120
I went there and you know that,

77
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:31.040
that you know that my mother was a gang that, uh,

78
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.720
she said, no, no, no, I don't want you to, to, to fight.

79
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.760
I don't want you to train, uh, boxing. I don't want any boxing in this house.

80
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.510
I was, I cry when, when she say that,

81
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:46.230
because I really like a full contact, combat spot. So I cried when I,

82
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:50.510
when she told me that and I was training, but she doesn't,

83
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.310
she doesn't know that she doesn't know that. No secret. Yeah. Secret was secret.

84
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.190
How old were you when you had your first fight? My first 17. 17.

85
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.620
So she didn't know. She didn't know? No. No.

86
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.220
<v 0>So this was full contact or.</v>

87
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.700
<v 1>Full contact? Yeah. Okay. I did maybe three years full contact and then I,</v>

88
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.220
I move.

89
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.100
<v 0>Kickbox let's explain to people don't know full contact is no leg.</v>

90
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.140
<v 1>Kicks. Yeah. No full contact is no low kicks.</v>

91
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.100
Low kicks. Yeah. Leg kicks. Yeah. That's what I kick the legs. Yeah.

92
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.850
Low kicks under middle kick. Yeah.

93
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.250
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. You guys say have different terminology cause it's call low kick in.</v>

94
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.810
Yeah. We call it leg kicks. Leg kicks. Yeah. But low kicks is correct.

95
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.890
Low kicks is correct. So, uh, you just can't kick the legs,

96
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:35.090
which is interesting, cuz that's very effective and you're very good at that.

97
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.170
Yeah. That's a big.

98
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.730
<v 1>Part of your game right now. Yeah. So, but I'm better in boxing.</v>

99
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.920
So because I, with, with full contact mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is a little bit,

100
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.920
is a little bit similar than, than boxing.

101
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.920
The way you move mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the way you fight because no lock, kick,

102
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.200
no light kicks. Right. So yeah, it's a little bit similar as boxing. And uh,

103
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.280
when I was training food contact, I was watching a lot of Moham Ali,

104
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.240
a lot of movement. Yeah. A lot of movements. So I'm better in boxing.

105
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.320
When I fight kickboxing.

106
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.480
<v 0>When did your mom find out?</v>

107
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.880
<v 1>After, after one year, after my first fight,</v>

108
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.110
she was like, where, when, where was you? I said, no, I was, uh,

109
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.670
in the soccer training. And she said, why do you have gloves? I say, oh,

110
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.910
sometime I go to watch boxing. And she say, I told you,

111
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.150
I don't want you to watch. And to, to, to fight, I say, no, no, no, I don't.

112
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.430
I'm I know I'm not training. Just watching. She said, no, I don't want it.

113
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.060
And every day I just went to the, to, to train, to train, to train.

114
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.940
And uh, he doesn't see me with any, uh,

115
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.420
black eye or things like that. So one day she was very, very tired.

116
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.660
And I say, yeah, uh, mom, listen, I went to the,

117
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.220
the boxing training and she was like, okay. And then the,

118
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.090
I went to the boxing training. I was like, okay. I think,

119
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:05.170
because she didn't see me with any black eyes. I that's,

120
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.890
that's why she was scared first, I think. Right.

121
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.730
She didn't want you to get hurt. Yeah. And then she, she just accept the,

122
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.570
the thing because I make, um, in French recorded fasting, I just,

123
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.400
I just went to the training, like, I like it. So I do it. And today,

124
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:21.160
what do you call it? What do you.

125
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.120
<v 0>Say in French? Forcing.</v>

126
