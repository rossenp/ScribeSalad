00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I want to ask you about Lyme disease. Sure.</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.040
Lyme disease is a scary one, right? And, uh, I mean,

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.960
so many of my friends in the east coast habit,

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.040
it's really terrifying that that th that part of the country in particular seems

5
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:17.220
to be like really badly infected with these,

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.400
these ticks that carry this disease.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850
What can people do to prevent that? And what, what can we,

8
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.600
there's no vaccine for Lyme disease. And I know there was at one point in time,

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.610
but people were having an issue with, uh, I mean, uh, a good friend of mine.

10
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.260
Her dad actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine

11
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.090
before they discontinued it. Um, what can someone do to sort of, uh,

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.430
PR protect themselves? Yeah.

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.600
<v 1>Well, Lyme disease in of itself is a fascinating story.</v>

14
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.890
I've actually been involved with it since its early discovery in the 1980s and

15
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.950
Minnesota, Wisconsin was a big focus, the upper Midwest.

16
00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.390
And this is a story that I think you'll find interesting is is that even though

17
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:04.230
it was discovered primarily in the Eastern part of the United States named after

18
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.030
Lyme Connecticut, um,

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630
it's a disease that actually probably originated in the upper Midwest.

20
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.360
And I tell you that because, uh,

21
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.650
it turns out that there is a focus in Northern Wisconsin and in east central

22
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.080
Minnesota where there's Lyme disease.

23
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:22.110
There's another disease called anaplasmosis. There's another disease,

24
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.520
but easier, et cetera,

25
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:28.290
that all seemed to have a similar kind of tick human Deere

26
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:31.920
kind of component. And back in the, uh,

27
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.890
CCC days of the 1930s,

28
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.300
the white tail deer population had been virtually totally depopulated from the

29
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.134
Northeast.

30
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.970
And so they actually trapped here in Northern Wisconsin and took them out

31
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.630
and deposit them in the New York and Connecticut and so forth.

32
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.040
And most of those deer are actually deer that, you know, today there are great,

33
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:58.200
great, great, great. Great-grandfather came from Wisconsin. Wow. And guess what,

34
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.330
when you moved here, you moved ticks. In fact,

35
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:03.930
I was involved with a study that the Wisconsin division of health did and a

36
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.340
colleague of mine. The late Jeff Davis were up in Northern Wisconsin.

37
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.990
There's deer would come into the check station and they would actually measure

38
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:16.110
the number of ticks that were attached to the NAPE of the neck. Okay.

39
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.340
And they had a thing drawn and they asked hunters who were driving back to

40
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.450
Madison and Milwaukee.

41
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.310
If they would be willing to check in at a station down there for just a second.

42
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.380
And then they were going to count the ticks again.

43
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.170
And it turned out that as the vehicles come rolling down

44
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:38.130
from highway 51 from Northern Wisconsin, get on the interstate 90,

45
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.480
94 and go to Milwaukee or Madison,

46
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.980
the ticks just kept falling off until the time they get to Madison or Milwaukee,

47
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:46.950
the ticks are almost all gone well guess lo and behold,

48
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.910
where all the Lyme disease and so forth started to show up right along the

49
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:52.650
interstate quarter. Wow.

50
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.190
Because the ticks were coming off and then they were getting into the local deer

51
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.130
in that population. And so it's exactly what you said. The ticks are moving.

52
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.950
They're moving. Okay. They've moved and they're now infected. So I think that,

53
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.710
that this Lyme disease issue is a key one.

54
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.060
Lyme disease is really an important disease. It's real, no question about it.

55
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.310
The challenge we have is,

56
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.880
is that there's a lot of people that assume that they have chronic Lyme

57
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.420
infection and you know, the data on that is just really,

58
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.660
really not there to support that these people are chronically infected,

59
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.640
but they do have an immune response likely that occurs where it sets

60
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.540
up this trigger. And so they're sick. They actually have something,

61
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.020
but it's not treating it again for the bacteria infection.

62
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.710
It's the fact that this body, your own body's immune systems,

63
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.000
we've talked about several times today, but starts attacking you. See,

64
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.430
I think it's a similar picture we see with chronic fatigue syndrome,

65
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.240
same kind of thing. These people really are sick. They really do have problems,

66
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.820
but it's not something you can treat. So when people,

67
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.350
I have a challenge because when people take IV antibiotics at extended periods

68
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:00.640
of time for Lyme disease, you know, the data, there's four different studies.

69
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.110
Now that have been done where people have had what we call a double blind

70
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.360
control, placebo controlled trial,

71
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:11.830
where half got the drug half got Ivy, but no drug.

72
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.650
And it turned out all four of these studies in Lyme disease.

73
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.630
The people who got the,

74
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.050
just the placebo did just the same as the people who got the drug.

75
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.410
And I worry that we're using antibiotics a lot there.

76
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.500
And this is where I just mentioned earlier about Clostridium difficile.

77
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:31.330
We actually had a patient Minnesota died from the Ivy treatment for what was

78
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:33.790
chronic Lyme disease. And it wouldn't have been helpful.

79
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.870
And so we need a lot more research in this area to figure out what are these

80
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:38.680
people getting?

81
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.150
What is it that we can shut off so that they don't have this chronic Lyme

82
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.090
disease picture, knowing that it's not actually just,

83
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.540
you had to treat a more treatments that can help them with the antibiotics

84
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.940
anymore. And so I think that that's, uh, an area that, uh, uh,

85
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.680
we just need a lot more work in and, and as the numbers are growing,

86
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:01.030
as you know, so we don't, we don't know what's happening well, there's,

87
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.830
we have enough data to say your immune system is really cranked up, right?

88
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.300
Your immune system is, you know, just playing something. Yeah.

89
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.390
It's like rheumatoid arthritis, a lot of things where we, you know, we,

90
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.470
you know,

91
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.010
thank God for our immune system is what fights off all the bad things we have.

92
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.720
But sometimes that immune system gets turned down too much and then it takes on

93
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.960
us. Okay. And that goes back to the coronavirus.

94
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.810
So that's why a lot of these people are dying right now is this over vigorous

95
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:30.070
immune response and Lyme disease has kind of that insane inciting event where we

96
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:33.520
have evidence now that you could be infected with the bacteria.

97
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.820
But if we treat you, it's not like it's like every other bacteria,

98
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:38.290
you can really get rid of it,

99
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.460
but you still have this chronic illness that's occurring.

100
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.360
And what I think is hard is,

101
00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:47.680
is that we see people who have this,

102
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.100
who are desperate to have somebody understand what they have.

103
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.360
And they end up going to people who take real advantage of clinicians who charge

104
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:58.400
them an arm and a leg for things that are not going to help them.

105
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.570
And what we need is a lot more research on what is actually going on and what

106
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:07.230
kind of drugs can we use to reverse this immune system disorder. Right.

107
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.480
<v 0>We have, uh, a friend of mine, who's a UFC fighter, Jim Miller, and he's,</v>

108
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.800
he's got Lyme disease and it's pretty bad. And he takes a stack of pills.

109
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.260
I don't know what he takes every day. Yeah.

110
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.290
What do you think someone is taking and w what,

111
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.570
what benefit would they get from that?

112
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.050
<v 1>I couldn't tell. I mean, I'm, I'm not, you know, without knowing what it Sarah,</v>

113
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.040
but again, more often than not a few has been adequately treated. Um,

114
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.230
it's not that the bacteria is still growing in him.

115
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.470
Like it might be for a lot of days, but an auto-immune auto-immune,

116
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.790
which is real. I mean, that's,

117
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:40.910
the other thing is I think these people just want to be legitimized and said,

118
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:44.840
you know, I'm really sick and I'm not, um, it's not something I'm, you know,

119
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.220
mentally ill about whatever,

120
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.830
but then we've got to figure out what it is that you have.

121
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.800
And I really don't know. We don't know yet. We don't know. Wow.

122
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.210
But it's been around for so long. I know,

123
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.550
but this is where we need a lot more research about this.

124
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.150
So in terms of what is it that's making these people like this,

125
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.650
and this is really important.

126
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.320
<v 0>And is there anything they can do to eradicate the text?</v>

127
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.490
<v 1>You know, this is another thing you'll find interesting. Um,</v>

128
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.500
in Minnesota, prior to the rival, the first Whiteman,

129
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.770
the native Americans burned much of our state all the time,

130
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.230
the Prairie's for much of the territory. And even in Northern Wisconsin,

131
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.500
Northern Minnesota, we had the classic, you know, pine forest, firewood,

132
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.720
whites row. And with that,

133
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:30.920
it would open up so much of the forest that,

134
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.270
that you'd have a very different kind of, of, of mammals population, deer,

135
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:36.260
et cetera, et cetera.

136
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.850
And with the suppression of fire what's happened is we've now have,

137
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.080
instead of having these old growth forest, we have all this younger, you know,

138
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.370
non pine or any kind of like the Oak trees of the upper Midwest are all

139
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:52.550
disappearing because Oak trees need sunlight and fires.

140
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.010
What kept there were very resistant to fire.

141
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:59.240
And so the old Oak forest and so forth would, would survive cause a fire.

142
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.900
Whereas today with no fire, you know,

143
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.650
the Elms and the Maples and everything else comes in and the buck Thor and all

144
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:08.870
that kind of stuff and takes over. So,

145
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.340
so what's happening is in our state of Minnesota is we have a really good

146
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:15.260
example of this as we're losing our moose.

147
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.340
And the big primary reason is brain worm. It's brain room.

148
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:22.370
It's a type of parasite. That's common and white tail deer,

149
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.670
but causes no problems in moose.

150
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.830
It actually causes a brain infection and it kills them.

151
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.600
And guess why it's happening?

152
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.100
Because the deer range has moved farther and farther north in Minnesota,

153
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.233
try to keep this

154
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.740
[inaudible] has moved farther in Northern Minnesota because of lack of fire

155
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:43.790
because the forest is changing. So now where there only used to be moose,

156
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:46.520
we're seeing deer and moose and where that intersection is.

157
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.120
We're starting to see moose develop his brain worm infection cause it's from the

158
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:54.620
deer. So the tick population has changed too. And it's largely due to the fire,

159
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.310
lack of fire in many places in the Northeast, never used to be like it was,

160
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:03.030
we had fire all the time that would clear out these areas and it was just a part

161
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.620
of natural everything. So,

162
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.350
so one of the challenges we have with ticks is they're here.

163
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.970
We're not going to change how we live suburbs and trees and all of that.

164
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.910
<v 0>Controlled burns eliminate.</v>

165
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.840
<v 1>A lot of them, they do,</v>

166
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:18.060
because what they do is they just don't eliminate the ticks.

167
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.920
But what they do is they eliminate, for example,

168
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:24.120
the Whitefield mice or all these different species that are important to the

169
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.070
ticks. And then they bring in different species that will will be there. So,

170
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.290
I mean, this is a big debate in Minnesota right now. I mean, we're,

171
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.500
we're losing all these moves to brainwork. Ironically,

172
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.280
the moose for population is expanding dramatically. I'll Royal.

173
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.340
Why? Because there's no deer out there.

174
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.270
And so they're not getting brain worm out there. So people have said, you know,

175
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.880
we're going to lose our moose. Well, it's the deer. So,

176
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.450
so fire actually has helped the most in areas in Northern Minnesota where

177
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:52.410
there's been a lot of fire,

178
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.090
the moose population is growing because the deer are not there because exactly

179
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.860
those mammals, those rodents and so forth are very different in burnt-out areas.

180
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.320
And they are in fi in non burnt-out areas.

181
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.170
<v 0>They do control burns. In some states, I got,</v>

182
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.870
I had a friend who was hunting in Washington state a couple of years ago.

183
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:10.291
And he said,

184
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:13.500
it was really weird because there's these massive fires in the distance that

185
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.260
were actually being controlled. They do it on purpose.

186
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.470
<v 1>Yeah. Which is a lot better than having the out of control fires,</v>

187
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:22.020
where you have so much fuel. And, you know,

188
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.140
if you haven't had a poorest fire in 85, a hundred years in an area,

189
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.680
the fuel in there is huge. And so actually they do that in Northern Minnesota,

190
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:30.720
too. They're doing controlled burns in the paries.

191
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:32.630
Of course we do a controlled burns all the time. So.

192
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.540
<v 0>But the problem with the east coast is you're dealing with a lot of these sorta</v>

193
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.370
almost residential areas that have yeah.

194
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.860
<v 1>All these ticks. Yeah. You can't. Yeah, there, you can't there.</v>

195
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.690
We have to find ways that that's,

196
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.140
that's where we really have to have vaccines and treatments for these diseases

197
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.070
rock, you get rid of the ticks. So what we have to do is figure out a, I mean,

198
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.270
wouldn't it be incredible.

199
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.100
We have a cocktail vaccine for male Babesia for Lyme disease,

200
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:57.690
and that's what we need.

201
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.730
<v 0>Is there any kind of an animal that eats ticks.</v>

202
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.880
<v 1>Birds? Yeah. Birds will eat them, but not enough. Not enough. No, no. They're,</v>

203
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:06.900
they're doing very well. Thank you. Ticks do very well.

204
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.990
And that's another issue, uh, you know, for some of the larger mammals is,

205
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:13.740
you know, tick predation can get so heavy, particularly in, in,

206
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.340
in certain times of the year that that really literally,

207
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:20.160
it takes a lot of blood out of these large animals, even though they're so big.

208
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.190
<v 0>I went down a rabbit hole the other day online,</v>

209
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:27.960
and I saw this one deer that was covered in these Frisbee size patches of

210
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:29.200
texts. That's exactly right.

211
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.050
<v 1>Swollen all and they're full of blood. Oh. So, and it happens day after day.</v>

212
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:35.970
So it is a hit on them. It's a real hidden.

213
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.450
<v 0>To pull up a picture of that, just to freak people out of watching online.</v>

214
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.690
Just they need to see this. Yeah. It may be amaze.

215
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.540
It's one of those things that when you talk about ticks and you talk about Lyme

216
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:48.630
disease, most people, their eyes glaze over, they don't even care.

217
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.620
It's not affecting me until someone in your family has it. Yep. Um,

218
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.790
does a guy that I know who was a former UFC fighter, Marcus Davis, who he put,

219
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.920
he had his wife got Lyme disease and he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars

220
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.180
trying to,

221
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.810
trying to help burn and do something about and treatments and all these

222
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:08.980
different things for it. Yeah.

223
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.190
<v 1>It's a, it's a real challenge. It's a challenge. And this is another area.</v>

224
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:13.510
Again, you know,

225
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:16.810
when you think of the amount of money we lose in just last time,

226
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.700
let alone pain and suffering what an investment to make in this. I mean, this,

227
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.630
this is the kind of thing,

228
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.240
and this is where infectious disease is really needed to run the science.

229
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.223
I mean.

230
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.000
<v 0>We pulled up a chart of the United States where they showed the areas that are</v>

231
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.270
affected by these ticks. And what,

232
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.800
what percentage of ticks carry Lyme disease they've tested and some places in

233
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.570
the Northeast it's in the 60%.

234
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.610
<v 1>Exactly. Yeah, it is. It's huge. And it's growing and it's growing. I mean,</v>

235
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.130
when you and understand how wildlife has changed, I mean, look at,

236
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.360
to think that we have all these wild coyote populations in New York city now.

237
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.570
Yes. I mean, it's amazing how many animals, the city and the country,

238
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.160
what the rats aren't doing, the coyotes are taken off and it's, it's,

239
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.400
it's a challenge. I mean, these are infectious disease issues too.

240
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:03.940
They're they're.

241
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.790
<v 0>Very real. Yeah. They have coyotes in central park. They do.</v>

242
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.683
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

243
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.480
<v 0>They're put in the Bronx. They have them in, I mean, it's weird.</v>

244
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.680
It's weird to see, because this is something that just didn't exist before.

245
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.240
Look at it. There's that's that's okay. Yeah.

246
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.780
That's okay. That's not, that's not the best I've seen, but it's gross enough.

247
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.910
<v 1>It gives you a good sense of it though.</v>

248
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.320
<v 0>Yeah. Uh, Dan Flores,</v>

249
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:30.250
who has been a guest on the podcast before has a great book called coyote

250
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:30.761
America.

251
00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:35.560
That sort of details how this king to be and how these coyotes have a, oh,

252
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:36.430
look at that. All over that.

253
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.890
<v 1>Poor deer. Look at the eye and the phone.</v>

254
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.620
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. They're disgusting.</v>

255
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.310
But the coyotes about how,

256
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.270
when they got rid of the wolves and, uh,

257
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.800
they tried to do the same to the coyote.

258
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.440
They just actually expanded their territory. They're sneaky.

259
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.330
Very clever little animals.

260
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.270
<v 1>Adaption. Yeah. Just like microbes adaption. Yeah.</v>
