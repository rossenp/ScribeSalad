00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 1>Experience. That's gotta be a tough,</v>

3
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.170
not a people can pull yourself out of a lot of people. Can't reinvent himself.

4
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:07.860
Like.

5
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.910
<v 0>Right. Look, if you're Gallagher, like everybody expects fruit. If you say,</v>

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.150
I'm just going to talk. Now people are like, come on bro.

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.970
But we wanted to talk in the fruit. Right.

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.830
<v 1>And people like that have weird, weird, crazy fetishizes, bro. It's like,</v>

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.880
did he some watermelons, Denny. He likes looking at naked goats and.

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.190
Something, something, something crazy if you that. Well, but Gallagher,

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.230
you're going to see Gallagher. Anytime you see Gallagher,

12
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.210
you're going to think watermelon for the rest of.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.220
<v 0>Yeah. You're going to think sledgehammer,</v>

14
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.980
or you can think everybody's covered in plastic. Remember.

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.080
<v 1>I remember that when we were not, I hate to keep, but you just said it when,</v>

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.490
when I was what Chappelle show and I used to pitch ideas and um,

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.660
they used to just throw my ideas, like pop, get that outta here. Neil.

18
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.150
Usually I used to pitch ideas here and then a guy gonna come down and did the

19
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660
Dougal come and just, somebody's going to have a hat on. Right?

20
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.780
They're gonna come. And they gonna shoot him.

21
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:05.130
And then he used to be like this pack. He used to smack that outta here.

22
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.020
He was like, do that 10 years ago, son. Like my was so dated.

23
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.670
And I couldn't think of anything.

24
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.630
One day I was watching comedy central and Gallagher is on.

25
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.380
And for some reason, Gallagher looked like Dave Chappelle to me.

26
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.010
And I think because they like skateboards and, I'd say an escape.

27
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.950
And I just said, and I, cause I was smoking a joint. I said,

28
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:29.970
what if Gallagher was black? I was like, what if Gallagher was black?

29
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.430
I just said, what if galago was black? That was my pitch line.

30
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.570
I said, what if Gallagher was black? Right?

31
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.830
And then I called Neil Brennan and I said, I got an idea. He said, what son?

32
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.030
I said black Gallagher and bam.

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.980
<v 0>Wow. I forgot about this character.</v>

34
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.910
Black Gallagher. You were on without a doubt.

35
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.340
The greatest sketch show in the history of the world. I mean,

36
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:02.790
it lasted only a little while, but those are the,

37
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.080
the classic sketches. There's some great sketches. It doesn't put anybody down.

38
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:09.270
I mean, obviously Saturday night live has been around forever.

39
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.860
They have a lot of great sketches,

40
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.910
but it's hard to beat the black KKK dude.

41
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.010
It's hard to beat that. So it's like,

42
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.740
it's hard to beat that as an all time sketch.

43
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.000
<v 1>I don't even know what thought process you gotta have to even. Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:24.840
That was when.

45
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.090
<v 0>That sketches going on, you're watching and going.</v>

46
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.570
<v 1>Yo whoa. It felt like when that sketch drop, bro,</v>

47
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:37.980
when that sketch sketch drop,

48
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.970
I was like, oh. It was just like,

49
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.260
what are we talking about?

50
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.810
<v 0>Funniest things that's ever been captured on film when Neil's head explodes.</v>

51
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.580
<v 1>Yo, what a.</v>

52
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.310
<v 0>Great idea too. It's just such a great idea.</v>

53
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.470
A blind black KKK member and.

54
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.890
<v 1>He just around figuring.</v>

55
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 0>He's widest.</v>

56
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.280
And that still stays in pop culture. It's just one of those things.

57
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.940
It's going to be a Clayton Bigsby forever, forever.

58
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.090
There's a bunch of those is Rick.

59
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:16.240
James was one of the greatest sketches of all time.

60
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.070
<v 1>I remember when we were, um,</v>

61
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.050
when we were doing the wrap arounds and when you show the sketch to the audience

62
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.600
and um, they played the Rick James sketch and every time we played it,

63
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.710
the room just exploded. I mean just exploded. Like,

64
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.850
wow.

65
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.290
<v 0>Oh my God. Yeah, it.</v>

66
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.710
<v 1>Was, it was, you knew something different. You never know.</v>

67
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.560
No one ever knew that it would go to the extended. It went,

68
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.710
but you just knew something was big in that moment.

69
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.510
<v 0>Too. There was a moment where like people would just yell out. I'm rich.</v>

70
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.890
There was just yelling out and shows people just yell it out. Yeah.

71
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.440
I just kept yelling it out. I'm wrench patch.

72
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.840
They was like something they wanted to say.

73
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.010
They had to say it did that show had an impact,

74
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.160
a crazy impact. If you really stop and think about it,

75
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.550
it's amazing that someone somehow or another through whatever,

76
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.170
didn't keep that going. I don't know what happened. I don't even,

77
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.940
but God. How do you not keep that going? Just back off,

78
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.740
back off of film and just let him do it. What happened here?

79
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.750
How did you that up?

80
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.210
<v 1>That's how I felt when he did SNL a couple of years ago, you know, I was like,</v>

81
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.070
it's like, that show is past as,

82
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.380
and a lot of everybody's doing different things, you know what I mean?

83
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:43.270
But the show was so the show is just so iconic. It's hard to forget about it,

84
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.310
but it was like, um, if, if it, when we did SNL,

85
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.430
when he did the, uh, walking dance spoof,

86
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.880
When he did Jamie, did you see that sketch? He did the walking dead.

87
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.230
He his, for the walking dead.

88
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.520
<v 0>I didn't see this. Oh my God. And this is a recent thing.</v>

89
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.770
<v 1>Oh, this was SNL. He won an Emmy for this. This was SNL like two years ago.</v>

90
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.330
When this scene right here, man, I was saying to myself,

91
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.280
this is like,

92
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.950
cause I hadn't seen him perform as a character actor since Chappelle show

93
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.510
and he bodied just the beginning of this is ridiculous.

94
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:28.510
It was funny as that won an Emmy for like the, you know,

95
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.620
I have a little special category, like a special,

96
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.260
like a comedy special, not the, not the premiere, um, Emmys,

97
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.610
but the ones I'm talking about.

98
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.860
<v 0>Yeah. That's, that's a crazy scene to spoof too.</v>

99
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.790
Right? That was a terror. Remember that scene in the walking dead.

100
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.860
But he did it. That's like one of the most brutal scenes in all of television.

101
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.370
If you really stop and think about it, I couldn't believe what they showed.

102
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.410
Like when they first episode out to the season. Right?

103
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.320
I think so they killed off two or three people. The one dude who they,

104
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.880
what was his name? Did that Glen did.

105
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:10.160
They kept hitting in the head and you could see his eyeball pop out. I'm.

106
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.660
<v 1>Like, what did we say, gory.</v>

107
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.750
<v 0>I didn't with it. After that, I was like, I didn't even know.</v>

108
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.340
<v 1>Assistant to this. Yeah. But he made that funny. That was so funny.</v>

109
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.310
And it was any glimpse of, well, it will be a man killed, but that it was.

110
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.010
<v 0>Well, you know, I mean, again, when you talk about all times catches.</v>

111
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.710
<v 1>It was fun, man.</v>

112
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.710
<v 0>How many, how many episodes did it do all total?</v>

113
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.270
<v 1>I don't know what would, what? It was two and a half years, but I don't know.</v>

114
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.670
I would say probably 50 episodes, maybe net,

115
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.250
if that 50.

116
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.803
<v 0>Wasn't that many.</v>

117
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.480
<v 1>It was a lot. And another part, not even the schedule, the music that,</v>

118
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.090
the music that would be a dope show.

119
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:06.110
Just to show the guests kinda young Kanye common

120
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.440
good-bye dude. Everybody used to talk through.

121
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.170
<v 0>What a crazy show. Yup.</v>

122
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.080
Do you think he's happy to doing that or he's happier doing up.

123
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.920
<v 1>I think stand up, you know, he shares a similar personality,</v>

124
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.370
this similar personality you shared it. I share to Joey Diaz,

125
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.180
that want to be on stage. You want to perform as a standup.

126
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.390
You know what I mean? Like I don't think I can't speak for them.

127
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.530
I don't think it's, I don't think it's important for him to be on TV.

128
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.210
Other things important for him to be the best comedian he could be. Right.

129
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.590
You know, you know,

130
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.890
you know how you feel when you think you walk working at the top of your game,

131
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:53.750
you just hope everybody acknowledges.

132
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.650
<v 0>I think also too, you know, he did it and now, you know,</v>

133
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:03.220
now he doesn't have anybody to answer to, you know, he did it, the show's done.

134
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.980
He did it. It's still my opinion.

135
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.530
I think it's the greatest sketch comedy show of all time. Yeah.

136
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.370
<v 1>Then they do the things like it's hard not to talk about him because you know,</v>

137
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:15.280
he's what some people consider the greatest to ever do it.

138
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.100
You know what I'm saying? And then you have a relationship with that person.

139
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:22.750
You know, you're not exploited, but it's this interesting, you know, like I've,

140
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.390
I've seen his career go to the point where,

141
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.600
and this is why I say it's the last specialty we did sticks.

142
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:33.460
And stones was so important for comedy because

143
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.590
critics and a couple of people were dictating the tone of comedy had people

144
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:42.520
second, get some people second guessing themselves. Right. You know what I mean?

145
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.430
I've heard, I was hearing comedians. I, oh I want to say this,

146
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:47.260
but I don't feel comfortable. I'm like, what the has happened?

147
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.980
And you got to say what you want to say. Right. You know? And there was a, um,

148
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.100
there was a comic, I won't mention their name,

149
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:59.070
but they a critical article about Dave and sticks and stones.

150
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.490
And the thing that I found interesting was that they wrote a CRA,

151
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.270
they were a comedian writing, a critical article,

152
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.860
which is all up right out the gate. And I feel if you, as a comedian,

153
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:15.420
if you don't know what specials like sticks a stone

154
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.580
special. And like what bill, Burr's special,

155
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.630
what they do for the voice of comedy is saying, this is what we do.

156
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:23.280
That's it stop? Yeah.

157
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.880
<v 0>You know? Well, it seems like the expectations,</v>

158
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.670
cultural expectations of how we shouldn't,

159
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:33.120
shouldn't talk about things they're shifting so quickly.

160
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.370
And people like demand compliance for you to, you know, behave a certain way.

161
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.323
But.

162
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.500
<v 1>This is not a professor to comply in. No.</v>

163
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.420
<v 0>No, don't do that. It's also like this move towards compliance. I don't,</v>

164
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.720
I mean, I think we should just be all nicer to each other.

165
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.200
I think this compliance is like something that people,

166
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.880
because they think they're right.

167
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.910
They think they're going to enforce their ID on people,

168
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.700
but it's like the worst way to talk to people. For example.

169
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.460
<v 1>Yeah. Nice. Just be nice. Just be nice. Just be nice. Tell you this, Joe.</v>

170
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.140
You've probably had this. Why? Oh, why? It's because I'm gay.

171
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.510
No, it's because you're an. Yeah, no,

172
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:22.140
it has nothing to do about who Dick you suck or any of that.

173
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:27.120
It's because you're an. You take the out of anything.

174
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.720
could be in anything. It could be a gay, it could be in white.

175
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.740
It could be an nev take the off it. You set it. Yo,

176
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.420
just what is so hard, Joe, about being nice.

177
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.400
<v 0>What's a hard, we could be better at it.</v>
