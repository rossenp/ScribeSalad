<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.290
When you have these moments where things don't go well, or you have a fall,

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.620
or when you had your concussion, when you got really banged up,

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.910
overcoming those things, what is that like?

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.840
Cause I would imagine that it's such a scary thing to do. Well, maybe for me,

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:23.130
I know as much for you, but watching pictures of you, my hands, sweat,

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.350
not like legitimately,

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.900
like Alex Honnold freaks me out every time I see videos of him.

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.320
Cause he's got no nothing saving him. My hands start sweating.

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.380
<v 1>No, I think all our hands, sweat when we watch him. But, um,</v>

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.610
yeah. So for me, it's I think, for example, when I,

12
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.850
when I hit my head this time, the time I got the scar, um,

13
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.900
I was on one of my day had gone so perfectly. Like I was climbing super well,

14
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:52.880
everything was great. I, there it is. Um, yeah, that was the rock bottom moment.

15
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:57.650
So I was climbing and I was in the sun. I slipped off.

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.160
I felt like I was just going to have a really normal fall, super safe,

17
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.480
like nothing bad was going to happen.

18
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:06.860
And then I hit my head and I instantly like just felt the blood pouring down my

19
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:10.670
face and it was super dramatic and it was super scary.

20
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.290
And I lowered down and Adrian sort of assessed me for concussion

21
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:19.340
symptoms and tried to figure out if there was anything super serious.

22
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:23.540
And it turns out that there wasn't really. Um, and so it,

23
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.480
it came time to decide like, Oh, should I keep going? Or should I,

24
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.440
should I give up like what, you know what, what's the best course of action now.

25
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.700
And honestly, in my head, I was like, part of me was like,

26
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:35.990
I don't want to keep climbing.

27
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.030
Like I'm emotionally kind of destroyed and, and drained.

28
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.210
And I don't think I can.

29
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.320
<v 0>No, it happened like what, what was the sequence of events.</v>

30
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.130
<v 1>I was,</v>

31
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.810
so I was climbing this pitch and it's a pitch that I've never fallen on before.

32
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.100
Um, and the next pitch is the hard one,

33
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.450
which is where I think I went wrong because I was sort of thinking ahead,

34
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.670
like I wasn't focusing on what was happening in front of me.

35
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:04.910
I was thinking about the, the next pitch. And I was like,

36
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:08.120
I need to get this one out of the way so that I can focus on the hard one.

37
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.990
And therefore I was climbing the sun when it's too hot.

38
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.950
Like the friction's not as good. It's more slippery, all those things. Um,

39
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.430
and I was rushing it. I didn't rest enough. Friction.

40
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.870
<v 0>Is not as good when it's hot. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.450
<v 1>You want it to be cold because your skin sweats and like the</v>

42
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.190
rubber on your shoes isn't as sticky.

43
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:31.760
Like it's just the heat that heat radiates off the rock.

44
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:33.860
It just gets more slippery. Like imagine like a,

45
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.440
a granite face just like baking in the sun.

46
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.740
Like everything's more slippery and you're, you're all sweaty.

47
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:43.790
And so it's just not ideal. Um, and I could have waited, but I didn't.

48
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.320
So I climb, I was climbing and I was like, kind of traversing.

49
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.480
And so I was trying to do this move and I rushed it and I slipped and I

50
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:57.530
fell, but I had like a piece of gear down into my right.

51
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.770
And I just didn't,

52
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.160
I just didn't anticipate like the physics of how I was going to fall.

53
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.760
And I kind of fell sideways and I couldn't get my feet out in front of me in

54
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.040
time. And we watched the footage later. It was just like,

55
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.860
it was kind of like my head just like bounces off the wall, like a,

56
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.410
like a basketball. Um,

57
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.730
and I must have just hit like a crystal or something with my forehead,

58
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.090
like some sort of something sticking out of the rock. Um,

59
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.120
and there was just blood everywhere, like head wounds. They just, you know,

60
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.860
they bleed, they bleed a lot.

61
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.360
And so there was a lot of blood and lower down and it was super bummed.

62
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:35.260
It was just like, my confidence was sort of shattered. Like I could,

63
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.750
I just kept thinking back to last year, I was like, Oh no,

64
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.140
my attempts over everything was going so well. Like the socks.

65
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:44.410
And I was letting myself go to that place of doubt and that place of like,

66
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.660
it's over.

67
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.200
<v 0>And last year when you hit your head, you hit your head much harder.</v>

68
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.180
<v 1>Last year I fell on the first pitch of the route. Um, so close to the ground.</v>

69
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.610
Uh, and, but I felt like 50 feet and I hit a ledge and didn't the rope. Like,

70
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:03.210
didn't catch me. I hit the ledge because I was, uh, again,

71
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:06.090
rushing and not placing enough protection and.

72
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.850
<v 0>Fell 50 feet without being caught.</v>

73
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.010
<v 1>Hit a leg. Oh God. Yeah. It was a really, it was pretty gnarly. I, it,</v>

74
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.260
I don't remember. Cause I got knocked out. Yeah. Um,

75
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.550
but I had this crazy rope burn on my neck and um,

76
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.670
yeah, it was, it was pretty, I had, yeah, we,

77
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.970
I had to get rescued like full on ambulance to the hospital.

78
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:34.290
Like spinal injury worries, all that.

79
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.360
It was pretty serious. It was definitely the worst accident I've ever had. Um,

80
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.560
and it was, I walked out of the hospital that day, which is incredible.

81
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.320
Like that just doesn't happen very often. There's me.

82
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.830
<v 0>Dressed up like a burrito and what,</v>

83
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.350
so this is when they were carrying you to the hospital.

84
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.150
<v 1>Yeah. That's a rope burn. I also don't know how that happened. Oh,</v>

85
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:58.350
wow. Yeah.

86
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.400
<v 0>Wow. And there's no footage of this, right? You didn't,</v>

87
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.960
you didn't review footage of it.

88
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.570
<v 1>Well, it was dark when I started climbing.</v>

89
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.550
So actually his footage of Alex Honnold was belaying me. Um,

90
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:13.290
there's footage of him belaying me.

91
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.620
What is blaming blaming is the person who holds your rope at the bottom.

92
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.020
So he was like, essentially holding my rope,

93
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:22.350
but it's a little bit nuanced because the way we were climbing,

94
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.470
we were doing something called Simon climbing. Um, we were,

95
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.930
so we were essentially, I was tied on the top of the rope.

96
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:30.870
He was tied onto the bottom of the rope and we were climbing together up the

97
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.140
walls simultaneously in order to save time. And it's actually,

98
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.490
it is a more dangerous form of climbing than just like

99
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.240
one person climbing while the other person belays them. And then they,

100
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.450
and then I would stop and bring him up and then we'd go on from there.

101
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:47.820
Like instead we were climbing together. Whoa.

102
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.170
<v 0>That makes me nervous. Just thinking about it. So if someone falls,</v>

103
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:53.490
you're kind of connected to them.

104
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.140
<v 1>Yeah. We were always connected to somebody when you fall. Um,</v>

105
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.210
but if he had fallen, it would, it's,

106
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.720
it's kind of a complicated form of climbing that not many people do. Um,

107
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.110
it's definitely like a, an advanced strategy.

108
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.420
Um, but so was someone filming? Yeah. I have a,

109
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.860
I have a filmer. Who's making like a, a movie about me.

110
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.360
Um,

111
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.020
and he was filming cause he was there filming that attempt and he was filming

112
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.360
Alex as Alex was like sitting on the ground, getting ready.

113
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.820
<v 0>And have you reviewed the footage? Yeah. What was it like watching yourself?</v>

114
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 1>It's pretty, it's pretty like it's, it's hard. It was hard.</v>

115
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:33.070
I didn't watch it for the first few months. I was like, I don't know.

116
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.970
<v 0>How long does it take to fall 50 feet? It would imagine that's a few seconds.</v>

117
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.200
<v 1>I dunno. What's the fall.</v>

118
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.610
Isn't it like not nine point. Yeah. 9.8 meters per second.

119
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.310
<v 0>So it's a couple of seconds.</v>

120
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.310
<v 1>Um, at least it felt that way.</v>

121
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.800
<v 2>Oh God.</v>

122
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.230
<v 1>So that was, that was something like a mental hurdle to get over for this year.</v>

123
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:09.520
And then this year, something similar happens only I was way higher on the wall,

124
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:11.830
but I was really close to succeeding this time.

125
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.330
And I had this part of me was like, well, I just want to give up, like,

126
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:18.760
I don't want to do this anymore. I want to be done. Like,

127
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:20.350
I'm tired of this project. I'm over it.

128
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.250
<v 0>When you got over the first injury that the, the really bad one from last year,</v>

129
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.710
what was the process of recovery?

130
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.890
Like how long did it take before you felt comfortable enough to climb again?

131
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.660
<v 1>You know, I was super lucky. I think I definitely got away with one.</v>

132
00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:36.220
It was one of those things where I got away with one,

133
00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:40.780
like I walked out of the hospital. I was, um, back climbing.

134
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.350
I took, I think I took a month off, but I went to, like,

135
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.090
I went to Ecuador and climb to a volcano with my dad and like went skiing and

136
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.250
just did a bunch of things. Like how long is fine.

137
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.460
We went to Ecuador like four days later.

138
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.190
<v 0>Yeah. Kind of crazy father do you have?</v>

139
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.083
<v 1>He's awesome.</v>

140
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.600
My dad loves all sports and activities and he's like super passionate about

141
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:04.931
everything.

142
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:08.680
And this was his dream was to like go climb this volcano in Ecuador and we'd

143
00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:09.760
been planning it for months.

144
00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:12.580
And I actually felt that was one of the reasons I felt so bad that I got hurt.

145
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:15.340
It was like, I was like, Oh no, I'm supposed to go on this trip with my dad.

146
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:19.510
And like we had, you know, we had this whole plan. He's been training.

147
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:24.130
He trained like for months he's 65 years old. Like, Hey,

148
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.810
you know, it was one of those things.

149
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:27.340
So we went and we climbed the mountain and like,

150
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.630
thankfully I was able to do that with her.

151
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.553
<v 0>And it was really cool,</v>

152
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.000
but kind of like physical damage.

153
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:36.880
Did you suffer in terms of like how long did it take for you to recover?

154
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.010
<v 1>I, I honestly, I would say I felt pretty normal within a month. Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:45.850
A little back pain, but concussion cushion. Yeah.

156
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:48.130
The concussion symptoms were a little gnarly for a little while.

157
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.540
<v 0>But four days later you're climbing a volcano. Well, we're headed there. Yeah.</v>

158
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.540
How long after that before you were actually I.

159
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.973
<v 1>Maybe like three weeks.</v>

160
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.570
<v 0>So while you were suffering from some,</v>

161
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.330
at least concussion symptoms, you were climbing.

162
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.830
<v 1>Yeah. Not recommended. We went to the doctor and she was like,</v>

163
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.560
you can't go to Ecuador. You shouldn't do that. And I was like, yeah,

164
00:09:12.561 --> 00:09:13.394
that's nice.

165
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.000
<v 0>When, when you watch the footage of the fall and you, you know,</v>

166
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.040
when you see yourself hit the wall and just the impact and

167
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.900
what happened to you does that obviously didn't deter you

168
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.490
from doing anything, but has it changed the way you approach climbing?

169
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.880
<v 1>Yes and no. I,</v>

170
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.860
I think the reason that it was a little bit easier for me to overcome that

171
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:45.770
hurdle was because I was, it was really obvious what had gone wrong.

172
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.240
And it was really obvious that the,

173
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.670
what had gone wrong wrong was within my control.

174
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.650
Like I simply had not placed enough protection for the difficulty of the

175
00:09:54.651 --> 00:09:58.520
route. Um, it was an easy, easy climbing for me,

176
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.150
but it was really dark. It was cold. It was slippery. And I was like,

177
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.570
I was just going too fast and not placing enough gear.

178
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.270
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

179
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.420
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

180
00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:15.590
they're going to be available everywhere.

181
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:19.160
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

182
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.180
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

183
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:28.250
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Go download Spotify much.

184
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.193
Buh-bye.

185
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:33.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>
