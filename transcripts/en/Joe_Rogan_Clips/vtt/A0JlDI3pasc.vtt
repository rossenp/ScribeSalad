00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.120
<v 0>Everybody for years,</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.840
I had a whole series on my Instagram page of people doing the okay sign.

3
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.920
Of course, including me back when I wa had earrings in the news radio days.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.240
<v 1>And the other thing is we are at a point now where it's more easy to give the</v>

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.040
finger to someone than to say, okay. Yeah. Cause you.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.430
<v 0>You blur the finger out. Nobody cares. Yeah. But if you, you do that, like, oh,</v>

7
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:23.590
what is he doing? What is his, listen, me, he's touching his fingers.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.590
You can't even do like, you're holding a joint.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.070
Cause that's like a white power joint. Like if you're like doing that,

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.830
like a Roach, that's bad. That's bad. How do you,

11
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:37.590
you have to use a Roach. clip&lt;laugh&gt; now it's a ploy by the Roach clip industry.

12
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.910
She was drunk. And I was just trying to avoid her.

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.860
I was just trying to avoid her. I was she trying to avoid her.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.180
And she goes to me, you think you're all fear? Factorta &lt;laugh&gt;

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.340
she got in my face with this thing and the fingers moving.

16
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.380
You think you're all fear. Factora listen, bro. I feel what you're saying.

17
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.900
And I was only around.

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.130
I was feeling of dead space where we're trying to recalibrate our reality due

19
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:09.330
to your circumstances and your story being paradigm.

20
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.010
Chiing Joe, you're up. I'm not that up. &lt;laugh&gt; listen.

21
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.930
I wanna tell you, Matt man, I'm giving you a shout out. I love you. Pressure.

22
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.890
We love you own. We love you too. Oh no.

23
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.320
Gay stuff is a late night podcast and there's a lot of dudes that are listening

24
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:30.080
to this in the shower. &lt;laugh&gt; to bat Ruskin. I didn't do this to be mean.

25
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.560
I just did this because that's my nature. I am the scorpion.

26
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.120
You are the frog. This is how goes down.

27
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.360
Have you ever watcheded a rodeo and felt sorry for the bulls and what?

28
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:47.310
That nothing. So originally Toine was extracted that way.

29
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.630
Okay. But it is an, an ingredient in bulls. Semen. Okay.

30
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.070
So the Toine and red bull probably doesn't come from bullcemen but Toine is in

31
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.070
bullcemen. Okay.

32
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.950
So Hitler was getting his Toine right from the tap from the source.

33
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.060
He suck the bulls stick. Dter the best way is to suck upon it.

34
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.040
Suck the dirt.

35
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.740
You get it from the tap under it is fresh and it's 700% more

36
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.860
potent. The fewers just gets down there. They,

37
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:17.700
they hold the bull back with straps and buckles. It's kicking

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.410
and it Hitler gets this sloppy Nazi mouth right over that oh,

39
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.273
bull hog.

40
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.530
And that is apparently the origin of that upper lip mustache &lt;laugh&gt; that upper

41
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.250
lip must was to catch all the succulent drops when he's choking on Jay's

42
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.423
the flavor save.

43
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.930
And that giant bold Dick is puumbling the back of his throat and fills it up.

44
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.410
That when he comes out of his nose,

45
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.800
the cuz a lot of the JS comes out of his nose.

46
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.560
That's just enough mustache to catch, to catch the JS.

47
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.680
So that's why he had that mustache. A lot of people don't know.

48
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.600
Imagine if women had and men had and we were just really into big to

49
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.480
that's just as possible. That's entirely possible.

50
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.320
Isn't it entirely possible that all these futurists,

51
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:07.480
all these technological innovators, they all see the same end game,

52
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.560
but isn't it entirely possible? I mean like, I mean

53
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.960
it's entirely possible.

54
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.880
I think it's entirely possible that Clintons are murderers.

55
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.230
I think it's entirely possible. And people like John Anthony, west and yourself,

56
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.550
and some other folks like Graham Hancock are proposing that it's entirely

57
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.150
possible that there were many different eras of construction in Egypt.

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.950
&lt;laugh&gt; and it's entirely possible.

59
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.430
And that I think it's entirely possible that Lee Harvey OS walled,

60
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.270
well, you can't be good at everything. Yeah.

61
00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:42.620
That's a fact it's not possible if you had a magic wand and uh,

62
00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:47.060
someone said you could do whatever you want to fix this. What would you do?

63
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.700
You know, like if you were the king of the world, I said, ed,

64
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.780
what are we gonna do? Let's say you become president.

65
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.580
You gonna become president. What do you think? I think we gonna shadow it.

66
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:59.180
Got shot. All right. President Bernie, what do you do? So fascinating. Yeah.

67
00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:02.050
I've always the thought that was fascinating. It really is fascinating.

68
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.730
That's fascinating. There's actually a documentary, a fascinating documentary.

69
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.170
This stuff is so unbelievably fascinating.

70
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.770
It's like I look at things that are fascinating to me.

71
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.090
Absolutely fascinating Roosevelt. Fascinating. I'm fascinated by wolves.

72
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.210
I'm so fascinated by animals. So fascinated. That is a fascinating book.

73
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.120
Alaska fascinating place. The mind is a fascinating solution.

74
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.000
That's fascinating. It's a really fascinating man.

75
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.800
<v 2>Prison doesn't begin and end at the gate. Prison is in mind,</v>

76
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.640
it's locked in one world.

77
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.760
That's dead and dying or it's open to a world that's.

78
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.110
<v 0>Free and a alive, hold on. This guy sounds like me. &lt;laugh&gt; you see? Yeah,</v>

79
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.550
that should sound crazy. Dude. Should have a podcast. Well,

80
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.710
do you know the story of Fritz Haber, right? The guy who will yes. You know,

81
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:51.710
that's one of the, um, really cool things. This Dan Carlin, uh, thing on, um,

82
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.550
uh, on the history of the monol, uh, to the risk of, uh,

83
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:58.190
repeating myself over and over again, which I do all the time. But um,

84
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.870
when you eat marijuana,

85
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.540
it's processed by your liver and it produces something called 11 hydroxy.

86
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.860
Metabolite smell is a weird thing, man.

87
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.780
It's really weird that we all accept that there's some invisible that we can

88
00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:12.660
take in with a hole in our face. &lt;laugh&gt;.

89
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.020
And what I say is the far theory and the far theory is if someone farted and you

90
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.180
couldn't smell it, you'd have no idea that there's something around you.

91
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.450
It's totally completely invisible, but someone farts, you smell it.

92
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.810
But if you didn't have a nose, you'd be just sitting in someone's stench.

93
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.170
How do we not know that there aren't an infinite amount of things that we just

94
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.730
can't detect? I have a, a theory on that. It's called the fart principle.

95
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.210
I have no understanding of how that principle could relate to this,

96
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:40.970
but I'm all ears. Well, this is why this is a bad example.

97
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.000
This is a bad example, but it's not a bad one.

98
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.560
If you fart and you didn't have a nose,

99
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.120
no one would know if we didn't have a sense of smell.

100
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.880
If we didn't have a sense of smell, we could still get along in this light. No,

101
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:52.720
I agree. If there was a way to visually see if food was,

102
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.800
it's not an individual hallucination, they're all seeing. But what I,

103
00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.800
what I'm saying is it's entirely possible that there's multiple dimensions

104
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.280
or multiple things that we can't perceive that we haven't.

105
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.880
We don't have the senses for no, I, I, this pull this, pull this thing,

106
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.280
like right up like a fist from your face. There we go. I always do battle ropes.

107
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.080
Just take a look at how pull this microphone up.

108
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.720
Two face can tell me about a fist from your face. All right. Well,

109
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:19.390
let's basically what? Keep this like a fist from your face. Pull this, uh,

110
00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:22.590
microphone like a fist from your face. There we go. Grab this, uh, micing.

111
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:27.070
Keep it like a fist from your face. That's a good reference point.

112
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:30.390
Is this good? Perfect one. Boom. And we're live,

113
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:32.630
settle on up to that microphone. Young lady,

114
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:34.870
especially the comics where they go when they get that sitcom.

115
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:37.740
Grab that microphone. Oh, sorry buddy. Univers basic income.

116
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:40.100
This is what this is all about. Yes. Yeah.

117
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.060
That's what my campaign for president is all about this it's uh, Springfield,

118
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.220
Missouri pull talking to the microphone. It's in Springfield, Missouri. Yes.

119
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.780
I read the God delusion in, in preparation for this.

120
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.300
Can you pull that microphone right up to your face?

121
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:55.060
Just get it about a fist away from your face. You don't have to move. Okay.

122
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:58.570
The microphone move for you. Okay. Um, yeah. It's by the way,

123
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:01.770
if I've been too far off Mike this whole time. No, you're fine, man. Okay.

124
00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:04.450
We're good. Psychedelics. Give me hope. For real. Yeah, not joking.

125
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.730
It sounds ridiculous because people associate psychedelics with, uh,

126
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.210
with non-reistic things with hallucinations. They, they, they, they,

127
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.530
they don't look at it the way I look at.

128
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.880
<v 3>It. I'm weighing with, okay. Do try it or do I not? Or.</v>

129
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.200
<v 0>Um, you know, if you wanted to do something, what I would recommend is, um,</v>

130
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.040
go to Peru and doing like an iowayaoka retreat. Do one of those after you.

131
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.000
<v 3>Recommended it for me to do iowayaoska I'm sitting at the table one time, Joe,</v>

132
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.400
and I'm people are like, well, why are you down here? You know? I'm like, oh,

133
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.280
well, a good friend of mine had suggested to go. And,

134
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.630
and I had mentioned your name and they're like, but Joe just never done.

135
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.230
Naasska &lt;laugh&gt; and this is before my first drink. And I'm thinking,

136
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.430
what the hell? I just took advice. &lt;laugh&gt; I'm all the way in the Amazon.

137
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.030
<v 0>I'm like, Amber, you should go to Mars. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; like what?</v>

138
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.670
N and dimeethal Tripp to me, which is the active ingredient.

139
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.260
Iyaoska if you've done that, Alex, have you ever done DMT? No. &lt;affirmative&gt;.

140
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.660
Do you want to, you've done regular DMT too, right? Yes.

141
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.780
Does the experience mirror taking synthetic five MEO, DMT?

142
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.340
Did you ever had psychedelic experiences? I had a crazy dream last night.

143
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:13.620
That was, uh, I had DMT trip in my dream.

144
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.980
So if you just fed DMT, uh,

145
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:20.010
synthesized to sheep, it wouldn't be toxic.

146
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.130
What I'm gonna tell you about is your brain produces a chemical while you're

147
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:25.170
sleeping, but I'm gonna,

148
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.250
I'm gonna tell you something and I'm gonna be honest about it. You actually,

149
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.330
the one that, uh, that turned me onto it, the, uh, the DMT,

150
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.650
the story of Moses and the burning Bush to the aacisha Bush and the

151
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:39.930
Keisha tree, which is rich in DMT. You know, once I did, I wanted.

152
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.840
<v 4>To, to do it again and again and again,</v>

153
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.680
and they thought you shouldn't do too much, like, like, wait, I gotta.

154
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.240
<v 0>You know,</v>

155
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.640
I don't think you should listen to the people say you shouldn't do it too much.

156
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.800
I think you should do it as much as you want. That's what I agree with too.

157
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.440
Yeah, I agree. You could handle it. So my whole life,

158
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.000
since I was about my first memories.

159
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.360
<v 5>Were every night was a DMT trip.</v>

160
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.590
So I basically, uh,

161
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.270
I don't want this to sound arrogant. It's not, I've seen everything. Listen,

162
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.110
we all know about Jerry Epstein. Okay. And that I don't.

163
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.190
<v 0>Know about Jerry Stein. That was the, the.</v>

164
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.020
<v 5>Lolita express. Just Google that. And what is that?</v>

165
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.780
Bill Clinton was like on 20 flights first. It was seven. Oh, that's.

166
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.980
<v 0>Right. Okay. Now, now this pedophile.</v>

167
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.500
<v 5>Has a temple in it. And then he was also flying to this,</v>

168
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.140
this middle Eastern country with this chic that's admitted pedophile with,

169
00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:28.860
with multimillion dollar checks and bill Clinton on the plane and bill,

170
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:32.540
Clinton's a known sexual predator. Okay. So all this stuff's going on.

171
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.890
And so they start bringing it lawsuits against Donald Trump with Jane do

172
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.930
claiming he'd been with Epstein, even though there's no proof in the law.

173
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:43.770
Cause they make you log even on private jets. None of it was ever true. So this.

174
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.450
<v 0>Is this place, Bohemian Grove. And the idea was that, uh,</v>

175
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.290
there all the elites would go there and they would engage in these ult rituals

176
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:52.124
is in America.

177
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.960
<v 6>Yeah. There is. There does seem to be amongst the American ruling in the elites.</v>

178
00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:59.400
That does seem to be a proclivity for ritual.

179
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.400
<v 0>So Alex films,</v>

180
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.520
these people worshiping MOIC the oelgon yeah. There's a,

181
00:10:06.521 --> 00:10:09.520
there's a photo of it. There, there it is. This is real. Yeah. I mean,

182
00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:14.480
they really do have a giant owl and they really do burn some sort of a sacrifice

183
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.950
in front of this owl is real, right? Like this isn't like,

184
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.190
you hear things like that, like, well that's nonsense. Right?

185
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.310
<v 6>It's because, you know, we went in separately to, to um,</v>

186
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.070
cuz Alex got it into his head that maybe I was part of the behemian Grove.

187
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.750
<v 0>Oh, you like deep, deep inside. Yeah. Like thewicker man.</v>

188
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.390
<v 6>That I was like luring him. And he would be the one of the belly of the hour.</v>

189
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.260
Oh no. Um, so he went in, separat it to me. He went and found the undergrowth.

190
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.380
<v 0>But when you see that video, you have to go, okay, what is.</v>

191
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:43.890
<v 5>This?</v>

192
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.700
It's been in the newspaper that the cell towers are being used for my control.

193
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.420
That sounds like a schizophrenic.

194
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.140
<v 0>The significance of the research he explained is that although the cell phone</v>

195
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:58.010
power is low electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless have an effect on

196
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:02.170
mental behavior when transmitting at the proper frequency. What is this article?

197
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.410
Jamie signfic American.

198
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.673
<v 5>Okay. Okay.</v>

199
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.770
Remember how I told you we had ABC article in 96 about human animal hybrids with

200
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:11.330
pigs and cows. Yes. So you gotta make you part cows.

201
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:13.050
So the cow keeps you doesn't reject it or.

202
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.883
<v 0>Part pig,</v>

203
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.600
MIT MI T technology review estimates that about 20 per pregnancies of pig,

204
00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:19.440
human or sheep,

205
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:23.240
human chimeeras have been established during the last 12 months in the us total.

206
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.920
I watch in 2016, I, I, a hundred percent believe it. China has made, um,

207
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.920
pig monkey hybrids. Alexs Jones says they're doing pig humans. Yeah,

208
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.040
I bet he is. Right. I bet I'm guarantee. He's right.

209
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.880
<v 5>I've talked to hundreds of people now, not on air,</v>

210
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.870
but I'm gonna make a film on this. Who've taken iowaoska and DMT.

211
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.710
I've not taken it and be for obvious reasons. And,

212
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.870
uh, and it's unbelievable because I mean they,

213
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.560
a hundred percent in San Francisco is the main project site literally have an

214
00:11:55.561 --> 00:11:57.040
alien, uh, base.

215
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.440
And they are literally communicating and they've got like astronaut level people

216
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.840
taking super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things

217
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.280
and making interglactic deals. And.

218
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.360
<v 7>Rick and Andrew have together developed, uh, a technology, uh,</v>

219
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:17.550
for releasing DMT into human volunteers in a very slow drip that

220
00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:21.790
will keep them in the DMT state if they wish for hours on end

221
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.630
&lt;laugh&gt; and, and the intention,

222
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:30.110
the intention is to use this technology to explore and map

223
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.270
the DMT realm. There.

224
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.020
<v 5>Was the it's like 4,000 of 'em. Yeah.</v>

225
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.020
<v 0>There was a lot of Nazi scientists brought over there on YouTube. It says, uh.</v>

226
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.460
<v 8>Operation paper clip was, uh, anywhere from like 1200 to 1500.</v>

227
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.260
<v 5>S search engine. The total number of admitted congressional hearings</v>

228
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.940
in the 1970s.

229
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.260
He operation paper clip Frank Church committee in the seventies released it.

230
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.250
I believe the number 34,200 and something. Hmm. Look it up. That's.

231
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.930
<v 9>Why we grabbed those Nazis. We were like, if we don't get them,</v>

232
00:12:58.931 --> 00:12:59.890
the Russians will I get it?

233
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.010
<v 5>And the Germans, actually, some of their sincientists went to the Russians.</v>

234
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.770
<v 9>Technology operations, all of that was to beat back the Russians.</v>

235
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.410
<v 5>Remember when the Russians tried to build their space shuttle and was half the</v>

236
00:13:10.411 --> 00:13:12.290
size mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. That was actually the German plan.

237
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.720
<v 9>The defector or those who come over from the other side, who we learn from.</v>

238
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.680
And they just disappear into, I mean,

239
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:24.280
they disappear as sort of the CIA's version of witness protection. There's.

240
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.760
<v 5>A lot. Cause like I told you, they gave people severals you pulled it up. But I.</v>

241
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.080
<v 0>It is fascinating. They brought those people over here and that's where the,</v>

242
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.360
the space program came from.

243
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.080
<v 5>It came from, well, that's why I wore the shirt, not as a sick joke.</v>

244
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.430
They already had the CIA that was OSS. Okay.

245
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.190
<v 0>The CIA is OSS. That's.</v>

246
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.070
<v 5>All on record. Okay. I I'm glad you questioned me, but I don't know what pre.</v>

247
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.470
<v 0>Profess or CIA, what is OSS again?</v>

248
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.830
<v 5>Uh, office of special plans, our.</v>

249
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.910
<v 8>Office that was before the CIA and then the CIA.</v>

250
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.710
<v 5>Came up office of.</v>

251
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.670
<v 0>Strategic plan, sort of like, um.</v>

252
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.700
<v 5>Now all of strategic services. What.</v>

253
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.860
<v 0>Is this right here? Are you bringing it up? Jamie?</v>

254
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.380
I guess Jamie pull up some video of Al joelsen in blackface. Right? But since,

255
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:06.580
since you brought up the magical pull up, her maroite find out if that's true.

256
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.020
I need to know. I much prefer yours is too. What the is this? Jamie,

257
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.540
the Korean grandmothers of cell sex. How do you pull these up so quick?

258
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.210
And what, what do you have on yeah.

259
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:21.290
How strange is it that we put like a monetary value on

260
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.650
actual life itself? Mm, wow. It's a,

261
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.690
just such a strange, strange concept. Yeah.

262
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.640
Did you see that guy accidentally hit that moose with his car? No. Holy. Jamie,

263
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.190
pull that video up, pull it up.

264
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.870
Jamie, pull up, pull up. Well, Jamie pull up that video, pull it up.

265
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.120

268
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.240
He has to do it. He has to do it, pull it up, pull it up, pull it up.

269
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.920
<v 0>Jamie, pull that video up.</v>

270
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:14.750
