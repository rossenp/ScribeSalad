00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. If anybody's got the answers.</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 1>It's Chaco gotten the answers.</v>

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.090
<v 2>Oh, uh, I'm not quite so sure about that. I'm not sure how this movie ends.</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.460
<v 3>The dumbest movie. Do you know magic? The gathering is now racist.</v>

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.770
I don't even know what magic the gathering is. Dorky game that the nerds play.

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.530
Oh, sorry. How was it? How is it racist? Um, I don't know.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.160
It was just re I only saw the title of the article that they're trying to cancel

8
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.140
magic. The gathering. I'm like, oh, Christ.

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.360
I thought that thought you guys liked. I thought they liked magic.

10
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:39.560
The gathering. I have. No, everything's, everything's, everything's problematic.

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.190
Everyone's getting canceled. It's amazing how many people did blackface.

12
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.960
<v 2>Yeah. It's very strange. It's very strange.</v>

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.480
It's very strange. I mean, he's on, it was on prime time TV, right? Yeah.

14
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.340
A bunch of times. Yeah. I mean like in the modern world, prime time TV.

15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.650
<v 3>Jimmy Fallon was doing well. He's doing a Chris rock impression,</v>

16
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.340
which by the way, you used to be able to do. When I was in high school,

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.750
my friends were Mr. T for Halloween, nobody gave a. Nobody was like, Jimmy,

18
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.290
what's wrong with you? Everybody's like, oh, you're Mr. T for Halloween.

19
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.850
It was never like a problem. It's very, it's a very strange thing.

20
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.890
You know, like you can do white face. No problem. Here it is. What is his magic?

21
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:22.700
The gathering.

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.280
<v 0>Invoke prejudice card. That's a.</v>

23
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.140
<v 3>It's an enchantment card,</v>

24
00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:31.040
which restricts the casters opponents only using summons that matched the skin

25
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:32.630
color of their opposing creatures.

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.083
<v 1>Huh?</v>

27
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.890
<v 2>This is you. If you brought me on to talk about this, I should leave now about,</v>

28
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.260
about magic, the gathering. And this is why I'm here, man. We're in a bad way.

29
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.990
Shows.

30
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.290
<v 1>How up everything is. Uh, there's a.</v>

31
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.510
<v 2>Lot of thin skin out there right now. Apparently.</v>

32
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.510
<v 3>I just don't. I mean, it seems like a perfect storm.</v>

33
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.960
Like if you wanted to engineer the downfall of society,

34
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.820
you would do it in several steps.

35
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.630
You would have a reality show president where everybody's mad at him.

36
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.130
And then all the liberals get their feathers in a ruffle and everybody gets

37
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:08.630
real, super uptight. And,

38
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.140
and then there's this big divide between the left and the right that's kind of,

39
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.680
you know,

40
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.420
manufactured and then you'd have this disease just lock everyone inside.

41
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.340
Yeah. Unprecedented lock, shut down the economy force people to not work.

42
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.810
So if your business falls apart, you could be the most hardworking diligent,

43
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.110
disciplined person. Who's always at work hour early,

44
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.150
always has your I's dotted and your T's crossed and you still go broke and

45
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:34.984
you're still.

46
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.220
And then you have this George Floyd thing and then boom.

47
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.380
It just ignites the, okay. The.

48
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.280
<v 2>Other thing that you have to wrap around all this is this social media,</v>

49
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.440
which is, you know,

50
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.340
I'm only going to post things that are just going to completely make everyone

51
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:56.450
that sees whatever I'm posting emotional and, and filled with rage.

52
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.270
Whether you're on the left or you're on the right. My goal is to enrage people.

53
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.640
That's the goal. And then that just gets spun up over and over.

54
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.210
So you're taking all these little incidents and you're multiplying times

55
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:09.280
thousands and thousands of views.

56
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.690
<v 1>Now it's an.</v>

57
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.430
<v 2>And, and then on top of that, mainstream media is the same thing, right?</v>

58
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.430
It's not like there's this huge difference between what the mainstream media

59
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.730
shows and what social media. They're both these both almost emotional media,

60
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.820
just trying to make people emotional, which is the worst possible thing.

61
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.520
No one makes good decisions when they're emotional. No,

62
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.560
I spent my adult life trying to train humans to not get emotional in pressure

63
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.370
situations. Why? Because it's going to end up bad every single time,

64
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.400
every single time. And yet that's what our,

65
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.380
that's what our society is based on right now.

66
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.040
But it's based on these emotional reactions. Yeah, because.

67
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.360
<v 3>Of social media, I think.</v>

68
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:49.560
And because of things like YouTube and user created content where anybody can

69
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:50.820
kind of make videos.

70
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.800
So many things are vying for folks' attention that mainstream media

71
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.020
has resorted to click baity cut type.

72
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.890
Whether it's a New York times articles, which you know,

73
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.470
used to be beyond reproach, that there they've gone,

74
00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:06.570
social justice warrior and click baity.

75
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.540
And all these other websites are a hundred percent click baity.

76
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.250
That's the only way they can get people to pay attention.

77
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.230
Like I saw like the dumbest article, I couldn't believe how dumb it was.

78
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.790
It was an article on Ozark is like, has Ozark been canceled?

79
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.060
And I'm like, they canceled that show. That shows amazing.

80
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.470
So then I click on the article.

81
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.630
The entire article is about a guy who couldn't find season one

82
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:35.610
on Ozark because there was a glitch and then he found it. And so it's not.

83
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.560
So the whole article was just, but they got me. They get everybody.

84
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.760
<v 2>They got their advertising dollars because they can show the engagement with</v>

85
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.750
them. Exactly.

86
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.890
<v 3>Well, here's a good one.</v>

87
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.930
CNN showed a guy got shot yesterday in San Bernardino.

88
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.120
Um, a Hispanic man got shot in San Bernandino. So that's the title.

89
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.640
The title of the article is Hispanic.

90
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:02.340
Man gets gunned down by the police in San Bernardino.

91
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.680
What they leave out is the guy had a gun and was shooting at the cops.

92
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.480
So this guy's got a gun there's photos of this gentleman with a gun.

93
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.960
And there's a cop on his knees about the shoot, that guy,

94
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.740
the guy standing in front of a gas station. There's gas pumps. I mean,

95
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:23.580
I maybe felt like they wouldn't shoot at him because the gas tanks were right

96
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.330
behind him. The pumps were right behind him, but why would they leave that out?

97
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.860
Guy with gun in gunfight with cops dies is the right

98
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.160
title. Not Hispanic man gunned down by cops.

99
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:39.540
Like they're literally trying to incite anger and violence.

100
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:43.680
They know that you read that and you say Hispanic man shot by cops.

101
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:46.710
Like these mother they're murderers. They won't stop.

102
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.400
And they leave out this picture of this man with a gun pointing it.

103
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.640
<v 2>You're looking at me like, I'm going to say some kind of really profound answer.</v>

104
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:59.120
I got nothing for you because, because of your you're exactly right.

105
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.680
That what is, what do they set up that headline for it's outrage, people,

106
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.270
anyone that actually opens it up and reads,

107
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.240
it would actually probably say something like, Hmm,

108
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.870
sounds like the cops did a good job on that one and killed a bad guy before he

109
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.800
blew up a gas station in her. It killed a bunch of innocent people, but that's,

110
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.650
that's obviously not that I think if you try to write a headline,

111
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:23.090
the other way of how these heroic cops face, man, with gun,

112
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.180
eliminate him before he can cause terror in this neighborhood,

113
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.040
that would be a nice headline to read,

114
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.180
but you're not going to see it not today because it's not going to drive enough

115
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:33.014
people crazy.

116
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.480
<v 3>Today. If your wife tweets all lives matter,</v>

117
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.460
you can get sh you can get fired. You doesn't even have to be you anymore.

118
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.260
All lives matter.

119
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.940
Just imagine the time we're saying all lives matter is so

120
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.100
controversial that you could get fired.

121
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.580
<v 2>Didn't that happen to a soccer player or something? Yeah. Yes.</v>

122
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.190
<v 3>A soccer player. His wife tweeted, something like that.</v>

123
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.150
Yeah. The guy who runs the Kings or the guy,

124
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:06.190
who's the commentator for the Kings, they fired him.
