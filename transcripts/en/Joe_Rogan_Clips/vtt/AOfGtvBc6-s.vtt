WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.800
<v 0>It's very generosity. Um, are you, are you,</v>

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.560
you suing the Southern poverty law center? Is that what's going on?

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.840
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, I in fact have an update for everybody cuz uh, you know,</v>

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.080
we crowdfunded, uh,

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.400
a lot of the early costs for the case against the Southern poverty center.

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.880
<v 0>What did they do? What is it? What is the, yeah, let me back up a please.</v>

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.550
<v 1>Um, uh, once upon a time, uh, yours truly a British Muslim,</v>

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.430
uh, of Pakistani origin was listed in the United Kingdom on the

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.390
Thompson reuteers world check database under a category red terrorism

10
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.350
designation while at the same time being listed across the Atlantic

11
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.750
in the United States,

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.340
by the Southern poverty law center to as an anti-musli extremist.

13
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.660
So I was both a Muslim terrorist and an anti-musli extremist,

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.740
according to two separate lists.

15
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.820
And of course that speaks to some of the polarization in our times in how

16
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.860
irrational this conversation around extremism Islam integration Muslims in the

17
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:02.210
west has become, I sued Thom Reuter's world. The database,

18
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:05.890
this database is no joke. It's like HSBC and, and many,

19
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:08.810
many other banks use this database, uh,

20
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:11.810
for background checks on where clients can have a bank account with them.

21
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:16.210
So as a result of, for example, Thomson Reuters and their database, uh quum,

22
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:20.450
which is a counter extremism organization I founded 10 years ago had its bank

23
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:24.440
account shut down in the United States because of the Thom reute' world check

24
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.120
database system that HSBC subscribes to anyway, we sued them,

25
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.480
they paid damages, they issued an apology and they, uh, uh, uh,

26
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.280
took my name off this, uh,

27
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.800
terrorism designation list they have on their world check database, uh, Maja.

28
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.080
<v 2>I think you, maybe you should back up further and just give the,</v>

29
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:45.350
your kind of your sh short form bio in terms of why would you ever be on a

30
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.390
terroris sure watch list.

31
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.350
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I'll I'll do that. Um, but at the same time,</v>

32
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.470
the Southern poverty law center had, had listed me, as I said,

33
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:55.590
as an antimos extremist. So we are also, uh, taking legal action, uh,

34
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:58.230
against them. And, um, I, I will get to your point, but I think,

35
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.470
just wanna say that the I've just, uh, held a law firm on retainer,

36
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:06.260
Claire lock and they were the ones that sued the rolling stone magazine for that

37
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:10.420
college rape campus scandal. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Um, successfully got, uh,

38
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.700
won that case, Claire Locke, which is, uh,

39
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:15.420
an announcement made here exclusively with you. No one else knows this yet.

40
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.380
We have retained clairelocke, uh,

41
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:21.620
they are writing to the Southern poverty law center as we speak. Um,

42
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.450
I think they've got wind of it, the Southern poverty law center, as of,

43
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.010
I think either yesterday or the day before they've removed the entire list,

44
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:31.610
that's been up there for two years. I know they've removed the entire list,

45
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:33.890
which also had Aon herceali on it. Um,

46
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.730
and it's no longer available on their website.

47
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.370
<v 0>Now, is there logic that if you are a critic of Islam,</v>

48
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.890
of radical fundamentalist Islam,

49
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:46.920
that you are somehow or another or racist extremist that, so.

50
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400
<v 1>That's pretty much what they've said. If you criticize Islam, um,</v>

51
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.640
AAN myself who have come from within the community yes.

52
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:57.960
Who have had that experience that somehow that makes us anti-Muslim, um,

53
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.840
there are a number of logical errors involved in that logical leap that they've

54
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:03.674
made. Do they have.

55
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.040
<v 0>Any distinction? Is there,</v>

56
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:08.560
is there anything that they write that sort of points to why they would say

57
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.360
that? Uh.

58
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.320
<v 1>One of them, honestly, the reasons they listed, one of them was that I had a,</v>

59
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
a bachelor party in a strip club a year before I got married.

60
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.870
<v 0>That makes you an anti-musle extreme IST.</v>

61
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.430
<v 1>That was one of the reasons listed.</v>

62
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.723
<v 0>Why.</v>

63
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.470
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; oh, the nine 11 hijackackers weren't a strip strip club on nine 10.</v>

64
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.390
Right. So.

65
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.670
<v 0>That was that, that real, they really listed that they.</v>

66
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.471
<v 1>Actually listed that,</v>

67
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.550
which is part of the reason why we can prove malice because what has that gone

68
00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:35.470
to do with anything that.

69
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.950
<v 0>But that doesn't yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah. So that was the,</v>

70
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.100
that was a primary reason. It was one.

71
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.100
<v 1>Of the three main reasons they origin listed. And another one was again false.</v>

72
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.300
Uh, they claimed that I had called for the criminalization of the face veil for

73
00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:52.340
Muslim women in the west, which wasn't true.

74
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.940
I had called for a policy to be adopted where in banks and airports,

75
00:03:56.941 --> 00:03:59.460
where you are not allowed to wear a motorcycle helmet, I,

76
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.530
you also shouldn't be allowed to cover your, a face in the name of religion,

77
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.890
which is very different to calling for the criminalization per se of the face

78
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:07.131
fail.

79
00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:09.930
That's like saying you're not allowed to wear a motorcycle helmet in a bank.

80
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:13.170
So I believe in the criminalization of motorcycle helmets, it's just absurd.

81
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.010
Yeah, it's ridiculous. Um, so it was a mischaracterization of my, um, opinion,

82
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.970
the article. So it's two. Yep. And the other one, uh, the, the, the,

83
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.960
the reason they, I can't even, because they kept changing their reasons,

84
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.920
the actual website has been, um, we've got the archive and, and it's been,

85
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:30.520
they've been changing it each time people have been pointing out the stupidity

86
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:31.920
of their allegations. Now, why.

87
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920
<v 0>Do they, what is the Southern poverty law center?</v>

88
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.080
<v 2>I mean, this is a painful irony because if you roll back the clock now,</v>

89
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:42.630
you know, 20 or some odd years, the, their reasons to exist were great. I mean,

90
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.623
th this was the,

91
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.910
the flagship organization that was suing the KKK mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

92
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.230
you know, sovereign citizens and just the, the far right, you know,

93
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:55.750
white nationalist, Christian nationalist movements in the us, and in,

94
00:04:55.751 --> 00:05:00.390
in some cases to great effect and their, and their concern,

95
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:01.740
obviously about, you know,

96
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.100
extremist hate groups in the us was totally valid. And I mean,

97
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.540
it was, it became, I mean, now, now that we see how morally confused they are,

98
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:13.660
people have been shining a light on them and they, and they've,

99
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.380
they're this bloated organization that's been taken in way too much money.

100
00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:20.500
And they're, I mean, it's not, it, it suffers from other signs of,

101
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.850
of corruption or, or conflicts of interest. But back in the day,

102
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.170
you know, Morris D's was, you know,

103
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:31.370
bringing the KKK to court and bankrupting their various chapters and that all

104
00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:35.970
that looked fantastic. And now the social justice warrior, moral panic,

105
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.330
uh, moral stupidity virus has gotten into their brains.

106
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.000
And they can't differe someone like mod from a

107
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.960
right wing Christian neo-Nazi hater of

108
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.360
Islam. Right. Or hater of, of, of, you know, people from the middle east. Uh,

109
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.000
and, and so it is with iion, herrsaiian,

110
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.520
I'm now the ironically you're off the website now I'm on it.

111
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.400
I think I'm on it in a, in a far more transitory way. But the, the,

112
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.360
the article that was written about my podcast with Charles Murray by V hit the

113
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.760
Southern property law center hate watch page. And so there,

114
00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:16.360
you had articles about neo-Nazi groups, articles about the Austin Bond,

115
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.990
and then me and, and my podcast with Charles Murray.

116
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.870
<v 0>I definitely want to talk about that. Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:24.470
But I wanna give people your background first. Sure.

118
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.870
The reason why you were on the list in the UK in the first place had to do with

119
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.590
your actual background. Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

120
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.190
<v 1>So, so I was born and raised in Essex in the United Kingdom,</v>

121
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.220
and I came of age in what I now I'll refer to as the bad old days of racism in

122
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:43.140
the United Kingdom, much has changed since then for the good, but in those days,

123
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.260
uh, there were, uh, serious, um, uh, uh, uh,

124
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.220
cases of violent racism that I faced, uh, hammer attacks,

125
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:53.060
machete attacks by actual Neo Nazis. I mean, I've grown up,

126
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.020
this is the irony of this Southern poverty law center listing.

127
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.210
I've grown up fighting Neo he's on the streets,

128
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:01.010
and they've been attacking me with hammers and machetes because of the color of

129
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.370
my skin. And youve got a bunch of white guys in Alabama, uh,

130
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.890
designating me in the same breath as they would designate,

131
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:09.210
designate these Neo Nazis,

132
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.930
but that when I grew up and having that experience being, um,

133
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.850
falsely arrested by Essex police on a number of occasions profiled while the

134
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.480
genocide in Bosnia was on unfolding against Muslims in Bosnia. Um,

135
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.360
I often say to an American audience, when I'm speaking about this,

136
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.840
we are now here with you on the west coast,

137
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.680
in this beautiful new studio you have. Congratulations. Thank you. Um,

138
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.720
and imagine a genocide was unfolding on the east coast against a,

139
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.320
a group of people with whom you identified,

140
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.960
and even if it's just on a human level human beings, but, you know,

141
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:41.310
even within in that a community identification would impact you in a way,

142
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.190
for example, if you defined yourself as, uh, Jewish,

143
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.750
and there was a genocide against Jews on the other side of this very continent

144
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.990
of this very country, how it would impact you on, on the west coast. Um,

145
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:55.070
well Sara, over Sara, Ava from London,

146
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.980
it takes us less time to fly from London to Bosnia than it does from York to LA.

147
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.500
And so it really had a profound impact on Muslims across Europe when that

148
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:05.820
genocide was unfolding and, and things were never the same. Again,

149
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:08.140
it radicalized an entire generation. Of course,

150
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.740
ideology had a lot to do with that,

151
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:14.020
but the anger originally came from the genocide. So at the age of 16,

152
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.900
what with, uh, the domestic racism and the, uh, situation in,

153
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:22.650
in Bosnia unfolding as it did, I joined, uh, hisboalard, which is a,

154
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.290
uh, uh, a non-terrorist still legal in America and in Britain and across Europe,

155
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.090
uh, Islamist organization,

156
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.930
it was the first of the global Islamist organizations that aspired to resurret

157
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:38.010
the notion of aaliphate, uh, which we've subsequently seen to, uh,

158
00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:42.040
great damaging effect in the form of ISIS fate. Um, and, uh,

159
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.160
their method of coming to power was by infiltrating militaries in Muslim

160
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.240
majority countries, uh, recruiting army officers, and then instigating military,

161
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.760
cos whether that be in Turkey, in Pakistan, in Egypt,

162
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.560
these are the countries they, they targeted. Um,

163
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.080
and their aim would be to then through the military coup set up this caliphate,

164
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:03.160
which would then be an expansionist caliphate, uh, and would conquer the world.

165
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.800
I mean, that's, it sounds crazy. That's what they believe.

166
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.080
And that's what they're very, very serious and intent on bringing about.

167
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.600
And now people, when I say that, believe me,

168
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.320
cuz they've seen the ISIS experiment unfold,

169
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.590
but I joined a group that sought to do that. Um,

170
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:22.110
through non- terroristic means at the age of 16, I ended,

171
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.310
ended up on the leadership of that organization in the UK, uh,

172
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:29.710
ended up co-founding that group in Pakistan in 1999 where I went, I left the UK,

173
00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:32.430
went to Pakistan, um, was among the first,

174
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.950
the Vanguard of British Pakistani members that,

175
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.860
and out there to set the group up, uh, they've been about three or four, uh,

176
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.180
C Plotts in Pakistan,

177
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.340
since an army officers have been arrested for being members of this group.

178
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:48.300
And many of them still in jail. Um, I spent a year in Pakistan, went back, um,

179
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.700
while studying for my degree in the university of London, uh, would fly Monday,

180
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.300
uh, would fly on Saturdays and Sundays to Copenhagen in Denmark.

181
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.250
I co-founded the Danish Pakistani chapter of this group.

182
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.810
And then the third year of my degree, cause I was doing law in Arabic, um, uh,

183
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.370
resulted in me having to go to an Arab country for the language year.

184
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.290
And so I chose Egypt and, uh, a day before the nine 11 attacks in 2001,

185
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.490
I ended up in Egypt.

186
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.240
I went to Alexandria enrolled in the university of Alexandria to study for the

187
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:20.920
year of, uh, Arabic language, which was the third year of my degree. Um,

188
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.200
of course nine 11 happened and the climate changed,

189
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.400
the security climate changed all over the world.

190
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.240
Something we didn't know about nor predicted. And on the first of, uh,

191
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.720
um, April, 2002,

192
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.910
my house in Alexandria was raided by the Egyptian states of security.

193
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.670
I was blindfolded, my hands were tied behind my back.

194
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.470
I was then driven through the desert into Cairo to the dungeon of the state

195
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.230
security headquarters, um, in a building known as, uh, as, uh aljiaz,

196
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.230
which is the main headquarters of Amina dollar, the internal state security.

197
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.590
Uh, we were held in the Dungeons there for four days and they electrocuted, um,

198
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.740
most of the prisoners that they had there, um, tortured them, interrogated them.

199
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.060
On the fourth day, I was taken to a, a prison known as Mazara,

200
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.860
uh, in Cairo, um,

201
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.780
put into solitary confinement for about three and a half months,

202
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.180
then charged eventually sentenced to five years as a political prisoner under

203
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.050
the egyptianed agency law, um, and served my full sentence there in Egypt,

204
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.450
uh, eventually left prison in 2006 in returned to the UK. So.

205
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.490
<v 2>So did, did amnesine international get you out at.</v>

206
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.890
<v 1>All or, or they just, no, they only took an interest in you, you were coming.</v>

207
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.730
So they can'tcampaign for my release and nobody got me out cause that had to

208
00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:39.120
finish my full prison sentence. Right. Um, but at what changed me and,

209
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.960
and led to me to be the man that sits before you today is you're right, Sam,

210
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.880
uh, Amnesty's uh, adoption of me and, and,

211
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.080
and a few others in the case as prisoners of conscience.

212
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.000
And they took the very brave and bold step. Now looking back at it,

213
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.000
because keep in mind the context there.

214
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.000
This is Bush was president Tony Blair was prime minister and we were in the

215
00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:00.320
thick of the war and terror.

216
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.360
We were in the middle of it and am amnesy comes along and says,

217
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.840
we disagree with everything this guy stands for,

218
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.400
but they don't believe in using violence to bring their caliphate about.

219
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.270
And so we will defend their rights to say stupid things and they shouldn't be in

220
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:16.350
prison. They certainly shouldn't have been tortured for it. So, um,

221
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.870
amnesty adopted us as prisoners of conscience and I was 24 years old at the

222
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:21.430
time, by the way. So everything I've just described,

223
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:23.910
you happened to me up until the age of 24 when I was in prisoned.

224
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.510
And it was the first time in my relatively young life. I'm 14 now. Right.

225
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.403
And, uh,

226
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:35.340
I had never been defended by any main stream pillar of mainstream society

227
00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:38.140
in that way before nobody had spoken out for me. And that had a,

228
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.860
a real huge kind of emotional impact on my psyche. Um,

229
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.980
I've said in my, um, autobiography that where the heart leads,

230
00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:47.814
the mind can follow.

231
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.700
And so I was now willing to consider alternatives because of Amnesty's work

232
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.210
campaigning for me. And so I spent the next four years in prison, uh, reading,

233
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.410
uh, rereading all well. Uh, every one of his, uh, books, reading token, reading,

234
00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:04.050
classic English, literature, studying Islamic theology,

235
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.850
really trying to understand the world around me. Um,

236
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.050
and I had four years to do so.

237
00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:12.290
And I spent four years debating and discussing with, um,

238
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.970
pretty much the founders of edits,

239
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.400
main jihadist organizations who were in jail with me in this same prison,

240
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.400
including the assassins or the former president,

241
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.080
an Sadat who had been killed in 1981 because of his peace deal with Israel and

242
00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:27.160
his assassins were in jail with me and they'd been in prison longer than I'd

243
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:27.900
been alive.

244
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.160
And so they had some collective years of wisdom between them and most of those

245
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.200
jihadist prisoners, I was in jail with had over the course of those years,

246
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.550
two decades and more changed their views and reformed.

247
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.070
There were still conservative religious Muslims, something, which I'm not. Um,

248
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.470
and I never, I don't claim to be in my, in my work at the moment. Um,

249
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.390
but they were still religious Muslims, but they were no longer, um, extremists.

250
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.510
And they were no longer what I call Islamists people that sought to implement

251
00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:58.380
their version of Islam over society. And so they, uh,

252
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.620
in four years of constant debate and discussion with them, um,

253
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.300
people that I knew had more wisdom than me they've been in jail for longer than

254
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.260
I've been alive. Um, I, my views began slowly changing.

255
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.380
I read a lot of the books they wrote about changing their own views and why they

256
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:14.940
changed. And, uh, upon my release, uh, I, I, I,

257
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.690
a good few months after my release, I,

258
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.010
I had to leave the organization cause I no longer believed in an ideology that I

259
00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:22.490
was once.

260
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.250
<v 0>Prepared to die for. That is fascinating that the shift came about in jail,</v>

261
00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:27.650
speaking with assassins.

262
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.290
<v 1>Among many others.</v>

263
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.130
<v 0>Yeah. That, I mean, that is really incredible.</v>

264
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.730
You would think that most people think that when someone goes to jail,

265
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.960
usually whatever criminality that they have in them is cemented in hardened.

266
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.360
<v 1>Yeah. I'm I,</v>

267
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.240
I don't know why mine is an exceptional case cuz most people you're right.

268
00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:45.280
Whether you look at sad, kuup,

269
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:47.840
who's known as the founding father of modern dejihadism.

270
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.880
He started off like me a non-terrorist Islamist, but in Egypt, jails, in fact,

271
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:54.000
the very jail I was held in,

272
00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:57.960
he was tortured and he ended up becoming the godfather of modern day terrorism,

273
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.080
um, through his book milestones or my in, in Arabic.

274
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.840
And yet that in my case, for whatever reason, you know, it,

275
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.670
I kind of went that bit further to question everything I believe in. Um,

276
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.350
but that's not normal Mo in most cases, when you torture people in jail, it,

277
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.310
it ends up hardening and osifying that ideology and people become as angry

278
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.230
as you know, they become the monster that they were seeking to defeat.

279
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.430
<v 0>So you get outta jail. What do you do then? So.</v>

280
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:31.260
<v 1>I, I, uh, left the group in 2007 and by 2008 in January. So I finished degree.</v>

281
00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:34.020
I had one year left of my undergraduate degree. I, I graduated,

282
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.620
I did my masters at the London school of economics in political theory.

283
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.940
And while doing the masters set up Quium and Quium, uh, we,

284
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.900
we bill as the world's first counter extremism organization, it was meant to be,

285
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.460
uh, we believe it is bringing us back to the SLC's allegation,

286
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.010
a Muslim response to extremism from people that have lived it and been through

287
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:59.770
it. Um, my co-founders were Islamists themselves who changed like me, uh,

288
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.810
Muslims born and raised, uh,

289
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.490
come from the community to have a community based response,

290
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.330
a Muslim response to this growing problem of extremism.

291
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.320
And this was 10 years ago and course ISIS emerged since then a only

292
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:14.480
demonstrating why this kind of response was needed.

293
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.440
And so for the Southern poverty law center to designate somebody with my

294
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:19.520
background, with that trajectory,

295
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.080
with somebody who was prepared to die for this cause, um, a a,

296
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.720
and so somebody who wanted to address these problems as a Muslim,

297
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.120
uh, to call for reform for the good of my communities,

298
00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:33.350
as opposed to against them, you know, at the end of the day,

299
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:37.710
it can only benefit Muslim communities. If extremism is put back in its box, um,

300
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.470
for them to then list someone like me as an anti- Muslim Extrem, it,

301
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.750
it just really does. I think,

302
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:45.830
shine a light on the true absurdity of the situation we find ourselves in, uh.

303
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.310
<v 0>Absurdity and the,</v>

304
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:52.270
the lack of real investigation or backing up

305
00:16:52.271 --> 00:16:55.300
their claims with actual facts yeah. And information.

306
00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.020
And that brings me to your story with Charles Murray and VX and Ezra Klein.

307
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.700
Well's.

308
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.620
<v 2>Linger here for a moment. Sure. It's the same problem,</v>

309
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.580
but not only is it a lack of investigation, but when it gets pointed out,

310
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.940
I mean, I forgot the, the guy's name of the S SPLC who was quarterbacking this,

311
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.610
but it wasn't more as D's, but it was someone high up at mark it potik or the.

312
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.650
<v 1>The CEO, uh, something Cohen, I think is that.</v>

313
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.930
<v 2>Uh, I thought it was mark pot. Anyways, he's listed in the,</v>

314
00:17:21.931 --> 00:17:26.770
he's named in the Atlantic article at first, put this on our radar, but he,

315
00:17:26.771 --> 00:17:28.290
they just double down. I mean, the,

316
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.690
the error cannot be pointed out clearly enough to trigger. I mean,

317
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.920
much less an apology, a any modulation of, of the claim. They just,

318
00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:42.680
people just double down in the face of obvious counter evidence. And that's,

319
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:48.080
it's, it's just not about a sincere engagement with the problem. And there's,

320
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:51.600
and there's this, there's so many variables here that make it,

321
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:55.200
make it a really toxic environment. But one is that the, the,

322
00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.200
the locus of concern is never the individual. It is the group,

323
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.160
it's the tribe. And so you can, it's like,

324
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.800
they'll sacrifice any number of individuals to make the political

325
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:11.270
case they want to make. Uh, so they, they don't, they're completely,

326
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.950
unreented when they're shown to get it wrong. And so, and,

327
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.830
and in your case and an Ion's case, it's just such a,

328
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.910
such a grievous moral lapse,

329
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.350
because not only is it is the attack on you illegitimate,

330
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.310
it actually raises yours, your security concerns mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it,

331
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.620
it, it, it becomes a, a reference point for journalists who are confused,

332
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.300
who can't follow the plot, or don't have the time to, to fact check everything.

333
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.740
It makes you radio actor from the point of view of mainstream journalists,
