00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How do you get it journalism back on track?</v>

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.910
Is it possible at this point? I mean, is it is a lost art,

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.620
is it going to be like calligraphy? I mean, yeah.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.290
<v 1>Right. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. The Japanese calligraphy, right.</v>

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.730
You have to pass it down through masters and maybe that's,

6
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:20.390
that's going to be able to have journalism. It's like, I mean,

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.070
and then there's two things that could happen. One is that like,

8
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.760
if you created something like neither side news right now, right. And just like,

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.070
uh, that's a great name. Yeah.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.860
Like a network where it was a bunch of people who just kind of did the job

11
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.190
without the editorializing. I think it would have,

12
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.150
it would probably have a lot of followers right away. It would make money.

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.540
And nobody has clued into that yet. Like if,

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.610
if some canny entrepreneur were to do that and that we're to bring back the

15
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:48.560
business that, or, you know,

16
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:51.950
journalism has always been kind of quasi subsidized in this country, you know,

17
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:55.910
going back to the pony express, newspapers were carried free across to the west,

18
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:59.540
right? The us postal service said that the original 19,

19
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.100
the communications act of 1934, the idea was, you know, we,

20
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:05.510
you could lease the public airways,

21
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:09.380
but you had to do something in the public interests. So you,

22
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.630
you could make money doing sports and entertainment,

23
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:13.490
but you could take a loss on news.

24
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:16.460
And so it was kind of quasi subsidized in that way,

25
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.030
but that doesn't exist anymore. There's no subsidy really for news anymore.

26
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.390
I'm not in a story short. I agree with that, that being the way to go,

27
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.310
but there has to be something because right now the financial pressure to be bad

28
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.250
is just too is too great. You know, like there's no,

29
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.360
there's no way to sorry to go on this. But I came,

30
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.660
when I came from the business, when the money started getting tighter,

31
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:42.350
the first thing they got rid of where the long form investigative reporters,

32
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.740
like you couldn't just hire somebody to work on a story for three months anymore

33
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:47.990
because you needed them to do content all the time.

34
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.690
Then they got rid of the fact checkers, you know,

35
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.300
which had another serious problem, you know? And,

36
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.650
and so now the money is so tight that he just had these people doing clickbait

37
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.080
all the time and they're not doing real reporting.

38
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:02.960
And so they have to fix the money problem. I don't know how they would.

39
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.800
<v 0>Do that though. How much has it changed recently? Because like when that piece,</v>

40
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:07.190
that you,

41
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.240
the stuff that you wrote about the banking crisis was my favorite coverage of it

42
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.641
and the,

43
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:15.500
the most relatable and understandable and the way you spelled everything out.

44
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.080
Um, could you do that today?

45
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.310
<v 1>Yeah, but I think it would be harder because that's not that long ago,</v>

46
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.430
it's it really is. And it's only, you know, that was,

47
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.870
I really stopped doing that in like 2014 or so five years out.

48
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.660
But the, the big differences, uh,

49
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:37.130
social media has had a huge impact on attention span. So, you know,

50
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:40.970
I was writing like 7,000 word articles about credit,

51
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:42.410
default swaps and stuff like that.

52
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.110
I was trying really hard to make it interesting for people, you know,

53
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.750
you use jokes and humor and stuff like that,

54
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.400
but now people would not have the energy to really fight through that.

55
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.510
You'd have to make it shorter. Um, even TV, you know, they,

56
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.420
people, you don't see that kind reporting that in depth. Yeah.

57
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.250
Kind of process reporting where you teach,

58
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.090
where you're teaching people something, because people just tune out right away.

59
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.540
Like they need just a quick, hit a headline on a couple of facts.

60
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.470
So yeah, there's a big problem with audience, right? We've,

61
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.240
we've trained audiences to consume the news differently and all they really want

62
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.550
to get as a take. Now, you know, it's like the,

63
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.430
everything's like an ESPN hot take. Right. You know, so that's the counter.

64
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.180
<v 0>To that though. Is this what we're doing right now? Like,</v>

65
00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:34.200
these are always these long conversations, they're hours and hours long,

66
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.090
and there's a bunch of them out there now.

67
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:40.080
It's not like mine is an isolated one and there's so many podcasts that cover

68
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:43.140
and some of them can cover them, like in a serial form. Like, um,

69
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.550
the dropout was that there was other call that yes,

70
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.960
it was the dropout was the one about that woman who created that fake blood

71
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.380
company. Yes. Right. Susan, what was her name?

72
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.840
Elizabeth. What is her name?

73
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.940
Elizabeth Hall. That's right. That's right. Theranose yeah. The,

74
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:11.640
the completely fraudulent company. That was an amazing podcast. Absolutely.

75
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.960
That if I read it, I probably you're right. I probably would have like a boring,

76
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.000
right. I probably would have abandoned it earlier,

77
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:20.010
but listening to it in podcast form,

78
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.130
listening to actual conversations from these people,

79
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.160
listening to people's interpretations of these conversations,

80
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.090
listening to people that were there at the time telling, you know,

81
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.340
telling stories about when they knew things were weird.

82
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.620
And when they started noticing the,

83
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.460
the there's like tests that were incorrect,

84
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.080
that they were covering up that kind of.

85
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.020
Like you can do that now with something like this.

86
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:46.380
And I think that one of the good things about podcasts too,

87
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:50.250
is you don't need anybody to tell you that you could,

88
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.540
you could publish this.

89
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.110
<v 1>Yeah, no abs absolutely. I think you're you're right.</v>

90
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:57.420
And I think the formats,

91
00:04:57.421 --> 00:05:01.740
like this reveal that the news companies are wrong about,

92
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.650
uh, about some things about audiences. Like they,

93
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.070
they think that people can't handle an in-depth discussion about things.

94
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.880
They think that audiences only want to watch 30 seconds of something they don't

95
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.540
they're, they're interested. They, they, they do have curiosity about things.

96
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.640
It's just, uh, it's very difficult to con convince people in the news business,

97
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:24.410
especially to take chances on that kind of content. You know, they'll,

98
00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:28.800
they'll do it for a podcast. They'll do it for a documentary. But, um,

99
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.990
but for, for the news, they just,

100
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.720
they're making things shorter and shorter and shorter. You know,

101
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:36.210
I was really lucky to have an editor who I, you know,

102
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.560
understood the idea that we have to get into this in depth.

103
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.080
There also it's going to be meaningless to people. Right. Um,

104
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.900
that's pretty rare, you know, for the most part, they,

105
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.170
you don't see them taking that kind of bet anymore,

106
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:51.600
but maybe podcasts will help people, punk puncture that.

107
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.760
But the flip side of that is that they're not,

108
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.460
they're not investing in stuff like, um,

109
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.610
like international news in the way they used to, like,

110
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.650
when I came up in the business, every bureau, uh,

111
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.640
every big network had bureaus in every major city around the world, you know,

112
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.710
Rome, Berlin, Moscow, whatever it is. Right.

113
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:12.290
And they had newsrooms full of people who are, you know,

114
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.890
out there gathering news. Now there's none of that. Right.

115
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920
Because they figured out they can make the money just as easily by having

116
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:23.270
somebody sitting in an office in Washington or New York and just,

117
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.460
you know, link to something and have a take on something, you know? So the,

118
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.240
I think the news is getting worse. Podcasts are getting more interesting. Maybe,

119
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.030
maybe there's a happy medium. They can find in between, well.

120
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.400
<v 0>As well, documentaries are commercially viable. If it's a great subject, like,</v>

121
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.510
um, like a good examples that wild, wild country one, or, you know,

122
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:47.860
I didn't even know that that cult existed. I had no idea what,

123
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.720
what happened up there. And then, so this, this documentary sheds light on it.

124
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:55.090
It does it over, like, I think it was like six episodes or something like that.

125
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:57.580
It's amazing. And it made a ton of money.

126
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.850
<v 1>Yeah. Or making a murderer was another one. If it was really good, like they,</v>

127
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.940
you take, because that's something that happens all over the place.

128
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:06.220
You have these criminal justice cases and they're, you know,

129
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.330
terrible and justice has happened. Um, and you know, if you,

130
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.160
she really tell the whole story and make characters out of people and invest the

131
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:17.050
time and energy to, to tell it, tell it, well,

132
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:21.460
people still like really good storytelling. Um, but, uh,

133
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.240
but I think within the news business, they just, they have this belief they're,

134
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.560
hard-headed belief that people can't handle difficult material.

135
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:32.920
And I don't know why that is, you know? Yeah. I don't know why it is either.

136
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.170
<v 0>It's. I mean,</v>

137
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:39.640
I think there's a large number of people that aren't satisfied intellectually by

138
00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:41.650
a lot of the stuff they're being spoonfed.

139
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.690
And they think that because the vast majority of things that are

140
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.720
commercially viable are short attention, span things.

141
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.690
I think it's like this real sloppy way of thinking.

142
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:55.170
Non-risk taking way of thinking. They're like, well,

143
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.130
this is how people consume things.

144
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.390
You got to give them like a music video style editing, or they just tune out.

145
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.640
But there's always been a thirst for actual long form conversations.

146
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.140
You don't an actual real in-depth exploration of something in a,

147
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:12.520
in a very digestible way.

148
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:15.730
Like one of the good things about doing your podcast or this podcast,

149
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.730
any podcast really is that you can listen to it while you're commuting.

150
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.751
You listened to it.

151
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:23.830
And it'll actually give you something that occupies your mind and interests you

152
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:26.260
during what would normally be dead time. Right?

153
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.190
<v 1>Yeah. And, and you're absolutely right about the,</v>

154
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.690
the thirst for something else. And again,

155
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:38.560
I think when people turn on most news products,

156
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.150
they're getting this predictable set of things and that doesn't quench that

157
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:45.490
thirst for them. They're not, they're not being challenged in any way.

158
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:50.020
They're not seeing different sides of a topic. You know, you're not approaching,

159
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.520
uh, covering a subject, honestly, by genuinely, uh,

160
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.500
you exploring the idea that so that people you may have thought were bad or

161
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:00.660
right. Or people that you may have thought are good or wrong,

162
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.920
it's just all predictable. So I think people are fleeing to other things now.

163
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.000
Right. They just, they, they want, they want to just get the story. They don't,

164
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.990
they don't want to have a whole lot of, you know, editorializing on top of it.

165
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.500
And yeah. And, uh, yeah. And, and they,

166
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.970
I think also there's a lot of underestimating of audiences going out there

167
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.140
and like, we, we just think that they can't handle stuff and they can, yeah.

168
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.390
They're, they're, they're they're interested, but we, we,

169
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.320
we just take it for granted that they can't do it. Maybe I'm guilty of that too,

170
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.050
you know? Cause I've been doing this for so long, but, but yeah, it,

171
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.280
it does happen.

172
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.280
<v 0>I don't think people have changed that much. Yeah, no.</v>

173
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.690
<v 1>Probably, probably, probably not. It's just, um, it's just difficult, you know,</v>

174
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.140
maybe it's also, we don't have the stamina to,

175
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.110
to stick with a story in the same way that we used to,

176
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.750
like now if a story doesn't get a million hits right away, we don't,

177
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.880
we don't return to the subject. Um, you know,

178
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:56.550
you think about stories like Watergate,

179
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.330
like when Woodward and Bernstein first did those stories,

180
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.050
they were complete duds. Like everybody thought they were on the wrong path.

181
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.390
They were the only people who were covering it.

182
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.180
And a lot of those stories kind of flailed around, you know what I mean? They,

183
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:15.420
they didn't get the big response and it wasn't until much later that it became

184
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:18.710
this hot thing that everybody was watching and you wouldn't see.

185
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.500
So that wouldn't happen now. Right? Like if, if reporters were on a story,

186
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.000
if it didn't catch fire within the first couple of passes,

187
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.460
your editor is probably going to take you off it. Now.

188
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.810
<v 0>What was that story that the New York times worked on about Trump and they</v>

189
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:36.470
worked on it for a long time and it was released and went in and out of the news

190
00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:38.210
cycle. In a matter of days, nobody gave a.

191
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:44.120
<v 1>The, yeah. The one about his finances. And it was like a 36,000 word story.</v>

192
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:45.980
It was like, unbelievable. It was like,

193
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:49.280
it was like six times as big as any is the biggest story I've ever written in my

194
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:49.610
life.

195
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.350
<v 0>They thought it was a giant take down.</v>

196
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.410
<v 1>Right. Yeah. And it was your,</v>

197
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.360
it was like a 36 hour thing if that. Right. And, and maybe,

198
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.650
maybe, yeah. And people kind of said, oh, this is amazing.

199
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:06.770
It's got all this information in it. And it just fell flat, you know?

200
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:07.520
And that's,

201
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.380
and the important thing about that is that news companies see this

202
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.270
and they say, wow, we invested all this time and money. We put our, you know,

203
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.780
really good reporters on this. We gave them six months to work on something.

204
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.980
And it got the same amount of hits as you know,

205
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.680
some story about, uh, you know,

206
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:30.620
a carp with a human face that was filmed in China. You know what I mean?

207
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:32.330
Like some thing that we, you know,

208
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.720
we picked off the wires and we stuck it in page 11, whatever it was.

209
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.080
So then that what that tells them the incentives now are,

210
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.880
let's not bother let's,

211
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.090
let's not do six months invest in investigations of anything anymore,

212
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:48.200
because what's the point we're going to get as many hits doing something dumb,

213
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.480
you know? So they just don't take the risk anymore.

214
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.850
<v 0>God, it's so crazy that that's the incentive now that all clicks total,</v>

215
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.450
it's such a strange trap to fall into. And, and, and.

216
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.670
<v 1>Then there's also the, the other thing, which is the, the litigation problem,</v>

217
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:03.450
you know,

218
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.300
and this is another thing I wrote about in the book is that there was a series

219
00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:07.260
of cases in the,

220
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:11.010
in the eighties and nineties where reporters kind of took on big companies.

221
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.000
I'm at the Chiquita banana thing that the Cincinnati Enquirer did. Uh,

222
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.430
remember the movie, the, um, the insider,

223
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.900
but Brian and Williamson tobacco company, CBS. Right. Um,

224
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.710
there was another one with Monsanto in Florida where some Fox reporters went

225
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:26.970
after Monsanto and they,

226
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.830
so they all got sued and it costs their companies a ton of money and

227
00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:34.560
reputational risk. And so after that,

228
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.810
what news companies said is why take on a big company

229
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.350
that can fight back and throw a lawsuit at us?

230
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.980
And what do we win by that? We're not going to get more audience from that,

231
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.000
you know? So now if you watch consumer reporting, you know,

232
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.510
at like a small, um, TV station, usually it's,

233
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.960
they're going to bang on some little Chinese restaurant that has roaches or

234
00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:01.680
something like that. They're not going to go after Monsanto or, or, or,

235
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.180
you know, Chiquita banana,

236
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.740
because there's no point there it's too much of a

237
00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:11.020
risk. So they just don't do it. And that's another thing that's,

238
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:13.200
that's gone wrong with reporting. You know, they, they,

239
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.110
they've the economic benefit of going after a powerful adversary isn't

240
00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:22.330
there anymore. So they don't do it. And, uh, that's, that's,

241
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.240
it's a problem that clearly you've.

242
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.410
<v 0>Seen a giant change in journalism from when you first started to where we are</v>

243
00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:33.390
now, do you have any fears or concerns about the future of it? I mean,

244
00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:36.510
this is what you do for a living. What is your, what are your thoughts on it?

245
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.900
Where do you think it's going? I mean, I'm really worried.

246
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.360
<v 1>About it because, um,</v>

247
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.510
because you need the journalists to kind of exist

248
00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:52.710
apart from politics and to be a check on everything. Right.

249
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.070
I think that the whole idea of having a fourth estate is that it's separate from

250
00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:59.970
the political parties, right? I mean, I don't work for the DNC.

251
00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:02.760
It's not my job to write bad news about Donald Trump, right?

252
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:04.920
That's the DNC's job. You know, they, they,

253
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.190
they put up press releases about them. And if people would see us as,

254
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.350
as being indistinguishable from political parties or being all editorial,

255
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.040
then we don't have any power anymore. Like, that's, that's the first thing.

256
00:14:17.041 --> 00:14:19.800
Like the press doesn't have any ability to influence people.

257
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:24.570
If people don't see us as independent and truthful and all those things.

258
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.010
And so that's what I really worry about right now is like,

259
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.760
people won't will stop listening to the media. They'll still tune us out.

260
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.020
They don't trust us anymore.

261
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.400
And like Walter Cronkite from 1972,

262
00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:41.580
the Gallup poll agency found that he was the most trusted man in America.

263
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.680
And that was true all also in 1985, like for 13 consecutive years,

264
00:14:46.681 --> 00:14:49.560
he was the most trusted, there's no reporter in America. Who's,

265
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.180
who's the trusted man in America that doesn't exist.

266
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.840
Yeah, exactly. So people think of us as clowns and, you know,

267
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.510
entertainment figures. And so how are you gonna,

268
00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.750
how are you going to impact the world if people think you're a joke, you know?

269
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.030
And, and that's why that's what I really worry about.

270
00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.510
We don't have any institutional self-respect anymore. And, you know, we don't,

271
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.220
we don't feel like we have to, um, you know, challenge, challenge, audiences,

272
00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:18.190
challenge, challenge, powerful people, you know, it's,

273
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.380
it's just a bunch of talking points and that's,

274
00:15:20.381 --> 00:15:24.190
that's not what the business is about. So I worry about it. Um,

275
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.570
and you know,

276
00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:28.930
I think there are a lot of journalists who kind of say the same thing.

277
00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:33.080
We all kind of talk some talk amongst ourselves, which is, you know, the, the,

278
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:34.390
the job, as we knew,

279
00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:38.590
it is kind of being phased out and changed into something else. And, um,

280
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.530
and that's not a, that's not a good thing, you know, cause people do need in,

281
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.300
in tough times, people need, need the press. Uh, you know,

282
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.840
as ridiculous as that sounds now because, but it's true. And, uh,

283
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.180
I don't know where, where we go from here. Legitimate.

284
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.610
<v 0>Journalism is so important. It's so important.</v>

285
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.820
It's the only way you really find out what's going on, right. The only way,

286
00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:58.300
right.

287
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.150
You're not going to find out through the depictions of the people that were

288
00:16:01.151 --> 00:16:04.240
actually involved in it that want you to see it a certain way.

289
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.620
You're not going to find that from people that have financial incentives and

290
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.550
given you a specific narrative, you need real journalism. Yeah.

291
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.610
It's so hard to find. And I think it's one of the reasons why we're so lost.

292
00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:20.590
And it's one of the more insidious aspects of the term fake news.

293
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.620
Cause God, that's so easy to throw around. It's like,

294
00:16:23.621 --> 00:16:27.130
it's so easy to call someone a bigot. It's so easy to call someone a racist.

295
00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:29.590
And it's so easy to say fake news and all that.

296
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.240
They all have the same sort of effect.

297
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.930
They just diminish anything that you have to say almost instantaneously.

298
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.100
<v 1>And th th there's when,</v>

299
00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:42.370
when you can cast the entire news as being fake, um,

300
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.800
people can tune a tune and out, but a lot of that has to do with,

301
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.560
but who is doing the news reading now? Right?

302
00:16:47.561 --> 00:16:52.450
Like in the sixties and seventies, maybe before reporters,

303
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:55.870
a lot of them came from the middle and lower classes. Like, you know, they were,

304
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.950
it was, the job was originally kind of like being a plumber, right.

305
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.330
W w was more of a trade than a profession. And so you had a lot of people who,

306
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.370
who went into the job and they had this kind of attitude of just wanting to

307
00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:12.100
stick it to the man. You know, like they, they,

308
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.350
they didn't want to be close to power.

309
00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:17.410
They wanted to take it on people like Seymour Hersh, right?

310
00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:20.590
Like if you see that kind of personality who just wants to take the truth and

311
00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:24.940
rub it in somebody's face. Um, but then after all the president's men,

312
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.530
it became this sexy thing to be a journalist. And you saw all,

313
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.490
a lot of people from my generation who went into journalism because they wanted

314
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:36.700
to be close to politicians and hang out with them.

315
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.950
That's kind of like the primary colors thing, right.

316
00:17:38.951 --> 00:17:42.340
Where you see people who they just want to like, have a beer with the,

317
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.020
with the presidential candidate.

318
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.500
And that's totally different from what it used to be like, not, so now,

319
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.430
now we're on the wrong side of the rope line. You see what I'm saying?

320
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.900
Like we used to, we used to be outside of power, like taking it on,

321
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.370
and now we're kind of seeing w w we're more upper-class in,

322
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.170
in the press and we're,

323
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.860
we're kind of in bed with the same people we were supposed to be covering.

324
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:08.460
And that's, that's not a good thing. People want people to see that they, they,

325
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:09.540
they, you know, that's,

326
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:12.250
that's one of the reasons why they say they call us fake news is because they,

327
00:18:12.251 --> 00:18:15.260
they see us as doing PR for, you know, rich.
