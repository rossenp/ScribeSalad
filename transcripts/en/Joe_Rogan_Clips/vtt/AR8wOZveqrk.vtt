00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 2>One time I was getting on a plan. e and, uh,</v>

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.060
a few wilds down for me.

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:13.770
I saw George Carlin and well, he, yeah,

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.690
he was so few miles ahead of me and I, I, you know, I never met him before,

6
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.930
so I didn't want to bother him. And I sat down and then he,

7
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.920
he gets up from his chair and he starts,

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.430
he looks at me and is walking toward me. And I got so excited.

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.560
I still like George Carlin.

10
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:35.460
He wants to talk to me and he comes over to me and he says,

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.690
uh, I got to work on some stuff. I'm writing.

12
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:44.370
I got to read something and then I'm going to take a nap so I can talk to

13
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:47.370
you. And he walked, he was like,

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.000
basically he went out of his way to tell me to go myself.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.700
<v 0>What was it? He just being courteous because otherwise he would have said,</v>

16
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:58.230
I would talk to you. Yes.

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.740
<v 1>Yeah. But at, when it was getting near the end of the flight,</v>

18
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:05.910
when they announced that we are going to be a descending soon,

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.590
uh,

20
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.330
he came over to me again and he scribbled his

21
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:17.280
phone number down on a piece of paper. And he said to me, uh,

22
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.400
next time you're appearing on TV.

23
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.770
I want you to call me and tell me,

24
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.670
because I want to see what's going on in that brain of yours.

25
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.580
And that was like, holy.

26
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.780
<v 0>Yeah. I only got, I saw him perform live a few times.</v>

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.190
I saw him perform live in New Hampshire when I was like 21 in like

28
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.260
1988. Um,

29
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.580
I saw him there and I saw him at the comedy store later and I ran into him once

30
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:50.890
the comic store. And he was so unassuming. Yes.

31
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.390
She just walked by and said hi to everybody. Hello? Hello. Like,

32
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.830
it's like real friendly,

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.730
easy just was there to do his work and super nice guy.

34
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.830
<v 1>And the funny thing is I had, you know, George Carlin's number, which,</v>

35
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.760
and I thought that was like a tremendous thrill, George,

36
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.300
Carlin's a fan. I thought this was unbelievable.

37
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.790
I also met Jonathan Winters and he gave me his

38
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:22.200
phone number and I didn't call either one of them,

39
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.940
uh, because I I've had those, you know what?

40
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.140
It's like a couple of celebrities who've given me the numbers. It's like,

41
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.310
you know, we meet them. They're my best friend, the whole world.

42
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.380
We hit it off like a lifelong pals. And then you call them and you go,

43
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.900
hi, it's Gilbert. Oh, hello.

44
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.710
<v 0>It.</v>

45
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.250
<v 1>Wore off. Yes. It's kind of, to me, it's like,</v>

46
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.990
when you meet a girl and you get her phone number

47
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.830
and she's like, oh, here's my number. Don't lose this. Don't lose this.

48
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:03.520
And here's here's, if I'm not at this number, here's my other number,

49
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.310
please call me, call me, call me all excited.

50
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.750
And then you call them up and you go, hi, you know, uh,

51
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.100
remember we met at, uh, Joe's party and it's like,

52
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.503
oh yeah.

53
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.821
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.420
I think some celebrities just get exhausted by people wanting things from them.

55
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:25.540
You.

56
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.630
<v 1>Know, I'm sure, absolutely.</v>

57
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.230
<v 0>You're constantly someone thinks that they can get further up the show business</v>

58
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:36.310
ladder just by being friends with you being around you. That's why,

59
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.890
when they act normal, it's uh, it's so refreshing. Well.

60
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.760
<v 1>It's like when people come up to me and say, uh,</v>

61
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.030
could you give me some advice or some pointers?

62
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.700
I always feel like underneath it is like,

63
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.770
can you like press that button? That makes me a star.

64
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.260
<v 0>Help me? Yeah. Give me a lift up. Yeah. But which doesn't exist.</v>

65
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.090
Yeah. No one can do that.

66
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.840
<v 1>It's like, I think they they'll look at you if,</v>

67
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.320
when you're known and they'll think, oh, you know,

68
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.590
somebody sprinkled some dust on you,

69
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.490
magic dust and you immediately became.

70
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.250
<v 0>Known and you'll be able to tell me how I can do this.</v>

71
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.050
<v 1>Yes, yes. Where I can get this dust rum and I'll sprinkle on myself.</v>

72
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.290
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I think people are just looking for shortcuts all the time. Right?</v>

73
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.150
Yeah. And I think that's also one of the reasons why celebrities are a little

74
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:38.020
standoffish with even when they meet other celebrities, you know,

75
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:38.980
I think they just get,

76
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.370
but then sometimes they feel like those are the only people that they know that

77
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.270
they can talk to.

78
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.600
<v 1>Like, I feel like, uh,</v>

79
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.020
who can the cast of friends, so.

80
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.850
<v 0>Right, right. They're all oddly famous. Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.923
In a weird way.

82
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.540
One of the weirdest celebrity encounters I ever had was Robin Williams.

83
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.960
He came to one of my shows by himself. Yeah.

84
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.340
And I didn't know it was him until a few minutes in talking to him.

85
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:13.700
He had a big, crazy beard and a baseball hat on, and I'm talking to,

86
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.120
I was doing like this little meet and greet after the show.

87
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.710
And I'm just talking to this guy and he's like, I really liked that pit.

88
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:23.020
I love this. I loved how you did this and that.

89
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.950
And then I'm in the middle of talking to my like, holy, this is Robin Williams.

90
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.240
Oh yeah. I didn't realize it until like a couple minutes into talking to him.

91
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.290
I just was talking to him like he was just a regular guy and he acted like a

92
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:36.124
regular guy.

93
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.710
<v 1>Yeah. I, there were a couple of times I,</v>

94
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:44.050
at those clubs, he would pop into those clubs all the time.

95
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.940
And there were a few times he called me up on stage with him to riff with him,

96
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:52.690
which was great. And, uh,

97
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.890
what I remember most about him, I was at the of,

98
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.080
and I wasn't known at the time. I mean,

99
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:03.620
I was known to the comics and everything like that.

100
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.100
And, uh, and, uh,

101
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.870
I guess he had seen me a few times there and, uh,

102
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.290
so I'm getting ready. They're just about to introduce me.

103
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.920
And then the door opens up and, uh, Robin comes in.

104
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.630
So of course they go, uh, oh Robin, uh,

105
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:28.280
you're you're on a Gilbert, uh, go away and Robin you're on next.

106
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.750
And, and Robin said to them, he goes, oh, he goes, oh,

107
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.870
I have a few people in the audience to see me.

108
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.070
And I'd like them to see Gilbert first. Wow.

109
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.500
And that always stuck with me. Uh.
