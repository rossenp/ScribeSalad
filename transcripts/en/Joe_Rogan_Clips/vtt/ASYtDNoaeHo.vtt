00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 2>Well, what you said made me think of one of the hardest stories I ever did.</v>

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.680
I did a, an article for the new Yorker about the sons of Jim Jones.

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.640
Oh. And, uh, not everybody died in Jonestown. Uh,

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.080
he had three sons,

6
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:24.830
two of em were adopted and they were playing a basketball tournament in

7
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:29.510
Georgetown, Giana, Gianna. And, um, this,

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.430
this story took place when I, you remember the branched videos.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.590
Yeah. Now that you're a Texan, you know, it's just up the road Waco. Yeah. Uh,

10
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.980
my editor at the new Yorker at the time was Tina brown and she, uh,

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.940
she asked me to go, you know, right about the branch D videos. And I said, Tina,

12
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.460
there are more reporters than branch Dividians up there right now. I couldn't,

13
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.240
you know,

14
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.540
but what I was had been watching the news coverage and just before

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.260
the place was called Rancho apocalypse,

16
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.530
which was turned out to be really appropriate.

17
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.050
<v 0>But they sent before the configuration,</v>

18
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.810
they sent out a, a van with children, you know,

19
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.970
who had grown up in this community. And these kids, you know, as they,

20
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.810
they drove past the ATF and the FBI lines and then the media line,

21
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.440
and you could see these children looking out the windows,

22
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.720
they were leaving behind everybody.

23
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.840
They knew they were leaving behind the only world they knew.

24
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.520
And they were going into what, and I thought, what happened to those kids?

25
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.400
This must have happened. You know, what will happen to those?

26
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.360
It must have happened to children elsewhere.

27
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.710
And so I started doing some investigation and I found out that, you know,

28
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.750
Jones had these three kids, uh, three young boys. They were, well,

29
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:52.950
they were young men. Um,

30
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.790
and there was Jim Jr. Who was black. Uh,

31
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.270
and then there was Steven and, uh,

32
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:05.340
who was the natural son and there was two M Jones. And, um,

33
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.893
for whatever reason,

34
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.000
they hadn't talked to anybody and they agreed to talk to me. Wow. Uh,

35
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.840
and perhaps it had to do with, you know,

36
00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:19.480
the branch Dividian thing that was going on at that same time.

37
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.150
So this was in the early nineties. Yeah. It was 15 years after Jones. Um,

38
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.590
it was a, actually almost exactly 15 years. And, uh,

39
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.550
there's a cemetery in Oakland where

40
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.830
many of, most of the 900 bodies were buried and there's,

41
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.780
they took a earth mover and, and took a down,

42
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.980
you know, half of a hill.

43
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.140
And then they stacked all the caskets up and covered it again.

44
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.620
But it still has this distortion. And you can see, you know,

45
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.860
what remained of the, the, the Jonestown followers.

46
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.080
But it was interesting to me that the people who

47
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.440
joined the Jones cult were all

48
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.160
good people. They were all, you know,

49
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.320
it was started in Indianapolis and then it moved to the bay area and they was

50
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:17.240
largely a, uh, you know, largely black, uh,

51
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.630
Jones was, uh, very, very progressive, you know, on race.

52
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.270
Uh, and, uh, but you know, a lot of, uh, good-hearted people involved in it.

53
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.390
And he was a, a big figure in San Francisco at the time politically, you know,

54
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.670
his, his support was sought after, you know, he was admired as a,

55
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.790
a community leader,

56
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.460
but he totally crazy and paranoid and suddenly decided

57
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.420
he had to remove the entire group. And you can't tell your family, you know,

58
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:50.620
can't tell anybody you're going just to, you know,

59
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.260
he sent his sons down to Giana to clear the jungle so that they could make

60
00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:01.210
this village. And, uh, and then overnight they move, you know,

61
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:06.170
nearly a thousand people to south America and leaving

62
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.570
behind all their friends, their jobs and stuff like that. One day, you know,

63
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.410
they they've been, you know, uh, removed. They've been, uh, raptured,

64
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.210
you know, off to south America. And so

65
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.800
I was interested, you know, that, you know, in learning more about it, but,

66
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.720
uh, these, these, you know,

67
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:32.600
young men were totally haunted, but you would,

68
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.240
you would certainly relate to Tim Jones.

69
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.920
He was physically one of the very powerful, you know,

70
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.910
Pearl, you know, a hundred pounds with either hand, you know, he,

71
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.990
but he couldn't, he couldn't get on an elevator. Uh,

72
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.870
the last time he tried to do an airplane flight. I mean,

73
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:57.710
this has been years ago. I don't know if it's changed for him now, but he was,

74
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.940
he made the airplane turn around and drop him off at the gate,

75
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.740
uh, which is hard to do. But when you're, you know,

76
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.020
as physically overpowering as Tim was, you know, he's a,

77
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:13.820
he's kind of a formidable figure. And, um,

78
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.060
so he just had all sorts of anxieties. So I went to talk to him and, um,

79
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.010
he, he said, I'll do it on one condition.

80
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.210
We have to do it in a public place. You know,

81
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.490
restaurant someplace where I won't cry. And I want my wife there,

82
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.810
cuz I never told her about it. And wow,

83
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.690
it's a little hard for me to tell this story because

84
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.330
we went to a restaurant

85
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.320
and within five minutes he was crying, you know,

86
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.440
and pounding the table. And the waiter was keeping his distance.

87
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.920
People in the restaurant were, you know, frightened.

88
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.480
And he told the story of going back.

89
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.160
He's the one who had to identify 900 people,

90
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.880
his, his natural birth parents, his adopted parents.

91
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.800
He had a wife and children then too. They were all dead. Everybody was dead

92
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.493
and

93
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.510
I've never forgotten the power of,

94
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.230
of a religious belief and a personality like Jim Jones,

95
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.230
who could persuade all those people to stay with him,

96
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.830
train them in this, you know, suicide drills night after night, you know,

97
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.030
and then one day it's real. And um, you know,

98
00:06:36.031 --> 00:06:40.300
the boys felt guilty because they thought if they had been there,

99
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.420
uh, they might have been able to stop it, but probably not.
