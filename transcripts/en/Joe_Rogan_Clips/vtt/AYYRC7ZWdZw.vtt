00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And I did that for like three years, like chasing it,</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.650
going to try outs, things like that,

3
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:10.290
sending tapes stuff to agents and things like that.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.530
And it just didn't pan out nothing stuck. You know,

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:17.670
I had opportunities that I just wasn't the same player and I can admit that.

6
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.490
And I'm comfortable with that because I know I had a successful basketball

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.030
career. Just didn't go to the level where I made millions of dollars.

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
So after that, man, I was literally stuck after traveling around the world.

9
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:29.790
I ended up in Malaysia,

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.660
I was in Australia trying to pursue you don't want to know how I ended up over

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:34.530
here. Know.

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.750
<v 1>Man, this is one of the only a few.</v>

13
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.850
<v 0>People know this story. So.</v>

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.220
<v 1>When.</v>

15
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.710
<v 0>You at your bottom, you try to find something for comfort.</v>

16
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.260
I've never done weed or anything in my life,

17
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.520
but I was addicted to like online data back then. Yes.

18
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.540
I was like trying to meet girls, like just to try to find her some situation.

19
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.260
I felt like, oh, I feel incomplete. So let me like online date or whatever.

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.430
And I met this girl,

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.730
like one of my friends in Phoenix played basketball in Kuala Lumpur.

22
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.870
So obviously you need a visa to go over there. So I'm thinking to myself,

23
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.420
like what's the, the,

24
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.850
the way I could get over there to Kuala Lumpur and try to play basketball.

25
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.560
So I was like online.

26
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.620
<v 2>Dating. I don't even remember what website. You're a good looking guy.</v>

27
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.380
I know how you not getting girls in America. I do.

28
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.360
<v 0>I'm just saying I was just listen. My whole point. My point was,</v>

29
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.320
I literally met this girl in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She was from Canada.

30
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.070
She was a singer over there singing in little military bars or whatever,

31
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.010
little hot blonde or whatever she was. And um,

32
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
I remember talking to her for about a month and I convinced her that I wanted to

33
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.820
come visit her, but my whole intention was, let me get over there.

34
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.690
Try to find out what this team is and see if I could like try out for him some

35
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:49.050
crazy. You don't do that today. I did it back then.

36
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.240
So I went over there to laugh because I know people that know me is

37
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:58.320
dying. Listen to this right now. This is a true 100% store.

38
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.610
I get over there to Malaysia with no money.

39
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
I may have $400. I got people to pay for ticket here.

40
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.720
I'm going to Malaysia to play basketball. This is lying to people, right?

41
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.540
So I get over there. This girl, I don't even want to say her name.

42
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.410
She might Sue me, but she picked me up at the airport.

43
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:20.550
She looked exactly like her pitches, beautiful from Canada, everything.

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.450
So she takes me to her apartment. She got this nice apartment.

45
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.720
It was like in a jungle Cho, like I'm talking about the balcony.

46
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.500
I seen like little monkeys on the balcony. Yes, it was crazy.

47
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.830
And then it's like a rainforest. Right? And then in Malaysia,

48
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.110
if you ever been in a Malaysia, I don't know if it was like there.

49
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:41.460
Now the doors are high off the ground, like two inches. So it's like,

50
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.010
anything can crawl under the doors or whatever.

51
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.830
So that's the first thing I noticed when I got to Malaysia, I was like,

52
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:49.890
this is some crazy. Right? We're in a jungle and adult.

53
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.000
Like what about snakes or bugs? I remember asking him these little kids,

54
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.870
when I first got to Malaysia, I was like, have you ever seen a snake?

55
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.680
Like in this area? And it was like, yeah, I seen the Cobra and all this stuff.

56
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.800
And I was just like, holy. But the back to her,

57
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.540
she turned out to be a sex addict.

58
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.480
<v 3>Yes. Congratulations.</v>

59
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.420
<v 1>Man. Listen, yo, this.</v>

60
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.600
<v 0>Is crazy. Like, because this is way before I ever decided to say,</v>

61
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.920
I'm going to do film for a living. Right. I was over there.

62
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.420
Um, the first day I got there, like I had a good time with her. Then I,

63
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.900
you know,

64
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.190
ended up having relations with the lady and she turned out to be a sex addict.

65
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.750
So, you know, as a man,

66
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:36.160
I just flew all the way across the world to see this girl, you sleep with her.

67
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.670
And then all of a sudden she wanted to do it again and again and again.

68
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.250
And then when you like slow down, like, you know, I just got here, bro.

69
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:45.820
She started crying and going nuts and I'm in Malaysia. I'm like,

70
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.320
I don't know who this girl is. Oh.

71
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.880
<v 2>No, listen, she's crying. Cause you won't her. Guess how many times you her now?</v>

72
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.560
Two times. And she wanted to go.

73
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.190
<v 0>To long time. Still. Like it was crazy. I am, listen.</v>

74
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.370
I am in Malaysia. This I'm not in America. I'm in Malaysia.

75
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.660
So the crazy thing is probably after a week,

76
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.920
she started to go crazy and complain about I'm not sleeping with her.

77
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.880
I'm I'm in my, I'm in my prime, my sexual peak.

78
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.430
And you don't want to sleep with me. And I'm just thinking to myself, like,

79
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.450
I don't know what the am I doing over here in Malaysia? Like what? This lady?

80
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.370
So I ended up meeting this black guy, uh, that she introduced me to,

81
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.620
there was like a hustler in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

82
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.680
And I started hanging out with him just to get out of the house.

83
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.200
<v 1>And he's like living with.</v>

84
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.640
<v 0>Any money to go home. So I'm just stuck with this.</v>

85
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.590
<v 2>Beautiful girl that you have to all the time.</v>

86
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.160
<v 0>First of world problems. Right. Serious first.</v>

87
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.250
And then she started getting even better. Like I hate Americans.

88
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.550
You Americans are so ungrateful and all I'm just thinking like.

89
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.450
<v 3>Wow, you're representing America. It was.</v>

90
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.910
<v 0>Crazy. I was like, I must've just didn't do a good enough.</v>

91
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.120
I thought our girls be lined in. Right.

92
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.950
Well maybe she was just extraordinary.

93
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.890
And she was like in her late thirties and I was in my early twenties.

94
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.480
<v 3>So some girls in their late thirties, they hit this itchy peak man,</v>

95
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.510
just like all the time. She.

96
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.610
<v 0>Kicked me out her house in Malaysia. Like I went out with Bobby one night,</v>

97
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.310
this dude, his name was Bobby too. And um,

98
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.260
w I came home and she said, um, your stuff is outside. Like she texted me.

99
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.680
I had a little international phone. She was like, your stuff is outside.

100
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:34.050
I'm thinking like, she was like, yeah, this is not working out.

101
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.540
So think about that. Imagine being in another country,

102
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.730
and this is not working out, no money, no money, zero, not a dime.

103
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.210
And I, the guy that I was with, I told him what happened. He was like,

104
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.470
I'm gonna take you over there to get your stuff.

105
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.320
You could stay with me until you figure it out. I get there.

106
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.520
And all my stuff is outside. Everything. She's not there.

107
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:57.060
She's done left or whatever. And I had some brand new Timberlands.

108
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.290
Remember the boots, tablets. I am poor. I need them Timberlands.

109
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.340
They in a house. I had more on brand new. So I kicked the door down. Boom.

110
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.770
Oh no. Yes. Like I was trying to get in the door.

111
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.350
I just kicked it and it broke like the little handle bro.

112
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.140
I got in and got my Timberlands left. I remember she texted me. She was like,

113
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.240
Hey, did you break my door? I was like, nah,

114
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.960
I don't know what you're talking about. I just left. So from there I was,

115
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.650
I stayed with Bobby for like three weeks in Malaysia.

116
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.790
I was hanging out with him everyday, going to parties. And I'm like, bro,

117
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:29.450
I gotta get home to America. So I contacted my, one of my, uh,

118
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.210
mentors growing up, uh, in Australia,

119
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.240
he was playing pro professional basketball and Melbourne named Rashad,

120
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.530
Tucker shout out to him.

121
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.270
And I convinced him to get me a ticket to come over to Melbourne because I was

122
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.640
like, bro, I need some money to go home. And he was like, nah, man,

123
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.140
I just get you a ticket to come to Melbourne. I was like, bro,

124
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.910
literally like I I'm trying to go back to America. I don't know what to,

125
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.770
but then when he, he sold me on, I was like,

126
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.220
I really ain't going back to nothing. So let me go. He was like, man,

127
00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:59.140
you can come over here and try out for the team.

128
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.150
You can try to practice with us. And I was like, oh,

129
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:03.520
that may be my opportunity to play professional basketball.

130
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.280
He's one of the top players in Australia.

131
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.320
So I ended up in Melbourne and I was in Melbourne for three months.

132
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.060
Not doing, but going out, practicing with the team. This was mid season.

133
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:19.120
So I couldn't like make a team because they was already, you know, they think,

134
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.490
and then I ended up getting stranded over there too,

135
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.290
because he left me cause he cheated on his girlfriend and uh,

136
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.220
he had to go make up with her. So he left me talking about I'm going to be back.

137
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.910
And then I was just stuck in Australia like yo bro,

138
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.440
I need to get back to America job. No job, no money, nothing. He was like,

139
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.850
uh, I'm glad I was young. When I did all this stuff, he was like, Hey man,

140
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.740
tell her, tell one of them girls, a sob story. They'll get you.

141
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.810
I'm like a sob story, bro. You have money. Buy me a ticket to go home, man.

142
00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:57.520
I can't do it right now. I'm like, man. So I had to tell this girl a sob story.

143
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.520
Her name was Deanna, Deanna Casar.

144
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.130
I'm giving her a shout out because she saved my life.

145
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:05.620
She bought me a ticket home. She,

146
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.060
she went in her savings and bought me a ticket back from Melbourne to ho

147
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.270
Honolulu to Las Vegas. And um,

148
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.890
I didn't know why I chose Las Vegas, but I just chose. I go to Las.

149
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.230
<v 2>Vegas. So you literally has zero money.</v>

150
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.120
<v 4>Zero Morrow. How were you eating?</v>

151
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.520
Her people that I was around. Right. They just fed you. Yeah.

152
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.560
<v 0>Man. Sometimes you have angels in your life.</v>

153
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.220
And I guess these people were angels to cause that's what I was just telling

154
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.530
Jamie, like I just seen a documentary on homelessness.

155
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.370
It was like four out of five people in LA county paycheck to paycheck.

156
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.660
I think it was like eight. Like, or it's four out of five. People are like one,

157
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.940
$400 emergency from being broke or it was like 80% of people live paycheck to

158
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:53.260
paycheck. So I always tell people like when I'm inspiring people now I'm like,

159
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:55.860
bro, I was homeless once. Cause that's essentially homelessness.

160
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.340
If you ain't got an address, you can't pay bills. You're homeless.

161
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.120
No matter if you got a roof over your head. And I feel, I feel like people,

162
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.400
you see all these beautiful moments that I do now or what anybody does

163
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.720
does. And they don't see the story that ultimately led you. Like what,

164
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.320
what ultimately turn to you doing what you're doing now.

165
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:20.190
So after Australia I went to Vegas. I was living with two strippers.

166
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.940
Yes. I live with two strippers. Again,

167
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.570
I'll live in Vegas with two strippers that worked at the rhino,

168
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.540
the spearmint rhino. I met them on Craigslist.

169
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.540
<v 3>For rooms to rent Jesus Christ.</v>

170
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.910
<v 0>And I had enough money, like $600 to move into a room.</v>

171
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.940
So I literally moved in with these girls.

172
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.890
And one day, have you ever been in a Vegas casinos?

173
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.750
Cause this is like the climax you ever seen? Like the mega bucks slots.

174
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.380
So one day it was Floyd Mayweather vs. Oscar de LA Hoya.

175
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.700
So that was the year I was in the,

176
00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:03.650
the Mirage and I seen these two hot black girls and I had like some money in

177
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:07.070
my pocket, honey, this, um, so I wanted to sit down next to him.

178
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.730
So I went over there and sat next to him and was just trying to shoot the.

179
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.790
And I put a $20 in on the slots. Cause you know,

180
00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:17.210
you can get free drinks if you put in a slot. So I just hitting it,

181
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:19.550
talking to him where y'all from, y'all going into fight, blah, blah, blah.

182
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.900
And then one of the girls was like, Hey you won. I was like, oh, okay. You know,

183
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.450
are you thinking ain't winning no slots. Guess how much I want? How much?

184
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.150
$9,000. Whoa. Swear to God. $9,000 to somebody broke.

185
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.510
Wow. Yes. $9,000. So.

186
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.300
<v 3>When they give you that, do you pay taxes on it later?</v>

187
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.630
Or the game or on social security number though? You give them the wrong. So

188
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.280
I gave him the wrong thing. Yeah.

189
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.800
<v 0>Because they just actually your name, your social security number. Okay.</v>

190
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.600
<v 3>Maybe you shouldn't have just told everybody that.</v>

191
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.760
<v 0>Bam, that came, proved that I want anything they can.</v>

192
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.350
That was like 12 years ago.

193
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.010
<v 3>They didn't have records back then. No, I don't think so. I hope not. No,</v>

194
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.620
ain't nobody gonna watch this. Nobody's.

195
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.500
<v 0>Watching this. This is nobody's gonna watch it.</v>

196
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.470
So after that I literally lived off that nine grand for about the rest of the

197
00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:16.880
summer. And uh, I ended up moving to San Diego after that.

198
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.260
Like I'm skipping some stuff,

199
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.400
but I moved to San Diego and that's when my life changed because I lived in San

200
00:11:22.401 --> 00:11:24.740
Diego and was just partying. What brought you to San Diego?

201
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.850
I met a guy in Vegas during the night of the Floyd Mayweather fight and just

202
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.930
party with them that night.

203
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.520
And I just got his phone number one time and then I was just staying in touch

204
00:11:34.521 --> 00:11:36.560
with them or whatever. And then he was like, I live in San Diego,

205
00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:41.480
he's in the Navy, Dr. Bill. And I literally said,

206
00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:43.250
let me come out there one weekend. I was like,

207
00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:44.870
let me just come out there and kick it with you or whatever.

208
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.560
Cause he was telling me how great San Diego was. And um, I went out there and I,

209
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:52.670
I didn't leave for four years. San Diego is pretty awesome. I love San Diego,

210
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.770
but I essentially was doing the same thing I was doing for the past couple of

211
00:11:56.771 --> 00:12:01.540
years. Lost. Cause you gotta understand like athletes go through this now.

212
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:05.320
Like I just did. I just released the episode with Ryan Bader on my channel.

213
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.980
And I talked to him about that. Like when your sports career has done,

214
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.340
a lot of people go to something else they lost and things like that.

215
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:17.110
And I was for about four or five years and it wasn't until I

216
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:18.940
lived in San Diego that I figured I was like, man,

217
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:23.300
I got to really do something with my life. I'm literally a failure. I got,

218
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.650
I have a college degree. I graduated from college. So it wasn't like,

219
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.340
I just didn't want that responsibility of having to do a nine to five and things

220
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:34.090
like that. So it wasn't until I live in San Diego that I,

221
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:37.030
I literally talked to the God that I was living with him. I was like, bro,

222
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.520
I don't know what I'm going to do on my life, bro.

223
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:43.540
But I got to figure something out. I was like near in 30 and um,

224
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.610
I ended up moving to Minneapolis,

225
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.440
back to Minneapolis and I got a job as a teacher out like a teacher's assistant.

226
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.920
They called it behavior assistant. I was like working with kindergarten kids.

227
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.590
Jesus literally crazy life. Right?

228
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.830
What a crazy life end up where I'm at now to be on Joe Rogan. Right?

229
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.240
So it was March 3rd to 2011. Um,

230
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.080
it was like negative 20 degrees outside. I was living with my guy,

231
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.120
my best friend. And um,

232
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:14.080
I went to work that day and it was freezing outside and they literally still

233
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:17.520
went to recess that day. I'll never forget that. Oh,

234
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.840
put your coats and gloves on kids. It's time to go to, to recess.

235
00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:24.240
And I was like, what do you mean? We going into gym or outside? It was like,

236
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.850
we're going outside. I was like, man, these people in Minnesota, crazy.

237
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.710
<v 2>Hard. Those are hard people, bro.</v>

238
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.490
That was the last day I ever worked in my life. He said, this. I can't do it,

239
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:34.110
man. I was like Brooklyn outside of that, whether.

240
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.410
<v 0>It was just the fact that I was like, what am I doing with my life?</v>

241
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.950
I'm working with Kenny, the great rewarding job. I'm like what?

242
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.970
It's nothing wrong with me. I'm physically able to do anything.

243
00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:48.870
I'm intelligent enough to do anything. I'm qualified enough to do anything.

244
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.410
No victim.

245
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.600
<v 3>Of circumstances just kept happening.</v>

246
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.920
<v 0>Things kept happening. Um, and a lot of it is my fault because you just lazy.</v>

247
00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:59.790
Right? So March 3rd, 2011 is the day I said,

248
00:13:59.791 --> 00:14:04.200
I'm quitting my job. I went back to my apartment with my roommate. He was.

249
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.640
He was like, bro, you always quit and jobs. And he was like, bro,

250
00:14:08.641 --> 00:14:11.010
what you going to do? I was like, bro, I'm fin to figure something out.

251
00:14:11.011 --> 00:14:14.610
I'm going to buy a camera or do something. He was like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

252
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:15.720
And,

253
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.110
and we literally was sitting in the kitchen in his little kitchen on the floor

254
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.590
talking about life. Cause I would just tell, I literally mentally broke.

255
00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:25.650
I was like, bro, I'm just jacked. Like I got to figure something out.

256
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.590
I had Pell grant was coming up. I was getting my,

257
00:14:28.591 --> 00:14:31.860
my tax returns back and I had enough to buy a camera.

258
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.440
And the first camera I ever bought was a Canon T two. I,

259
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.600
it was like $800 and I bought a lens and that was it. That was it.

260
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.560
It changed my life.

261
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:45.030
And I literally spent like the next year shooting videos in garages,

262
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:47.580
like cars coming up, filming the wheels.

263
00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:51.830
And I was just really literally honing myself because back then I had a camera

264
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:55.850
in college, digital cameras weren't even out until 2008,

265
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.790
like these little new style cameras. So I had to relearn everything. And I,

266
00:14:59.791 --> 00:15:03.710
I really learned a lot from YouTube and Vimeo and I was watching the,

267
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.860
I had a creative eye and a mindset. So I was just like,

268
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:11.720
I gotta get the skillset. So I started doing rap videos for $50,

269
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.290
a hundred dollars free. You know, I tell all these kids,

270
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.380
they messaged me now like bro, I spent two years doing videos for free.

271
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.530
Just trying to learn how to do this stuff.

272
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.620
Everybody want to get paid for something. And I'm like,

273
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.200
you probably don't deserve to get paid yet. So I,

274
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.100
I had friends shout out to Matt Irv, Mr. Organic.

275
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:35.210
Like I was shooting a videos for free and I was just getting better.

276
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.640
I was getting better and better and better and better.

277
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:38.960
And then like three years into it,

278
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:42.320
I shot a music video called Saks fifth avenue. And um,

279
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.410
so you're editing these as well. I'm editing them, doing them audio editing on,

280
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.590
uh, at the time I was editing on Sony Vegas. Um, uh, uh,

281
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.760
old program now is, is, is it's popular now. It's, it's,

282
00:15:54.761 --> 00:15:57.440
it's pretty easy to use. And um,

283
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:02.270
it was cheap to buy like 90 bucks. So I was able to use that, um,

284
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.750
like the movie studio version, it was, you don't get all the little tools,

285
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:06.584
but you got enough.

286
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.510
And I had this cheap laptop that this girl bought me. Uh,

287
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.460
she lied and told me she was gonna buy me a camera and it ended up buying me a

288
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:19.640
laptop. I was off and she was like, listen,

289
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.230
like the most popular candidate, a camera back in like 2011.

290
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.370
It was like a Canon five D mark two. It was like $2,000.

291
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.970
I couldn't afford that. So I met this girl online,

292
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.810
literally from Denver, Colorado, from Denver, Colorado. And you know,

293
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:42.350
you start your little love affair or whatever you talking and you promising and

294
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:45.860
I want to see you. So one day she was like, I'm gonna come see you in Minnesota.

295
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.070
This is around the time I started. And uh,

296
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.650
she told me she was going to buy me that camera. Cause I was telling her,

297
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:55.790
I was like my dream camera, my dream camera. And I remember my roommate, uh,

298
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.130
like, ah, running his room, like, look, bro,

299
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:01.370
look at his short film that was shot with this camera. I'm finna had his camera,

300
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:02.840
bro. We finna do all types of things.

301
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.530
So she like kept telling me she had the camera kept telling me how to camera.

302
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:11.360
So like the day she came, I picked her up. I had this little use 9,

303
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.230
19 92 for tourists. It was blue. And um, I picked her up the airport.

304
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.430
I remember I was like.

305
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.460
<v 1>Where are you? Kimra soon. As.</v>

306
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.360
<v 0>Soon as soon as he picked me up, when he came here, she was like, don't worry,</v>

307
00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:24.910
don't worry. Don't worry. And I'm like driving, thinking like, man,

308
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:28.000
she ain't got this camera. She lied to me. She just wanted to see me. Right.

309
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.890
So we get to my apartment and my boy, he anticipating it too. He like, man,

310
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.560
he going to get this camp. We finished shoot all our music videos. Right.

311
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.640
Cause if you get this camera at this time, you, oh you shoot new at a five D.

312
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.390
So I remember she like pulled. She was like, here's a gift. It's like,

313
00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:45.580
she pulled out the gift and I'm like, this ain't no camera box.

314
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.000
It was a brand new laptop. And I'm sitting here complaining,

315
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.920
I'm complaining about a laptop and I already have a camera,

316
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.860
but she like gave me this laptop. And I was just like, all right, cool.

317
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.330
So she gave me the laptop and I, I get the Sony Vegas program.

318
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:03.600
And then I started editing with that and I had that camera for about two years.

319
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.553
I've sent a girl.

320
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:10.580
<v 1>I don't know. There's a lot of that in my life. And I don't.</v>

321
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.200
<v 0>Blame them. Girls listen, man. Yeah. I used to be one of those guys, you know,</v>

322
00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:16.070
dumb, dumb girls,

323
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:20.060
this materialistic and they all about nice things and they liked to travel or

324
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.840
you ever dated a girl and you like see her previous boyfriend and they'd be

325
00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:24.230
like,

326
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.910
they don't want to like Napa valley and Vegas for her birthday or

327
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.170
New York. And you're like, I can't even take you to the movies. I'm like.

328
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.450
So for me, if a girl get tired of you, now they call it ghosting.

329
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.080
Right. They call it ghosting. But back then ghosting that's what ghosting was.

330
00:18:42.081 --> 00:18:44.690
It was like, ah, this guy ain't worth nothing. Let me get rid of him.

331
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.460
So she left.

332
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:48.883
<v 1>She left.</v>

333
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.680
<v 0>I had a summer job. Yes.</v>

334
00:18:51.681 --> 00:18:56.300
Ever official job was at 43 hoops in Minnesota was a basketball academy where I

335
00:18:56.301 --> 00:19:00.710
was there with a lot of pro basketball players or semi-pro or guys that had

336
00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:04.430
college experience. And we just taught kids all the time. And um,

337
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.520
I was getting paid, you know, $20 an hour,

338
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.460
$25 an hour per session to teach kids.

339
00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:15.110
And I kind of made a ruckus there to complaining about just bro,

340
00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:18.490
we teach in 20 kids and I'm only getting $20. How much are y'all getting fall,

341
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.410
these kids. Right. But I mean, that's just work, right?

342
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:24.650
I shouldn't complain about a job, but that whole summer,

343
00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:27.590
I was just telling everybody in there, I'm going to do film.

344
00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:30.500
I'm moving back to California. I'm about to just do film about to do film.

345
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.020
Cause I had enough, like I was doing videos at that point,

346
00:19:33.021 --> 00:19:36.830
but now I have a part-time job and I'm able to do videos and I never forget.

347
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:41.560
One day I was telling a group of guys in there I'm quitting his job and I'm

348
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.960
going to go do film. And I just remember the look on their face. Like, you know,

349
00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:47.180
like the boy that cried Wolf, I get whatever man,

350
00:19:47.181 --> 00:19:50.180
you ain't going to do anything. But that drove me insane. Joe doubt,

351
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.690
doubt drove me. People doubted me. That's what I needed.

352
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:57.140
I needed that fuel where people could tell me I couldn't do anything haters.

353
00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:57.920
I needed haters.
