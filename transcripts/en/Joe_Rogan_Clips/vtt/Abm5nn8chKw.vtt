00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The weirdest I've ever been around were homeschooled.</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.920
Yeah. Homeschooling is interesting, dude.

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.320
I know a guy who is homeschooled and he's so awkward and he's in his thirties.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.040
Yeah. He's just so he doesn't know how to hang. Yeah. He can't hang.

5
00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:20.200
He never learned how to hang. He, no one's ever with him. Yeah. He doesn't know.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.190
He doesn't know how to deal with people. J jabbing him and just around with him.

7
00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:28.670
He's like, woo. He doesn't &lt;laugh&gt; he doesn't get it. Is he mentally ill? No,

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.230
he's a smart guy in terms of like, he could rattle off facts.

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.030
Why did his parents homeschool him? Religion? That's that's part of it. Yeah.

10
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.830
It's a lot of it, man. Most of them real Christian stuff or yeah. Yeah.

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.060
Anti-vax too lot of weight vacs. The whole deal. Wow.

12
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:46.700
You're gonna take apple cider vinegar and it's gonna cure everything.

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.620
We gonna trust bill and Melinda gates, you know? Well with the vaccines, I mean,

14
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:53.380
they're going all over the third world, sticking a needle in anything. I mean,

15
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:58.140
those they are, they are the fact they're trying to use.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.450
Listen, they're try to help people. If it works, pause, what,

17
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:04.690
what do you think would be their motive? First of all,

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.050
bill gates literally has 90 billion. He's trying to,

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.410
I'm good things with his money and trying to use his money for philanthropy.

20
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:13.910
Sure.

21
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.370
But hold on the idea that these crack pot conspiracy theories have that bill

22
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:23.360
gates is the antichrist. Cuz he wants to get people Inno related from vaccines.

23
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.950
Yeah.

24
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.600
With vaccines and viruses that he's somehow or another trying to control people.

25
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.520
Bill gates has everything. Yeah. He doesn't need anything more. I agree.

26
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.440
He's not trying to get anything more.

27
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.400
He's making no attempts to control markets,

28
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.080
no attempts to get to like a thousand billion dollars. A hundred percent.

29
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.230
He's not doing that, but he's you using his foundation to try to,

30
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.030
to help people get, get healthy, help people get internet. Yeah.

31
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:52.150
Help people get running water. But they have, I mean, listen,

32
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:53.910
they've done things in the third world. Like they've,

33
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:57.550
they've introduced certain vaccines and stuff that have had adverse health

34
00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:00.870
consequences for people. Like what? Um, this is, I mean you could look it up,

35
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.910
but this has literally happened. I mean,

36
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:03.420
they've been involved with things you it's.

37
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.780
Has you gone well when say something like that.

38
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.060
If you don't wanna get sued yeah.

39
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.420
By the richest man in the world and you're going to he's coming after you right

40
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:12.340
now. I will, I will. I will gladly get in a high profile,

41
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.220
legal battle with bill gates right now about vaccines.

42
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.020
What do you think about vaccines? No, I think they're fine for the most part,

43
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:21.220
but if he wants to Sue me because it's something I said on a podcast,

44
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.010
let's go well, could only help. He did. No can't no.

45
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:28.530
He went CRI financial debt. I don't research these companies,

46
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:30.890
but I know for a fact that you know,

47
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:33.610
he's been involved in vaccine things that did not go well,

48
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.450
where'd you read this? I read it. Present planet.com. No, no. I've read it.

49
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.890
This is, this is a fact. This is a reality. You can't just listen.

50
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:46.320
People have issues vaccines. When you are saying it's a fact. Yeah. You,

51
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.440
you have to be able to reference. I don't. I, if you don't,

52
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.040
you don't really have enough information to say it's a fact. Well,

53
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.320
it's something that's been reported and it's been incredibly reported by who?

54
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.880
I mean see what I'm saying, but no it's incredibly reported.

55
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.920
Gates' foundation accused of dangerously skewing aid priorities by promoting

56
00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.040
corporate global. Look at the people in the back of that photo.

57
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.640
They don't look at me. What does that mean? Don't look that's,

58
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:15.120
that's not what we're asking. We're talking about adverse reactions to vaccines.

59
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:19.230
No. Yeah, Jamie, but, but say that, but let me see that article title again.

60
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:24.190
What a bizarre title. Look at this accused of click on it. Please.

61
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.670
Dangerously skewing aid priorities by promoting corporate

62
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.590
globalization. What does that mean? Everything's in quotes around everything.

63
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:37.830
Everything's in one umbrella, right? Like his company, his, his,

64
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.300
his health initiative. &lt;affirmative&gt; all of these things work together.

65
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.500
And that, you know, you have to trust that everybody's motives are pure.

66
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.620
I don't think he's trying to depopulate the world, but you know,

67
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.140
these people stand to make lots and lots of money if people adopt certain

68
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.060
vaccines, right. Or certain things that are, you know,

69
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:58.460
maybe medically advantageous, maybe not maybe necessary. Maybe not.

70
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.170
There's definitely an issue when money's involved with any sort of treatment.

71
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.590
Yeah.

72
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.770
And this is one of the issues that a lot of the conspiracy theorists bring up

73
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:10.010
when it comes to ventilators that a hospital gets X amount.

74
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:13.650
If someone gets brought into intensive care and then they get Y amount,

75
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:15.290
if they're put on a ventilators. So they're saying, well,

76
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.410
there's a motivation to put people on ventilators. Yeah.

77
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.650
Perhaps I would hope never.

78
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.600
But there have been cases of people doing surgery on people that didn't need it.

79
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.480
There have been cases of people doing things to people and treatments on people

80
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.960
where it wasn't necessary to provide, you know, something. So they,

81
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.280
they wanted to make money and they, they do things to people just to make money,

82
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.960
not to make them better. That has happened.

83
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.440
I think there was something in India. If you look at bill gates, India,

84
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.270
I think I, I vaccines. Yeah. I, I mean, listen, I'm not making,

85
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.190
I'm not making this up. I understand. But do you understand what I'm saying?

86
00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:50.750
That you're saying something as a fact and you have literally no data. I,

87
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.830
I have the, I have the data. I just can't recall the exact name of it.

88
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.310
That doesn't mean it didn't happen well, but you don't know if it happened.

89
00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.790
If you can't. Well, I didn't go and investigate it data. Okay. Here we go.

90
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.460
Why is going for that? Thank you. Under fire from critics in India. Well,

91
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:10.260
let's read it funded two entities that have played a key role in

92
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:14.500
immunization program and are both under fire for conflict of interest. Okay.

93
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:17.980
It doesn't mean adverse reactions to vaccines 2009,

94
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:21.500
several schools for tribal children. Jesus Christ. We're.

95
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.290
Does that say those names?

96
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.810
The Kaman Kama? I don't even know Kama district. Yeah.

97
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:33.810
We'll just get that in Teang Ghana,

98
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.890
then a part of, uh,

99
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.930
undivided undre Prade became sites for

100
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.200
observational studies for a cervical cancer vaccine that was administered to

101
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.000
thousands of girls. So it's a HPV disease. That's a dangerous, uh, vaccine.

102
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.400
That's a dangerous vaccines. Oh, these girls are whores. Okay. Forget it. Sorry.

103
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.360
No, no, the vaccine's dangerous. Yeah. That HPV there's people have had, uh,

104
00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:59.120
adverse reaction to that. Uh, like a high number.

105
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.840
The girls were administered by the, uh, with, uh,

106
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.880
administered the human papilloma virus vaccine in three rounds. That,

107
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.320
that year under the supervision of state health department officials,

108
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.400
the vaccine used was a Gardasil manufactured by

109
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.670
Meck, Merck. Yeah. Months later, many girls started falling ill and, and,

110
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.990
and by 20 10, 5 of them died. Yeah. That's a, but that is a, uh, I get it.

111
00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:29.030
I that's a controversial vaccine period. I'm just more. It's good.

112
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.630
But it's one of those ones where there's a high number of adverse reactions,

113
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.790
estimated 14,000 children studying schools meant for tribal children.

114
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.940
So vaccinated with another band brand of HPV vaccine

115
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.020
cer cervix. I like when they're like on the nose like that. Oh,

116
00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:48.300
is it cervical cancer? Yeah. We'll call it cervix.

117
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.780
Cervix manufactured by GSK earlier in the week,

118
00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:55.300
the associated press reported that scores of teenage girls were hospitalized in

119
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:59.730
a small town north in more than Columbia with symptoms that parents

120
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.490
suspected could be adverse, adverse reaction to Gardisil. Mm.

121
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.330
So some people died from this vaccine, but it is it go Google, uh,

122
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.850
HPV vaccine, dangerous reactions. Cause I, I I've read that.

123
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.810
There's a certain percentage, whether it's, you know,

124
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.000
one 10th or I used whatever, when there's a, some people get,

125
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.960
when anyone stands to make billions of dollars and Institute

126
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:24.561
something,

127
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:29.120
that's going to be very widely accepted as now necessary for life.

128
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.720
You know, you have to ask questions about it.

129
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:34.120
According to HPV vaccine manufacturers,

130
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.640
the most common adverse reactions to Gar to include include pain, swelling,

131
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.590
redness, sting, bruising, bleeding out the injection site and headache, fever,

132
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:45.990
nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain. And it keeps going. It's not that bad.

133
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.870
I'm not saying that he's doing something inherently wrong,

134
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.830
but you have to watch people like that. And the fact that nobody knows,

135
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:55.190
like nobody knows he, you know, this is not a well known thing I understand,

136
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.380
but the idea that this is how he wants to make his money by vaccine,

137
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.260
there's a world that's increasingly run by billionaires whom

138
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.980
tell us what isn't isn't necessary and how things are gonna be. Right.

139
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.260
That's true. Whether they're in tech, whether they're in health,

140
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.220
whatever they are, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, these are billionaires.

141
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.500
Generally they give these Ted talks and stuff like that.

142
00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:15.100
People don't pay attention. What they're doing.

143
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.220
They're they influence the political system in ways that we have in,

144
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:23.090
in that we know about and don't know about. And you gotta watch these people.

145
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.130
I never know bill gates. Okay. Hold on. I have no idea what he wants to do.

146
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.530
Now we're talking about a totally different thing. And I agree with you.

147
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.330
See the thing is before 2000, let's say 2000,

148
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.050
no one had any inkling whatsoever that social media was gonna have an impact on

149
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.040
political realms on the way, you know, just language.

150
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.720
What, what sort of, uh, discourse was allowed? What wasn't allowed,

151
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.560
no one ever thought that, that this was gonna be an impact.

152
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.720
And that these companies would literally earn billions of dollars

153
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.360
by selling your data. Meaning what are you interested in?

154
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.080
What are you clicking on? Yeah. What are you going to? And that's what,

155
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.480
that's what they're getting their money from.

156
00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:04.600
There's a great podcast that Sam Harris put out.

157
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.000
I wish I could remember the guest,

158
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.800
but he was talking about how we didn't know that our data in terms of our search

159
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.520
history, uh, the stuff that we go to, where,

160
00:09:13.521 --> 00:09:15.430
where we travel to with Google maps,

161
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.310
we didn't know that that data was a commodity. Right?

162
00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:21.390
And so we signed off on one of the most valuable commodities in the world.

163
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.030
I think it's bigger than oil right now. It's it's gigantic. Yeah.

164
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.270
And these companies, not only do they gather out this commodity,

165
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.110
but then they use their influence to,

166
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.550
to influence social aspects of our culture.

167
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.540
The way we communicate what's allowed, what's not allowed.

168
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.020
And that's that's squirrely because these people are a lot of 'em are socially

169
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.140
inept. I mean, all this stuff you were talking about at the beginning,

170
00:09:44.141 --> 00:09:46.460
when you say, when they we're gonna gonna come to you, and they're gonna say,

171
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:50.500
you need a card, you need this, you need that. Uh, the free flow of travel,

172
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.340
how you're allowed to travel or around the country and the world.

173
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.100
A lot of these people,

174
00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:59.650
whether gates or whoever are going to have a huge input in those

175
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.770
laws that are made. And they're gonna think they're doing it for a good reason.

176
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.570
Of course not everybody does everything because they think they're doing it for

177
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:08.130
a good reason. Not necessarily, you know? Well, a lot of people do,

178
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.650
some people do. I bought my house cuz I believed it was gonna work.

179
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.970
&lt;laugh&gt; I bought it cuz I believed in home ownership. The point is that,

180
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.120
I just think you have to look into this. It's not my, my job. Yes.

181
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.760
To have every fact before I speak, but not it's my, it's not my job.

182
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.360
When you talk about bill gates and vaccines and things along those lines,

183
00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:29.800
you probably should. If bill gates wants to tweet at me and educate me later at

184
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.420
fear,

185
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.240
the real fear is that they're practicing with these vaccines on poor people.

186
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.670
That's what, Well's what they of. That's what they're doing. They're doing it.

187
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.790
They call the school a tribal girl school.

188
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.870
I know tribal tribal girl school. What kind of, I mean,

189
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.750
it's crazy native Americans. I mean, bill gates,

190
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:51.910
wouldn't be doing that in be air or Beverly Hills. You should, you know,

191
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.830
I agree. Grab kids, start grabbing those tos and putting needles in their face.

192
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.220
Grab those little Beverly kids, private schools.

193
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.300
I walk around every day and those little pieces of.

194
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.740
Give me a look cuz they know I shouldn't be there,

195
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:06.460
but it's close to my house where I have to walk.

196
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.980
We have to walk and get air and just see other people.
