00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.823
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 2>Here's what I'm worried about. I'm worried that they,</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.800
that it's now been proven that someone with a lot of money who's outside the

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.700
system can win and can actually become the president.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.970
The worry that I have is not just that someone worse than him tries to do it

6
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.010
again, but someone was like really, truly evil.

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.170
The other worry is that the other side tries to prevent that from happening and

8
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:33.150
by doing so they justify hamstringing democracy. Like they decide like,

9
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:34.770
look, we can't ever let this happen again.

10
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.940
So we need a concerted effort where we coordinate with the media,

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.440
we coordinate with the,

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.120
all of the different intelligence communities and we figure out a way to

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.133
pick,

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.210
pick the people that we want to win and attack the person that we don't,

15
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.990
because that's how banana republics get started. Okay.

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.880
And that's how people get assassinated.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.380
And that's how people justify a lot of wild they justify because they think

18
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.920
ultimately it's imperative for the future of our nation.

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.730
If this person doesn't win and our person gets in there and they think so,

20
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.480
so zealously that they're willing to do wild.

21
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.120
And that's what happens in other countries.

22
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:16.950
And we were talking before this podcast about,

23
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.870
they killed the president of Haiti yesterday.

24
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.540
<v 0>Yeah. That's um,</v>

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.430
would you say that I'm so disappointed in myself? Cause I just,

26
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.140
I just feel like, like, as a black person,

27
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.650
when I hear black news from a white person, like that I should know,

28
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.460
like I should have known before you got the president of the Haiti got

29
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.294
assassinated.

30
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.830
<v 1>To be honest, I'm really up on assassinations. I follow all the assassination,</v>

31
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.060
Twitter page I'm on assassination, Twitter.

32
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.050
<v 0>Sasha nation Twitter. I'm just guessing. Oh, okay. I was going to say.</v>

33
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.570
<v 1>I just pay attention to new. A squad of gunmen assassinated patient precedent.</v>

34
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.890
How do you say his name? Jovan Nell Moyes. Jamie,

35
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
I'm sorry. Did his wife and an overnight raid on his home,

36
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.680
on their home on Wednesday inflicting more chaos in the Caribbean country that

37
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:10.650
was already in during gang violence, soaring, inflation,

38
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.330
and protests of its increasingly authoritarian rule. Wow.

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.640
<v 0>Prime minister, claw Yosef.</v>

40
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.870
<v 1>Well, what's scary about this kind of stuff is, uh, you know,</v>

41
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.490
who knows who's going to take over now. You know,

42
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:28.830
when someone assassinates the president,

43
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.070
they don't want that president in there for various reasons.

44
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.720
So who's kind of coming now,

45
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.990
how much worse is it going to be for the Haitian people? How much, what,

46
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:39.030
what kind of person is going to try to take over now?

47
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.220
<v 0>I feel like it's been pretty bad for Haitian people for,</v>

48
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.970
I don't know if it's ever been good. Well,

49
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.160
I was telling you earlier that that's the first slave.

50
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.440
That's the only slave rebellion in history that works.

51
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.070
<v 1>It says a boat Edmond.</v>

52
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.880
The Haitian ambassador to the United States said the attack on the 53 year old

53
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.190
Moise. Uh, I'm not saying it's, I don't know if I'm saying his name. Right?

54
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.040
Moisi M O I S E was carried out by foreign mercenaries and professional

55
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:06.874
killers.

56
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.930
Well-orchestrated and that there were masquerading as agents of the us drug

57
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.220
enforcement administration.

58
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.900
The DEA has an office in the Haitian Capitol to assist the government in counter

59
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.480
narcotics programs, according to the U S embassy.

60
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.350
<v 0>Well, if drugs were legal over there,</v>

61
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:24.970
they wouldn't have had this know that that's not true.

62
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.633
<v 1>Rather than whacking people.</v>

63
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.540
<v 0>Or man, but see, I'll be on some game of Thrones. Like I don't,</v>

64
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.180
I don't even trust this. I'm like maybe he had something to do with it.

65
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.590
<v 1>You know? So true. You never know it's it's so hard to know when,</v>

66
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:41.650
by the time the news gets to someone like you or me who the?

67
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.190
<v 0>No. Yeah. It's the steel. Who knows? Cause well that that's,</v>

68
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.840
what's so funny to me is I feel like where does we're the same as China where we

69
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.520
it's just that we're all convinced.

70
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.720
We're all convinced that we're not being controlled,

71
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.140
but they just have a different method of doing it. You know? Like, oh,

72
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.900
well over there the government was straight up. Just be like, yeah,

73
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.680
we're spying on you. Yeah. And over here, they're still spying on you. They,

74
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.780
you just convinced that they aren't or that it's not so bad,

75
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:11.650
but they it's the same outcome. They know everything you're doing.

76
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.660
And every move you make, we just feel free. Like,

77
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:16.990
like the you brought up about Edward Snowden, right? Yeah.

78
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.640
You would expect that kind of information to make people rebel. But,

79
00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:23.170
but some.

80
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.090
<v 1>People rebelled, some people were furious.</v>

81
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.680
<v 0>Well, I heard that I heard Julian Assange, like he had a quote that was like,</v>

82
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:30.610
I don't know what the exact,

83
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.190
but the sentiment was just that all people really care about is their

84
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:40.720
sense of freedom, not their actual freedoms. So you can tell a bunch,

85
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.840
you can tell a, you can tell a bunch of. The government is spiraling.

86
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:46.420
You collect an, all your messages, listen to all your phone calls,

87
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.750
all your purchases, everything, but you feel free and people don't give a.

88
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.040
Cause you feel free. More people gave a about having to wear a mask.

89
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.290
Then the government spying on them because that makes you feel less free. Yes.

90
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.610
And that's what we're lazy.

91
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.820
<v 1>And the thing about the government having that power,</v>

92
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:07.150
it's actually bad for them. Cause it's not,

93
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.990
it's too much responsibility because you have to lie about it. First of all,

94
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.700
because you're not supposed to have that kind of power.

95
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.420
And that's supposed to be able to just spy on people randomly because at the end

96
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.590
of the day, the government is comprised of people and we're people.

97
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.700
So it's just people spying on people and you're doing it through initials. Oh,

98
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.540
where the FBI and the NSA and the DEA and the Bubba. He just,

99
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.340
people spying on people,

100
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.580
reinforcing laws that were written down on paper,

101
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.850
by who the knows who and who knows who the knows.

102
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:39.340
If those laws are valid in 2021 anymore,

103
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.150
with all the technology we have today with the abilities to do things today are

104
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:47.230
so much greater than what these laws were established about.

105
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:51.340
Like in the 1970s or 1960s. And even then.

106
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.380
<v 0>Yeah, I'm on some George Carlos, it's your freedom is an illusion.</v>

107
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.100
The only thing that is comfort and violence, you, you have,

108
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.280
you have comforts and you either have the, you to have the,

109
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.170
the ability to use violence to maintain it or not. But that's really all it is.

110
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.620
It's like, if you, you can, you can create this utopia with all these rules,

111
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.870
but if you can't enforce the rules, it doesn't matter.

112
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:19.460
So you violence will always be a part of the world. Authoritarianism.

113
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.380
<v 1>I just comes to violence. I honestly, in this country,</v>

114
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:29.300
I'm almost less concerned because if it comes to violence in this country,

115
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.163
I just,

116
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.150
I can't imagine how the government is legitimately going to take

117
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:35.984
over.

118
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.880
When a lot of the people that are actually in the military would

119
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.010
have to turn on the people that they grew up with.

120
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.860
They would have to turn on the people that they,

121
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.610
that they love in their communities because the government tells them to like

122
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:53.600
the end of the day, the people that protect us, it's the military,

123
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.650
the government of the people that direct the military. But you're,

124
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.690
there's a push comes to shove there. You, you,

125
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.640
you're never really gonna take over this country in a military way because the

126
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.490
military, the people that will not want you to do that.

127
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.000
So they wouldn't trust these Weasley politicians that would try to do that.

128
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.580
<v 0>Yeah. I think at the end of the day,</v>

129
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.390
more people would challenge who

130
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.650
they'd be more attached to who is in charge of them,

131
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.290
then the cous president or who's in the government. Yeah.

132
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.153
Well that would be harder.

133
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.140
<v 1>It'd be really hard to get the government to control the military,</v>

134
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:34.010
to the point where the military turns on regular people really hard because

135
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:37.730
they're not, the idea is like that the elites are going to control the world,

136
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.150
but the elites are not the military. There are elite human beings.

137
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.950
There are elite soldiers,

138
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.950
but there are not elites in terms of like the 1% of the world.

139
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.570
They're regular folks for the most part.

140
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.330
So getting regular folks to turn on regular folks,

141
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.420
because the elites tell them to, that's one of those weird,

142
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.280
like how do you do this things?

143
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.410
So the way to control populations is through propaganda and reeducation of

144
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.540
their youth, turning people on each other.

145
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:07.100
Like if you really wanted to up a future community, you would, uh, you know,

146
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.290
you'd distribute propaganda to their children,

147
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.190
teach their children to feel bad about themselves. And that this, this,

148
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.900
this country and this society is a mistake in a disaster and the worst thing to

149
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:19.670
ever happen. And we need to burn it down.

150
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.750
If you taught that to kids over and over and over again, those kids grow up.

151
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.580
Well, you have a real shot at things up because you can ruin all of the

152
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:32.960
structures that have kept societies together. And then if you accompany that,

153
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.550
if you company that with things like de fund the police, whoa,

154
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:41.870
and we're not going to prosecute anybody for anything less than 950 bucks. Oh,

155
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.600
now you got a little funny coding. Yeah. You got open looting. You got chaos.

156
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.760
The cops scared arrest people.
