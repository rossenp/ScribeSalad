00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. You know, uh, I gotta give you some thanks for, for, for,</v>

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.720
even for doing it. I, before the fight happened,

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.120
I had kind of already had in my mind, I'm like, okay,

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.880
it's been a year since we last kind of did this. And mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

6
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.200
it was right after the Barboza fight. And I was like, okay, I'm a, I'm,

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.240
I'm a get through the fight and then I'm gonna do this.

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.590
&lt;affirmative&gt; the result. Wasn't exactly what I, what I wanted,

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.470
you know what I mean? And it made me hesitant about doing it,

10
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.390
but I was like, uh, this is the story, you know what I mean? Yeah. And,

11
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:36.150
and this is, as I said, kind of like was upset at myself for a few days.

12
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:38.230
Eventually I just kind of got over and I'm like, you know what I said,

13
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:39.064
I was gonna do it before.

14
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.940
I'm not about to be no sore as loser and you know yeah.

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.300
<v 0>Why does that? Well, like I said, I, I love you. Whether you win or lose,</v>

16
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.540
I I'm just, you know, it's,

17
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.340
it's a giant part of the game. Yeah. Half the game is losing. Yeah.

18
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.820
Someone has to win. Someone has to lose. If you watch a fight someone's losing,

19
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.500
unless.

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.420
<v 1>It's a draw. And I figure it's,</v>

21
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:03.850
it's all about how you and how you take it into the next fight.

22
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.690
And really when you look at it, I mean, it sucks. It really does. And I,

23
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.530
I hate it. Like, and it, like, it's something that boils up inside of me. Like,

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.850
I, I go over, I replayed a fight a million times in my head and I,

25
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.970
I just hate losing. And I hate that feeling, but it's just the reality.

26
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.240
And it's like, it it's just real life and just real life. It's.

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.640
<v 0>Nothing you can do about, there's nothing you do once it's over. Yeah. The only,</v>

28
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.640
only thing you can do is learn and grow. Exactly. Yeah.

29
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.280
And the guy you fought as a stud, I mean, he thought fought Hael dos.

30
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.360
He's a legitimate world champion fighter.

31
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.600
<v 1>Yeah. When, when I was approached with the fight and,</v>

32
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.520
and kind of start really diving into it and really looking at him,

33
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:45.070
like I always like a really big challenge and that one was definitely one,

34
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.630
you know, he had already had a lot of fights, uh, that went five rounds.

35
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.510
He had fought, he's fought pretty much everybody, you know, uh,

36
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.910
Kamar Uzman was his last fight. Uh, Kobe Covington,

37
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:58.230
he had fought KIB he already fought like a lot of, uh, top,

38
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:01.710
top guys and for five rounds. So I, I knew what type of challenge it was.

39
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.500
It's just, I hold myself at a high esteem. So I was like, you know what,

40
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.500
I'm, I'm just ready to do it. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you,

41
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.060
the, the fight itself was, was good, but either way,

42
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.980
I'm gonna learn from it and, and, and grow from it.

43
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:19.660
And I still got a whole long, long road ahead of me. So.

44
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 0>You do have a long road ahead of you, but, you know,</v>

45
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:24.530
as we're talking about that long road, it's new up on you real quick.

46
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:25.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And before you know it, you know,

47
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:29.490
you're 37 years old trying to figure out if you still wanna fight. Yeah. That's,

48
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:32.490
that's how it happens to guys. I've seen it happen to guys. Yeah.

49
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.170
<v 1>So I feel like if you approach it smart, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm,</v>

50
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.570
&lt;affirmative&gt;, it could still get done, which is what I'm trying to do. Right.

51
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.690
Uh, I kind of already knew that I needed to make some changes and, and,

52
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.360
and do some things D um, even before this fight and before my last one, too.

53
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.480
Um, but, you know, I just was like, okay,

54
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:52.360
I'm gonna just get through this one and then I'll do it.

55
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:55.040
And now I'm gonna get through this one and then I'll do it. But, you know,

56
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.240
that's kind of a big wake up call to just like, all right.

57
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.840
It's time to get outside of the comfort zone and, and,

58
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.440
and kind of do something different and, and kind of do what I already know.

59
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.310
I gotta do.

60
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.160
<v 0>What did you think was gonna happen in the fight and what was surprising?</v>

61
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.080
<v 1>I didn't think that he would be able to keep the, the pace for sure. Um,</v>

62
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.720
but what surprised me was how smart he was and, and how, uh,

63
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.870
he beat me tactically more than anything is, you know, when I was going,

64
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.110
he wasn't doing, you know, and he, and he kind of, he,

65
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:27.790
he controlled the pace better than I thought he was going to. You know,

66
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.270
I thought once I set that pace that he was gonna be right there with me,

67
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.470
but then a a as it got going, I started to realize, oh,

68
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:36.390
he's not really expending much energy.

69
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.780
He's kind of just letting me burn out my energy. And, and,

70
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.980
and then he took his moment when, when I made the, the last mistake.

71
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.300
And really when it boiled down to it,

72
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.780
I lost one position at the end there mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

73
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.780
where I went for a take down and, and, you know, nine times outta 10,

74
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.700
when I go and club back, the guy hits his knees. Uh, but he,

75
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.450
he just stayed on his feet and stepped out. And when I, my knees just like,

76
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.090
lost that position and, and against a guy like that, so dangerous,

77
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.570
a black belt and his, uh, is, is so good.

78
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.610
I knew one slip up was gonna be all I needed. And I think he knew that too.

79
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.330
And he was just kind of waiting, buying his time and hoping that I slip up.

80
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.130
<v 0>It seemed like you expended a lot of energy early on.</v>

81
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.770
And it seemed like by the time he got the submission, you were fairly tired.

82
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.440
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, uh, fall, you always used to tell me this and it, it was always,</v>

83
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.440
uh, uh, there's tired and can, and tired, and can't, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

84
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:34.200
you know, it it's a fight it's, you're gonna be tired. Right, right. Uh, but I,

85
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.280
I still do think I had my legs underneath me and, and, and still could,

86
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.550
it's just, I could have played it better.

87
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:46.150
Tactically I could have had had, you know, more time when I wasn't just going,

88
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.830
going, like you said, especially in that first round, uh,

89
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.350
if I would've had a little bit better experience maybe, or, or, or something, I,

90
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.790
you know, I don't know. I I'll figure that out, but, uh,

91
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.430
I could have played it a little smarter, like he did.

92
00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.290
<v 0>Are,</v>

93
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.220
do you have a person that's giving you strategy or are you sort of making your

94
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.420
strategy up on the fly?

95
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.700
<v 1>That's one of the things that, that's kind of the main thing that, that, um, uh,</v>

96
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.620
I, Robert Fallis was that guy for me. Yeah. Uh, until he passed and,

97
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.340
and then I kind of just picked up the ball and, you know, I,

98
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.460
I understand fighting, um, but yeah, it's, it's mostly me doing the strategy.

99
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.370
And right now that that's where I'm in the limbo of,

100
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:28.210
of trying to find somebody who already has that experience and has already been

101
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:30.330
there and done it, uh, to tell me a little better.

102
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.530
<v 0>Strategy. Yeah. I think it's so critical, man. I really do.</v>

103
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:36.290
And we had this conversation over the phone about it. I think that, uh,

104
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.850
a young fighter with a lot of potential like yourself,

105
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.450
there's a reason why fighters have trainers. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

106
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:43.040
there's a reason fighters have head coaches.

107
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.720
It's re it's not because they want to give up all their money. Yeah.

108
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:49.520
It's because it, it helps. And you, you can delegate those that,

109
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.600
that thought process to a master,

110
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.560
someone who's a master of martial arts who understands positions,

111
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:58.320
who understands strategies, seen guys tired, seeing guys good,

112
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.960
seeing you in the gym, seeing you grind, understands your skillset,

113
00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:03.080
understands how you are when you come in.

114
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.920
Perfect understands how you are when you come in tired, you know? So that,

115
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:08.200
that is just giant.

116
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.320
And having someone who understands you psychologically as well, and,

117
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.920
and also having someone that you respect and that you want to impress all those

118
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:16.754
things are huge. Huge.

119
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.030
<v 1>Yeah. It's, it's, it's a big one. Uh, especially like you said,</v>

120
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:23.230
being able to talk to you too, and, and being able to understand you.

121
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.150
I think that's what Rob did really well. Yes. Uh, and, and he kind of,

122
00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:31.470
he was so good. He kind of like reeled me in a little bit. Like, I I'm the type,

123
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.190
I I'm just kind of go, go, go.

124
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.300
And I kind of think higher to myself than maybe even

125
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.140
I am, but that's just how I am. So, but that's how you have confidence, right?

126
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.980
Yeah. So, but he was the type to kind of reel me in and,

127
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.820
and he used to even tell me like, Hey, you don't gotta get hit so much. Or,

128
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:48.780
you know, I'll, I'll stand in front of a guy. And just like,

129
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.180
especially when I was younger, it was a little even worse. And, you know,

130
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:55.380
cause mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's just how I be feeling. Right. But, you know,

131
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.330
he was kind of the type to, to reel me in him more than anything.

132
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.850
It's not like he would tell me one specific techniques or, or it,

133
00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:04.810
it was even about his style or anything like that.

134
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:06.530
It was just the way that he was able to,

135
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.650
to kind of get through to me and kind of make me understand what it is that I'm

136
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:12.440
trying to do.

137
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.530
<v 0>Yeah. And you guys, you guys had just a good relationship too.</v>

138
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:19.600
He was such a good guy, man. Yeah. Such to good dude to,

139
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.720
I mean, just, just losing him. I mean,

140
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.680
it was devastating for the whole mixed martial arts world, but losing him for,

141
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.280
you had to be a real, just a, a,

142
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.960
a giant change in your career.

143
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.503
<v 1>Yeah. It's a.</v>

144
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.120
<v 0>Which fight did he die before?</v>

145
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.750
<v 1>Uh, he died right after the Tony fight &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

146
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.670
which is a whole nother piece of it. You know, I, I know he had a whole lot of,

147
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.110
uh, uh, things going on early in his life, especially, you know,

148
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.470
with his family. And, um, when we went to his,

149
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.470
his Memorial and people were kind of explaining, you know,

150
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.390
what it's like growing up in a, uh, uh, he grew up, uh, Jehovah witness.

151
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.900
So he is like explaining what, like to grow up like that and, you know,

152
00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:03.980
to try and get away from that and having your family disown you. Yeah.

153
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.980
And how like that can I, I, I, I understand, I understand importance of family,

154
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.860
so I, I can get that, but then even I'm like, man, you know,

155
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:16.460
they would tell us, see, we were more so keeping him alive longer than,

156
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:19.220
than anything. So I'm like, man, if I would've won that fight with Tony,

157
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:22.330
it's like, would he, should, would he still be here? You know what I mean? Wow.

158
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.210
Those are the type of like, like did I do it to myself almost,

159
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.890
but I already know I'm already at the point where I kind of got over it a little

160
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:37.610
bit and I kind of understand that I'm not gonna be able to replace him by any

161
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:38.770
means. Uh,

162
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.920
but I am gonna have to get that person who can still speak to me in that

163
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:47.960
same light, you know, the only way that I'm gonna make it right.

164
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.320
Is to win that title and, and do it for him. You know, he,

165
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.800
he kind of saw that for me.

166
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.880
And he was kind of the one to give me that confidence to say,

167
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.720
cuz he he's already coached multiple UFC champions. So when he told me that,

168
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.440
that he could see me being a champ, that really like, I was like, oh, okay.

169
00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:08.400
Like I didn't really, like, I, I kind of got it a little bit,

170
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.160
but I didn't really know it until like he gave me that kind of confidence.

171
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.150
Right. Um, so the only thing that's gonna make it right.

172
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.630
Is to go out there and win that title. And that's that's if I got it,

173
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.750
wouldn't no matter what I gotta do, I'm not stopping until I do it.

174
00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:21.830
So are you 100%.

175
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.470
<v 2>Committed to one.</v>

176
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.550
<v 1>70 Now? Yeah, I think so. I think it's, I think it's, I think it's right. Um,</v>

177
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.430
you look like you're about one.

178
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.263
<v 2>90 Now, right?</v>

179
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.750
<v 1>Yeah. Just about I'm I'm about 180 5, 180 6, um,</v>

180
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:35.380
which is normally what I would be about getting ready for a 55 pound five too.

181
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.620
Um, actually when I stepped into the cage, I was lighter, uh,

182
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:44.180
going into this fight than I was for some of my, my 55 pound fights really.
