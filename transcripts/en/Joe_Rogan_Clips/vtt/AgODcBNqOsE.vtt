WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's like when we,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.550
when we would do the open Anthony show. Okay. Or like Howard stern,

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.250
like when he would do back in the day, when he would do live remotes,

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.460
I love Howard stern. I love opening it that he put, like,

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:19.260
if I was a fan of this show, I don't have time and I'm not going to some mall

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.610
in the middle of the day blowing off work or whatever the cause I'm trying to

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.660
get my own go. The people that show up, you love them. Cause they're diehards,

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.530
but they're out of their minds. So, um,

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.570
it just has to do with that. I'm kind of, um,

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.080
it doesn't necessarily have to do with me, but it does.

11
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.190
It's one of one of those things.

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.710
And it's also another way of saying that I'm full of.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.130
<v 1>And you know, paper tiger. Yeah, exactly.</v>

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.760
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.620
<v 1>So there'll be an Anthony Daisy.</v>

16
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:51.840
Remember when they used to have a stadium seating,

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.350
like small stadium seating in the studio and guys would come in and they would

18
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:58.680
let fans come in the studio and sit and watch a show.

19
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.090
Those are the good old days. Yep.

20
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.560
<v 0>I still, I, every time I go to New York, I, I there's, it's like a void.</v>

21
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.730
Uh, somebody said it perfectly like, you know, Phantom limb, you know,

22
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.180
that's what it feels like. And you get, oh, I'm in New York and I'm going to.

23
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.190
<v 1>Uh, it doesn't exist.</v>

24
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.790
That was the last show that I used to get up early for Owen.

25
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.850
And when they were together before Anthony got kicked out and

26
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.030
Opie and Jimmy and Anthony were all together, it was amazing. That was.

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.330
<v 0>It's like seeing a band with all the original members on the first</v>

28
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.220
couple of albums tour before David Lee goes solo. And then, you know.

29
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.290
<v 1>Well the first guy poured it over to XM too. Right. They were the first,</v>

30
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.920
or I think they were, were they before Howard or around the same time,

31
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.900
but they were.

32
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.480
<v 0>They would have first say, I think my name is, they were on.</v>

33
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.580
That was the one that was XM. And then serious.

34
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.870
<v 1>Before like Howard was on serious, they were on XM. And then they merged. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.970
But they were the first show.

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.860
The first radio show that let you just around like

37
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
Howard is amazing. Right? Greatest radio personality of all time by far.

38
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.950
But Howard controlled the show. He had yawn, he had the board in front of him.

39
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:15.390
He controlled the board. He asked the questions, he had an agenda and you know,

40
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.280
he was trying to make the show as entertaining as possible. And they got ready.

41
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.930
Yeah. Oh, and a, you just it. Come on in guys. Come on. And Patrice,

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.560
come on a bill, Ari Shaffir have a seat and everybody you'd be in the room.

43
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.600
Breakage your vase, 10 people in the room.

44
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.310
Norton Norton would be doing creepy characters. I mean,

45
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.350
it was the, it was, it.

46
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.290
<v 0>Was the birth. Jimmy was my favorite one. Oh.</v>

47
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.090
<v 1>He was trying to talk to you.</v>

48
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.930
<v 0>I don't remember. He didn't do it enough. That's like a deep cut.</v>

49
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:47.670
Jim Norton jive talked. Jimmy was one of my favorite ones. It was so silly,

50
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.990
which is my favorite thing. Ever.

51
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.420
Highly intelligent people being silly is one of my favorite things ever. And I,

52
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.010
Jim was the, in Patrice was sort of the king of that. Oh yeah.

53
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.650
Super, super, super next level smart and just silly,

54
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.443
really silly. I,

55
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.730
when Howard went from terrestrial radio to,

56
00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:12.130
to serious, it was like, he died because I didn't have,

57
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.780
until I got serious in my car, that's like my favorite thing about my car.

58
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.170
Cause I listened to them every morning if I, you know, and I gotta get them up.

59
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.130
And it's like the old days,

60
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.240
like when I first came to New York and I get to listen to it, they went.

61
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.940
<v 1>Podcast. Whether they realize it or not,</v>

62
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.830
they were the birth of podcasts because Ona was like a podcast like this

63
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.640
podcast. Like we didn't even talk about what we're going to talk about.

64
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.570
No discussion whatsoever. I mean, obviously you and I don't have to do that.

65
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.690
Right. But we wouldn't. Anyway, we just come in here and shoot the.

66
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.430
That's all they ever did. Come on in. Shoot the. What the going on? You know,

67
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.490
Anthony would have a gun on him. Look shine.

68
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.360
That's a gun everywhere this day,

69
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.130
that guy doesn't get in the middle of the night.

70
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.110
<v 0>Favorite a deep cut. Anthony character was the guy with giantism.</v>

71
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.760
Did you ever hear him do that guy? No. Ah, no, he did. I can't do it.

72
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:09.250
You know the giantism and they get that voice. You know,

73
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.550
Tom R was pretty tall. I can't do what

74
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.580
you would do this thing. I know he's going there dragging. And then like,

75
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:20.380
something like that would happen.

76
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.200
And then it just felt like two in the afternoon somehow.

77
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.990
And you look at your watch. It was like 7 0 2 in the morning.

78
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.850
<v 1>Do you remember when Anthony did lie from the compound? He did. Uh,</v>

79
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.680
he built a studio in his.

80
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.260
<v 0>That's when I was like going, this is not going to last,</v>

81
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:39.010
this guy's literally building. It's just like,

82
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.370
it's like we're in business selling ice cream and I'm building my own ice cream

83
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:46.990
parlor at home. No, no job. I'm in this business with you. I knew like,

84
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.780
like this is going to fall apart. You know?

85
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.530
What's funny is what did that show in is also what made it great. Yeah. Like,

86
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:56.290
you know, they used to play the, oh. They used to play the sorry about that.

87
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:00.100
They used to play the, uh, the Clint Eastwood, uh, thing.

88
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.400
I always thought the theme to that show should have been the wheels on the bus

89
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:08.140
go around. Cause it was just like, you know, the thing was,

90
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.970
you were on the bus, but you were outside at your head. It was you almost like,

91
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.510
uh, I always felt like when I went in there that Raiders of the lost Ark,

92
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:16.751
you know,

93
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:21.670
when Harrison Ford's on the hood and you're grabbing onto the foot not to go

94
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:25.840
underneath it and some days y'all hung on and then other days, yeah,

95
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.140
except it didn't have the happy ending and you didn't have the whip to hang on

96
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.093
to what you just.

97
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.350
<v 1>Do you remember the day we were there and pat from Knocky threw up in,</v>

98
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.550
um.

99
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.670
<v 0>Duffy's done. That was your idea. Yeah. And then that dude Thanh,</v>

100
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.030
Nathaniel came, he was the one that coined it. The baby,

101
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.660
I got credit for some reason. I think Dan's voice sounded like me. He came home,

102
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:46.810
he.

103
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.820
<v 1>Came home. I've been saying, it's, you know.</v>

104
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.770
<v 0>Your idea was your idea. You were like the only thing they could top this</v>

105
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.390
for those who didn't see it, it's such a brilliant idea.

106
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.260
It was the eggnog drinking contest. And you had to do a double shot.

107
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:07.520
Like it was bourbon, but it was eggnog like every 30 seconds. Well,

108
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.680
Panda returning champion was pat from monarchy who had diabetes and

109
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:14.180
lost the total. It already,

110
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.550
it was just sitting there and then he continued to drink it.

111
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.600
Oh yeah. To do the bit that you came up with. Oh, I mean,

112
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.480
there has to be like a, um, you know,

113
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:30.710
when like a broadcaster can get into the sports hall of fame, just because,

114
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.520
you know, he never played the game, but he, he like, you know,

115
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.440
because of what he added to it,

116
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.590
I always set the pat menarche should have been like, they should have been like,

117
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.080
like a, like a chick Hearn, Johnny,

118
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:45.740
most sort of award that he can with his,

119
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.240
his health continued to drink. I remember when,

120
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:55.020
when people posted that video, everyone was saying fake, this isn't real.

121
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.160
And that may be a joint real. I was like, no, that was real. I was there.

122
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.940
<v 1>There was plastic bags all over the ground. I remember they, they,</v>

123
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.440
they put plastic everywhere,

124
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.510
all over the ground because they knew that people were gonna throw up.

125
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.830
They had the garbage can ready.

126
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.820
And then pat Duffy leans his head over the edge of the garbage can.

127
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.050
And then pat from Monache just here, come, you see them. Ah,

128
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.160
and then it keeps coming. It keeps coming like way crazier.

129
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.080
<v 0>He just went, just came out and then somebody kept shutting it off.</v>

130
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.030
And every time, I mean, it was like, uh, it is, I can't,

131
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.880
I can't watch, watch this. You know, I still can't tell the story.

132
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:33.590
If I tell it in detail, I started.

133
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.520
<v 1>Oh, see, fear factor killed all that in me. I never.</v>

134
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.410
<v 0>I'll tell the one that makes me gag.</v>

135
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.120
I start to gag is when there was the dude

136
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.353
watch it.

137
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.630
<v 1>It was true. It was tremendous.</v>

138
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.820
<v 0>Do I say it? I'll say it real quick. Just go through it.</v>

139
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.193
<v 1>Easily. You tear it up.</v>

140
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.740
<v 0>There was a dude who got knocked out. So then what he did was he started,</v>

141
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.510
he puked into a pitcher,

142
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.590
he puked into a pitcher and then he was drinking his own puke,

143
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:08.660
trying to make the other people pukes.

144
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.480
So then somebody dared this guy who had to take a swig from it.

145
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.080
And he had like this hipster Viking level beard, and he

146
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.280
can't do it. I can't do it.

147
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.170
This is like 10 years later he took this Viking level swig. He just,

148
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.830
oh, so he gave himself like kind of like a facial with it.

149
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:35.300
And then he puked into the pitcher, I think. And I remember it was in his beard.

150
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.030
There's a point in that podcast, in that pocket.

151
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.590
And in that show where I almost puked.

152
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.190
<v 1>Yeah. Does the crazy thing about seeing.</v>

153
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.200
<v 0>Oh, Bill's going to go bills. And I was like hanging on to the table.</v>

154
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.200
<v 1>Yeah. We didn't realize that at the time.</v>

155
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.210
But those are some of the greatest moments of our life.

156
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.770
<v 0>You know, you've got to forgive, forgive.</v>

157
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.910
<v 1>Yourself that because you were in the moment. Oh yeah.</v>

158
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.020
I was feeling like melancholy when I was in Vegas and I had, you know,

159
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.590
I had this re uh, sitting in my room, smoking a cigar with, uh, Bobby Kelly,

160
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:10.950
Rick Dellia, you know, uh, from Boston scene. Right. Uh,

161
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.390
and we were sitting and I was looking down at the strip before they came over.

162
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.050
And I was thinking about the first time I came out, there was right,

163
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.080
right before they imploded the sands or the dunes or something.

164
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.500
And they were starting to implode those old ones. And, uh,

165
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.940
just walking up and down the strip in the reel was the new hot one,

166
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.470
uh, uh,

167
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.360
casino and just all the great times that I in crazy stories and all that.

168
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.430
And then just walking around Vegas,

169
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.940
being old now and seeing all these young people like,

170
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.790
and you want to stop them and just be like, dude,

171
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.530
if there's any way to take this in, do it. Because you know, at my age,

172
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:51.960
if I was to continue doing that, you just a creep.

173
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:57.090
I really respect younger people where it's just like, this is their time.

174
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.520
Let them have it. That's their club.

175
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.760
Don't be standing in there with your white whiskers and. Listen,

176
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.920
trying to listen to their DJ music, just get the out of there.

177
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.930
Let them enjoy their generation's drugs and let them have their stories and

178
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.710
just, yeah. Yeah. There's no way you could impart that on anyone though.

179
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.990
Tell them to soak it up and enjoy it.

180
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.560
I had moments where I remember thinking when I was young, like, wow,

181
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:23.394
this is a war.

182
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.100
<v 0>Well, I remember you that night after the, the, uh,</v>

183
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:30.900
the baby bird you were at Caroline's you are Caroline's.

184
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.570
And I went down there and you had this debt, that ground in your face.

185
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.140
You're like, that was great radio. I was just like,

186
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.470
I remember I told that I told the whole story. I came home,

187
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.230
Nia just started living with me and her friend was there and I was

188
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:52.140
telling them the story of what I saw that day.

189
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.780
And I was laying on the ground crying, laughing, telling,

190
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.030
and then this guy did this. Do you remember the guy who was, um,

191
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.550
he would do his shot and when anybody would puke,

192
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:05.790
he would stand over in the corner and not face them. He was facing the corner.

193
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:10.530
So we started calling him Blair, which everybody got there.

194
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.190
So I'm crying, laughing, and then gagging, as I'm telling the story,

195
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.270
and then they weren't laughing, which made it even funnier to me.

196
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.540
And then I just remember a friend at one point just was like, she was like,

197
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.180
where do they find these people? And then that was,

198
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:27.720
that just sent me over the top. I was like, I don't know, just crying, laughing.
