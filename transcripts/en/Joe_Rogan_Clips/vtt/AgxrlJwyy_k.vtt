1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>And that's a, is that, is John Siena in trouble for selling his forge?</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.610
I don't think.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.260
<v 1>So. I don't think the contract is.</v>

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.360
<v 0>Enforceable. You don't think so? I I'm.</v>

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.260
<v 1>Just going by what I've.</v>

6
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.240
<v 0>Read, tell it, tell people what the story is.</v>

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.370
<v 1>So to get one of the new Ford GTS, right? Um, it's,</v>

8
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.680
what's called a homologation race car. Okay.

9
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.430
So they wanted to go when the 24 hours of Lamar in a certain class,

10
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
the LM GTE class, in order to race in that class,

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.880
it has to be a street car, right?

12
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.340
So you have to build a certain number of street cars.

13
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.470
You can't just build a dedicated race car.

14
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.160
That would be called the prototype class. Okay. So they had to build,

15
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.150
I think the number is 499, that's 400 and something 4 50, 4 99,

16
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:46.860
whatever it is for decides that the demand will outstrip the supply

17
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.230
and there rather than, you know,

18
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:53.280
highest bittering or whatever they make you like apply. So you,

19
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.350
you have to be a social media star or a celebrity or

20
00:00:58.351 --> 00:00:59.850
someone you had to like,

21
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.740
tell them why you should have a Ford GT and what you were going to do with it,

22
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:07.470
and how you were going to share your Ford GT with the world.

23
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.270
And then they would decide that you had earned the right to buy their

24
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.550
$450,000 car. Jesus.

25
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.640
And it came with a contract that you couldn't sell it for two years.

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.070
They didn't want people flipping them. Right.

27
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.610
Which apparently is exactly what John's seen when it did.

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.700
<v 0>Must be so rich. Like why would,</v>

29
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:33.840
why would he violate the contract for a couple of years?

30
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.010
<v 1>I've never met John CCC. Huge. Is he a really.</v>

31
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.330
<v 0>Enormous, how huge is he? Like high, enormous while he's just enormous,</v>

32
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.830
like width. I bet he's probably only like six, three or 6, 4 64.

33
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.610
<v 1>He can't fit in it. So if he took delivery and can't fit in it,</v>

34
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.710
that's probably why he would get rid of it rather than.

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.830
<v 0>Tall. Mr. Scene is I'm.</v>

36
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.660
<v 1>Six, three. When my head hit the ceiling.</v>

37
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.150
<v 0>Oh, that's probably exactly what he's probably six, two.</v>

38
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:04.860
At least he seems like a guy who should be even longer and taller than he

39
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:06.210
is because he's so thick.

40
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.860
It's almost like they chopped off a foot of his arms in every place on a

41
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:15.360
giant. But his wrists are like tree trunks. Hilarious. Six foot, two 50. Yeah.

42
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.230
So.

43
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.160
<v 1>He probably be close.</v>

44
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.870
<v 0>It'd be close. Six foot, two or six foot, six foot, 250 pounds. Oh, he's.</v>

45
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
<v 1>Shorter. Shorter than I thought. Well, I don't know why he sold it, but he did.</v>

46
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.440
<v 0>Maybe, even for him, if it's two inches for you, maybe he felt squashed.</v>

47
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.020
<v 1>Look, I drove it for one day. I don't know what it,</v>

48
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.360
what kind of sacrifices to buy it, but I.

49
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.210
<v 0>Think like me might be a good car for you. Good for you.</v>

50
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.870
<v 1>So the seed is fixed and the pedals and steering wheel are adjustable.</v>

51
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.970
You can adjust the seat. How bizarre?

52
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.120
<v 0>Yeah. The pedals come to you. Yeah. I don't think I like that.</v>

53
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.120
<v 1>That's what you gotta do, man. It's what you have to do. Cause the car,</v>

54
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.490
the shape of the car dictates that the seat back angles.

55
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.530
<v 0>I can't, but camp can't you just make the seat, slide up.</v>

56
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.410
Put the seat on school.

57
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.560
<v 1>Like a seat. No, you can't. The car is so low. You did see a seat.</v>

58
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.880
Rail is like inches.

59
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 0>Precious inches. Precious inches. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.020
<v 1>The roof is 43 inches from the ground. That's like this. Whoa, it's.</v>

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.250
<v 0>So low.</v>

62
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.240
<v 1>It's that low? It's 43 inches from the roof to the ground. Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.590
Compared to all the car at one Lamar, by the way in the year was supposed to,

64
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.130
wow.

65
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.110
You park it next to a nine 11 and nine 11 is like six inches taller

66
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.100
than one of these things. If that makes a really big difference.

67
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.130
The 24 hours of Lamar, you're talking 200 mile an hour straightaway speeds.

68
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:31.630
Like that's a huge difference.

69
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.910
So they've designed the car without seat rails to get everything even

70
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.840
further down, you know.

71
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.710
<v 0>The dope looking car. I saw one that was black with red stripes. That was the.</v>

72
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.550
<v 1>That was when I was driving around. Leno's got the same color too. God,</v>

73
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:45.760
that's a.

74
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.710
<v 0>Pretty car. That's gangster. That's a pretty.</v>

75
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.480
<v 1>Car carbon fiber wheels, which are lovely, um,</v>

76
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.980
carbon fiber wheels.

77
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.970
So there's two kinds of weight in a car they're sprung weight and unsprung

78
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.990
weight. What's what's that mean? So sprung weight is weight.

79
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.460
That is most of what you think of as the car, the engine,

80
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.210
the body, anything that is sprung on the suspension,

81
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.320
unsprung weight is weighed on the car that is not sprung on the suspension.

82
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.530
So wheels, brake, rotors tires,

83
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.360
suspension components that aren't sitting on the suspension, right?

84
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.360
So it's like a rough calculation,

85
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.950
but like roughly one pound of unsprung weight

86
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.170
will translate the feeling of five pounds of sprung weight.

87
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.570
So meaning like if you are able to pull 20 pounds of unsprung weight out of

88
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:41.404
your car,

89
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.970
each wheel is four pounds is five pounds lighter than a stock wheel. Okay.

90
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.060
So you're not about 20 pounds. Unsprung weight at your car.

91
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.260
Your car will feel like you pulled a hundred pounds out of it and it will stop.

92
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.730
Start accelerate, turn better commute.

93
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.630
Uh, totally in all our it'll perform better in all areas.

94
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:05.950
So to go from a forged aluminum wheel,

95
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.370
which is 23 or 24,

96
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.080
25 pounds a wheel to a carbon fiber wheel, that's like 11 pounds a wheel.

97
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.060
You you're pulling so much on sprung weight out of the car. It'll feel like,

98
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:21.430
you know, swinging a baseball bat with a weight on it.

99
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:26.050
And then just throwing that weight away. Wow. Yeah. Massive, massive,

100
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:28.090
massive, massive, massive difference. And the wheels are.

101
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.950
<v 0>Oh, expense. I would imagine like how many companies may carbon fiber wheels on.</v>

102
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.240
<v 1>Y called the carbon revolution and they're from Australia.</v>

103
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.530
<v 0>Though. They only make them for the.</v>

104
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.480
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

105
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.480
. You can buy the wheels. They have fitments for a few different cars. Porsche GT three is one. 

106
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.313
Um,  and they make them for Ford.

107
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.870
<v 0>Will you do me a favor, Jamie,</v>

108
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:54.370
and pull up the photo of that black Ford GT with the red stripes.

109
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.100
<v 1>It's on my Instagram. If you have my Instagram handy, the one I drove off.</v>

110
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.103
<v 0>Um.</v>

111
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 1>Incredibly the,</v>

112
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.200
the road presence is just seen and it makes noises that only.

113
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.813
<v 0>God.</v>

114
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.820
<v 1>It makes noises that only race cars make. There's a specific sound like,</v>

115
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.001
you know,

116
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.800
the pops and crackles you get from most of these modern cars when they dumped

117
00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:20.570
the fuel in the exhaust and. And it's just, it's cool.

118
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:25.490
But it's a synthetic [inaudible] sound. It's programmed. This does that.

119
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.010
Not programmed. It's just like fuel into header, bang.

120
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.140
Wow. It's just sorry. Scars.

121
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.000
<v 0>And this goes for like $500,000, four 50, if you can get one,</v>

122
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:40.250
but you can't get what you can't get unless, you know, Johnson.

123
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.690
<v 1>Uh, the root, I mean the rumor is he got like over a million for his butt.</v>

124
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.720
<v 0>Oh. So somebody ordered, well, that makes sense. Flipped it. Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.880
He flipped it. Yeah. And so they're suing him.

126
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.270
<v 1>Yeah. I, I read that it was thrown out.</v>

127
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.230
They sued him for breach of contract for selling it. But he,

128
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.240
he claims or claimed that the contract didn't say he couldn't sell it. Oh.

129
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.040
<v 0>So it was a verbal.</v>

130
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.060
<v 1>Agreement or something. I don't know.</v>

131
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:08.000
Maybe it was one of those things they just hoped nobody would call them out on.

132
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:10.750
And uh, maybe it's unenforceable, you know what I mean? How,

133
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.090
how do they sell you something and then enforce that you can't sell the thing

134
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:14.920
you bought.

135
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.480
<v 0>Know, you can't do that. You really, you literally can't do that.</v>

136
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:18.560
I don't think that's enforceable.

137
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.100
I think once the contract is signed in and you take possession of this object,

138
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:24.140
that's yours to do whatever you want. I, I.

139
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.520
<v 1>Think morally, I.</v>

140
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.650
<v 0>Agree. This is America, but for hats off,</v>

141
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.020
you made a dope car. That thinks amazing.

142
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.670
<v 1>[Inaudible] extremely crazy. It really in it it's,</v>

143
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.860
it's unlike anything else on the road. Because even, even the, um, the very,

144
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:44.600
very high end Supercars, you know,

145
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:49.070
your Lamborghini Aventador is that are 400 grand and your V12 Ferrari's and all

146
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:52.910
that stuff are fundamentally their road cars. And even when you,

147
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:54.380
they go racing with them, they,

148
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.650
they sort of take the road car and modify it for racing.

149
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:02.390
This is so clearly a race car that they had to build some street

150
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:05.390
cars, you know? Wow. And, um,

151
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.550
it's rocking.

152
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.230
<v 0>It looks amazing. It's got.</v>

153
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.790
<v 1>An air brake on it, the actors, I mean, so go back to the rear picture. Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:16.280
So the wing, the whole wing that,

155
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:19.820
that whole wing that goes across the back there lifts.

156
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.690
<v 0>Up when you hit.</v>

157
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.120
<v 1>The brakes. Well, it lifts when you start driving quick,</v>

158
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:26.300
it lifts up and becomes a wing wing. And then when you hit the brakes,

159
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:29.270
it flips up and becomes, uh, an actual air brake.

160
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.440
And it is extremely effective. I would imagine what it does. Is it, you know,

161
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:37.490
when you break the card nose dives, it completely eliminates the dive.

162
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.890
So the car just squats straight down. Wow.

163
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.850
<v 0>It's wild. It's gorgeous. Yeah. Are they going to keep making them?</v>

164
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.430
<v 1>I don't. I don't think.</v>

165
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.470
<v 0>So. Why not forward?</v>

166
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.210
<v 1>I find a guest. They lose money on every single one they make. If I had to.</v>

167
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.610
<v 0>Guess kind of a word, we in here, I know Trump.</v>

168
00:08:56.611 --> 00:09:00.570
I thought you were going to fix all this. I thought that was party platform.

169
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.290
That's what I heard. It's going to make America great again.

170
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.180
<v 1>Uh, the, we, we, the, the glow, the car economy is,</v>

171
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.140
it's such a global economy like American.

172
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.290
Like we make a bunch of like the hell cats are built, like in Canada.

173
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.640
And like we make BMW X fives in South Carolina.

174
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.560
<v 0>Well, we made a Ford, uh, Tundras in Texas. That's what he meant.</v>

175
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.020
Toyota, Toyota Tundra. Sorry. Yeah.

176
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.780
Toyota is make a couple different cars here in America. Right?

177
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.950
I just made a couple of cars.

178
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.320
<v 1>I think Japanese automakers probably have at least as many auto workers in</v>

179
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.090
America as American car companies do.

180
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.380
This is definitely the same car I was driving the press car. God,

181
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.440
what is great is just the buttresses. Like when it goes by,

182
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:48.990
you can see right through the side of the car,

183
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:53.220
you can just see the air there between the tunnel and the pod. That's so pretty.

184
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.670
<v 0>Yeah. That might be the best looking car I've ever seen. It is.</v>

185
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.890
<v 1>So cool. And it was.</v>

186
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.120
<v 0>So fast as far as like American cars that literally might be the best looking</v>

187
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:03.990
car I've ever seen.
