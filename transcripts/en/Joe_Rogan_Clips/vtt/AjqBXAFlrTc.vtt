00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 2>How old were you when you had your first match?</v>

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.313
<v 1>Like that?</v>

4
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.400
My first professional was 1919 fight king Zulu with

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.080
120 fights and four draws, only 120 victories.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.100
He was a.

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.040
<v 0>Big guy too. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.910
<v 1>About 2 10, 2 20. And about a, uh,</v>

9
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.790
yeah, he was a big guy. How much do you weigh at the time? 1 74.

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.030
<v 0>Those, uh, matches are still available online. People can watch them. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:31.470
It's pretty.

12
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.190
<v 1>Cool. I think so. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

13
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.830
<v 0>Is it wild looking back at 19 year old, you fighting Zulu.</v>

14
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.790
<v 1>Was, uh, maybe the biggest experience in my life.</v>

15
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.260
Cause at this point I felt like I was good. I was able to, to fight well,

16
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.500
but I didn't have the experience. So, and then one day I got home,

17
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.900
I saw my father talking with his, um,

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.780
Zulu manager in Brazilia the capital and the, and the guy tried to bring,

19
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.650
to invite my somebody's of my father team to fight Zulu.

20
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.050
And my father would say, no, I don't have nobody.

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.370
We don't fight Tuda for so long nobody's training for, and I,

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.650
I get the idea said, Hey, dad, put me and put me and put me in.

23
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.450
So I immediately ask him to, and he look at me and he mentioned to the,

24
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.170
to the V Santa. I said, yes, but I have my son here at 19 years old.

25
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:25.080
He wanna try. And the guy said, no, Mr. Mr. Gracie, this,

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.720
this is not a fight for him to try.

27
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.760
The guy is very tough and this and that as the guy tried to pull my father off

28
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.400
the deal, my father becomes more excited to the no,

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.960
but I think he gonna go handle the challenge, this and that.

30
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.040
So he's become excited with the, the situation. So,

31
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.190
and then we set up the fight month later, I was there to fight

32
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.083
and, uh,

33
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.510
we start the fight and, uh, he has a trade trade, uh, like,

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.310
uh, one movie he does,

35
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.590
which grab you with the hands between your legs and lift you up and throw you

36
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:05.460
over the, on, back on the floor. And as he approached that,

37
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.380
I moved back block his,

38
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.420
his shoulders and hit him with the knee right on his face was the best

39
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.860
knee I could possibly give in somebody and expect him to just,

40
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.820
I expect to win the fighting, right. That in that moment. But he just shook,

41
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.050
he stood up, leave his head, shook, speed,

42
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.930
a tooth &lt;laugh&gt; and start back, ready again to go. You know?

43
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.130
And then I felt like was really serious.

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.050
And the thing was much serious than I expect. And for the next 10 minutes,

45
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:41.770
because was 10 minutes rounds for the,

46
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.330
for the end of the round,

47
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.760
we just engage and fall on the ring and come back in and backing out.

48
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.640
And a lot of, a lot of commotion, a lot of strength.

49
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.440
And in the end of the round, I kind of crawling to the corner.

50
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.240
And I said to my dad, dad, I quit. I don't, I cannot go anymore. I'm tired.

51
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.080
And my dad not even listened to me said, he's tired. They, you he's worst.

52
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.640
Now he gonna kick his, do this and that. I said, dad, I'm serious, man.

53
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.400
I'm dead. I cannot go. And then my brother holds,

54
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.560
throw me a bucket of ice and water in my head.

55
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.920
I go and then Bing the REL, the bell rings. And I push in again.

56
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.870
And like my dad said,

57
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.470
I could beat the guy in three minutes because he was already tired, wasted chew.

58
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.510
So when I grabbed his back, he could not escape and I put him to sleep. And uh,

59
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.190
and then I confirmed my worst enemy was in my mind was the,

60
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.780
my enemy was in my brain. Tell me I have to quit. I have to.

61
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.420
So I decide and that day never hurt my my mind

62
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.460
tell bad things to me anymore.

63
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.140
So either I gonna die or I don't go. But if I go, I cannot say,

64
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:55.860
oh, I think I had enough. I think it's time to.

65
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.290
So this was the worst enemy I could have. And from that day on,

66
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.610
I decide to either go to putting everything on it or don't go at all.

67
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.130
So it was easier for me because I would start to, to,

68
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.090
to deal with one enemy only, not two enemies that my mind and my opponent.

69
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.520
<v 0>It's probably the most common thing that happens to fighters is they lose</v>

70
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.640
faith in themselves or they, they start to look for a way out. Yes.

71
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.120
<v 1>That's pretty much a, because you don't see the other side,</v>

72
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:32.920
you see yourself and you see you tired. You see with problems,

73
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.040
you start to see the negative aspects of you and you're not

74
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.150
putting yourself like the guy has the same problems. He has the same ideas.

75
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:46.390
So you have to keep going here as everything is normal. And it's hard to,

76
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.790
to people relate to that. You know, when you start to getting the problems,

77
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:52.150
you start to see yourself bigger than the other ones, you know,

78
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.190
more problems and worse, and that's not gonna be the,

79
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.830
the right way to resolve the matter.

80
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.310
<v 0>It's interesting that you figured out how to handle these things, uh,</v>

81
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.900
on your own on too, because this is, uh,

82
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.420
it's an area that fighters seek psychological help with now.

83
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.140
They hire psychologists and they,

84
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.060
they get hypnotized and they do all these different things to try to figure out

85
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.060
how to stop that negative conversation in the mind,

86
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.210
how to stop those negative voices and how to not give into that weak that wants

87
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.530
you to quit. Yes.

88
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.650
<v 1>This power we all have within,</v>

89
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.090
but some people don't even go for that. And they,

90
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.010
they seek for different people to help them, which is good too. But once you,

91
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.890
you become more intuitive when you become more enlightened

92
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.760
with your own potential, you able to resolve all the matters yourself,

93
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.960
you know, because it's all about your mindset.

94
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.120
It's how you think and how you believe and what you ready for and what you

95
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.080
prepare for and how you able to, to accept and surrender everything around you.

96
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.000
<v 0>And that these moments that, where you do want to quit,</v>

97
00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:03.080
whether it's in training or in competition,

98
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.400
for people who understand that and have experienced that and have overcome it,

99
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.240
life becomes easier.

100
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.880
<v 1>Yes. I think, you know, martial arts Andras with,</v>

101
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.590
with complete idea is a Metaform for life. You know,

102
00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:24.950
you become a good martial artist, you become a good person. You go,

103
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.950
you gonna become a happy person because you wanna be able to, to conquer your,

104
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.990
your happiness outside of the mat.

105
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.350
<v 0>And to deal with your demons. Yes. And some people never fight those demons.</v>

106
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:40.700
They never, so when something happens to them in life, some adversity comes up,

107
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.220
they're not accustomed to handling it. Yes.

108
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.940
And we're seeing a lot of that now with this, uh, pandemic,

109
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.580
we're seeing a lot of people freaking out because they've never really

110
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:55.300
experienced any true adversity in their life. Yes.

111
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.700
<v 1>No, it's not only for that,</v>

112
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.370
but because they ever thought about how to resolve those problems, you know,

113
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.170
they just thinking the problems there, what I gonna do,

114
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.290
but they don't thinking about how I can control the situation,

115
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.210
how I can be on top of this, how I can, you know,

116
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.240
just defend myself from those demons. And, and, and if you don't see you,

117
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.320
the perspective of how I can resolve my problems, you allow yourself to,

118
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.760
to, to put your problems in somebody else, hands to resolve for you.

119
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.360
And it's all about perspective. It's all about focus.
