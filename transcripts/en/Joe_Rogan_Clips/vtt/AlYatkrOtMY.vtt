00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.080
<v 2>Don, how did you, when, when did you, you, you started out was like UFC eight.</v>

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.220
<v 1>Your first fight, you know, the first new UFC I fight for.</v>

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.170
<v 0>Boxing and kickboxing before.</v>

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.230
<v 1>That. Right? No boxing. I did boxing. Um,</v>

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.360
think I had eight fights and, um,

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.950
I think it was two and six or two, five and one, I don't know,

8
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:30.480
because I fought my first two's Don fry and I won

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.314
those.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.510
And then I had an argument with my trainer and so

11
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.700
we split. And then,

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.240
so then I fought under Jr. Fry.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.890
Why'd you change your name or there was my name growing up as junior to Jr.

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
And that's how I was in junior high and high school. And then,

15
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.190
um, you know,

16
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.540
when my dad and mom called me and then I think I changed my name

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.780
because of a contractual re you know.

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.730
<v 0>You got some deal with the manager. Yeah. There's a lot of those sneaky deals.</v>

19
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.564
Huh?

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.350
<v 1>Yeah. But, um, that was more the trainer. And, you know,</v>

21
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.800
I don't know if that was because they were really good guys. Uh, art,

22
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
mark Tori was my money guy who, you know, they, they,

23
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.320
the two murals Mike mutuals and his father Al brought me to tart

24
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.380
art Russell at ASU back in the late sixties and art.

25
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.170
Uh, he's a billionaire, you know? And so he was interested in, I mean,

26
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.430
he basically funds ASU wrestling. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, that's nice.

27
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.630
Out of his pocket. Yeah.

28
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.730
And he's done so much for him to wrestling in the U S I

29
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:49.140
mean, he's like the top dog because, um, he, uh,

30
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.490
he used to have what's called Sunkist wrestling team. And, uh,

31
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.230
so that was his baby and he steamrolled that. And,

32
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.080
um, then, like I said, uh,

33
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.270
the immunos brothers or Mike and his dad took me to art or

34
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.070
to give it a shot after he called, um,

35
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.260
jeez, the coach said Oakey state. Um,

36
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.300
Joe say to double, double check on me.

37
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.770
<v 0>So did you start it out wrestling? Did you wrestle as a young boy? No.</v>

38
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.640
<v 1>Sir. When.</v>

39
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.480
<v 0>Did you start wrestling?</v>

40
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.630
<v 1>Uh, it was a freshman in high school.</v>

41
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.400
<v 0>And then when did you box?</v>

42
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.160
<v 1>Uh, when I got out of college.</v>

43
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.050
<v 0>Oh, so most of it was, you know, that's fairly late in life to box, right?</v>

44
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.480
<v 1>Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's why I was</v>

45
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.900
[inaudible].

46
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.580
<v 0>So when did you hear about the UFC?</v>

47
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.000
<v 1>Um, I was a fireman, you know,</v>

48
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.330
I guess did the boxing and then got out,

49
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.650
did certain doing odd jobs for, you know, a year,

50
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:03.070
year and a half. And then my wife,

51
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.660
at that time, we had couple of horses, you know,

52
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.330
and being a Kali dresser, you got a bit of an Eagle and yeah.

53
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.260
So that'll get what hell I could do that. So, uh,

54
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.460
stir going around with a farrier name, Stony new thing,

55
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.970
and then Stony got me interested. Then I, um,

56
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.700
got tired of that was really me good money, but you know,

57
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.770
for the time he was giving me five bucks a horse, you know, teach me, you know,

58
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.640
pull the shoes, um, shaped the shoe, you know, and all that good stuff. Well,

59
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:41.170
he, he did the technical work on the hooves. And then,

60
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.870
um, I said,

61
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.860
somebody told me about being a fireman about, you know,

62
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.570
working 10 days a month, you know, had a restaurant. So hell,

63
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:57.280
that's the job for me, you know, tending his month. I can do that. You're.

64
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.170
<v 0>Doing the 24 hour shifts. We just stay.</v>

65
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.850
<v 1>There at the firehouse. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

66
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.410
So I got on the phone called up all of the cities and see Arizona.

67
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.060
Nobody was hiring. So I called up Santa Fe, New Mexico.

68
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.270
They said, yeah, we're going to run a test.

69
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.960
And so I went over there and tested and passed the test and

70
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:19.930
then went to my buddy, Jerry Pegan,

71
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.180
Paul he's got me into wrestling. Um, when I was in high school,

72
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.320
come all your later, please.

73
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.320
There you go over there for you. Thank you, sir. Bring her up, man. And

74
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.230
so then I wouldn't see to Jerry's house in Santa Fe.

75
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.700
And I went through there.

76
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.220
I think it was like a six month or her more, um,

77
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.740
academy, you know, in the fire.

78
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.940
<v 0>Department and.</v>

79
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.170
<v 1>Six months. Yeah. Wow. It was a hell of an academy. It really was.</v>

80
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.990
<v 0>And so from there you thought about fighting.</v>

81
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.820
<v 1>No, I had already fought, no, but I mean in UFC. Oh no. Um,</v>

82
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.470
from there we were there a year, year and a half couldn't afford to live there,

83
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.390
you know, you know, in Santa Fe you're either real rich, real poor, you know,

84
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:21.130
this was 30 years ago. So I don't know how it is now, but, um,

85
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.120
probably similar probably like the whole country now, right now.

86
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.300
<v 0>Though. Santa Fe, a lot of beautiful friends from there.</v>

87
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.450
<v 1>Beautiful. Yeah. You've never been, oh, you got.</v>

88
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.270
<v 0>To go. I don't even think I've been in New Mexico except driving through water.</v>

89
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.060
<v 1>Or drive through it.</v>

90
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.860
<v 0>I was a kid. I don't remember.</v>

91
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.900
<v 1>Yeah, he didn't, obviously you haven't gotten through, see, uh,</v>

92
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.700

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.430
<v 0>Jackson Winkeljohn I want to go down there and check out the gym now.</v>

94
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.170
How come you suggest a busy man, Don Frye? Just a busy man.

95
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.500
So when you, when you first heard about the UFC,

96
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.180
so you were firefighter then or well.

97
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.140
<v 1>Back to the, back to the, you know, like I said,</v>

98
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.870
we were in Santa Fe for a year,

99
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.090
year and a half and then couldn't afford to live there.

100
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.370
And so I got on the phone and so,

101
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.220
you know, we still had horses and so pain farrier, so, oh, I can do that.

102
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.940
So I found Oklahoma horseshoe in school, in Oak city.

103
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.340
And so I moved my wife back home to my parents' house,

104
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.450
you know,

105
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.370
and I went to old lawnmowers at school for their 12 week program.

106
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.400
Oh wow. And so I did that.

107
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:40.130
And then when I came back to, uh,

108
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.290
Arizona Sierra Vista, um, hooked up with a guy named, um,

109
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.310
oh Jesus, um,

110
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.620
Tyler Basinger Tyler's of magician is a farrier,

111
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.330
just a magician. And he paid me $5, a horse,

112
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.430
you know, and fit me lunch. And, uh, and you know,

113
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:07.400
so I was learning how to shoe horses from him, you know,

114
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.280
doing the apprenticeship, start my own business.

115
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.810
I got on as a firefighter reserve,

116
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.640

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.540
<v 0>This is like old school Western. Wow.</v>

121
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.030
<v 1>And so then I, then I had some time I worked at a, um,</v>

124
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.880
<v 1>What's harder.</v>

125
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.400
<v 0>Horseshoeing or restraining patients.</v>

126
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.440
<v 1>Oh, where she, whenever I broke a kid's arm. So, you know, just the headlocks,</v>

127
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.430
you know, they, they did a breakout where, you know,

128
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:09.130
20 or 30 of them run off and then you get to herd them back in and a

129
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.760
couple of them act out and one of the guys had the kid

130
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:14.460
restrained for,

131
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.340
you had him from behind and his arms pin cancer slammed his head into

132
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:23.900
his face. So I just walked up and did a headlock and we landed,

133
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.780
snapped his arm. Yeah. That can

134
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.220
kind of put a damper on things. Was.

135
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.030
<v 0>That the end of your.</v>

136
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.940
<v 1>Restraining patients that it was in that career?</v>

137
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.590
<v 0>So how does it make its way to the UFC?</v>

138
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:41.480
Do you remember when you found out about the UFC?

139
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.790
<v 1>Yeah. And then, um, the thing that still a year or two before.</v>

140
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.500
<v 0>So this is like 92, something.</v>

141
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.090
<v 1>Like that. Yeah. And then, um, I started doing judo,</v>

142
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.570
you know, because I needed, I needed something to do, you know,

143
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.020
uh, you know, you're 22, 24 years old. You,

144
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.050
you know, you used to be a college athlete, you know,

145
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.670
you still walk around with an erection. Right. I understand. And, um,

146
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.160
so I started doing judo and advanced very quickly in

147
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.960
that. And um,

148
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.950
so then I got on the busy fire department in 94

149
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.360

150
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.270

158
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:58.830

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.900
something on TV and saw Dan clipper, Dan Severn.

160
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.700
And, uh,

161
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.530
then he was doing some kind of bodyguard work for Robin looking

162
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.360
from, um, who's a radio guy in New York. So whoever's.

163
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.040
<v 0>Howard stern or really.</v>

164
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.650
<v 1>No in his, in his great t-shirt. Yeah.</v>

165
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.890
Everybody's a Susan Gray t-shirt. And so, uh, you know,

166
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.420
then we saw Dan fight and I called him. I was so, you know, I said,

167
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:35.370
Dan did Don fry. Remember me playing fireman,

168
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:39.780
but you know where shoer, you know, Kenny, she's tough.

169
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:41.640
Can you get me in on? And he says, yeah.

170
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.060
So he ended up getting me some fights,

171
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.420
probably about five or six fights, you know,

172
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:53.400
around the country and uh, you know, check still in the mail, you know?

173
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.860
Um, this is pre UFC. Yeah.

174
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.590
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, so you fought MMA before the UFC.</v>

175
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.510
<v 1>Oh, it was, it was warehouse fighting MMA it.</v>

176
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.470
<v 0>So right. We'll call it back then. No holds barred. Right.</v>

177
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.620
So would you wear shoes? You do whatever you want. Was it bare knuckle?

178
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.090
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

179
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.250
<v 0>And your day, and even in the UFC eight, it was,</v>

180
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.730
you were still allowed to fight bare knuckle. Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.350
<v 1>But I wore gloves because I hit heart</v>

182
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.290
and smart gloves.

183
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.130
Aren't made to protect your face for me to protect my hands.

184
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.290
<v 0>Gloves in the UFC. It was a tank. Yeah. Smart, smart.</v>

185
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.490
<v 1>Move. He hits hard.</v>

186
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.370
<v 0>Yeah. Holy. I remember your fight with tank.</v>

187
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.740
What a fight that was Mike.

188
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.610
<v 1>And I, and they didn't make a top 10 of one round fight.</v>

189
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.331
<v 0>Oh,</v>

190
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.870
I don't have no idea why it does well it's cause there's so many great fights.

191
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:51.720
It's arbitrary who makes top 10, but I think it should have been in there.

192
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.860
That was a classic. Nobody knows.

193
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.480
Nobody knows anything about UFC 100 and be a war. You know, I do.

194
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.580
And you were there. I was there. The new fans,
