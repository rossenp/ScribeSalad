00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. There was a couple that, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.720
adopted a child from Russia and they thought that the child was,

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.440
uh, a little kid and it turned out she might have been 30.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.600
They don't know how old she was. She tried to kill them.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.440
She scared there was a horror movie still.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.510
They thought they're adopting a little kid, like a little six year old.

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.670
That's a 30 year old with some sort of a metabolic disease. Yeah.

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:29.430
Well that serves you right. For trying to be a do gooder. You know,

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.590
they'll never do anything again for anybody.

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.670
Not that they'll never do one thing. Like the husband will try to bring it up.

11
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.830
She's like, you, Herman, you. You almost got me killed by that midget. I mean,

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.020
the idea that there are midgets dressing up as children and trying to

13
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.340
bur into family so that they can wake up in the middle of the night and kill

14
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:51.940
them. Yeah. Is truly the funniest thing that has happened in, in,

15
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.420
I don't think technically image. I think she's something else. Well, she, okay.

16
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.460
Maybe whatever she was, she has like a growth disorder that keeps her like,

17
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:00.300
looking like a small child. Did you see,

18
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:03.770
there was a video recently where it looked like a kid was getting thrown off a

19
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:06.450
bus. I know. Yes, yes, yes. And it was just a, was it a, it was a,

20
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.090
like a little person who was just thrown off a bus, but it was, it was,

21
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.810
it was a scam. Like someone, was it fake? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.570
Got RI and I both got duped. He said I got DED. Cuz my friend texted me.

23
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:17.810
They go, there's a pedophile midget that just got thrown off a bus.

24
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.210
It is hilarious. It is the funniest thing ever. When, when the unzips,

25
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:25.040
the hood and you see is like grown up face. There's a woman who looks like what?

26
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.760
The Fox. She, I don't think they were in on it. No,

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.120
I don't think they knew the people on the outside did not. Yes.

28
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.680
I think the guy threw that guy off the bus and that was the scam. Yeah.

29
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.360
And then the dude who was the, the little person in the hoodie,

30
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.360
he was in on the scam and they was in on the scam.

31
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:40.840
But I don't think the people on the street were in on it.

32
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:43.350
So now what happens when the, when the, when these,

33
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.150
these little people wake up and they're like activated, they're like,

34
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.470
I'm gonna kill the family. How did they try to kill them? Well, this lady,

35
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.270
she was threatening. She was threatening to kill the family.

36
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:54.750
And they were really worried that she was gonna do this.

37
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.190
She was gonna poison them or something like that. I think that's what it was.

38
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.990
Scary stuff. It's a horror movie because you know, you gotta think,

39
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.980
who knows what kind of abuse this little kid had gone through? Well,

40
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.420
actually a 30 year old as, as a little kid through in Russia, you know,

41
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:13.580
and all these foster homes and foster care and you know,

42
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:16.260
they are ruthless over there. Its it's rough. It's rough.

43
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.940
I imagine it's not the best place to grow up as a person with a disorder.

44
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.913
What's up. Jamie.

45
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.010
<v 1>Are, I feel like a I'm hearing.</v>

46
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.090
Are you saying that happened in Russia or was a Russian kid? Russian kid. Okay.

47
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.730
This is happened in Indiana. It's actually Ukrainian.

48
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.650
<v 0>Kid that reporting this that's UK is part of Russia. Um that's okay. Isn't it?</v>

49
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.410
They had a it's one of res union union. It's fine.

50
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.890
They had a three years before they figured this out. Oh my God.

51
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.330
Now what kind of, what were those three years nice?

52
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.400
Like were their nice memories out good? Isn't that odd to look back and be like,

53
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.000
remember when we all went to Disney world before? No, they were probably like,

54
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.920
Hey, this isn't growing.

55
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.200
I think they said that she was creepy in the article that I read.

56
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.480
I think they were actually like,

57
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.480
they would wake up and see her like standing at the door.

58
00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:01.400
Like I think there were things that she did that. Yeah. Very, very bad.

59
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.720
What do, what does she look like? Do they have an image of her?

60
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:05.680
I'm trying to find, I'm trying to find that one. I might,

61
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.000
but I saw a picture of her. I saw saw a picture of, did she go to jail?

62
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.120
It was real weird. Looking like she didn't look like a little person.

63
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.760
She looked like a young person. It was a very strange, yeah.

64
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.360
I mean I hope she finds another family.

65
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.070
I hope she key keeps doing this to different families because whatever happened

66
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.110
in this bitch's life was so bad that she needs to do this. Let her do it. Mm.

67
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.870
Can do it to the wrong family that feed you to the wolves.

68
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:32.830
You do it to the wrong fam. Absolutely. Um, yeah.

69
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.910
It's it's I worry about that though. What YouTube, because I say is it,

70
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.380
you build a whole, or you build people that are your fans.

71
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.580
They want to see comedy. And I always thought that like, okay,

72
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.060
I'm not gonna be able to do this on like mainstream TV,

73
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.780
but these are funny things that I can do there. She is, look at her. Oh my God.

74
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.860
She does look. Okay. So it is a little person, but she looks like a child,

75
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.060
but strange. It's not like a regular look at the one down the middle,

76
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.460
the middle and the lower corner. Look at that. That's horrific.

77
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.370
That one right there. That's terrifying. Ukrainian child. She might even,

78
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.570
but it's also, how is she gonna kill you? What's she gonna,

79
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.170
I guess in the middle of the night or something. Cut your neck, man.

80
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.490
That's true bro. Their 30. That's creepy. There's something weird.

81
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:18.010
They thought it was a little kid. Yeah. That's so strange. Don't adopt folks.

82
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.600
Oh my God. To not so strange. Get that one there. Yeah.

83
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.480
When your cursors on, look at that one, that one freaks me out.

84
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.520
Cause you'd be like, something's wrong.

85
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.320
You would never think that was a murderous young adult.

86
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.560
Who's either eight or 22 that everyone was talking about. Um,

87
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.440
I don't think they think 22 now.

88
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.120
I think some people think as old as 30 and I think the youngest,

89
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:41.910
they think she is a 16 and there's no wreck. No one can prove anything. No,

90
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:45.470
they don't know what the going on. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

91
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.670
it's so crazy. She had period. She had adult teeth. &lt;laugh&gt;

92
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.590
well guess what? She's not 12. That's an indication that, I mean,

93
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:58.910
did she never see a doctor in three years? Oh, oh, scroll back up.

94
00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:00.590
Hold on a second. Look at this. She had periods.

95
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:04.500
She had adult teeth who alleges that after Antalia began acting out violently

96
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:06.020
attacking a baby boy,

97
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.660
pushing Christine into an electric fence and making death threats that families

98
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:13.020
sought out psychiatric health, healthcare officials,

99
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:17.220
including the Barnett's primary care physician who performed a bone density test

100
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.300
and a clinical therapist who treated Antalia believe her to be an adult,

101
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.490
a child. Holy. you.

102
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.330
Imagine when you're in the doctor's office and getting that diagnosis,

103
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.730
they do a bone density test and the kid, the kids are sitting there. Yeah.

104
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.570
It turns out it's an adult. Can you imagine going in and you're,

105
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:37.170
you're ready to hear like she's got cancer, a brain damage and she go,

106
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.930
actually you're you're raising a 30 year old from the Ukraine.

107
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.400
Look at this in 2012,

108
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.160
a judge approved the Barnett's application to have Natalia's date of birth

109
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:49.720
officially revised to September 4th, 1989.

110
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:54.520
Officially changing her age from eight to 22 shortly after they

111
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.880
rented Natalia an apartment.

112
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.640
That's nice and placed her under the supervision of an Indiana state healthcare

113
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.000
provider. So she could receive psychiatric treatment as an adult.

114
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.520
That's an understanding.

115
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.720
And the family moved to Canada &lt;laugh&gt; they left the country,

116
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.200
but they rented her an apartment and then left the country.

117
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.840
Christine Barnett then moved to Canada. &lt;laugh&gt; when her son Jacob.

118
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.430
And they could harassing child prody prodigy about whom she wrote. Oh,

119
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.630
is that the parent? Yeah. Yeah. It's her parent. Yeah. No,

120
00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:27.190
the Barnetts they're the Barnetts yeah. Yeah. They're the ones who would, uh,

121
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.350
adopted. So Christine's the one that, but she took,

122
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.190
so she left the husband and moved to Canada. They're divorced now. It's well,

123
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.700
that's that'll do it. It's a tough thing for marriage to, to survive. Yeah.

124
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:41.380
You survive. You rented an adult. Yeah. You rented an adult for a couple years.

125
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.580
Gonna kill you. Pretending to be a kid pushing you into an electric fence.

126
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.780
I feel like they &lt;laugh&gt;.

127
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.540
They had a dinner and they said whatever in our marriage made us think this was

128
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.060
a good idea. We should just separate. What do you got?

129
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:54.740
They got arrested for abandoning her in that apartment.

130
00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.010
Why the story goes further? I believe that sounds, oh my God.

131
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.930
2019 prosecutors in tip canoe, Indiana. That's your number one problem.

132
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.730
Right there. Tip canoe.

133
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:10.570
Indiana brought formal charges and neglect against the bar nets.

134
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.610
Now divorced an affidavit of probable cause from 2014,

135
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.560
provided by refinery 29 refers to test performed by Payton Manning

136
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.240
children's hospital in 2013,

137
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:24.360
that seemed to contradict earlier medical reports about Natalia's age

138
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.040
investigators at the time found Natalia's claims that she was Ukrainian child

139
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.440
who had been abandoned by the Barnett's credible.

140
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.120
But Michael Barnett's attorney told the daily male that the charges had been

141
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:40.350
filed because another couple perhaps in, by Natalia that she was a minor,

142
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.030
had petitioned to become her guardian. Oh my God.

143
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:45.590
She tried to rope another family. She's good. She's good.

144
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.350
Explaining Natalia is living on her own and a couple wanted to become her

145
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.630
guardians thinking she was still a child.

146
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.310
The couple tried to overturn the 2012 results.

147
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.220
So they tried to overturn her age an adopter again,

148
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.100
despite new tests commissioned by that couple,

149
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.100
the court upheld the original result,

150
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.140
which maintained it in Natalia was an adult.

151
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.780
The couple later dropped their guardianship petition.

152
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.140
Once she tried to kill them too. Wow. Now where is the, that last part?

153
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.820
Where is where's the Talia today? Where whereabouts are currently unknown.

154
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.410
Her age remains a subject of much debate. She's touring with Skippy,

155
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:26.290
from family guys. &lt;laugh&gt; the she's killing clubs in Connecticut. Yeah.

156
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:30.130
She's on the blues clues tour. Jesus Christ. She's I mean, listen,

157
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.170
you know, that's a guest. You wanna get a guest? That girl,

158
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.490
I would have someone in the room with a gun.

159
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.010
You sit her on a stack of phone books. I might have a, you might, I might have,

160
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.320
you might bring her home. Uh, she might, you might fall for it. You might,

161
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.240
you know, she might be riding Marshall around the house. No, I have real kids.

162
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.480
Yeah. That's true. I know what her kids, I understand kids. It is wild.

163
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.080
When you, do you think, could you ever get DUP like that? Yeah.

164
00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:54.640
You could get DUP. Yeah. If someone's really, really, really good.

165
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:58.360
And you're tired. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. If you work, you're working work too hard.

166
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.080
If you're working hard, you just drink a little bit.

167
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.440
Maybe you're on some antidepressants. It make you a little loopy.

168
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.400
I wonder if the parents are like, how good of parents are we right?

169
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.360
That for three years,

170
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.040
we didn't know that we had a 30 year old psychopath living in our house.

171
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:12.480
Like maybe we're not the best at this. She's got a Bush.

172
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.790
That was the other thing we found on that she had pub, adult Bush, teeth,

173
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.750
adult teeth. Oh, death threats. Woo death, death threat.

174
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.110
How do you make a death threat? When you look like a kid like that? What do you,

175
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.670
I mean, it's crazy. Like Chucky, HES scared the out of everybody.

176
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:26.550
That's what it is. you kill you, dude. Chucky was terrified.

177
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.350
Chucky was really people say, sometimes I look like Chucky, which is not nice.

178
00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:31.510
That's not true. Those people are mean, I agree,

179
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.110
but there's a lot of people on YouTube that like to just let it fly.

180
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.860
He should really, I like to let it fly. You're supposed to read that stuff.

181
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.580
I know. But sometimes I do.
