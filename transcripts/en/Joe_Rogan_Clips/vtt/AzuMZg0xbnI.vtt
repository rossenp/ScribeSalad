00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's really complicated, right? It's like,</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.690
who should be able to decide when you can or can't go back to

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.910
work. It's not, it's not straightforward.

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:16.650
It's not cut and dry because if you say the people should be

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.300
allowed to make their own decision,

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.990
you run into the very real possibility that especially if you have to go to work

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.040
at that factory and you can't not work and you do get sick and you do go home

8
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:30.090
and you do spread it to your family, a loved one could die. That's that's real.

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.433
On the other hand,

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.660
the government doesn't really seem to have any sort of straightforward plan

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.310
as to how people can economically bounce back from this. I mean,

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.780
there was one of the weirdest quotes, I think it was Trump that said this.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.770
We're just talking about businesses and restaurants that they'll be open,

14
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:53.940
maybe not with the same owners, but there'll be open again. Did you,

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.840
did you see that quote?

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.690
<v 1>No, I don't. I don't, I didn't see that, but it's like,</v>

17
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.590
what does that really mean?

18
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.020
Does that just mean like a different business will be created.

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.460
<v 0>Exactly what it means. It means that he's just being pragmatic and maybe cold.</v>

20
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.930
Whoever made that quote. That is probably how it's going to go down.

21
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:14.430
Is it Trump says restaurants may come back just maybe with new owners. Yeah.

22
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.390
I mean, that doubt, that does not make me feel good. Ben,

23
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.370
if I'm a restaurant owner, you know,

24
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:24.390
and there's a few restaurants that I'm always shouting out on the podcast, uh,

25
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.900
that are owned by friends of mine that are,

26
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.820
these businesses are hurting so bad they're they they've went

27
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.560
like that to no customers or a very small percentage of customers,

28
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.180
order takeout when they were, you know,

29
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.150
they had dine-in every night and they have these bills and they had their

30
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:44.070
business set up in a way that, you know,

31
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.010
you have to make X amount of money in order to stay open and they were

32
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.390
successful and they're doing well.

33
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.940
And one of the toughest businesses to be successful in,

34
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.150
and then all of a sudden the rug gets pulled out. So what's the solution.

35
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.000
Should people just be able to go to restaurants and everybody works there as a

36
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.840
waiter or a cook, or they just maybe get sick and then more people die. Boy,

37
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.140
that doesn't sound good to anybody either. So what is the solution?

38
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.380
I don't know, but I don't think that in our particular case,

39
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:09.990
I don't think our governor has the answers. Um,

40
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.310
one of the things he's been criticized for is he's decided to open up production

41
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.240
for television and films, but not churches. You know,

42
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:20.520
there's another thing they've done. That's really nuts. And my friend,

43
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:25.170
Adam Curry turned me on to, they closed alcoholics anonymous meetings,

44
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.440
but liquor stores were an essential business.

45
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.320
That is just not, that's not good government. It's not good thinking this,

46
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.140
this there's so many things where they've put into place.

47
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.020
These lists of what's approved and not approved.

48
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.800
And I just don't think that it's an I don't, first of all,

49
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:47.160
I think the information's constantly changing. And I think that they're,

50
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:50.040
they're going off this old information and they haven't made adjustments.

51
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.320
And then on top of it, I don't think they're qualified to,

52
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.930
I don't think they're qualified, just like we were talking about a president,

53
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.010
like one person who's involved in the economy and environment and all these

54
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.830
different things.

55
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.810
I don't think one governor can really be smart enough to know

56
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.650
a,

57
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.400
what kind of impact is going to have economically to close all these businesses

58
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.420
down and B which ones get to open up and what is essential and why.

59
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.810
And it's just, it's very frustrating for all involved.

60
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.750
And it highlights one of the reasons why w you know,

61
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:24.550
the way we do government is it's, you know, it's not perfect. It's, it's not,

62
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.210
it's definitely better than a lot of ways, a lot of places in the world,

63
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.040
but it stills. There's a lot of holes in it.

64
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.560
<v 1>Yeah. I share, I share your frustration with the constantly changing messages.</v>

65
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.760
Uh, do you know what is essential in one state versus in another state?

66
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.530
The issue of churches is a big one. I mean, on, on the other hand, um, the,

67
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:49.270
the in Massachusetts churches were included in the first phase of reopening and

68
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.060
a lot of public health officials say that doesn't make any sense.

69
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.470
And the suspicion is that it's there because of a lot of pressure and that it

70
00:03:56.471 --> 00:04:00.640
probably should have been, you know, in phase two or maybe even phase three.

71
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.390
But I think it's hard to really talk about the state by state,

72
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.610
without acknowledging the disastrous response from the federal government.

73
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:10.750
And I don't know where you stand on that.

74
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.340
You may totally disagree with me on that.

75
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:16.150
And I think that there's a lot of strawmen that are being put in place to argue

76
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.300
that Trump handled it beautifully to use his term.

77
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.130
But I think if you start with the idea of the coordinated federal

78
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:24.641
response,

79
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.660
we could have had a lot of these other issues that we're having now just

80
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.900
wouldn't be issues. And I'm glad to get into it more if you want.

81
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.310
I don't know if you've talked about that a lot.

82
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.740
<v 0>I think it'd be really interesting to talk about this,</v>

83
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.320
because what do you think they could have done differently? Like,

84
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.030
what do you think the government should have done differently?

85
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:40.864
The federal government.

86
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.580
<v 1>Got it? So here here's,</v>

87
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.610
the narrative has been a lot of two sides that are arguing people

88
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.600
who just vaguely say Trump failed. He didn't do enough.

89
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:56.860
And he was slow without like really giving specifics, which I will give.

90
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.510
And then on the other hand,

91
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.660
you've got a lot of people who are just reflexively defending, Hey,

92
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:06.100
he shut down, travel from China really early, and he took it seriously.

93
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:09.760
And we've done the most tests, which is a whole other fiasco,

94
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:13.720
a talking point that we can get into. But for the most part,

95
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.040
I think that the,

96
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:19.540
the critiques and the praise is just not tied to real dates.

97
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.950
So in January, we had our first case, January 20th, I think it was.

98
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:27.550
And South Korea had their first case, January 20th. Um,

99
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.070
we then often skip over February.

100
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.680
So a lot of people will defend Trump by saying,

101
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.590
you're not going to shut down a country when you've got one case.

102
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.590
And I totally agree. You're not going to shut down a country over one case.

103
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.380
We're not going to shut down a country. Over 15 cases.

104
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.780
There was this point where we had 15 and Trump said,

105
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.000
we've got 15 and soon it's going to be zero.

106
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.140
I don't think that it was logical at that point to say, shut it all down,

107
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.430
but just to like pick a date and then we can work around it. March five.

108
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.250
Okay. March 5th, China, 80,000 cases.

109
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.640
So we already had proof that like, this was, this was going to be big.

110
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.960
Italy had 4,000 cases. So this is, this is March five.

111
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.640
So we already had proof that it'll travel really far and it'll get bad

112
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.080
far from China. And we had 221 cases on March five.

113
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.360
It would be very reasonable on March 5th for Trump to say,

114
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.890
this is a problem. FDR like delivery.

115
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.640
I know hard to imagine Trump doing that, but we've got to work together.

116
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.550
This is going to be difficult. We're going to do a 30 day.

117
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.670
I need all 50 governors to help me on this.

118
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.060
Let's do 30 days of stay at home. He probably would have,

119
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.300
then on April 5th have had to ask for another 30.

120
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.240
So we would have done like 60 days, March five to may five.

121
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.560
And where would we be right now? We'd be in really, really good shape.

122
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:51.020
So it's really easy to just say, dude,

123
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:55.250
you're not going to shut down a country with five cases. I don't. I agree.

124
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.930
But we had the information on March 5th, March 10th, March. Well,

125
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.780
at any one of these points, if we did a real shutdown,

126
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.340
we'd be in such good shape.

127
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.481
<v 0>First of all,</v>

128
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:09.500
I think that the support for a shutdown that early would have been almost zero.

129
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.340
I think you would have a really hard time convincing people that this was going

130
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:16.100
to be that big of a deal and that there wouldn't be something they could do to

131
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:19.460
stop. I think a lot of this is Monday morning quarterbacking, right?

132
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.290
We're looking at what happened factually. Like we're looking at it in the past.

133
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.700
This is when we're,

134
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:29.330
there was this amount of cases when it was happening live.

135
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.720
There was a lot of confusion. First of all, the world health organization,

136
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:36.380
as recently as January was saying that, according to China,

137
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.410
this is what they wrote on a Twitter, a tweet. It's not,

138
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.340
it doesn't get transmitted from person to person. So this is in January, right?

139
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:46.550
In March, they were saying, you don't need a mask. This is,

140
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.680
there's been a lot of confusion.

141
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.190
It's not like there was like real straightforward, clear advice.

142
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.480
It's hard for us. It's so easy for us to sit back here.

143
00:07:56.481 --> 00:08:01.460
We are in late may and say, oh, he should have done this. And if he'd done that,

144
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.450
everything would have been great.

145
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.870
The support for shutting down the whole country for 30 days at the beginning of

146
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:08.240
March was zero. I don't think anybody would've agreed with.

147
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.430
<v 1>So there's no question. And I also,</v>

148
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:13.280
I think I do think we want to be careful though, if we,

149
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.930
if we write any retrospective analysis office Monday morning, quarterbacking it,

150
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.060
then it's not even worth discussing. Right.

151
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:23.390
Because we could just say throw it out. It's Monday morning, quarterbacking.

152
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:23.660
I mean.

153
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.560
<v 0>You're right. You're right. Yeah, no, it's definitely look it clearly.</v>

154
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.070
Wasn't perfect. So there's always going to be room for critique,

155
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.340
but like the idea that we could have shut everything down, boy, that is,

156
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.970
that was such a hard sell.

157
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.850
I remember when Cuomo was saying that they're not going to shut down New York,

158
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.893
it'd be too hard to shut.

159
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.290
<v 1>We're going to Blasio share. I mean, th they're they're not, you know,</v>

160
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.470
they're Democrats and Trump's a Republican. I don't care about that. I mean,

161
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:51.680
certainly there, there's no doubt that Cuomo and de Blasio, uh,

162
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:55.350
are deserving of some blame here as well. In one other example,

163
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.120
there was a period we'd have to look@covidtracking.org to get the exact numbers.

164
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.790
But there was a period in either late March or early April,

165
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.990
where South Korea remember South Korea had their first case.

166
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.600
The same day we did, we'd been out within like six or eight hours.

167
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:12.030
It might've been January, 1920 or vice versa,

168
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.410
but there was a point in late March or early April where South Korea

169
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.180
had as many positive tests in a day as we did

170
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.350
pest total.

171
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.010
So this is really important to understand that the discrepancy here, they,

172
00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:31.410
there was a day where we like asked 800 people in the United States and they did

173
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:36.210
so many tests that they had 800 positive cases. And so the, the,

174
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.290
the slow has thing. Response is a disaster.

175
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.640
And it, the proof is w you know, we can say it's Monday morning quarterbacking,

176
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.180
but South Korea got it. Right. Taiwan got it. Right.

177
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:50.940
In terms of places in Europe, Greece did really well.

178
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.950
New Zealand did really well. So we may be looking at it retrospectively,

179
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.820
but there were examples of countries that were on the ball with testing,

180
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:00.690
and it made a huge difference.
