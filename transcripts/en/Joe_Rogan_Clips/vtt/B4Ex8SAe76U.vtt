WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. No. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.760
<v 1>The worst possible scenario, like, um, did you see once upon time in Hollywood?</v>

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.480
I did. So those flower kids, right? The murderous flower, the Manson,

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.320
the Manson kids, those that's like worst case scenario. Yeah.

5
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.920
But sometimes we think about people just on, you know,

6
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.790
just cuz that's a possibility it's such a one mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but he gets a

7
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:25.470
disproportionate amount of energy and interest. Cause for the most part,

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
most people yeah. Are super fine. Yeah. Most people are great.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.270
Most people are friendly. Most people just wanna have a good time in this life.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.133
Yeah. About.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.110
<v 0>Right. Exactly. And even the Manson kids,</v>

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.670
there's probably a couple of them that were fun.

13
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.060
<v 1>I bet there was mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the girl who took off the girl who was</v>

14
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:43.340
like, Hey, I'll be right back. Oh yeah.

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.893
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

16
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.780
<v 1>That girl, you know who, who she is? Life did take off. No. Who is it in.</v>

17
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 0>Real life. Who did you watch? Stranger things. Yes. She's uh,</v>

18
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.700
the, um, she's Ethan Hawk and UMMA Thurman's daughter. What? Yes.

19
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.020
Wow. Yes. That's great. She was the one in the,

20
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.050
the two worked in the ice cream shop. Oh, that's crazy. Yeah.

21
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.890
<v 1>Okay. That's hard. What?</v>

22
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:09.610
I thought you were gonna say the actual Manson kid that did take off there still

23
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:10.190
wasn't.

24
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.770
<v 0>What's that meant the one in real life. Oh, in.</v>

25
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.090
<v 1>Real life. Yeah. You confused the outta everybody.</v>

26
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.690
<v 0>I'm so sorry. Just.</v>

27
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.370
<v 2>Had story going around. Uh, when we were talking about the other day,</v>

28
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.200
that story with Bruce Lee, that was loosely in reality. Yeah.

29
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:25.800
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; had to do with, uh, gene label bell. Oh Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.120
He was a stuntman on like the green Horne or something like.

31
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.600
<v 1>That. Well, let me, let me tell you this.</v>

32
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.960
He said it didn't it wasn't real though. Let me tell you this then.

33
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:36.000
Cuz talking from gene, gene was always I've I've known gene for years.

34
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.600
He's always super respectful about Bruce Lee,

35
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.870
but he's also he's okay. Let, put it this way.

36
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.550
If that actually did happen that way. If Bruce Lee fought Jean label bell,

37
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.430
Jean label bell would grab a hold of him and obliterate his brain on the

38
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.390
concrete 100 out of 100 times. Oh really? Cause let me just say that for,

39
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.350
so I'm not talking about the movie and like there was a thing in the movie where

40
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.740
I felt like they made Bruce Lee seem like a Buffon and I'm like, Ooh,

41
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.620
I don't think he was ever really like that Uhhuh.

42
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.140
This is like kind of an important historical figure for martial arts. And I get,

43
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.860
it's just a crazy Quintin Tarantino movie. I get it. The,

44
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.260
the end of the movie did not. I mean, spoiler, I don't wanna say what happened,

45
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.660
but he takes liberties for entertainment sake with a lot of different things.

46
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.380
Yeah. But with that one, I was like, Ooh,

47
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.090
I'm just gonna have some random dude that, that you know is a stunt man.

48
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.290
And Bruce Lees a buffoon to him and he kicks his on the set. But with that said,

49
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.290
if that guy, if that was a real life event with gene label bell and Bruce Lee,

50
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.130
gene LeBell would crush him. So gene.

51
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.930
<v 0>LeBell could've he's gorilla that would've been him in that scene. Oh yeah.</v>

52
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.890
<v 1>But it would've been quick. Right? It would've been a different thing, man.</v>

53
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.440
He's a gorilla, right? I mean, he's a,

54
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.280
like a judo champion with a severe arsenal of neck

55
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.680
cranks and joint locks and he is strong,

56
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.280
like a bear &lt;laugh&gt; I mean dude, in his prime,

57
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.960
he was a tank of a man really far bigger than Bruce Lee. Oh wait.

58
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.680
And Bruce Lee was small. Right. He was a small guy. Look,

59
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.280
Bruce Lee was an innovator in martial arts and one of my personal heroes. Yeah.

60
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.240
He's like the most important early innovator because he was the first guy to

61
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:18.120
think that you should combine the best elements of all these different styles.

62
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.630
Uh, when I was coming up, man,

63
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.950
I was doing TaeKwonDo and you were brainwashed to think that TaeKwonDo was the

64
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.550
best martial art, everything else was and you shouldn't even practice it.

65
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.310
So if I was practicing other stuff,

66
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.710
like I was doing some boxing or I was doing something like I'd get some frowns

67
00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:36.230
from some people. Yeah. It was like a thing.

68
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:40.260
And if you were in some schools that were less open mind than mine, you know,

69
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.740
my school was a little more practical than some of them, but some of them, they,

70
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:45.300
they would say Kung Fu or death,

71
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.420
like all they wanted to do was Kung Fu they're doing this in the park. Right.

72
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:49.340
And you couldn't say, Hey man,

73
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.780
a wrestler's gonna grab a hold of you and he's gonna just pound you into a tree.

74
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.620
And there's not a God thing you can do about there's Jean there's Jean label,

75
00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:02.090
bell. Who was, he was uh, in a bunch of different movies as a stunt man.

76
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.050
Oh yeah. That, that.

77
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.883
<v 0>Looks like green Hornet.</v>

78
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.490
<v 1>Became same friends. So that's they were very good friends. Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.770
And he had nothing but good things to say about Bruce Lee. Ah,

80
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.490
but he said he taught Bruce Lee a lot, like some of the moves that Bruce Lee,

81
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.770
Bruce, Bruce Lee used an armbar and one of the early scenes in game of death.

82
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:21.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was from Jean Leba Jean label bell.

83
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.560
I guarantee you helped him here. But look at this,

84
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:26.960
like if Jean label bell really wanted to grab a hold of Bruce Lee,

85
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:30.480
Bruce Lee would be unconscious as would I, as would many, many,

86
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.560
many other trained martial artists, not Jamie. Bruce Lee was a Fu I mean,

87
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:37.680
Bruce Lee was a fantastic martial artist. And like I said,

88
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:39.320
one of the most innovative guys ever,

89
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.070
we don't even is how much his style had a gigantic effect on

90
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.910
making untold millions of people sign up for martial arts classes, including me.

91
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:49.530
Right.

92
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.670
<v 0>And part of it was because he was a movie star, right. He had the looks and the,</v>

93
00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:53.910
and the charisma. Yes.

94
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.790
That allowed him to bring it onto film and show everybody.

95
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.950
<v 1>He had everything. He had philosophy.</v>

96
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.700
He had a deep understanding of all these D in martial arts.

97
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.060
And he had the courage to try to combine them, which was unheard of at the time.

98
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:09.300
Where did he got him exercise from a lot of these Kung Fu like circles?

99
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:12.260
Where did he learn it? He learned it from a bunch of different places. I mean,

100
00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:14.060
he learned it, us books. He learned it in China.

101
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.300
He learned different things from different people. I know he did.

102
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.020
He worked with a lot of different martial arts,

103
00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:22.730
including gene LaBelle of course was a what's gene else, judo, uh,

104
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.530
credentials. I know, I guarantee he was a national champion.

105
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.850
I think he was a world champion, but he was, uh, whatever he was.

106
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.610
He's a gorilla.

107
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.850
<v 0>I feel like Kung Fu was more popular earlier.</v>

108
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.290
<v 1>Well, the UFC changed all that. Yeah. Nice. Dan, what is his judo,</v>

109
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.290
but what is his, uh, competition? Uh, accomplishments.

110
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.600
<v 0>Belt. No, &lt;laugh&gt; yellow belt.</v>

111
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.400
<v 1>He's but if that,</v>

112
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.000
that makes sense that they kind of base it on him cuz he really was uh,

113
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.400
a legendary stunt man as well.

114
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.800
<v 0>Wouldn't that be cool though. If,</v>

115
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.800
if Tarantino had the inside scoop on that story.

116
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.000
<v 1>Maybe that's. Yeah. But Bruce Lee and him were friends.</v>

117
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.000
I guarantee you like that didn't go down like that. They didn't have a fight.

118
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.800
Right, right, right. And if they did have a fight,

119
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.520
Jesus Christ &lt;laugh&gt; I'm telling it would've been horrific. Yeah.

120
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.920
That guy's a gorilla. Judo people are different, man.

121
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:19.230
They have different their, their core judo is yeah.

122
00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:23.590
Their core is so strong. There's only a few judo guys that ever rolled with it.

123
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.110
A like of consequence like Carol Perian was one of them.

124
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:28.590
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think when I was a blue belt, I rolled with him and he,

125
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.710
he was like rolling with a chimpanzee &lt;laugh&gt; he just threw me around.

126
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.630
I was like really? Jesus Christ. It's so disheartening.

127
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.950
When you grapple with like a, like a,

128
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.380
a really good wrestler or a really good judo person,

129
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.780
they just have this insane ability to manipulate bodies. It's crazy. Okay.

130
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:48.060
It says, uh, he won the national heavyweight judo championship and the uh,

131
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.300
USA overall judo championship title.

132
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.100
So he won the national heavyweight title and he went on to win both the

133
00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:56.540
heavyweight and overall champion in 1955 as well.

134
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.690
So that a eight amateur athletics, uh, union.

135
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.410
I think that's a AAU. I think that's, that stands for, so that's a,

136
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:07.210
that's a big time judo title, especially for back then in 1954,

137
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:09.890
there probably wasn't that many judo championships.

138
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.170
It was probably a fairly recent thing. Where's judo come from Japan. Japan.

139
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:16.850
Yeah. Japan jujitsu too. Even, uh,

140
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.720
Brazilian jujitsu really came from Japan because, um,

141
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.520
count Meda. Who was this? Uh, traveling judo master mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

142
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.200
he taught people in Brazil. He taught the Gracie's.

143
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.480
So the Gracie family in Brazil. Yeah.

144
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:34.080
They took that jujitsu and they refined it and made, made it much more,

145
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.880
much more emphasis on submissions cuz of Carlos Gracie and Ilio,

146
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:42.550
Gracie and car Arolsen Gracie and like the early masters. Right. Really amazing,

147
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.150
amazing story of one,

148
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:48.310
really one family that kind of revolutionized the way people fight on the ground

149
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.830
and they just all focused on. Right. I remember. Yeah. They just were,

150
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.870
they just were bad asses &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

151
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.910
And they would just fight each other all the time and they were trying to figure

152
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:58.190
out what works best and they's they just got it down to a science.

153
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:01.740
There's the story of about from gene label bell about make us a little bigger.

154
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.740
So can I read this because uh,

155
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:06.540
label bell said that when he got on the set do sold to put Lee in a headlock or

156
00:08:06.541 --> 00:08:08.660
something, so label be went up and grabbed Lee.

157
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.420
He started making all those noises and he,

158
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.700
that he became famous for &lt;laugh&gt; label be said,

159
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.260
but he didn't try to counter me.

160
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.580
So I think he was more surprised than anything else.

161
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.180
So he probably just grabbed him, got him in a headlock,

162
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:21.570
right then label bell lifted Lee onto his back.

163
00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:24.370
What it's called a Fireman's carry and ran around the set with him, said,

164
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:27.570
put me down or I'll kill you. Lee screamed. He said,

165
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.570
I can't put you down or you'll kill me. Label bell said holding Lee there,

166
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.730
as long as he dared before putting him down saying, Hey Bruce, don't kill me.

167
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:38.090
Just kidding champ. Back on his feet again, Lee didn't kill label bell.

168
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.640
I dead Lee recognized his lack of was deficiency in G kudo style of martial arts

169
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:45.920
that he was developing. See, so it wasn't really a fight,

170
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.440
but this is what I'm telling you.

171
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:53.000
Label bell was so powerful and such an amazing judo guide that if it

172
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:55.800
was a fight, it would've been right really quick. Right.

173
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.600
So if that's who he was supposed to be portraying in the movie, like if that's,

174
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.680
if they showed that the Brad Pitt character was some judo champion that became a

175
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:07.160
martial artist later. Okay. Maybe this guy was.

176
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.120
<v 0>Like a roofer &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Well he was a.</v>

177
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.760
<v 1>Beast. It was, it was a fun part of the movie. Yeah. It was great.</v>

178
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.000

179
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.030
<v 0>That movie and it's so it's a, it's like split camps on it.</v>

180
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.030
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like just in my circle of friends that are run into

181
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.030
whatever people either loved it and,

182
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.630
and feel like they could have hung with it for two more hours or people are

183
00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.310
like, what's the point? What was the.

184
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.830
<v 1>Story? I don't get it. Those,</v>

185
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.990
I don't get it guys keep a real close on &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

186
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.380
Keep him like they're Jeffrey Epstein. You're trying to keep life.

187
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.740
It's those people. I don't understand their thinking. I don't either.

188
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.860
<v 0>It was so did you not.</v>

189
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.540
<v 1>Enjoyed that? Oh my God. Wild movie. Like, were you not entertained?</v>

190
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:49.420
Like there was a lot of times in that movie. I was like. Yeah. Whoa. Ah, it's a.

191
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.980
<v 0>Great movie. I could have just hung with it forever.</v>

192
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.940
And especially being out here in LA mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it was just like that

193
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.300
cool muso and Frank's.

194
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.450
<v 1>Ah, they didn't even have to do anything to make it look different.</v>

195
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.410
I know it's so great. That place looks like it's from 1969.

196
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.770
Aren't we supposed to go? Yeah, we're supposed to go. Yeah. You and me and Joey,

197
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.410
