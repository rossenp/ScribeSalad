00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience stories that like,</v>

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.140
it's just amazing to me that the public kind of thinks that there's no gap of

3
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:13.970
time that they didn't see, that could possibly be what led to this.

4
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:17.570
Like it's not one day you were happy on the carpet and the next day you were

5
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:19.880
making out with your friend in Italy, what the? Well,

6
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:23.690
there was a lot of time in between that, that you didn't see. It didn't go.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.990
I didn't like I didn't, you know, can't.

8
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.390
<v 1>Rely on someone else's narrative right now,</v>

9
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:30.770
especially someone who doesn't know you,

10
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:32.870
you really shouldn't even read what people write about.

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.300
<v 0>My dad again, you know, my dad's been a real figure in my life. And, um, my dad,</v>

12
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.130
when he got his Grammy nomination, he wore,

13
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.950
he went to the Grammys in a John three 16 shirt and he,

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.350
he didn't get the Grammy. And the next day,

15
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:49.310
the New York post or someone put even God can't save Billy Ray Cyrus and his

16
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:53.300
career. And he was sitting next to Johnny Cash.

17
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.400
They were going to S something,

18
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.740
I have a Johnny Cash tattoo that was handwritten, uh,

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
to my dad from around that time. And he said, what the hell?

20
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:04.580
Just like you say to me right now, you're my Johnny Cash. You know, he said,

21
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:07.370
what the hell are you doing reading that? And my dad said,

22
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.160
I just never really picked up, picked up the paper again. But again,

23
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:11.540
my dad didn't buy that paper.

24
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:16.220
It was just kind of in your face and thought that was funny. He, he does now.

25
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:17.870
Now he just says, well, whatever,

26
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:20.540
we'll get Johnny Cash to come and sit next to me and talk to me now, he,

27
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.430
now he loves it. Um,

28
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.540
and it's been really good to have him go before me. You know, it's,

29
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.490
it's kind of that buddy system.

30
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:30.530
I think it'd be really scary if I would've been able to see that.

31
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:34.590
But to your point of, I don't click on this. You know, it,

32
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:38.660
it comes into my life by if I walk by a magazine stand,

33
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.600
which I like to walk on the street and it says like,

34
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.880
Miley's on drugs and pregnant. And then I think one of those things are true,

35
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:50.180
but not the other you for lying about me. Yeah.

36
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.170
<v 1>But that's all they have. I mean, what, when someone's in the public eye,</v>

37
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.880
in someone's as prominent as you are,

38
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.870
you become a way for them to access money. Right?

39
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.150
That's all you are advertisement.

40
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.100
<v 0>And I totally get it. It's that unprogrammed thing of also,</v>

41
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.170
I think what's interesting sitting here with you is that all of this is kind of

42
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.250
new. Um, I mean, even just like the idea of podcasts,

43
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.760
what I used to do when it was like promo time for an a record. Okay.

44
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:23.990
So I'm 12 years old and I'm printing physical copies of my album.

45
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:26.960
So I have to write my music, you know,

46
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.370
six months before you actually. So I just, the Dolly's new album for Christmas.

47
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.050
And I had to record a Christmas song in July.

48
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:34.850
It was the weirdest thing I've ever done in my life.

49
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.770
But when you make physical copies, that's what you do.

50
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.940
And you're telling a story from always being behind,

51
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.960
especially when it comes to the media. So now what I love about this,

52
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:47.390
what I love doing, you know, a show like yours is like,

53
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.880
we talk about it right now and people hear it right now.

54
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.590
So you're getting the real information.

55
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.380
You're not getting information from all right. I, you know,

56
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:57.170
I shot a magazine cover. I did an interview.

57
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.340
I was law in love with my boyfriend mean that literally happened when I did

58
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:03.220
vanity fair. I flew there like a week after I had gotten married.

59
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.100
By the time the thing was on the stands, I was divorced. It was old news.

60
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.050
It was like, come on, you know,

61
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.440
you really not able to tell your story in real time.

62
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.010
And that's what I love about the new way that music is happening in streaming.

63
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.160
And I love the idea that like I threw up that, um, uh,

64
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.470
flaming lips record I did on SoundCloud and it was like, you know,

65
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.900
no one had to buy it or I sound 105,

66
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.280
but it's very exciting because I really hated always being behind myself.

67
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.860
And I think that's what,

68
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.310
now I can use my art as my kind of,

69
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.650
I guess the way that I can talk to the press. Isn't what bothers me.

70
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.980
It's kind of the public, you know? And, and I, and I got in this habit where,

71
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.350
when people would meet me,

72
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.720
because I didn't get in the habit just became a thing that happened constantly

73
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:51.460
was I meet someone and they go, man, you're not as crazy as I thought you'd be.

74
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.260
And I'm like, thank you. Uh, I dunno what you thought I'd be doing right now.

75
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.420
If you thought I'd be in like, you know, space, buns,

76
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.530
dropping acid or something.

77
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.280
But people say that to me all the time that I'm not as crazy as they thought I

78
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:05.380
would be. And that's just a weird thing to say to someone.

79
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.840
<v 1>Yeah. But the public image, like what they sold of you, you know,</v>

80
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:12.090
here you are Hannah Montana. And then all of a sudden,

81
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:16.230
you're this very sexual singer and you doing all this crazy stuff and you're on

82
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.440
television, shaking your. And everybody's seeing that. And they're like, oh,

83
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.810
Miley Cyrus is out of control. Now she's won.

84
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.730
So then that becomes the narrative, right?

85
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.440
<v 0>When people make the narrative,</v>

86
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.840
when you become in control that now you're out of it.

87
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.880
That was always really interesting.

88
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.180
<v 1>Well, it's also youth, right? Like, like, think about the marriage thing. Right?</v>

89
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:36.570
You take it, you say vanity fair. They write the article. You're deeply in love.

90
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.050
By the time it comes out, you're already divorced. Right? That's so Hollywood.

91
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.580
I mean, to them, that's like, oh,

92
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.640
we've seen this story before we know where this going. I'll also,

93
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.000
you're a child star. Oh. We've seen this story before.

94
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.420
And so you get stuck in that narrative too, right?

95
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:55.410
Because they want you to fall down the exact same path. They don't want.

96
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.510
<v 2>You to reinvent yourself past.</v>

97
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.930
<v 1>Well, then they'll spell it out for you. This is what she's doing.</v>

98
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.970
She's on drugs. I've had.

99
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.690
<v 0>To con I've had to now I don't read those types of things,</v>

100
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:10.620
but I've had to unlearn that they're not true.

101
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.760
Cause sometimes I write things.

102
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.570
I write things down when I want something to get put into my head.

103
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.940
Even if I'm going to have a hard conversation with somebody,

104
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.190
usually I kind of write a little mini script for myself.

105
00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:23.580
So I kinda know where I, I don't like going into something with no direction.

106
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.100
Where do I want this to go? What are my goals? What do I want?

107
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:27.720
That's what any of your athletes would do? It's like,

108
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.520
I know that I have that as an artist, I want to have a long career.

109
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.960
I have to do the things to be able to have that, um, longevity.

110
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.870
And so I would write down, you know, kind of, uh,

111
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.480
kind of an idea of where I'd want conversations to go,

112
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:46.110
even with the people in my life and what do I want out of them.

113
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:50.280
And I had to stop going, Hey, just because they wrote that down. It's true.

114
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.890
Because something about writing it down gives a lot of power.

115
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.040
I don't like to write down things that I don't mean.

116
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.350
That's why I don't write songs. I hate because once you write it down,

117
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.490
they are like alive.

118
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.750
What you're saying is that like reading things that other people wrote about you

120
00:06:04.751 --> 00:06:06.490
made you think that those things were real,

121
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.220
so it with your own personal narrative.

122
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.210
<v 0>Your definition of yourself to prove something that I didn't need to prove.</v>

123
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.830
Like all of a sudden I'd be trying to prove that I'm not crazy when I knew I

124
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:22.060
wasn't crazy. Um, and yeah,

125
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.600
I just think also, I mean, when we're talking about realistic children's books,

126
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:29.650
I think the stigma that kind of, uh, surrounds, you know,

127
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.620
youth growing up rebelling and then craziness,

128
00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:36.340
and then what's the line between that and mental illness. And, you know,

129
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.810
I do have some kind of genetic family history of alcohol. I mean,

130
00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:42.580
that totally gets erased when you're a celebrity.

131
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:44.980
It's like Hollywood did this to you. It's like, no, dude,

132
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:48.580
my great grandma was an alcoholic. You know, my granddad was an alcoholic.

133
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.530
My grandma's an alcoholic. Um, you know, so I, I obviously had it.

134
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:56.950
Wasn't Hollywood, you know, it's genetic. I,

135
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.220
I understand my self from a human.

136
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.820
There's nothing about me that thinks I am super human. And I think that,

137
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.420
I think I would, I would take that as something that,

138
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.870
that makes me unique because I don't think that I'm really,

139
00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:13.450
I know that there's something special about me in my life,

140
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.890
but I don't feel that on this level of, of being a human,

141
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:22.120
that I'm different. And so I know what it takes to keep this motor going. And,

142
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.760
and, and I also know when to take time. Well, all.

143
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.370
<v 1>Those things, you said it perfect. As long as you have doubt,</v>

144
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.990
as long as you want to do better.

145
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:33.790
As long as you're recognizing who you are is not exactly who you want to be.

146
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.040
You want to be better. You want to figure it all out.

147
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.640
You want to work it all through and you have this weird guilt from growing up in

148
00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:44.080
this weird way. It has to be your superstar. When you're a little kid guilt,

149
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.480
there's no way around it. And if you hang out with normal people,

150
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:48.460
they're going to stick that in your face as soon.

151
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.880
<v 0>I'll hold my guilt. They know the weakness. So they use it with me.</v>

152
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.610
You got to find people that don't do that. That's why my,

153
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.400
my crew is pretty small, beautiful. Well, they're all nice people.

154
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.040
And they've all been my in my life for over 10 years. And.

155
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.800
<v 1>That is possible. People ask people that are famous. Like,</v>

156
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:06.790
is it possible that you could find people that don't get weird around you? Yeah,

157
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:09.520
you could find them, but they have to be strong people.

158
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.730
You have to have people that don't have their own personal sovereignty.

159
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.910
There are people that can hold their own space. They don't need you.

160
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:16.540
They just love.

161
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.730
<v 2>You. And that is possible. And you know.</v>

162
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.900
<v 0>I had someone that, that tried to try to hurt me and say that,</v>

163
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.000
I mean, I really have had I've I've, I've had really amazing people in my life,

164
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.620
but I've had people that have tried to hurt me too.

165
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:32.470
I haven't brought my little scarf just in case I got emotional.

166
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.423
Cause I really might.

167
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.700
I had someone recently tried to tell me that everyone in my life is afraid of

168
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:40.330
me. And that like, that really makes me upset just because.

169
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.940
<v 1>I brought a lot of people in your life are afraid. I think everyone.</v>

170
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.780
<v 0>In my life that I have in my close inner circle really loves me.</v>

171
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.980
And so to say that everyone in my life acts out of fear of me, my mom,

172
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.000
I'm almost 30. She will whip my. Like my mom will actually hit me,

173
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.700
but I don't mean in a bad way.

174
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.590
<v 1>I don't mean that they're afraid of you like,</v>

175
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.420
like afraid you're going to do something terrible.

176
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.840
And they're afraid around you. I mean, you're a powerful thing.

177
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.500
You're you mean this? There's no getting away from who you are.

178
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.150
You got to kind of accept that your Miley Cyrus, not a very strange thing,

179
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.750
but there's one Miley Cyrus on, in the universe that we know of.

180
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.740
It's you and you're really famous and you're really young. It's weird.

181
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.940
There's no getting around that.

182
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.090
And the fact that you feel guilt about all this and the fact that you want

183
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:25.020
things to be difficult,

184
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.260
those are all the best indicators that you're trying to do better.

185
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.480
Like you get it, you do get it.

186
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.060
And you know that you have a hard road and the people that don't think you have

187
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.980
a hard road, there are their mind.

188
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.380
Like I didn't get famous until I was much later in life.

189
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.160
And it was a slow drip into my thirties and into my forties.

190
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.440
It was way healthier. But I also, during the whole time did martial arts.

191
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.720
So it was always humbled. I was,

192
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.120
I was getting my kicked and I feel like those two things are the only things

193
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:54.650
that saved me from my own brain, because you're,

194
00:09:54.651 --> 00:09:57.750
you're like people are not designed to be famous.

195
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.510
That's why Kings are all tyrants. When you've,

196
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.890
you're the one person who gets to make all the calls, absolute power corrupts.

197
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:08.220
Absolutely. It's a common expression, right? That happens with.

198
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.390
<v 0>Famous. I'm trying to have a good relationship with the power and feel,</v>

199
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.430
feel a healthy dynamic to work the way you're.

200
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.940
<v 1>Describing it is perfect. Like how many, like look the Ellen situation.</v>

201
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.390
I don't know, Ellen, she's probably a nice lady, but she's in control.

202
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.760
She's in control of all these people and they're all scared of her. She's like,

203
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.980
you. Where's my tea. You know, that, that kind of.

204
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.160
That's not a good place for a person to be.

205
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.680
<v 2>I'm really, really.</v>

206
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.500
<v 0>Proud of myself that I don't live in that world.</v>

207
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:37.220
And I think I could probably also mark that up to animals and how much I love

208
00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:39.710
them. And I think that's what led to my veganism for a time.

209
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:43.040
It was like the fact that tonight I have to put powder on my dog's.

210
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.200
That makes me happy.

211
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.900
Apparently I think it kind of just hopefully conceals in some way,

212
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.150
how disgusting it's very,

213
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:57.860
very out there and in your face. And I think it's more of like a,

214
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.240
a concealer. Um, but I'm really happy that Kate Moss, Hey guys,

215
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:04.850
I got to say Kate Moss makes me put baby powder on her.

216
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.350
Just use that as the teaser. Um, one time Kate Mazda,

217
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:13.040
when we put baby powder on her called monkey butt. So I, um, that,

218
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:15.530
that makes me happy. And like my, one of my dogs,

219
00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:17.060
he's obsessed with drinking out of the pool.

220
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.450
And so he like throws up all the time and it's disgusting and it all didn't

221
00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:23.870
seem, always makes me happy. And the one thing that I like about my dogs,

222
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.670
they don't know who I am. I mean,

223
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:27.620
they know that they got a good living situation. They're probably like,

224
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:28.940
I wonder what she does for a living,

225
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.180
but because their life is pretty good and they get to go to other cool places

226
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:36.170
also. Um, but yeah, my dogs don't know who I am. So I liked that.

227
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:39.020
And the cat scratched the out of me all the time and the pigs are horrible.

228
00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:40.460
They bite my ankles. I love it about.

229
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.750
<v 1>Them. Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify.</v>

230
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.980
That's right. They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

231
00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:51.410
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

232
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:55.090
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

233
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.110
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

234
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.940
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
