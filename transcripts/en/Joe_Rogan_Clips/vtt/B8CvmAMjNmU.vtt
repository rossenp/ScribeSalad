00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.560
<v 2>Well, obviously I was doing those shows with Dave till he got the.</v>

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.200
<v 0>Communities. What was that? It was, it was stubs here am theater.</v>

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.720
<v 1>Okay. Stubs has a 400 seat am theater. And, uh,</v>

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.480
so we tested the entire crowd. And then, um, someone in Dave's circle,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.430
not related to the show got COVID and was hanging around with Dave.

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.310
Got Dave sick, got three or four other people. Sick radio Raim got sick.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.510
Um, uh, the photographer's son got sick.

9
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:33.710
I don't know if the photographer got sick. A lot of guys got sick.

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.190
Did you El get it? No, no. Elon already had it. Okay.

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.070
Is anti Elon had it in the past?

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.340
And a lot of people were saying his girlfriend Grimes gave it to Dave.

13
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.660
That's not true. No, he was another guy that gave it to Dave.

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.180
His girlfriend Grimes had gotten over it already long before,

15
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.540
like several days before she got to the show. You, yeah.

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.341
<v 0>You, I don't know.</v>

17
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:55.900
Maybe have the blood type or you just built different where you just,

18
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:57.420
you're not the guy who's gonna get COVID.

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.810
<v 1>I don't know, man, but I got show. Well, see, I was at a show,</v>

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.170
um, with, uh, several people that wound up getting COVID.

21
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.210
Cause I went to this show and uh, I didn't expect that it was gonna be like,

22
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.650
so COVID E &lt;laugh&gt;. Everybody was just, you can feel it. Yeah. Out here bro.

23
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.410
People don't give a. They just go out. But the thing is you can see Florida.

24
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.360
Yeah. Oh know.

25
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.000
<v 0>Dude. I just show for new year Eve, I walked out and there's,</v>

26
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.200
it was just everyone's together. And I come out. I'm like,

27
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.960
do you guys not get the news? Like, listen, I'm pretty loosey goosey,

28
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:35.160
but this's ridiculous. And I see a guy making up with two chicks in the front.

29
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240
I go, Hey, hold on, stop. Do you know each other? They're like, no,

30
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.560
I'm like the you doing, man. They're not.

31
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.350
<v 1>Worried. They're not worried about it. No, they don't care, man.</v>

32
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.670
Do you know about, uh, Corin and zinc and all those,

33
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.550
the different medic or different nutrients? Yeah.

34
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.110
For people that didn't listen to the Mark Gordon podcast,

35
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.550
I'd recommend you listen to it because there's actual peer reviewed studies on

36
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.990
Corin, which is something called an ion four, which gets ions into the cells.

37
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.700
And then you take that with zinc has a much higher absorption rate of zinc.

38
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.380
And according to Dr. Gordon,

39
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
it essentially like stops viruses dead in its tracks. When you,

40
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:14.220
when you take this on a regular basis, even COVID. Yeah. And I'm, I'm just on,

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.860
I have not wavered even a little on my vitamins mean either. I.

42
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.380
<v 0>I stay unless I got COVID right. I was like the Canary,</v>

43
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:24.730
the coalmine for comics 20. But you were, there was the first one.

44
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.410
<v 1>Yeah. It seems to me like kind of everybody's gonna get it. Yeah. At this point.</v>

45
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.430
Be cool, man. Yeah.

46
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.290
<v 0>Be cool. Yeah. Everybody's gonna get it be cool.</v>

47
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.050
<v 1>Well, the people is like, when you get it,</v>

48
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.130
they're like want to yell at you for being irresponsible and for killing my

49
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.210
grandma, Kevin Hart so.

50
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.290
<v 0>Much smart on me cuz he got it. And then announced six months later, like, Hey,</v>

51
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.480
I did have it a few months ago and was like, all right. Not big deal.

52
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.800
<v 1>Yeah. You were like, while you had it, you announced it. The day I got the Hey.</v>

53
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.680
<v 0>Got COVID. I.</v>

54
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.520
<v 1>Have a friend who got it and doesn't Joey lit you up. Oh, let me, well,</v>

55
00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:57.960
Joey was lit lightening me up for going and doing that show in Houston. Joey,

56
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.040

57
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.240
Wanna catch that? Give a, give it to your friends. Joey, come on. Well,

58
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.320
he's worried about getting it.

59
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.400
<v 0>You know? And he should be with, with his health and you know, his stature.</v>

60
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.680
He should be, you know, cuz I have a, a family friend,

61
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.840
my mother-in-law's best friends, their son got he's 22, you know, outta shape.

62
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.150
But he, he passed away from it. I whoa. Yeah. He's 22, 22 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

63
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:24.910
So there there's like those outliers that you, how outta shape is he? You know,

64
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:29.710
pretty, you know, not, not like obese, probably 5, 10, 2 80, 2 90.

65
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.150
That's not obese. I mean that's obese, but I'm I'm saying he's not like,

66
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.870
you know, he's not on TLC 600 pound life or nothing, but that's OB that's.

67
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.900
<v 1>Morbidly obese though. Yeah. Great. That's he's a hundred pounds.</v>

68
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900
<v 0>Overweight. Yeah. He's he's heavy. Yeah. though.</v>

69
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.793
<v 1>That's crazy. Should.</v>

70
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.820
<v 0>22, 22, 22. Heartbreaking too. That's.</v>

71
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.580
<v 1>What was so that's what's such a bummer man.</v>

72
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:53.460
It's like we have such a problem with obesity in this country and poor diet.

73
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.100
And that is the number one comorbidity factor.

74
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.380
Apparently for COVID death is being overweight.

75
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.090
<v 0>Should be a wake up call, like get in shape. Jesus.</v>

76
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.890
<v 1>Christ. It should be. But you know, I've had overweight people on the podcast.</v>

77
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.330
I'm like you do anything about it. I can't wait for the vaccine.
