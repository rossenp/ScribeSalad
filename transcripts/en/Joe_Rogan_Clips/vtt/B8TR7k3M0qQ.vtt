00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 1>Now, when you work as a coach for George,</v>

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.740
you weren't just working as a jujitsu coach.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.250
You were working in almost like a mastermind,

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.370
sort of a position. You, I mean,

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.130
I saw some conversations that you had with him,

7
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:23.070
where you discussed various things. And in fact,

8
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:27.390
one of the things you came to me about was you asked me if I knew

9
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.420
anyone who was proficient at the spinning back kick.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.580
And that's how I got to working with George. Your P your,

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
your coaching with him was not just simply like the,

12
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.560
these are the principles of jujitsu. This is what I want you to work on.

13
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.970
When the fight goes to the ground,

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.930
you were working on a lot of different aspects.

15
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.490
Like you are a guy that sort of put it together. Now,

16
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.240
when you don't have a background in striking and you know, you are,

17
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:01.380
you're looking at all of these various disciplines and trying to formulate a

18
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:05.610
strategy for a guy who was just such a Supreme athlete like George,

19
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.490
how did you, how did you formulate that?

20
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:12.720
Did you do it based on the individual and based on their physical strengths and

21
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:16.800
limitations and sort of formulate what you think would be the best approach?

22
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.620
Did you work it out with him in conjunction?

23
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.890
<v 2>Um, the, when, when George comes to train with me, there's,</v>

24
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.600
there's a bunch of considerations festival George lives in Montreal.

25
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.510
I live in New York. So time is always an issue. Well,

26
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:34.280
he does go down there quite often, but, um, uh, but it's not like a squat squad,

27
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.080
like seven days a week, three times a day, George was never like that. Um, uh,

28
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.370
so in the time available, we'll work on, uh, on,

29
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.970
on what we can. So everything's always done with Jorgen. Okay.

30
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.630
How much time is available and what is a scenario that's coming up for George?

31
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:55.370
Almost always. It was, um, uh, an upcoming mixed martial arts fight. Okay.

32
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.760
Um, so a lot of people often ask me to say, you know, how come you didn't teach,

33
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.770
teach Joyce and PLA clogs? Why, why wasn't he late logging everyone in MMA?

34
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.780
Um, well, that's, that's a good question. Uh, first off, um,

35
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.380
late logging, as you saw from the Gordon,

36
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:16.430
Ryan clip requires if it's not done well,

37
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.950
lake logging is one of those things where if it's done well, it's amazing,

38
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.170
but if it's done badly, it's the worst looking thing in the world.

39
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.310
It's a disaster. Um, so, uh, secondly,

40
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.330
George's game because it's taped down to so strong is almost always done from

41
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.930
top position on the ground is rare for George to be in bottom position on the

42
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:36.020
ground. Um, and in a fight situation,

43
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:39.350
if you're already on top of someone and you've got the striking prowess of

44
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:41.000
George St. PM, I was happy to,

45
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.290
to coach him more in what we call a grapple boxing, this the skill of,

46
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.880
of grappling to punching on the ground. It just made more sense for him. Um,

47
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.530
he's competent in leg blogging,

48
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.580
but he's not like Gary Tonin Eddie Cummings or Gordon Ryan,

49
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.190
could he finish most black bouncy? Absolutely.

50
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.780
But why you stake a fight where literally millions of dollars. I mean,

51
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.160
40 is a legacy on the line.

52
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.220
Why would you take that risk when you could just stay on down to punch him out?

53
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.190
Like he did with say John fetch, for example, you know? Um,

54
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.120
so it didn't really make sense to push that hard on George. Um,

55
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.820
your question though was okay. Well, what about these other skills?

56
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.360
What about standing position? Well, um, I'm, I'm fascinated,

57
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.700
not just by just my martial arts in general,

58
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.290
and I've always believed all the various sport martial arts in the world have

59
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.920
areas where they are particularly strong. For example, I've always,

60
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.450
people make fun of TaeKwonDo, you know, that are,

61
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.250
they don't want us talking on him. I mean, you'll back me up on this joke.

62
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.330
There were some TaeKwonDo players out there at Olympic level who can kick with a

63
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.200
skill level that most people can't even imagine. Um,

64
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.460
uh,

65
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.440
I've seen people like her Perez kicking demonstrations with it.

66
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.200
You're looking at it.

67
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.470
This is one of the most impressive things I've ever seen in my life.

68
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.310
And this is the guy who, if he hits you is going to take your head off it's. I.

69
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.370
<v 1>Was there, it wouldn't hurt. Pres was in his prime. I watched him Kao,</v>

70
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:04.950
quite a few people. I watched him Kao, uh,

71
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:08.100
one of the U S national champions with an ax care. So.

72
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.760
<v 2>With the worst chaos I've ever seen in my life came from TaeKwonDo.</v>

73
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.980
Like they tend to involve a jump spinning kicks with just huge amounts of,

74
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:18.900
of, of kinetic energy being developed.

75
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.540
You see the same thing in point fighting karate season, terrible knockout,

76
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:26.280
some point finding people make fun of these sports acting on their own is the

77
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.920
issue. That's the issue. That's the issue on their own. They got problems.

78
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:33.030
But if you can integrate that into a well-developed complete skillset,

79
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.410
they could be incredibly effective.

80
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:38.850
And I always saw tremendous potential for TaeKwonDo dos jump spinning backache.

81
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.090
No one does spinning backaches better than TaeKwonDo.

82
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.300
That's one of their main things and they do it incredibly well.

83
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.580
The setups are fantastic that the application,

84
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:49.830
the mechanics everything's super impressive.

85
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.510
So I always thought that would be a, you know,

86
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:53.100
George had a good spinning back kick,

87
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:54.600
but I thought that would be a nice addition.

88
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:58.020
You always want to be building new skills into a upon you don't,

89
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.510
you don't want to be that predictable guy where everyone knows what you're

90
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:05.220
doing. And, um, uh, and I know you came from TaeKwonDo backgrounds and, uh,

91
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.950
so I thought that would be an interesting thing for you to work on with him.

92
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.790
Well, it was.

93
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.390
<v 1>A funny conversation because that was my specialty. Yes.</v>

94
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.520
And so when you brought in, I always wanted to talk to you.

95
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:17.700
I was fo found you a fascinating guy. So when he came up to me and you said,

96
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:21.150
do you know anyone? It's almost like a trick question. It was a trick question.

97
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.490
And when you know anyone besides Joe, like what I said, I was like,

98
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.630
I was hesitant. I was like, okay, you're not going to believe this, but.

99
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.010
<v 2>The truth is I knew you had a good junk swinging back. I was trying to subtly,</v>

100
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.000
did you know, how did you know we would get, oh, okay.

101
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.610
<v 1>I thought you were just with me. I mean,</v>

102
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.720
but I felt like when I was telling you, I was like, man, I don't even want it.

103
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.000
I wish I knew someone who did it as well.

104
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.830
<v 2>As me. You should have just been like, yeah,</v>

105
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.460
I got the best jump spinning back in the. Not really. I.

106
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.420
<v 1>Did jump spinning back, hit quite a bit,</v>

107
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:57.680
but I prefer a regular spinning back here. I want my foot, the ground.

108
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.510
Cause I push off that foot. Yeah.

109
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.100
There's a significant amount of force in the left leg forcing, uh,

110
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.100
pushing off that back. Interestingly.

111
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.630
<v 2>You've seen some,</v>

112
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.660
some guys out there now having good success and even me spinning back because I

113
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:13.360
remember seeing Michael Page had a beautiful one. He's got average.

114
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.980
<v 1>Yeah. That guy can do very impressive.</v>

115
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.700
He's another guy who came from that point fighting background, you know,

116
00:06:18.701 --> 00:06:23.380
you see Raymond Daniels and him and a lot of these guys from that

117
00:06:23.381 --> 00:06:25.030
background, Raymond Daniels.

118
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.350
<v 2>Worked with, uh, George, uh, for his last two fights. Very, very impressive guy.</v>

119
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.243
Phenomenal.

120
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.660
<v 1>Yeah. And, and again,</v>

121
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:36.490
it's he had just the point fighting skills and now he's developing real

122
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:40.960
boxing skills and he's, you know, you've seen him in Beltour Kickbox, you know,

123
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.840
he's you see, you see the integration of the two it's phenomenal. I mean,

124
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:48.670
he could just do things physically that most Kickbox just really don't know what

125
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:51.430
he's doing. You know, he'll, he'll jump up and do,

126
00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:54.730
what's called like a touch spinning back kick.

127
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.580
Like he'll jump up and touch you with the front.

128
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.600
<v 2>Leg. I saw that he hit it in a glorified, I believe. And, um,</v>

129
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.190
yeah.

130
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.590
<v 1>He's phenomenal. He's phenomenal. But then again,</v>

131
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.780
when you see that it's like those things by themselves,

132
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.050
you're just going to get taken to the ground and smashed. And most people,

133
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.980
unless you land one of those catastrophic spinning backaches right away,

134
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.290
the odds are you, you,

135
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:24.460
you need all those other things as well in order to be particularly effective,

136
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.900
which is why George was such a way with it. Yeah, yeah,

137
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.250
yeah. But that was, uh, that was a fun moment. It was an interesting,

138
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.610
because like I've always wanted to like show somebody this it's cause it's a

139
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:38.230
weird little thing that I know how to do.

140
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.810
<v 2>Um, going back to your original question,</v>

141
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:42.550
the idea of Georgian and shoot chatbots,

142
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.630
you'll see that Georgia's entire methodology in the standing position is built

143
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.000
around the concept of a dilemma.

144
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.860
The dilemma is always between his jab and his takedown.

145
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.280
People always talk about proactive and reactive. Takedowns okay.

146
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.960
This guy's a reactive take. This guy's a proactive takedown guy.

147
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.960
The thing about George is he would use his jab

148
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.160
proactively, but he would use his takedowns reactively.

149
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.710
Now that's interesting because George would literally provoke people.

150
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.100
You're saying the sit down, I would.

151
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.030
<v 1>Just want to point this out past tense. You're saying this like, you know,</v>

152
00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:29.530
something, I don't know. No, no, no. George just won the middleweight title,

153
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.821
relinquished the title.

154
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:33.430
And then the great speculation is will George fight again?

155
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.910
<v 2>The truth is that no one knows because it comes down to medical problems.</v>

156
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.060
George has a, uh, uh,

157
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.390
he's got a problem on his stomach and colitis. Is that what it is? Yeah.

158
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.590
And what is that exactly? It's uh, I'm not gonna claim to a medical expert,

159
00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:51.130
but it's one of the most frustrating things that George has had to deal with

160
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:54.550
where there are certain parts of the human body that is out of your control and

161
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:56.790
the stomach is one of them, just things happening in your stomach.

162
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.710
You can't control it. Things like stress seem to make it worse. Um, and,

163
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.850
uh, uh, the truth is that no one really knows at this point. So, um,

164
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.500
wherever there's doubt, my instinct is to think, well,

165
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.060
you already want to come back, George,

166
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:15.810
you've done all this and what a great way to cap off the career too.

167
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.703
It was amazing.

168
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.550
<v 1>And I got to tell you when he came back,</v>

169
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:23.030
this is what was really interesting about that fight. George had said,

170
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.360
I'm better. I am a better martial artist than I was before.

171
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.790
And he looked better. I mean,

172
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.300
he definitely looked like he was a little out of competition.

173
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.320
Like there was a moment. Yeah.

174
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.580
<v 2>Okay. How many fighters do you know, came back after a four year layoff?</v>

175
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.530
<v 1>Very few, but skill wise, he looked phenomenal. I mean,</v>

176
00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:47.300
his striking looked incredibly smooth and I think you could see it in

177
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:51.350
Bisping's face. Like pretty early on, like this guy is,

178
00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:55.940
this is not a rusty George St. Pierre. It's not a small welterweight. Who's,

179
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.340
you know, making his way in the middle where he looked huge,

180
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.090
he looked phenomenal. His, his technique,

181
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.360
the way he was landing leg kicks and his sharp jab.

182
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:08.930
And then ultimately that left hand that he used to stun Bisping and get him on

183
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:10.850
the ground. I mean, he looks sensational.

184
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.660
<v 2>Yes. Um, uh, you were there the night.</v>

185
00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:18.560
George went into his first retirement and you'll recall the whole retirement

186
00:10:18.561 --> 00:10:22.550
thing was kind of, the speech was vague. It wasn't, yeah, it was confusing.

187
00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:26.480
And um, cause he intrude, he didn't know if he wanted to retire. Um,

188
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.730
the whole thing was actually contrived in the octagon right there in front of

189
00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.770
you. I would have been a hard fight. Uh,

190
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.950
the training camp hadn't been the best camp though. The fight for Hendricks was,

191
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.320
uh, George was unclear if he wanted to fight at all,

192
00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:42.590
there were all kinds of controversies involved in the fight. And um,

193
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:47.390
then when the fight was over, it was, it was a very close fight. Um, and, uh,

194
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.720
uh, he wasn't sure what he wanted to do.

195
00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:55.430
There was a language miscommunication and ultimately he, he essentially,

196
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:58.220
he walked away from the game and he walked away for four years.

197
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.520
That's a long time to be out of a sport that as young as him, a man,

198
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:04.970
which is evolving all the time, every year, the sport changes and, uh,

199
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.840
the belts tend to change hands very, very quickly. Um,

200
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.760
so when George started talking to me about the idea of, okay,

201
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:17.270
I want to come back, I think I've still got comeback. I want to come back.

202
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.640
There's a desire. Passion. My point to him was first off.

203
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.470
You sure you really want to do this? Like, you know,

204
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:26.900
the last two fight camps was tough.

205
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.410
You didn't seem to have the same kind of drive as he used to have you sure you

206
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:33.500
want to do this? Is this like a middle-aged fantasy here going through here?

207
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.950
And he said, none of that, I feel this. I want to come back.

208
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.630
So my question to him was if you're gonna come back,

209
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.820
are you just going to do the same thing?

210
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.880
You're just going to come back to welterweight and do what you always did,

211
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:51.050
which is come out and beat the best welterweights and just hold a title.

212
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:55.900
It's going to be doing the same thing. I thought, if you're going to come back,

213
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.530
let's do something significant, something you haven't done before.

214
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.930
And so the way I put it to him was what are the three most persistent

215
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.770
criticisms you always hear about George St. Pierre, number one,

216
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.840
he never fought up a weight class and never went up. Number two,

217
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.340
you fought. So tactically sound was such an emphasis on,

218
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.250
uh, strategy and techniques or what have you that matches could become

219
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.920
dull. The average fan was like, well, yeah, he's,

220
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:30.820
he's winning easily and it's dominant, but it doesn't do it for,

221
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:34.600
it's not excited, no drama and the funds on gun. Um,

222
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:40.090
so you had this idea that, uh, on one hand, uh, uh,

223
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.580
he was very technically sound strategically deep,

224
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.710
but the fights weren't as exciting as they ought to be. Um,

225
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.610
the idea that he'd never gone up a weight category in the third,

226
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.000
most persistent Chris and Lee didn't finish fights. Okay.

227
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:57.730
He was a very skilled fighter. It wasn't finishing fights.

228
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.180
So my point here was okay. If you got to come back,

229
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.190
let's do it in a way where you address those three things. Okay.

230
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.210
George's is always concerned about his legacy as a fighter.

231
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:13.000
And if there were three persistent criticisms of George NPS legacy,

232
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.920
so three things you don't finish in fights,

233
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:18.280
you never went up a weight class and you're too tactical. Okay?

234
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.750
You're not providing the drama that a fight should. So I said,

235
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:23.584
let's change things

236
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.800
we've got in that four years. Previous to that, whenever I was training George,

237
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.500
I was training him for a fight. He was going to fight. He's fighting.

238
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:35.170
Nick Diaz is funny. Carla's condos finding, you know, whoever.

239
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.090
And it was always getting him ready for a fight.

240
00:13:37.091 --> 00:13:41.020
You find him Matt Hughes in two months, let's get ready. Now you're a tired.

241
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.020
I'm not going to train you to fight some dude.

242
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.300
I'm going to train you in jujitsu.

243
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.320
Freddie Roach is going to train you in boxing.

244
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.750
In this scenes,

245
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.370
we could S we hit the time now to start working on finishing skills.

246
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:06.580
A significant change occurred where my primary emphasis in training George in

247
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:09.040
that four year layoff was in submissions. Now,

248
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.270
happily that happened at what time, the time the squad was coming out.

249
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.100
So I had a group of some of the best submission peoples in the world for George

250
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:22.060
to work with. So his submission started getting better. Suddenly Joe St. Pierre,

251
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.690
he got on your back as a problem. He submitting people in the gym.

252
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.710
I could run off some names. I won't do it cause it's not the thing to do,

253
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:32.170
but I could find out some names of people he submitted in the gym that would

254
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:36.280
shock you, like well known you to two people. And for the first time,

255
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:39.730
he's our primary focus. Wasn't on grapple walks and it was submission.

256
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.010
Freddie Roach was working on with, on the mechanics of punching.

257
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.550
George always had good in-out movement. It was had like that karate movement,

258
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.440
the, um, the ability. He always had a strong jab,

259
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.780
but now he's teaching them how to sit on a punch.

260
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:57.710
Suddenly George had a left hook. Okay.

261
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.480
And you're a guy who can integrate lift,

262
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.270
uh left-hand between jab and leave took. That's a dangerous man. Okay. Um,

263
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.650
everyone was worried, you know,

264
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:09.650
there's so much overreaction to George's J at this suddenly left hook

265
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:12.320
opportunities were opening up and now he was sitting on that left or can people

266
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:13.154
getting hurt.

267
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.090
So now for the first time you got a guy who's got submissions and he's hitting

268
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:18.620
with genuine power.

269
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.620
As he came back, there was a question of who's going to be the opponent.

270
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.440
And the next thing I say is, well, you knew it went up a weight division,

271
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.540
go up to 85.

272
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.880
<v 1>Now was any consideration about going up to 85 because of the fact that Bisping</v>

273
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:42.714
was the champion.

274
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.940
<v 3>No, George has trained with bispecific. The decision.</v>

275
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.910
<v 2>Was made before Bisman was the champion. Really? Yeah.</v>

276
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.670
<v 1>How far in advance was the decision made?</v>

277
00:15:50.671 --> 00:15:54.510
Because Bisping a defendant against Henderson one against four.

278
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.580
<v 2>Year project. Okay.</v>

279
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.770
<v 3>So during initially, initially.</v>

280
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.560
<v 2>I couldn't make that decision because another student of mine,</v>

281
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.370
Chris Weidman was a 180 5 pound champion and Chris and Jordan never fight each

282
00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:09.360
other. But once that was no longer an issue, then it was like, Hey, this,

283
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.370
this could work. This could be.

284
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.120
<v 1>So D during the entire four years, he was talking about eventually coming.</v>

285
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.270
<v 2>Tired four years now. Okay.</v>

286
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.210
But he was training the whole time and I was pushing him.

287
00:16:21.211 --> 00:16:24.690
I kid you not fighting anymore. Let's do some submission grappling. Right. Okay.

288
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.250
Um, he stuck with Freddie Roach. He, he loves working with Freddie Roach. And,

289
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.480
um, uh, so the training was, was going in.

290
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.370
<v 3>Different directions. It was this more time coach.</v>

291
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.100
<v 2>Um, mostly he works for us a hobby and try now, but that's more, uh,</v>

292
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.930
integrated for us as a black bottle mine. So he, um, often, uh,

293
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.340
does jujitsu was for us where I teach for us and frost that does a good job

294
00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:54.870
there. Um, but for us, uh, ties things together. That's his principle.

295
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.880
And I know he trained with Phil nurse for a while as well. Yeah. Um,

296
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.630
then he trained with a lot of guys who came out of, uh, uh,

297
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.940
Thailand itself from Tiga, Moya, Thai. Um, uh, yod,

298
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.960
that's a shortening of his actual name. They all have very long names, but, uh,

299
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.400
yod was one of his trainers. They trained him prior to conduit and Diaz,

300
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.220
um, uh, did a fine job.

301
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:24.200
So there's never been a shortage of coaches in his life, but, uh,

302
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.900
there are certain things that seem to gel with them more than others.

303
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.450
Interestingly, during that four year period,

304
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.490
George had a strong rebirth into karate and worked with a lot of

305
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.850
specialized karate people, including Raymond Daniels and others. Uh,

306
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.360
they came from the, mostly from the European point, fighting karate, uh,

307
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:46.310
circuit. And he was working with them a lot and so somewhere,

308
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.450
or they crossed a certain poor period time where you're dealing with

309
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.590
a different athlete.

310
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.380
Now this is a guy who's had four years off and the training had gone in

311
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:56.250
different directions.

312
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.500
It's finishing skills in both fisticuffs and grant Blaine had gotten

313
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.910
considerably better. Um, he was, uh,

314
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.050
toying with the idea of going up to 85 and experimenting with diet, et cetera,

315
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:12.750
to get his body weight up. It's never an easy thing to do.

316
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.390
And tactically,

317
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.800
it was working more on the idea of being an exciting fighter through movement

318
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.030
and pushing harder for the finish. And, uh,

319
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.930
and I thought those were three very, very healthy directions to go. And,

320
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.880
and, um, uh, this would, is it worth if he did come back,

321
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:36.750
this would be offer a genuine opportunity to address the three most persistent

322
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:41.250
criticism of his career. Initially, there was a lot of resistance from the UFC.

323
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:42.780
I don't think they were fond of the idea at all.

324
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:46.650
They wanted him to go to one 70 and, and do what he had done. And, uh,

325
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.030
but George pushed hard for the, uh, for the fighter 85.

326
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.050
And ultimately it happened in a rather strange way. Tyrone Woodley had, uh,

327
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.150
a fight at one 70, which, um, uh,

328
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.860
wasn't the most crowd-pleasing fight. And, uh, uh,

329
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.690
George St. Pierre was supposed to fight Tyrone Woodley and then USA,

330
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.820
you know what, five Brisbane it's on. So they,

331
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.710
we chose the Madison square garden.

332
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.920
That's one of the great fight capitals of the world. And, uh,

333
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.590
that's how it happened. So was.

334
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.880
<v 1>Consideration and fighting one 70. Yes. And so this was the UFC's idea,</v>

335
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.350
but what about your plan? Yeah.

336
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.390
<v 2>For, I, I, I thought, first of all, I'm, I'm not the matchmaker.</v>

337
00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:33.320
I'm not the main policymaker. I'm the, I don't want to say that I was the guy.

338
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.420
I was the guy that suggested those ideas.

339
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.900
And George seems to like the idea that you said, if I'm going to come back,

340
00:19:38.901 --> 00:19:41.150
if I'm going to take the risk about four year layoff and come back,

341
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:42.740
it's a big risk. Yeah. I mean,

342
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.220
Mohammad Ali came back after three years and had two warm-up fights and still

343
00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:47.780
lost his title. It's fine. Yeah.

344
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.440
<v 1>But Muhammad Ali really wasn't working out. That was,</v>

345
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.630
that was when the Vietnam war thing had happened.

346
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.060
<v 2>But he was mostly doing tours of college campuses and it, yeah,</v>

347
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.970
it wasn't really working out the whole time and improving. You.

348
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.940
<v 1>Could see the difference in Mohammad Ali's body when he came back, but still.</v>

349
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.940
<v 2>There's many other examples, like sugar Ray Leonard came back off to layoffs.</v>

350
00:20:04.941 --> 00:20:08.330
He had one successful and one very unsuccessful come back and he was working

351
00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:12.110
hard the whole time. So coming back, it's a hard, it's a tricky,

352
00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:16.160
tricky thing on many levels too, not just physical, but also cycle. Yeah. So.

353
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.980
<v 1>Now this colitis thing is thrown a monkey wrench into the gears.</v>

354
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.610
<v 2>Actually it threw a monkey wrench during the camp. Really? Yeah.</v>

355
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.870
I could tell you some stories about that. That camp was, uh, as,

356
00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:31.100
as good as the four years was the camp itself. I can say now,

357
00:20:31.101 --> 00:20:33.290
because it's over was a disaster.

358
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.750
This is probably the worst camp I've ever been involved in. Um,

359
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.120
I was coaching of course, the squad for ADCC. So, uh, ADCC,

360
00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:46.100
I believe was, uh, around six weeks, uh, before George's fight.

361
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.550
So was in Finland and communicating with George and he's like feeling good.

362
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:53.340
Let's get the moment I get back. Obviously,

363
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.620
we're going on a plane from Finland to Montreal and start the camp,

364
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.280
uh, is at Mount, uh, I've got stomach issues. And, um, I was like,

365
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.240
what do you mean stomach issues? What does that even mean now? Um,

366
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.570
uh, about two weeks into the camp,

367
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.010
the issues got so bad that George literally could not.

368
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.430
Now this is a six week fight camp. It's a very short camp back in the day.

369
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:19.690
We used to do eight to 12 weeks,

370
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.750
but George thought a shorter camp would be better as a getting older.

371
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.070
He wanted a shorter camp. First two weeks were okayed, but I was in,

372
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.400
uh, the aftermath of the Finland expedition. And, um, uh,

373
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:37.600
when I first went up, George said, I gotta cancel. Okay. I,

374
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.430
I can't train. I'm like fine. It's four weeks away.

375
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.940
And Georgia two weeks off,

376
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.400
it was a critical moment on a Friday evening where I said to Foracia hobby.

377
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.590
This is the second time I've had to say this to, for us.

378
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.280
I'll be the other was the college conduct camp. I said, George,

379
00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.520
isn't training by Monday, we're going to pull the plug. There's no other way.

380
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.130
And we were talking about a four year layoff and this camp is lost.

381
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.330
It's dead in the water. So four weeks out, he takes two weeks off. Uh,

382
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.370
I believe it might've been five I'll check the dates later, but very close.

383
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.040
It was, it was a critical two week period. Where during that two weeks,

384
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:22.720
what is he able to do? Essentially? Nothing. Nothing. Yeah, just no train,

385
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:27.070
light drilling some movement. And, uh, he, he was, it,

386
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.320
it occurred at the worst possible time.

387
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:32.620
It wasn't at the start of the campus in the middle of the camp so that the first

388
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:36.310
two weeks were lost because then, uh,

389
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.130
we had two weeks of inactivity, then there's two weeks left.

390
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.660
And I remember the first time I went up, I bought Jake shields,

391
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:45.160
Gary toner and Gordon Ryan with me.

392
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:49.060
We came up and we went through some drills on the ground and I was happy.

393
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.120
You know, Joseph's okay on the ground. He did fine against the squad guys. And,

394
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.450
um, uh, we worked on some specialized grappling stuff.

395
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:57.640
And then the next day he went to do a shoot box workout.

396
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.980
Now I could sit here all day until you adventures

397
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:05.320
of George St. Pierre doing shoe box training with people.

398
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:09.310
I've seen him spot everybody again, I'm not gonna mention names,

399
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.560
but I've seen George St. Pierre take down. If it loosely

400
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.230
some of the biggest names in mixed martial arts in weight divisions,

401
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:25.180
far away of his own. So many times per round,

402
00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:28.690
you just lose count. I got, I, I I'm,

403
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.560
I'm afraid to even tell you the stories cause people wouldn't believe me. Um,

404
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.900
I'm used to seeing George St. Pierre shoot boxing bap bang down. Right? Okay.

405
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.660
Um, I've seen that since the side of his career, I watched your St.

406
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:47.090
Pier do a shoe-box workout where he couldn't score a take down.

407
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.490
This is a fights two weeks away. I'm just looking, going like, holy heck,

408
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.350
what is this? He's getting hit. He's getting frustrated. He's getting tired.

409
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.000
And I said to, for us, you know, this is, this is a crisis.

410
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.890
This is one of the biggest UFC's of the year it's Madison square garden.

411
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.760
He's the headline.

412
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.920
The UFC had to pull some big things to get this fight to happen.

413
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:15.050
They didn't originally didn't want it. If we pull out, now,

414
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:17.420
it's going to look like a disaster. It's going to wait. George,

415
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.360
let the UFC down. Um,

416
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.800
and to his everlasting credit, George said,

417
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:28.580
I'll be back on Monday and I'll be better. We went up and,

418
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.700
uh, he, he is, he dug in deep. What can I tell you? He's a trooper.

419
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.180
He, um, he trained every day, those last two weeks. And

420
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.380
as each day went by, there was significant improvement.

421
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:44.120
And I remember there was a distinct moment.

422
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:47.360
About five days before the end of the camp, I saw him do a shoe box workout.

423
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.740
And he looked like the old George and I was okay. I believe in this kit again,

424
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.170
you can do it. Jamie.

425
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.100
<v 1>Will you please Google colitis? I don't know enough.</v>

426
00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.860
I believe you should. Google ulcerative.

427
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.203
<v 2>Colitis.</v>

428
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.610
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know. It's so it's something to do with stomach ulcers.</v>

429
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.940
<v 2>Um, I'm not going to claim to be an expert, but, uh, yeah,</v>

430
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.760
I can tell you what the symptoms were,

431
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.910
was extreme stomach pain and inability to eat. It screwed up his entire diet.

432
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.320
And when did it start? Uh,

433
00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:21.280
it started early in the camp and got progressively worse. And then for the camp,

434
00:25:21.281 --> 00:25:23.530
there was no issues. Uh, here.

435
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.710
<v 1>Ulcerative colitis is usually only, uh,</v>

436
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.320
in innermost lining of the large intestine,

437
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:34.060
colon and rectum forms range from mild to severe having ulcerative colitis puts

438
00:25:34.061 --> 00:25:37.480
a patient at increased risk of developing colon cancer symptoms,

439
00:25:37.481 --> 00:25:41.230
including rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and pain.

440
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.000
It sounds like, yeah.

441
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.600
<v 2>If you read the, can you bring it back? Yep. Read the first four. Yeah.</v>

442
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.380
<v 1>Treatment can help, but this condition cannot be cured.</v>

443
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.430
Requires a medical diagnosis, lab tests, or imaging always required.

444
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.330
Chronic can last for years or be lifelong.

445
00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.750
<v 2>It's incredibly frustrating for them to deal with. And it says treatments.</v>

446
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.760
<v 1>Include medications and surgery.</v>

447
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.950
<v 2>Yeah. So it's a three, but,</v>

448
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:09.850
uh,

449
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.480
it appeared to back off a little bit in the last two weeks he came back and he,

450
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.990
um, this is the kind of person George St.

451
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:20.740
Pierre is the morning of the fight. Saturday morning.

452
00:26:20.741 --> 00:26:25.030
We're in New York city in the hotel room, uh, for us hobbies,

453
00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:27.850
Freddie Roach and myself are at the breakfast table.

454
00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:29.950
George comes down for breakfast and he's weighed in.

455
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:37.300
He looks at his breakfast is originally the

456
00:26:37.301 --> 00:26:41.350
plan because it was a fight at 180 5 was to have George come in at a,

457
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:42.460
at a higher body weight.

458
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.800
But he ended up weighing 191 pounds,

459
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:50.340
which is exactly the same as he used to fight at welterweight the same body

460
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:54.540
weight. So that was kind of a disappointment, you know? Um,

461
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.760
and, uh, he quietly excused himself and went to the bathroom.

462
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.860
Everyone else went away to do their things.

463
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.790
And I sat there and I realized he's in the bathroom for an hour.

464
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.320
He came out, I was like, George, you okay. And he looked at me, he said,

465
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:14.970
I'm fine. But I knew he wasn't. And then he went out for it.

466
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.740
Um,

467
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:21.450
and then afterwards he told me I was in so much pain and he was afraid to tell

468
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:24.960
me because he would worry that if I cornered him and I thought he was

469
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:25.561
compromised,

470
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:29.040
I wouldn't corner him the way I normally would that I would doubt him.

471
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:34.380
So he kept it all inside. Didn't say a word. And, uh, he's a good kid. You know,

472
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.030
he got help at a market like that. Wow. Well.

473
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.820
<v 1>That's what makes him a champion. Yeah. It's one of the things it's,</v>

474
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.540
it's less than perfect conditions. He could still rise to the occasion.

475
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.930
<v 2>Less than perfect. It was a very far from perfect. Now.</v>

476
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.960
<v 1>You said that during the Johnny Hendricks fight, uh,</v>

477
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.540
during the camp for that fight, when, uh,

478
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.990
he decided to impromptu retire inside the octagon. Yeah.

479
00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.400
That there was talk during the camp that he didn't want to fight. Yeah.

480
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.473
What was that about?

481
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.540
<v 2>Really centered around two things. One I can just,</v>

482
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.370
I can not discuss because it involves a personal life. Joe St.

483
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:15.350
PA there was some things going on in his personal life that, um, uh,

484
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.940
deeply affected him.

485
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.680
And he was deeply unhappy with some circumstances in his personal life. And, um,

486
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.380
it's not appropriate for me to talk about those. Um,

487
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:29.150
and the second was the whole idea that it become an obsession with George at

488
00:28:29.151 --> 00:28:33.290
that time, which was the use of anabolic steroids in mixed martial arts.

489
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:34.940
And, um,

490
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:40.460
he was deeply unhappy with what he perceived as the prevalence of the use of

491
00:28:40.461 --> 00:28:44.510
anabolic steroids in mixed martial arts as a whole and among his

492
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:49.100
opponents in particular. And, um, uh,

493
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.000
he wanted a testing program to be bought in for that fight.

494
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.240
There was talk about it, but nothing came of it. And, uh,

495
00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:01.460
it became like this psychological obsession during the camp and,

496
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.890
uh, uh, between those two issues, uh, there was a lot of unhappiness.

497
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.490
He, he came in, he did it strain, you know, he's, he's a professional athlete.

498
00:29:10.491 --> 00:29:12.110
It's not like he missed workouts or anything crazy.

499
00:29:12.111 --> 00:29:14.090
Like there wasn't a going out at night or anything foolish,

500
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:19.550
but there was a degree of unhappiness where I'm looking and

501
00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:21.680
thinking, how much longer can this go on?

502
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.193
<v 1>Now,</v>

503
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:29.750
there was some talk about the Tyron Woodley fight and

504
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.790
then Tyron had this bad performance.

505
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:35.240
But if George did get healthy

506
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.910
and was confident enough in his health that he could get through,

507
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.340
get through an actual training camp,

508
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.550
would he be interested in considering a fight with Tyron Woodley?

509
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.760
<v 2>Absolutely. I think Tyron Woodley is a great champion.</v>

510
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.120
I know he gets a lot of stick. A lot of flag. That kid is talented,

511
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.440
very talented, very good.

512
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.070
<v 1>He doesn't think George wants to fight him. He was on the podcast the other day.</v>

513
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.630
<v 2>Yeah. I, I think, uh,</v>

514
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.620
people say that for reasons so that they can motivate someone to find them,

515
00:30:01.621 --> 00:30:04.260
et cetera, et cetera. There's a political aspect to it.

516
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.480
I think they're both athletes have a deep respect for each other.

517
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:14.160
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
