00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 1>Experience, but it pays a little bit more of a price.</v>

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.440
I think every time you do it towards the end,

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.160
this is the thought about Tony and the gaci fight that look, I was saying,

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.080
it' pretty gangster. They decided to make weight anyway. But then people that,

6
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.640
you know, like Dana said this, a couple other people said this, like,

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.920
why would you do that? Doesn't make sense when you know,

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.150
you're gonna have to make that.

9
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.983
<v 2>Again. I mean, I talked to,</v>

10
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.950
I talked to Tony yesterday and he said it has had nothing to do with the weight.

11
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.710
I'm sure his loss had nothing to do with the weight. I'm sure.

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.870
<v 1>He, you know, look, he fought well. Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.870
but he had to have felt something from draining his body

14
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.190
just a couple weeks ago. It, we know it didn't we know it didn't.

15
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.500
<v 0>I don't mean to interrupt you. We know it didn't help him. Right, right, right.</v>

16
00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:43.100
We know that. Exactly. We know it didn't help.

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.860
<v 2>Him. Justin just fought a, an awesome fight, man. That's.</v>

18
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.180
<v 1>True too. That's fair. That's true too.</v>

19
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.100
Cuz this is the thing's like Tony took an inhuman amount of punishment, but his,

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.500
his cardio is so much better than everyone else's.

21
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.620
Even when he is getting robbed to a ridiculous extent, you, everyone knows like,

22
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:01.460
you know, better than anybody.

23
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.890
How hard it is to breathe when you're getting hurt.

24
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.330
If you're getting hurt and you're stunned,

25
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:09.450
that's when your cardio goes out the window through the.

26
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.970
<v 0>People. When you get, when you get clipped it,</v>

27
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:15.130
that drain energy more than anything, your cardio goes through the window. His,

28
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:16.570
his cardio never went away. He was fine.

29
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.650
<v 2>He's already training. He was training today. He was dancing in.</v>

30
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.490
<v 1>The dancing in the emergency room. No.</v>

31
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.440
<v 2>He is ready to go back. He's taken this loss. Like it gave me the chills,</v>

32
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:29.640
listening to him talk last night. Yeah. Like we were talking. I'm like he,

33
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.200
his championship only that's in his losses too.

34
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.360
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cause he's like, listen, he goes, everybody out,

35
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:40.040
everybody in the world is, uh, is suffering financially.

36
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.710
And I got to go in there and make a whole bunch of money and my family secure.

37
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:47.870
So wow. I lost technically. Wow. But I won in life. Yeah. That' true.

38
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.750
I'm winning. So I'm just ready to go back and do it again. Hey Eddie, Ken,

39
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:53.350
like he seriously feels great. That's.

40
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.110
<v 0>Can I ask you this without you getting upset at me when I was watching it and I</v>

41
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:58.150
don't know Tony, like you do,

42
00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.230
and obviously you you're one of the greatest justsu coaches all the time.

43
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.580
But when I was watching it in the fourth or definitely in the fifth,

44
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.740
I would've thrown in the towel.

45
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.460
<v 2>That crossed my mind, but I would've never done it, but I, I thought, man,</v>

46
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.820
it was, it was uh, cause I know you listen, listen, I know you listen, listen,

47
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.900
I have question never. I have never been a head MMA coach ever in my life.

48
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.660
Never wanted to be, never wanted to be. And I never, even to this day,

49
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:25.690
I've never been. That's not me. I 'm not Trevor Whitman. That guy's amazing.

50
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.610
I'm not uh, Greg Jackson, duke Rufus.

51
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.570
That's a that's that's a whole nother level head coach.

52
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.370
That's the guy that should be talking to the fighter. That's sitting down.

53
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.650
I never I'm. I'm the wide receiver coach.

54
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.690
I'm the guy that just throws in on the side. Like, you know,

55
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.450
especially in a standup, in a standup fight.

56
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.010
I shouldn't have been micd cuz I knew this was gonna be a stand up fight.

57
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.800
If the fight was gonna go to the ground. If it was a cabib fight. Yeah.

58
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.040
Maybe there's gonna be a lot of groundwork. Yeah. Maybe it makes sense. Uh,

59
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.400
for television to mic me. But whenever mikeing me up, I'm like,

60
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.000
I I'm just there for emotional support. Cause it's gonna be a standup war. Yeah.

61
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.240
Tony never. He hasn't had to take down in five years.

62
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.800
He never takes anybody down. The last take down he got was Gleas and Deba.

63
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.600
Think about that. He doesn't take,

64
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.600
he goes out there and you know what he does when a fight,

65
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.960
when the fight ends up on the ground, it's like from a scramble,

66
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.280
someone took him down, Kevin Lee takes him down.

67
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.560
That's where his jutatistic comes in. We knew it was gonna,

68
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.800
we were preparing for Kaib this whole time,

69
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.350
which he was gonna try to stay on his obviously and, and, and do this thing.

70
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.430
And all of a sudden, two weeks before the fight, when it was April 18th, uh,

71
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.390
we get the opposite of could be such a dangerous and not only the opposite in,

72
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.390
in strategy, but the opposite and probably the heaviest handed, lightweight,

73
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.790
maybe ever the most dangerous matchup for Tony, the most dangerous eat lights,

74
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:43.220
be people up with one shot. Yeah. So not even for one second,

75
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.700
did the camp thing. Oh, we got this one in the bag from day one from day one.

76
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.260
So hold on, how finish this? Please. Let me finish this real quick.

77
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.620
Let me get this off my chest. Um,

78
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.700
so the whole time we're we're training for a certain strategy.

79
00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:59.220
Now we got two weeks now, now it's Justin Gay with the smart thing. Uh,

80
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.050
the B to do a totally changed Tony's style or say, it.

81
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.010
Let's let's try to outbox this guy. Do Tony, Tony wanted to strike.

82
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.850
Tony was like, I'm gonna go out there. And, and I'll outbox him.

83
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.170
That was the plan. Uh, nobody said a hundred percent. It was gonna work.

84
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.530
You know what I mean? So, um, and it was weird. It was everything about that.

85
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.120
That,

86
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.120
that whole fight was weird when &lt;affirmative&gt; you get there and there's nobody

87
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.760
in the, in the arena and it's super quiet.

88
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.240
I've been to about 150 UFCs I've cornered a bunch of fighters in the UFC.

89
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.360
It was the weirdest thing. And the, and the, the,

90
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.560
one of the weirdest things was, um, in between the first round and second round,

91
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.720
uh, they only allowed one coaching, right? Yes. And they said,

92
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:43.350
who's it gonna be? I was the first one to say, not me. Like,

93
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.150
I don't wanna be the, I'm not the MMA head coach.

94
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.670
It's gotta be the striking coach that goes in there. Everybody agreed for sure.

95
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.470
I'm like, I'm not gonna be, it's always gotta be the striking coach,

96
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.230
the head coach, the guy that talks to him.

97
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.910
I'm just the guy that offers suggestions. I've never been,

98
00:04:55.911 --> 00:05:00.750
never wanted to be never tried to be. So, um, uh, Billy or Rashad.

99
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.620
Those are those Rasha is his Holloway. Yeah.

100
00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:06.980
Rashat Holloways his boxing coach and Billy is his mu Thai coach.

101
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.700
So one of them went in I'm on the outside. I had nothing to say.

102
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.700
All I could say was Tony, you're looking good.

103
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:14.140
That's it did E you know what I mean? Did,

104
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:17.420
did either of them consider throwing the towel? No, we didn't talk about it.

105
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.660
I just had it in my head. I didn't talk about it, but this what happened.

106
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.850
So then the second, and then, um,

107
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.370
the first round in my eyes at the, at the event, I thought, okay,

108
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:29.570
that could have went either way. Okay. Second round at the very end,

109
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:34.050
with two seconds left. He, he clips Justin. So after two rounds, I'm thinking,

110
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.930
okay, now it's gonna start to turn around. So at that point,

111
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:40.290
after the second round, he knocked him down. If he would at 30 seconds,

112
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.640
who knows where, what the, what would, who knows? But then at that point,

113
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:46.640
now it's the third round. We're like, okay, man, maybe he's gonna,

114
00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:49.720
Tony's gonna turn it around. Like he always does. So at that point it was,

115
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.240
we weren't like thinking, okay, we gotta take him down or anything like that.

116
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.760
But after that fourth round, it was, it was looking like, oh.

117
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.600
And right when the bell rung, after the fourth round,

118
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.120
Rasha turns around and goes, Eddie, get in there. And I'm like,

119
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.760
I wasn't ready for it, man. Oh, I wasn't ready to walk in there.

120
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.280
So I walked in there going, what the am I? I'm not a MMA head coach.

121
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.120
This is the fourth round. He's hurt. And plus dude,

122
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.760
my car got broken into last week. They stole my glasses. I always,

123
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.230
I need my asses. I'm I'm pretty blind with your glasses. So I didn't really,

124
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.670
I didn't realize how, how cut up he was until I walked up to him like, okay,

125
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.070
I'm supposed to give him advice. This wide receiver coach, like I'm the raw,

126
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.310
like, I, it was a mistake for me to go in there. Not a bad idea for you to go.

127
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:33.910
It was a mistake. Draw the half guard. So I was like, at this point at the,

128
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.860
I thought maybe that's pulling guard or doing some mmineary roles works

129
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.620
in the beginning when it's fresh. Like the way Ryan Hall got BJ. Penn. Yes.

130
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.140
Remember Ryan Hall. Bjpen yeah, it was early. Yeah. He went for emmineary role.

131
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.580
He was fresh. He leglocked him. If, if we're gonna do something like that,

132
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:54.060
we have to strategize for that. The whole camp, not just like, Hey, so I'm,

133
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.420
I'm in there going at this point. He's hurt. He's cut up.

134
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.570
Lot of things are swirling through my head and I'm thinking, oh my God,

135
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.850
what the hell? What is the best advice here? It's like, what is this qu,

136
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.450
I need help here. I froze. And it's so quiet. It's so quiet. You know,

137
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.490
you there's no energy. Well, usually you're like, dude,

138
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.570
you gotta take this down, you know? But it's so quiet. It's so quiet.

139
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.120
Everyone's like, you know, you're talking low. It was just so weird.

140
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.400
You're almost self-conscious.

141
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.920
<v 1>Yeah. Brian co just walked in the room. Brian co just please let him finish.</v>

142
00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:27.960
Cause he is in the middle of describing him'm so into.

143
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.880
<v 2>It. The corner, Tony Ferguson. I'm almost done. I'm almost done. No. Keep going,</v>

144
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.840
keep going. So I, I walk in,

145
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.880
the first thing I notice is he's cut up more than I can see from the corner.

146
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.030
From my point, I couldn't tell he had a big cut under his right eye.

147
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.790
And at that point, that's my brother, man. That's my brother. I'm thinking like,

148
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.230
like maybe the best thing to do is stay on the outside for the fifth round and

149
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:54.390
just get through this with no more damage.

150
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.590
I was thinking maybe cuz if he tries to shoot now and he's really tired and he's

151
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.500
he's it could be, he could catch a knee coming in. I'm thinking what,

152
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.900
what kind of advice? And then I just said, you might want to try an iari,

153
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.380
but I don't know. I don't know. I froze. I didn't,

154
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.380
I don't think you froze cause that's not bad advice.

155
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.540
Everything else wasn't working.

156
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:15.980
I I've never been in that situation ever before in my life.

157
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.700
And I don't wanna be, I'm not the guy for that. I don't, think'm the, I froze.

158
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.210
I'm not the guy after that. I shouldn't have been in there.

159
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.930
I'm always on the side when I'm in the corner, I'm always on the side.

160
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.450
You know what I mean? Just to I'll throw a little, little, uh,

161
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:30.530
emotional support. I'm not going to the most important thing for a fighter.

162
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.570
I've been in this business, getting paid in the MMA business since 2000,

163
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.570
I've seen fighters come and go. I work for the UFC for eight years.

164
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.760
Been to about 150 UFCs. I've seen everybody come and go. I know my raw.

165
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.760
I'm not I' yourself enough. Credit'm not, I'm not duke Rufus.

166
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.160
You're not giving yourself enough credit. Those guys they're on another level.

167
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.880
I am just, Hey, if he takes you down, get that over hook and hit that triangle.

168
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.360
But this is me, that it, but.

169
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.960
<v 1>You're a fantastic jujitsu coach.</v>

170
00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.280
<v 0>But I think you're also smart enough to know where your strengths lie and it's</v>

171
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.080
in the jujitsu. That's a good thing, man. That's a healthy thing.

172
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.280
But you sh you sh for sure have an understanding of how to coach someone in MMA.

173
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.720
The thing is there's like levels, right? There's like for us a hobby,

174
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.750
Matt Hume level, the wizards of tech geek. Andstrategy that's not me. Yeah.

175
00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:17.584
Those are different guys.

176
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.950
But those guys aren't Eddie when it comes to jujijitsu.

177
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.550
<v 1>No, they're not. They're not. No, the, but yeah,</v>

178
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:23.390
but that's the point it's like to be.

179
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.550
And both of them are very talented on the ground. By the way,

180
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.550
Matt Hume was a wizard. Amazing.

181
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.510
<v 0>Amazing was.</v>

182
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.070
<v 2>When the Madhu was also a legit striker. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; very,</v>

183
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.230
very much true. I worse than her than, you know, when Matt.

184
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.540
<v 1>Hum was on, on top of his game. Oh, he was amazing.</v>

185
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.140
He was an incredible fighter. He was way ahead of his time. Amazing.

186
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.660
<v 0>But, but if I want, if it went to the ground and he had straight technical hail,</v>

187
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:44.780
Mary trying to finish the guy, Eddie would be my guy of.

188
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.620
<v 1>Of course. Yes, of course I not giving yourself no credit.</v>

189
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.980
But thing is the thing about both those guys that we just,

190
00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:51.340
they know the whole game. They know the whole game for us. Us is very good.

191
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.220
Atstriking the best. Very.

192
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.890
<v 2>The, not, I don't know if you guys remember, uh, last year at PFL um,</v>

193
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.250
the first round fighters fight twice in the same night. Oh yeah. Remember that?

194
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:01.830
That's right. Yes.

195
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.570
And Vinny magolia pulled guard in both of his fights early in the fight

196
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.490
and tapped the guys out real quick. Real of course. Right? Yeah. Real quick,

197
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.410
real quick. It goes guard. But, but you set it up and you work on it. Yes.

198
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:17.600
You know, we Tony's a Rikker man. He wants to take your head off.

199
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.160
You know what I mean? Yes' such beast. So, so,

200
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.920
and then what happened in Vinny's fight? In the final of the tournament,

201
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.800
he got really tired. You know, he was really tired at the end.

202
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:28.040
He was trying to pull guard at the end,

203
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.720
but he didn't have the energy to pull guard. You know what I'm saying?

204
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:33.560
He takes a lot, the finals, he gotta set it up. It's like a takedown. He had,

205
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:33.760
he.

206
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.750
<v 1>Set it up. Had he fought earlier that night in the finals &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

207
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.110
<v 2>No, no, no. He, it it't like the, the, the finals were like months later. Oh.</v>

208
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.430
And.

209
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.263
<v 0>It was only one fight.</v>

210
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.310
<v 1>He got tired in that fight. Mm-hmm.</v>

211
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.910
<v 2>&lt;Affirmative&gt; in that fight. And he was trying to pull guard.</v>

212
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:49.830
He couldn't strike the guy. He was tired and there was no,

213
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:51.470
he was trying to pull guard, but he wasn't even close.

214
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:55.310
He'd like land on his butt with no clench. And uh, I forget who we fights,

215
00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:58.540
but he would just walk away. Look at, he's got his back. This is it. His back.

216
00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:01.860
This is it. This is it. Oh man. 20 seconds.

217
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.660
<v 0>Uh Tony's story's not over. There's so many good mans. No, no.</v>

218
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.100
And one win one win. He's right there. Well, how about that?

219
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.260
<v 1>You have to take into consideration the fact that he didn't really get a full</v>

220
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:16.860
chance to game plan for a guy's dangerous as Justin and prepare for him. Yeah.

221
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.580
<v 2>There's gonna be a reason.</v>

222
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.650
Eventually they'll be a rematch it and the training camp's gonna be different.

223
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.890
But, but here's the one thing we,

224
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.330
we could look back at this as a blessing in disguise in one way,

225
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.650
because originally Tony and Connor was the fight,

226
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.970
but then Connor loses toabib and then now it's Tony and con and cabib was the

227
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:37.370
fight. Now, since they're both coming off losses right now,

228
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.000
Tony Kaib makes the most sense right now. Can you imagine that?

229
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:42.973
You mean Tony and.

230
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.920
<v 1>Connor? Oh yeah, yeah, no. Connor's coming off. Win too.</v>

231
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.480
Thoughm I know Tony and.

232
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.200
<v 0>Connor. I'm sorry. No, Connor's coming off a win cowboy.</v>

233
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.080
<v 2>Oh, that's right. That's right. That's okay. Okay. But still,</v>

234
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.240
it still makes sense because.

235
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.440
<v 1>Makes sense. He did lose it. It makes sense. Cuz it's hard to pitch a,</v>

236
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.920
a con cabib fight right now. It's like, it's hard to pitch that. No,

237
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:04.480
gaci's right there. Gay's right there.

238
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.280
But depending what cabib wants to do in his dad and bad health,

239
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.360
if he's out for a little longer, then he can do GAE Connor. That's true.

240
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.430
How about, how about gay cabib and Tony Connor. Same car.

241
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.510
Oh my God. Super bold. Oh my God. People sleep people. That's perfect.

242
00:12:20.511 --> 00:12:23.830
That's that's amazing. Come on. How crazy that like new year's Eve or something,

243
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:26.950
you know what, but you're alsogetting cabibconnor ridiculous. Oh my God.

244
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.470
That would be the greatest to it right now.

245
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.750
And then the winners about fighting the winner of each fighting, an amazing car.

246
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.460
Tony, Tony versus tournament.

247
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.020
And gaci versus cabibbe on this everybody's head explode worldwide,

248
00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:41.700
worldwide simultaneously. There's some,

249
00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:44.340
there's some other dark courses for Tony that like, uh, uh,

250
00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:46.660
Dustin poiers right there. Charles William. Yeah.

251
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:51.180
Charles Loro impresses me as much as anybody me do do

252
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.410
when he strike Kevin Lee, I was like, this is crazy.

253
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.970
This striking's gotten so much better. Downment staying on the outside.
