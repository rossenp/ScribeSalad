WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. It's just, to me,</v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.220
it seems like if you pay attention to the track,

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
if you track technology, like where it's going, things constantly improve. They,

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.510
we, we demand constant innovation and we're already wearing these things

5
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:19.680
on our body and watches.

6
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.730
Now a lot of people were in the apple watches and the Samsung and all the Google

7
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.060
watches. And it just seems inevitable that it somehow,

8
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.860
or another advances to a point where there's a chip or something you wear,

9
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.670
or some plate that they put on the back of your head and screw in.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.190
<v 1>Yeah. But then you watch like black mirror and.</v>

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.200
<v 0>It, I know that is.</v>

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.550
<v 1>The problem. Well, then that'd be good.</v>

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.100
<v 0>I mean, but do you have a sense of history that you are,</v>

14
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.941
first of all,

15
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.230
you're amongst one of the rare human beings that has ever been in space and then

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.510
two you're working for a company that is at the very tip

17
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.210
of the spear of innovation. Like the,

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.860
you are at the front of the line in terms of creating

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.390
viable methods of sending people into space and returning them.

20
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.150
<v 1>I, I feel extremely fortunate, you know,</v>

21
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.220
that to have that experience I had at NASA, um, and had the visceral experience,

22
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:21.600
the incredible experience of, of flying in space, uh, doing spacewalks,

23
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.060
operating robot, arms, launching on rockets and all that.

24
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.220
And then coming to space X and being there, uh, at, in,

25
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:31.440
in the relatively early days and, and being there for seven years, um,

26
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.450
I feel like, uh, you know, I feel pretty satisfied that I can get to see,

27
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:41.250
I got incredibly lucky to see these things and be in a room where it happens,

28
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.390
you know? Uh, it's, it's pretty remarkable now. Uh,

29
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.860
so now I'm, I'm, uh, now I'm still a consultant at space X, but I'm a, uh,

30
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.570
full-time professor at USC.

31
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.140
So now I'm teaching and I'm also working on TV shows.

32
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.680
So now I'm like taking those incredible experiences.

33
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.970
I had opened up a lot of other doors and like I ended up was like, for example,

34
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
work, working on this TV show. I find myself like in a,

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.450
in a writer's room with a whole bunch of really talented creative people.

36
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.150
When does knowing a million years I would,

37
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.480
this would ever happen to me if it weren't for these incredible experiences,

38
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:18.600
I was lucky enough to have, you know, it's like, that gets even,

39
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.830
that gets really surreal.

40
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.040
<v 0>I could only imagine. I mean, I can only imagine, I mean,</v>

41
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.260
especially coming from your childhood,

42
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.300
having that image on your wall and now really being a part of this massive

43
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:35.040
change in the way human beings are going to be able to travel in space. Yeah.

44
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.140
And what is, tell us about this TV show,

45
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.050
cause you were talking to me about it off air before we started. Yeah.

46
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.550
<v 1>So this, this is a, for all mankind it's on apple TV and um,</v>

47
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.550
the, the way I got involved with this thing, uh,

48
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.610
I was a big fan of bow saw Galactica the too. Yeah.

49
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
<v 0>The reboot was awesome. Wasn't it? Oh, that's oh, so underrated. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.370
One of the best science fiction shows.

51
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.800
<v 1>Ever. Yeah. I mean, it was like in the early days of kind of like peak, I guess.</v>

52
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.650
And it was like, um, it was just so good. I mean,

53
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.220
the writing was so good and the whole concept and everything. Yeah. All the,

54
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.320
all the things that we're exploring in, uh,

55
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.740
science fiction is always as best when it's like an allegory and the way they

56
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:16.330
explored things that were happening in society like terrorism and stuff. Uh,

57
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:21.130
the way they were able to depict it. As in aside in an alternate universe,

58
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.350
I thought it was spectacular.

59
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.820
<v 0>Brilliant, brilliant.</v>

60
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.710
<v 1>Show. So I'm watching it on the space station,</v>

61
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.860
which is like the best place to watch that. That's crazy.

62
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.700
<v 0>Do you use an iPad or something like,</v>

63
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.130
how do you have things stored or is there a TV up there?

64
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.450
<v 1>There's, there's no TV, but there's,</v>

65
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.510
we have all these laptops so they could send us files and you can,

66
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.940
you can give them like four shows that you, like.

67
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.550
<v 0>How long does it take for a show to download in space?</v>

68
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.640
<v 1>Whether they download it for you, which is nice while you're,</v>

69
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.690
while you're working. And then when you're,

70
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.340
when you're ready to watch you just pop up.

71
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.030
<v 0>So is it like a satellite can connection, internet, satellite?</v>

72
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.400
<v 1>Uh, it's, it's kinda, it's a,</v>

73
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:02.230
it's a KU band system that goes to satellites that aren't part of NASA

74
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.640
satellites. So called teacher satellites.

75
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.180
So the data goes up to teachers and then down at ground stations to white sands.

76
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.014
And then.

77
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.650
<v 0>So what kind of bandwidth you getting? What's your latency?</v>

78
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.460
<v 1>You don't remember the numbers, but, um, we weren't getting, when I was there,</v>

79
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.290
we weren't getting live internet, uh,

80
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.840
because all that bandwidth is being used for science to get,

81
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.120
then all the data from the experiments and the video.

82
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.060
<v 0>You can check your Twitter. You can, now.</v>

83
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.500
<v 1>You can, now you can now I just missed that. Terrible. Yeah. It's probably.</v>

84
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.640
<v 0>Yeah. It's about a distraction. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.370
Just Google search and random things where you're supposed to be doing your job

86
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.560
at space. Yeah. So you,

87
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.620
you get these shows and you're watching Battlestar Galactica.

88
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.980
<v 1>Bellsa Gretta Colby rapport, daily show and like New York Yankees games.</v>

89
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:48.610
So I'm like, wow, that's what I'm watching.

90
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.290
<v 0>Wow. Are you watching, you know,</v>

91
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.960
I'm watching the Yankees games in real time right now, pre.

92
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.003
<v 1>Pre recorded.</v>

93
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.920
<v 0>Oh, wow.</v>

94
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.710
<v 1>Still though. So it was just, that was a nice, like, like a bit of home that,</v>

95
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.370
you know,

96
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.820
like I would play the radio broadcast while I was working and it just in the

97
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:05.470
background. And so I feel like,

98
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.050
hear the crack of the bat and it's kind of like you're in space,

99
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:09.280
but you still kind of connected to home.

100
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.410
<v 0>That seems like something that would go on in a movie.</v>

101
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.310
Like some guy who's working on a spaceship and the movie is listening to a

102
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.170
baseball game, go, three.

103
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.130
<v 1>Balls, two strikes.</v>

104
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.500
<v 0>Doesn't it really does seem very like some classic George Clooney</v>

105
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:27.610
movie about space. Yeah. It's real. Wow, man.

106
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.440
How weird did that feel so surreal that you were that guy up there with a

107
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:33.274
laptop?

108
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, you and I battle Battlestar,</v>

109
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.370
I'm watching Battlestar and they're like,

110
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.340
now I'm in the final season and they're like finding earth and I'm like,

111
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.203
it's right there.

112
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.020
<v 0>You're, you're in a spaceship.</v>

113
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.170
How many people have watched Battlestar Galactica while in a spaceship?

114
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.490
You might be the only person ever.

115
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.370
<v 1>Well, my commander was watching it too, so it was at least two and two of us.</v>

116
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.070
Um, but, but so they ask you like,

117
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.080
are there any celebrities you'd like to chat with while you're up there and they

118
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.430
will go out and get them for you, that kind of morale boost thing. Oh, wow.

119
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.640
And so I said, I want to talk to Ron Moore and David Eick. Oh,

120
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.750
we're the creators of Battlestar. So we had this great Skype session.

121
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.410
Wow. It was so cool. And that's why before I was going to mention this,

122
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.140
when we were talking about, um, you know,

123
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.680
science fiction and science fact and had this as crazy feedback loop about,

124
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:21.110
you gotta think about it first.

125
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:25.340
Like you go back and look at 2001 and he see these guys using tablets

126
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.650
in 1960 was in 1968. That movie came out and, you know,

127
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:34.130
Steve jobs saw that and said, I want to, I'm going to make one of those. Right.

128
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.620
And, um, so there's this crazy like interplay between fiction and fact.

129
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.310
And, um, and I got to talk to Ron Moore about all this and in,

130
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.760
in any invited me to, uh, come on the set for the,

131
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.850
for the final episode of Battlestar. Wow.

132
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.070
And you're not supposed to like the first 30 days,

133
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.690
you're back from a long duration mission.

134
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.910
You're not supposed to like go anywhere. And I'm like, uh, look,

135
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.930
they're only going to shoot this once. You know, it's, it's two weeks from now.

136
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.710
I'm going. And the last time I checked, this was a free country I'm in,

137
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:07.544
I can stop me.

138
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.930
So I went and I went all the way up to Vancouver and I got to go on the set.

139
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.800
I met all the cast. I got to be a focus polar on the camera guy got to do that,

140
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.580
that, that sticks, you know, oh, wow. I just had a blast.

141
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.710
And then he made me an extra as a colonial Marine in the back of a ship that

142
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:25.520
gets blown.

143
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.800
<v 0>I'm sure that show is super complicated to make,</v>

144
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.960
but I would love if they brought it back. Yeah.

145
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.440
I don't think people appreciate it enough. Cause it was on Saifai,

146
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.870
which is not the most popular network.

147
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:38.750
And it's also a reboot of a classic show.

148
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.970
So maybe it had like a bit of a stink to it,

149
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:45.620
but that was so much better than the first version of it. The comparison.

150
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.170
Great show. It's really intense.

151
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.160
<v 1>It's.</v>

152
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.080
<v 0>Really, really well-made.</v>

153
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.520
I like everything about it from the plot to the acting. It's it's sensational.

154
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.670
This is my favorite scifi show of all time, for sure. Yeah.

155
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.563
<v 1>Me too.</v>

156
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.400
<v 0>It's blasphemy me for star Trek fans, but it's really good. It's good, man.</v>

157
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.550
I mean, you couldn't have it without star Trek.

158
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:10.490
You couldn't have it without the original Battlestar Galactica,

159
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.900
but at the end of the day.

160
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.120
<v 1>Yeah. They all kind of build on each other and that's what,</v>

161
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:17.150
and so then Ron went off and did Outlander after that. Oh, okay.

162
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.320
And now he came in one day, he calls me up and he says, uh, I got this new idea.

163
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.300
Can I come by? Could we can get together?

164
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.540
And maybe I could bounce the idea off of you. I was like, yeah.

165
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.900
So he came to space X and then I gave him a tour of the place. And then, uh,

166
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.160
we sat down at the, in the cafe and uh, he said, okay.

167
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.170
So I'm thinking about doing a show about NASA back in like the seventies

168
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.020
and be kind of like a period piece would be kind of like,

169
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.710
we'd have a cast of characters, but they're all working on Apollo. Um,

170
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.150
and it would be true to real life,

171
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.360
but it would be the drama of the people behind the scenes. I saw.

172
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.490
It sounds pretty cool. He goes, yeah.

173
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.620
I'm also toying around with a slight twist that where we use an alternate

174
00:08:55.621 --> 00:09:00.420
reality and in his alternate reality, uh, things,

175
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.850
we start at that point, but things turn out differently.

176
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.290
And we start talking about like how close the Russians were to actually beating

177
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.590
us to the moon, which not a lot of people know about,

178
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.870
but when I was over there in Moscow, I got to see actually they're in,

179
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.070
they have a warehouse where they still have their lunar Lander, for example,

180
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:19.740
that they built, they were really working hard on it.

181
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.220
So we started what iffing like, well, what if the Russians got there first?

182
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.540
What would it, what would America done? How,

183
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.510
how would things be different today?

184
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.300
If that seminal moment of Neil and buzz stepping out on the moon was

185
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:37.410
instead Alexa and the owner of a cosmonaut doing it. Right. And I was like,

186
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.090
that is freaking genius. I mean, that was like, uh, I thought,

187
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:43.620
I w I want to see that show. That's like a great premise.

188
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.590
And he pitched that to apple and they bought it and then he called me up and he

189
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.380
said, do you want to work on the show? And I'm like, yeah, that's that's so.

190
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.970
<v 0>What is your role? What do you do there?</v>

191
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.690
<v 1>I'm a technical consultant. One of a couple. We have a, we have a,</v>

192
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.650
another group of people, a couple of other people that help out too,

193
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.510
but I get involved in like everything.

194
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:06.540
So I was in the writer's room where we're first coming up with basic ideas and

195
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:10.950
sketching out like multiple seasons and character arcs and all that kind of

196
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:12.780
stuff. And then I got to,

197
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.420
then I get all the scripts and I read them all and I give notes on all the

198
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:18.900
scripts. And then they come to the set and I, I meet with the actors, the cast,

199
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:22.740
and I give them suggestions about like, how to look real when they're in space.

200
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.080
Uh, and then I like work with the VFX guys. I work with the stunt team. Uh,

201
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.560
I get phone calls from like the hair and makeup people. Like,

202
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.800
how did what a ladies do with their hair? If they have long hair,

203
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:38.880
when they do a spacewalk, I'm like, you're calling the wrong guy, but,

204
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.630
but I can ask a friend. Right. So, so, uh,

205
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.250
so all that was so much fun for me. It's like, you know,

206
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:47.671
you know how,

207
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.080
like you can pay a whole lot of money and go to fantasy baseball camp. Yeah.

208
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.550
And like, you get to like,

209
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.140
have batting practice with the Dodgers or something and they humor you because

210
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.720
you paid a lot of money. Well, it's kind of like that.

211
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:04.590
I keep waiting for them to say like, okay, uh, the fund is over,

212
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:07.560
get out of here, go back to your day job, you know? But I'm like,

213
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.453
I'm just loving it.

214
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.900
<v 0>So how much correcting do you have to do? How much do you get to script and go,</v>

215
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.750
eh, that doesn't happen that you can't do that. That's not.

216
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.410
<v 1>It, it depends. And every production is different. Uh,</v>

217
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:22.080
the nice thing about for all mankind is they really, really want to get it.

218
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.780
Right. I've worked on other projects where they say they want to get it right.

219
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:27.480
But then they like completely blow up the laws of physics and, and you know,

220
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:29.280
I'm okay with that because the.

221
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.890
<v 0>Martian with the hand cutting thing. Yeah.</v>

222
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.570
<v 1>Cause at the end of the day, uh, I said this to some of my students,</v>

223
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.480
like nobody goes to see a movie for the orbital mechanics.

224
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.160
You go for the story, the characters. Yeah.

225
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.241
<v 0>It's hard.</v>

226
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:48.840
If you're an expert in something to watch a movie with a fudge stuff and it

227
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:52.860
doesn't make sense. Yeah. Like for me, martial arts movies,

228
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.950
martial arts movies do dumb. I'm like, come on, man. You know,

229
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:00.190
or if I watch a movie about a pool player and I can tell the guy can't really

230
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:02.560
play pool, I get upset. So for you,

231
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.570
when you're watching something like gravity, right. That was a big one.

232
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.720
A lot of people got really like Neil deGrasse, Tyson who hate it. He hated it,

233
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:12.880
hated it. He went into, I liked it.

234
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.520
<v 1>And the problem is, now that I have this job,</v>

235
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.810
now I'm getting more persnickety about it. You know, I'm sure now I'm watching.

236
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.520
I'm like, eh, that's not right. But yeah.

237
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.620
<v 0>Everything, the gravity, the hair that.</v>

238
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.330
<v 1>I used to, not care though, like when I first saw gravity, I loved it.</v>

239
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.000
Cause it was a good story. It was a grip me.

240
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.510
<v 0>But you knew that those space stations were not close to each other.</v>

241
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.360
<v 1>Yeah. The inclinations are, the Orvis is totally different. Doesn't it?</v>

242
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:39.310
You're going to go from one to the other with a fire extinguisher.

243
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:41.440
I knew that it was complete. Don't get me wrong.

244
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.070
<v 0>But that leap where they treating you, like,</v>

245
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:46.690
you're a moron they're treating you. Like,

246
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.480
there's no way you're going to be able to research this. But something like you,

247
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.080
someone like you rather that's your life. So like, you know, that's nonsense.

248
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:58.000
So you're sitting there watching some hokey solution for something that would

249
00:12:58.001 --> 00:12:58.834
never work.

250
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.850
<v 1>Yeah. So if it gets to the point where like,</v>

251
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.660
but that's the beautiful thing about like doing this with television is you

252
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:07.750
don't have to actually be right. You just have to be believable,

253
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.190
which the bar is like, when I'm teaching my class at USC, uh,

254
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.940
I gotta be right. But when I'm like, yeah, well maybe this could happen.

255
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.150
Right. You know, with the TV show, it's easier.

256
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.980
<v 0>But this TV show, you're just saying they really want to try to get it.</v>

257
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.540
<v 1>You really do. Cause it's, it's really important to them. And so yeah.</v>

258
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.080
I've ended up making like wholesale changes to, um,

259
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.650
episodes become like the original idea. I, I try very,

260
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:35.620
very hard not to interfere with their creative process because they're,

261
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:39.880
it's really, really good at that. And um, you know, I'm not worthy,

262
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.970
but I'm like, yeah, okay. I see what you're trying to do.

263
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.210
You want this guy to be the hero you want this person to feel remorse.

264
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:49.060
You want this. And, and, and, and over the course of time,

265
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.020
this person has a change of heart. I get the story. But what if,

266
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.860
instead of doing it this way, what if the events occur like this?

267
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.870
Because this could actually happen. Right?

268
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:01.720
And so I tried to change it and it was one like, um,

269
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.280
like episode nine and a little bit of episode, 10 of season one, uh,

270
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:07.300
we ended up sitting,

271
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.540
I ended up sitting and working very closely with the writers and changing the,

272
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:14.170
all the technical content to fit, to make the story work in a believable way.

273
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.920
And that when, when we do that, and then you see it on the screen,

274
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.290
it's like so incredibly rewarding. It's really fun.

275
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.830
<v 0>It must be, especially as someone who's a scifi fan, like you've,</v>

276
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:27.350
you've had two dream lives here, like three or four.

277
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.203
<v 1>Really.</v>

278
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.800
<v 0>Incredible that you've gone from that from NASA to space X.</v>

279
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:36.880
And now to be able to create television shows that you can actually ensure wow,
