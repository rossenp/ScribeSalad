WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.160
<v 2>One of the most bonkers things in our culture today. Yeah. I mean,</v>

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.520
amazing. That's that Scientology is like still, I mean,

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.920
I passed by the church of Scientology here just the other day. I was like, huh,

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.283
still works.

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.990
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah, they they've just moved it. I, when the documentary came out,</v>

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.390
um, some woman had just gone to see it at the movie theater and the,

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.630
and the, uh, it was on the drag, you know, on Guadalupe, across from, um,

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.870
the university. And she drove her car through the plate, glass windows,

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.710
the Scientology building, and she didn't stop there.

11
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:42.020
She drove around the lobby a little bit knocking over bookshelves and stuff.

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.380
I had to issue a statement deploring violence in any form.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.700
<v 1>Was she a, a victim.</v>

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.420
<v 0>Of it or no, she had just seen the documentary and she was really worked up.</v>

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.633
Wow. So.

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 1>That's a hype. She might have some other issues. Yeah, she might.</v>

17
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.270
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420
<v 1>Maybe Scientology could have helped her actually. Yeah. Wrote.</v>

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.340
<v 0>Could have been, I might have been a course for that. Well.</v>

20
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.530
<v 1>This it's a weird thing.</v>

21
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:07.170
When you see so many people that are so successful that are Scientologists,

22
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.850
at least you used to see that I had a neighbor who was one of the nicest guys

23
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.210
and he was a great guy. Who's a, in my old neighborhood.

24
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.730
And he was a Scientologist. And I found out in the most bizarre way, because,

25
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.730
uh, there was, uh, a piece of land that was for sale.

26
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.240
And he was talking about this piece of land, about possibly purchasing it. But,

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.520
uh, he was gonna have to put it off because he needed $50,000 because

28
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:34.240
his wife was going clear. Right. And it was like,

29
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.920
like a scene in a movie where the record skips &lt;laugh&gt; and I went, what,

30
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.150
like, what are you doing? And this was me of, you know,

31
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:47.590
I was probably 28 at the time 29.

32
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.150
I was the, the podcast has radically changed the way I look at things.

33
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.550
Cause I've had a chance to educate myself yeah.

34
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.750
And have all these conversations with brilliant people.

35
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.990
And just enough of these conversations where I have a different perspective.

36
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.620
But back then, I really didn't know too much about Scientology.

37
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:09.540
Other than I had bought a book from, um, uh,

38
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.940
DS online, cuz uh, not online rather, uh, on, on television, late night TV.

39
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.820
Yeah. 94. And they wouldn't stop sending me these pamphlets. Yeah.

40
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.140
Asking me to come to all these various, uh,

41
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.970
meetings and this and that and sending me all things for programs and they have

42
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.970
discounts. And I mean, I was in one way, I was kind of a,

43
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.290
I admired their hustle. I was like, this is, these guys don't stop. Right.

44
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.850
Like they just kept sending this to my mailbox.

45
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.410
I taught it was like a self-help book.

46
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.210
And I would always been in the like Anthony Robbins and all these different, I,

47
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.120
I always into motivation. I like, what can I, what can I get?

48
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.840
That's gonna help me like work harder or succeed better. Do you know,

49
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.240
whatever. So I saw this thing and it was like, wow, this seems, uh,

50
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.600
very compelling.

51
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.200
And I knew that there was a bunch of famous people that were Scientologists,

52
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.880
like Tom cruise and all right. I was like, maybe this is maybe this is legit.

53
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.520
And I was reading it and I was like, this boy, this is like, seems odd.

54
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.600
It seems off without getting too much into it. So when I talked to this, um,

55
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.840
guy who was my neighbor really didn't have a deep background and understanding

56
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.400
it, but that was the beginning of me. Like really getting into it,

57
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.030
it like talking to him and, and finding out like how much money he had to spend.

58
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.310
And what was it about and like, what did they do for you? And they,

59
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.830
he was explaining how nothing would ever influence you again,

60
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.150
no negative influence that's going clear. Meant.

61
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.070
That was probably one of the first times I had ever heard that expression. Yeah.

62
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.460
<v 0>I, first time I ran into it was when I was in, in college and I was, uh,</v>

63
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.500
my girlfriend and I were living in an apartment above this little storefront

64
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.340
and, uh, it was Scientology and uh, I'd never heard of it before. And you know,

65
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.460
they, I, they showed me the, the EME and stuff like that. And I just thought,

66
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.940
I thought it was an interesting, you know, I, I wasn't put off by it.

67
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.330
I was &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, I thought maybe so I didn't pursue it.

68
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.970
<v 1>Uh, how old were you at the.</v>

69
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.930
<v 0>Time? I was 21. 21. Yeah. And,</v>

70
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.330
uh, you know, it was, I've always been interested in religions,

71
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.250
you know, one of the, the themes, I guess, of my work and, uh,

72
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.000
and why people go into one religion rather why they believe one thing rather

73
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.160
than another, because in America you can believe anything you want.

74
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.440
And you know, that's not true in a lot of countries, but in our country,

75
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:35.840
there's a smorgasboard of religions you can choose from.

76
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.040
And if you don't see something, you know, you can make up your own. And,

77
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.950
you know, it was a very fertile religious culture, uh,

78
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.230
which interests me and, and I I've, as a reporter,

79
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.470
I think about how people have strong political beliefs and it

80
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.790
doesn't affect their behavior at all. Mm. You know, you know,

81
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.420
a lot of people like that, I'm sure. Or, but, you know,

82
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:07.180
if you have powerful religious beliefs, it determines your life. And,

83
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.020
you know, as, as journalists, we should pay more attention to that.

84
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.220
So I've always been intrigued by different religious

85
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.020
manifestations. And so Scientology was on my list. Uh,

86
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.170
I had wanted to write about it and because they're, you know,

87
00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:29.730
they're always scaring everybody, um, with, you know, legal threat threats or,

88
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:31.730
you know, shakedowns and stuff like that.

89
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.210
<v 1>Uh, do they still do that or have they kind of backed off from that?</v>

90
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.290
<v 0>Oh, the people that, some of my sources for that, you know,</v>

91
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:41.530
they hounded them mercilessly and, you know,

92
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:45.160
they are private investigators. They're not,

93
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.320
they're not doing the, the job that private investigators are, you know,

94
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:54.520
they're doing is not so much to, uh, sneak up on your, you know,

95
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.280
go through your trash. Although they do that,

96
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.280
it's intimidate you mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, you know,

97
00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:03.760
they had somebody following me around for a while. Uh,

98
00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:06.760
mainly to my public events, you know, when I was making speeches,

99
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.560
I I'm in a band and he came to one of my gigs. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.

100
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.000
<v 1>What kind of band do you?</v>

101
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.710
<v 0>It's a blues band. We play, you know, access Louisiana music. And, uh,</v>

102
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.110
we used to back before the pandemic. I, I don't know if our,

103
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.310
we had a regular gig at the Skylar lounge in east Austin and,

104
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.830
uh, opening.

105
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.430
<v 1>Well, I want to come see you when you'll.</v>

106
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.190
<v 0>Be invited. Yeah. Uh, we, we got it. We're gonna be really rusty.</v>

107
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.020
We need a lot of rehearsal now that's.

108
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.460
<v 1>To be expected. So, um,</v>

109
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.060
you got really fascinated by religions. And what,

110
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.380
what made you focus on Scientology? I mean, there's,

111
00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:51.380
there's a lot of crazy religions out there.

112
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.900
One of the weirdest ones about Scientology is we know who made it, right? Yeah.

113
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:58.930
It's like him and Joseph Smith, those the more, and, and Scientology,

114
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.810
the only ones where we know who the creator is. Right.

115
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.890
And the Scientology one is particularly weird,

116
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.090
cuz it was a science fiction author. Yeah. It's like,

117
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:11.010
that was that didn't raise any red flags of people like.

118
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.930
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, you know, you,</v>

119
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.930
you mentioned Mormons in the same breath and I think that's apt. You know,

120
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.960
they were the most stigmatized religion in the 19th century.

121
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.080
Uh, you know, mark Twain hated them. Uh,

122
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.280
Zane gray wrote a, a, a novel about, you know, how wicked they were.

123
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:33.520
They were hounded from one state to another.

124
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.520
And Scientology is kind of the modern equivalent of that. You know, they,

125
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.830
and of the reasons I wanted to write about it is you have these famous and

126
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:43.910
sometimes wealthy people,

127
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.710
as you point out affiliating with this organization,

128
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.910
they must be a kind of public relations martyrdom for them. Mm. I mean,

129
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.550
you, you can admire Tom cruise or John Travolta for their acting,

130
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.660
but you also think, are they a little nuts? You know,

131
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.060
is there something going on with them that they need this religion? And uh,

132
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.460
so why do they affiliate?

133
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.740
Why do they lend their celebrity and their standing

134
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.260
to, uh, such a stigmatized religion?

135
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.620
That was one of the reasons I wanted to write about it.

136
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.690
<v 1>Well, they must get some benefit out of.</v>

137
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.330
<v 0>It. That's what I, I, and they do. Yeah. I'm not, you know, I think,</v>

138
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:26.090
especially at the lower levels, you know,

139
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:30.330
they offer courses like Jerry Seinfeld was in for a while. I.

140
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.163
<v 1>Don't think he was ever in,</v>

141
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.170
I think he was interested in it and he was studying it. He took some courses.

142
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.153
<v 0>Yeah. And.</v>

143
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.770
<v 1>Uh, but he was never like committed as a Scientologist watch.</v>

144
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.000
<v 0>What is a ologist? I mean,</v>

145
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:44.360
once you're going to the celebrity center and you're taking courses, you know,

146
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.520
I say you're a Scientologist.

147
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.680
<v 1>But if you go fishing once, are you a fisherman?</v>

148
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.440
<v 0>Yeah. That CA aren't you. It's a good question. You know,</v>

149
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.800
I'm, I'm testing the water. I played basketball.

150
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.480
<v 1>A couple times. I Harley a basketball.</v>

151
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.560
<v 0>Player. It's a little different, is.</v>

152
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.240
<v 1>It? I mean, I guess it is, but I mean, I feel like taking courses and things.</v>

153
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.200
<v 0>Doesn't mean, well, Leonard Cohen did as well and rock Hudson. I mean,</v>

154
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:12.320
there were a lot of people were drawn to it. And I think, you know,

155
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.200
part of it is, uh,

156
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.870
Scientology set itself up as a religion

157
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.270
for celebrities. It deliberately targeted people like that.

158
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.790
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, uh, for instance,

159
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.710
if you go to Hollywood and you look at, you know, prominent actors and so on,

160
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.500
they tend not to be Southern Baptist. You know,

161
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.500
they is not designed for them. And, uh, you know,

162
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.660
they may come from a Southern Baptist, uh, background,

163
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:47.340
but if they move to Hollywood and they're looking for a group of spiritual

164
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.300
seekers like themselves, and they're, you know,

165
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:52.220
they want to affiliate with people like them.

166
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.460
Scientology says here we all.

167
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.130
And we have the celebrity center where people like you, you know,

168
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.650
can come and you can hang around with other famous people. Uh.

169
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.690
<v 1>I think they offer a certain amount of protection.</v>

170
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.530
And I think there's some something that there for that. And there's also,

171
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.290
I think, um, there's a structure that exists.

172
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.480
And I think there's a lot of people that, especially in such a volatile,

173
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.240
um, sort of, it's a uncertain world,

174
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.040
the world of acting in particular. Yeah. It's such a crazy world. I mean,

175
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:30.360
I always said, if you want the, a formula, like why is LA the way it is? Well,

176
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:32.480
just stop and think about what it is. You,

177
00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:36.480
you have a bunch of people that move there from somewhere else because they want

178
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.790
fame. Right? Right. And then you make them audition,

179
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:45.430
which is the weirdest thing. You go into, uh, an unnatural environment,

180
00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:49.310
usually a conference room. There's a bunch of people sitting around judging you.

181
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.430
And you want them to like you enough to pick you to do this thing.

182
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.910
So you can't in any way, buck trends,

183
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.700
you have to be like Uber polite. You have whatever the ideology is.

184
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.540
That's accepted the general vibe of Hollywood. You must confirm to that.

185
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.900
You must conform to that. Rather you like there's,

186
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.620
they don't even have opinions.

187
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.060
They have this conglomeration of opinions they've adopted in order to be let in

188
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.530
to this tribe. And then you, you hope that they pick you.

189
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.610
And so you have these incredibly insecure people who want acceptance and love,

190
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.930
and then you make 'em beg for it. They're essentially like, yeah,

191
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.850
going there and hoping that these people will like them.

192
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.890
And that's where you get the abuse,

193
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.250
like the Harvey Ws deans of the world and these type of people. It's like,

194
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.040
they're praying on this new need to be accepted and brought into this group in

195
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:45.880
order to, to, to, to be, to, to, to work, to be able to work. You, you,

196
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.840
you have to play this up game. And so if something comes along like Scientology,

197
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.080
that gives you structure and gives you family and gives you like the,

198
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.080
we are for you, we're gonna help you become clear.

199
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.880
We're gonna bring you to the next level. You know, you,

200
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.000
you're a gives you something where you feel like, like,

201
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.440
have you ever done martial arts? I did judo when I was in high school.

202
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.040
One of the beautiful things about martial arts is the belt system. Yeah.

203
00:12:10.041 --> 00:12:11.000
Because like, you, you,

204
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.190
when you are a white belt and also sudden they tie that blue belt on your waist,

205
00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:17.590
you're like, wow, I am making progress. This is really happening.

206
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.070
And you feel fantastic. Whereas if you went to a martial art, like, uh, I,

207
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.990
I did kickboxing for a while. There's no belts. And it just feels weird. Like,

208
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.630
you don't know where you are. Like, where am I? Like, it's not,

209
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.110
it's not the most success. And like, and because of that,

210
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.700
some kickboxing systems, even in Mo Thai,

211
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.900
some weird systems have developed their own belt structure, which is weird.

212
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.020
The system they've just sort of added to the existing martial arts that didn't

213
00:12:42.021 --> 00:12:46.580
have a belt structure, but it's to give people this sense of progress,

214
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.980
give people a scaffolding, give people, structure,

215
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.970
give people this thing where you feel like something is happening to for me.

216
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.490
And I think that's one of the things that Scientology does really well.

217
00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.330
It does for these up people. Absolutely catch new episodes.
