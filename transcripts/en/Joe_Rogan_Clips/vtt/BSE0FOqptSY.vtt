1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>All you would think about is your kid. That's awesome.</v>

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>All you would think about. Well, I just got evacuated, right?</v>

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.840
I got evacuated from my house cuz the fires, um,

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.200
fires you're are everywhere of it. They're everywhere.

5
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:14.320
They're especially when you're brother they're everywhere. They're they're in.

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.360
Um, they evacuated like thousand Oaks and they evacuated places in west lake

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.150
Malibu, girls out.

8
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.150
Apparently this fire that we have here is nothing in comparison to the fire.

9
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:29.550
That's in upstate what's further up Northern the Northern California.

10
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.950
Fire is supposed to be even more severe.

11
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.830
They were saying the Northern California fire was moving at what was the number?

12
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.670
It something insane. Like 80 football fields a minute.

13
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.260
Wasn't that labeled at the biggest fire in California ever.

14
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.700
The biggest fire going on right now, Northern California.

15
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.780
It's in Northern California. You know, what's crazy as.

16
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.780
<v 0>As how damaged, uh, cars are getting, they're like melting,</v>

17
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.580
the cars are melting. The videos are insane. People, this bus,

18
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.260
this bus that looked like it was bomb. Like how is, how were fire? Do we.

19
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.170
<v 1>Know how it doing that? I don't know. It's always the worst when it's like some</v>

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.210
Started it. I don't know. I don't know if they know yet prick.

21
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.290
I don't know if they know you direct energy weapons. Gosh, it happened.

22
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:12.090
They're saying right outside of, uh, rocket dying.

23
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.450
That's where it happened, which is uh, it's like a rocket. Have you seen.

24
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.450
<v 0>Those pictures of, of, of the cars with their,</v>

25
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.240
their rims or melting mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. How hot do forest.

26
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.120
<v 1>Fires get? They get hot as buck. How are a lot of.</v>

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.080
<v 0>How, how is steel melting?</v>

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.120
<v 1>A lot of aluminum. It's a lot of aluminum wheels.</v>

29
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.560
<v 0>The frame doesn't melt steel.</v>

30
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.400
<v 1>Is so good. A lot of people have aluminum wheels, right? A percent. Yeah. Alloy,</v>

31
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.234
regular.

32
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.600
<v 0>Fire melt, aluminum. Just the regular fire will melt. You.</v>

33
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.430
<v 1>Think it's so else your tires are gonna somebody up.</v>

34
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.950
<v 0>You know me, dude. You asking me, you asking me? Do I think something else?</v>

35
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.270
Think about who you're talking to right now. Now think.

36
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.890
<v 1>About who this is.</v>

37
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550
You got a couple factors here that I would just take into account,

38
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.390
not being a fire expert, but one of them want, think would be tires.

39
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.550
Tires are super flamable. Once your tires catch fire,

40
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.470
they're all made outta rubber and all kinds of other plastics and that that's a.

41
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.700
<v 0>Are.</v>

42
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.780
<v 1>Flamable they, they hold the fire.</v>

43
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:09.620
They're not just flamable they go black smoke. It's a crazy smoke, right?

44
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:10.140
That's why the.

45
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.020
<v 0>Cartel use them. When they kill people, they put 'em in. Cause they keeps.</v>

46
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.780
They don't put like don't they do 'em with like lighter fluid in the kinda I.

47
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.420
<v 1>The other thing I was gonna say is gasoline cars are fueled by gasoline.</v>

48
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.130
You got gasoline there. You got, you got insane heat. The,

49
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.890
the whole car gets engulfed. The gas tank erupts.

50
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.930
You got temperatures that are like,

51
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:34.290
it's like basically having an Inferno right there.

52
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.010
It's not like it's not a fire. Like oh,

53
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.530
a phone book called on fire and it melted a wheel. No, it's like a,

54
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.480
a giant combustion engine in that works on gasoline.

55
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.600
And has these rubber super flamable tires and is covered by a plastic

56
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.600
paint. That's probably flamable flamable and this all gets hit.

57
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.760
Insides, leather with fire.

58
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:02.600
That's coming from 50 mile an hour wind they're fire machines.

59
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.880
<v 0>Out there. And then what about like the, the registration?</v>

60
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.143
<v 1>What.</v>

61
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.240
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; I mean, I'm just trying to be funny on.</v>

62
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.680
<v 1>You. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you were serious. Look at these cars.</v>

63
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.440
These cars got Mercked.

64
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.670
This is like what happened when the met on the

65
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:20.504
Avengers?

66
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.470
<v 0>How did the windows get broken?</v>

67
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.510
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; they destroyed Eddie. The, the heat makes 'em shatter.</v>

68
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.350
They fall apart. If you ever get a glass too hot,

69
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.870
you ever have a glass get too hot, like. No, if you pour tea in a regular glass,

70
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.510
they crack ready for that.

71
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:42.140
That's not even that hot because thet makes them expand the, the,

72
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.900
the heat from the tee. You're not buying.

73
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.820
<v 0>It, honey. I don't know, man. Well.</v>

74
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.940
<v 1>These fires are weird. This is what I would suggest. Don't look into it. Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.700
Don't.

76
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.220
<v 0>Just don't don't I don't trust. You know me? Are you.</v>

77
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.420
<v 1>Are you affected by the.</v>

78
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.890
<v 0>Fires? CNN? If CNN, if the headline says anything, I don't believe it. Any,</v>

79
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.743
any CNN?

80
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.970
<v 1>Anything's true. Eddie. That's true Eddie,</v>

81
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.690
but here's a beautiful thing about this fire. You can see it.

82
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.930
You don't have to wonder. No.

83
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.730
<v 0>I'm not saying there's no fire. I'm just saying like.</v>

84
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.210
<v 1>But this is what we're talking about. We're talking about this fire. Okay. No,</v>

85
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:12.570
there's a.

86
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.370
<v 0>Fire for sure's a giant fire. I see the smoke. So I'm saying, I don't know.</v>

87
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:19.370
There's some crazy people out there saying that, um,

88
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.800
they're being started by some direct energy weapons. I don't know.

89
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.720
That's what the crazy people are saying. Well, fires happen all the time though.

90
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.000
It's it's kind of a natural.

91
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.960
<v 1>Occurrence. What, what, what's more likely that fires are happening.</v>

92
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.000
Like they always happen from electric boxes going out or wires going

93
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.150
down fires, being. Cigarettes, cigarettes, cigarette.

94
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:46.750
That's how firefi before there was Illuminati before there was anything,

95
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.190
there was forest fires. They'd been around forever.

96
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.670
This is not like a new occurrence.

97
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:54.350
It's not like they're using this secret energy weapon to do some that's never

98
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:56.910
been done before. How dumb would their super energy weapon?

99
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:58.670
If they used it to start fire, there's just a lot.

100
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.900
<v 0>Of weird out there. Like houses. Like you can see house, house,</v>

101
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.380
house completely leveled. Okay. I'll tell and all the trees around them,

102
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.180
nothing wrong with the trees at all. Weird. Just weird like that. Well.

103
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.300
<v 1>It's probably, I don't know what that means.</v>

104
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:16.100
Easier for the fire to make houses go up in flames because that's all

105
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.100
dry old. So dry, dry wood, wood. You got dry, old on the,

106
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.650
the, your tiles. A lot of times these people have these, um,

107
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.810
these roofing tiles and the, the embers get in between.

108
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:31.170
There it goes right into the tar. It burns it. It goes right through your,

109
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.410
my next door neighbor. His roof was on fire. God, we don't need no water.

110
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.970
We done. Yeah, no, they, um, they, they got to it in time.

111
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.920
The firefighters caught it. My friend bud caught it, told the firefighters,

112
00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:47.560
shout out to bud Budsman Budsman yeah. His house. No, no, no,

113
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.200
it wasn't his house, but it was my neighbor's house. So when,

114
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.480
when this was all going down, this is happening all throughout. Not just here,

115
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.440
but all throughout Topanga now and Malibu and these embers fall from the

116
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.293
sky. And then they,

117
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.760
they light everything up in flames because everywhere you look,

118
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.280
everything is dry as. It's dry as. Right?

119
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.560
We haven't had any rain in a long time. If you go running in the trails,

120
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.640
it's just dust. You're kicking up dust there's you start coughing.

121
00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:19.390
And then you got the wind, all spreads, all of it. Everything's brown,

122
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.710
dry out science, Eddie. And when these embers fall from the sky and hid this,

123
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.630
it just starts. We're just lucky. It doesn't happen more often. In fact though,

124
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.150
it happened this time, last year around here, because we had,

125
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.270
we had Ash out in the, the gym area.

126
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.460
We had to sweep the Ash because it had actually come in through cracks,

127
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.620
like little tiny cracks, dude. I've bashed all the way in my house. All from,

128
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.660
from fifth fire all the way where I'm at. I'm sure. I'm sure it's no joke, dude.

129
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.540
Fire it's from serious. So I don't think it's an energy wave,

130
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.340
but I do think it's super dangerous to live in a climate where there's this much

131
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.930
vegetation, not enough moisture.

132
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.170
Like how come we can't figure out how to get that water out of the ocean and

133
00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:05.490
start spraying it all over the.

134
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.650
<v 0>So much water in the ocean. There's so much water. I, you can use it at all.</v>

135
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.210
You know what? They're salt in it. We can't with it. We can't with that salt.

136
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:13.490
Feel.

137
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.410
<v 1>Like they can take the salt down. We still.</v>

138
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.490
<v 0>Can't with the.</v>

139
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.280
<v 1>Salt. No, no, no. They have decent alien plants. They're just super.</v>

140
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:20.240
It's too expensive. Yeah.

141
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.120
<v 0>It's too expensive. We can't afford that. They save the, this almond,</v>

142
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.920
the almond factor had more money. We'd be able to do that,

143
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.840
but it's too expensive to the.

144
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.840
<v 1>Alman plants. Want the ocean water? No, they.</v>

145
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.240
<v 0>Use all our water. If we got rid of almond, the California would be straight.</v>

146
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.990
Whoa.

147
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.750
<v 1>Yeah. The almonds bro. Vegans consumed more almonds and then were,</v>

148
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:42.230
they're the reason why they're the reason why the imagine how ironic that would

149
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:44.710
be. Is there almonds that were doing us in the whole time?

150
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.910
Not cattle raising is almond.

151
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.830
<v 0>Is there a country rich enough to filter the salt outta water</v>

152
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.750
and use the water for their country? Or is it, I bet it's just too expensive.

153
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.910
<v 1>Right? I bet Dubai could do that. No.</v>

154
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.380
<v 0>Much money. We do a demo.</v>

155
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.020
<v 1>They like gold hotels know hard it's they would, they would roll out a carpet,</v>

156
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.940
made a gold. That dude would slide on a gold surfboard in that very.

157
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.220
<v 0>Doesn't like a survivor filters. Like for the Navy,</v>

158
00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:15.220
there's like a survivor filter that you could drink the, the sea water.

159
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.820
And you could like suck. And it's like this filter the survival thing. Um, I.

160
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.210
<v 1>Don't know. Isn't that for seawater? You, I know they haveing PI no,</v>

161
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:24.610
they have those things for ponds. They have these things.

162
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:26.450
They're called scary pens. They just can't figure.

163
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.210
<v 0>Out that.</v>

164
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.530
<v 1>Seawater just can't that out. What's the high salt content.</v>

165
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.290
You can't too expensive. You can't have that much salt content, your water.

166
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.193
What if we have a.

167
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.130
<v 0>What if we have a up, what if we have a water tax? You know what I mean?</v>

168
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.210
We're running outta water.

169
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.800
We gotta figure out how to take the salt out of the seawater. I don't.

170
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.240
<v 1>Think this is a, we have plenty of fresh water though.</v>

171
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.120
I don't think this is a conspiracy. No you.

172
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.480
<v 0>But you just said, how come we can't just take the ocean water?</v>

173
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.800
<v 1>And I'm just being funny. I'll tell you why they can't. It's super expensive.</v>

174
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.720
It's just trans. That's what I'm saying. It's too expensive. Well,

175
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.960
we don't have that kinda money.

176
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.560
So much money to change the water and to do it all the time for all the people

177
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.240
just pull that water out. And then who owns it?

178
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.920
Maybe if we bring some Coke from central America and,

179
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.790
and we generate income that way.

180
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.350
Imagine if we started sucking all the stuff out the ocean,

181
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.870
the ocean started pushing back and then people started building houses in front

182
00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:22.190
of the people's houses in Malibu.

183
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.750
And at first they would protest sick at first they would go, you.

184
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.470
We have the beach. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's not the beach anymore.

185
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.590
So basically just got an acre acre goes right in front of them,

186
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.870
a mile to just keep sucking water out.

187
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.820
Imagine there's like a mile to the beach now. And you know,

188
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.620
all these Mabu people, they show up at the county board meetings.

189
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:43.980
They stop pulling the water outta the ocean. He turn around behind him.

190
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:48.540
It's a tropical jungle. We got monkeys in LA and par and she,

191
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.860
I'm not mad it, man. We turn it into the tropics.

192
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.380
We make it moist and delicious. That would,

193
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.850
that's probably why is a beast? I'm gonna do a fight. Uh, real quick.

194
00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.890
Daish is a monster.
