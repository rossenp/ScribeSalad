1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Have you been micro-dosing.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.680
<v 1>At all a little bit every now and then I want to do some right now. I've never.</v>

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.790
<v 2>Done it. Wow. You know, I'm the CCO of a company that does a microdosing.</v>

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.120
<v 1>Company, if it's all super illegal. Well, no. So.</v>

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.920
<v 2>What it is is a, it's a company called red light Holland. Okay. And,</v>

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.230
uh, it's the truffle, the truffle. So it's the top.

7
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:27.830
The mushroom cap is the illegal part. What that's stem,

8
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:31.810
which is the truffle is not a illegal, they're going to jail. Okay. Listen,

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.290
we're in the process.

10
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.360
We're in the process of getting it all legalized and done the right way.

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.590
And it'll be available in, in the Netherlands first

12
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.800
microdosing. And uh,

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.680
and then eventually we're hoping it goes the way with marijuana.

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.780
<v 3>I think it can, right now everything's in flux. Everything's all up right now.</v>

15
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.550
And particularly in California.

16
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.610
<v 2>Pell wanted me to do mushrooms with him. He said, you gotta do mushrooms. I go,</v>

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.670
I've never done it. Cause he got to do with me and John Mayer. I'm like, oh

18
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.750
yeah. I go, John starts singing. Yeah. I agree. You guys,

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.250
you're both professionals at this. I'm not,

20
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.790
I don't want to be the guy crying in the corner. Are you nervous about it? Yeah.

21
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.650
I don't know what it does, but.

22
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.850
<v 3>There's still a little do a little in your fun. Yeah. Yeah. You build it.</v>

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.600
You just try it out. You do a little, should I be alone?

24
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:25.190
When I do the first time, you should do it with a friend who knows how to? Yeah.

25
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:30.080
I would say just to take one cap to something light,

26
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.470
you'll feel good. The mushrooms want you to like them.

27
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.380
And so the first time you do it, they're going to welcome you.

28
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.230
They're going to be like, oh man, this is what you should be doing.

29
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.630
I'm going to straighten out all your personal problems.

30
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.190
All these little weird personality ticks that you got all this strange,

31
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.190
the trouble you keep getting yourself into do to.

32
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.920
<v 1>Help you. The machine's going to talk to you. We'll help you.</v>

33
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.780
<v 3>And then one day they're going to trick you into taking a large dose and then</v>

34
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.160
you're gonna meet the aliens. And you're gonna realize that this,

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.260
this dimension that we live in is it's

36
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:07.040
connected to neighboring dimensions that are accessible through certain

37
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.690
psychedelics. And then once you see that you can never unsee it.

38
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.520
You can, it's regular life loses its seriousness.

39
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.840
It loses like 20% of its seriousness. It's still serious, still regular life.

40
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.180
But 20% of it goes away forever because you know that that's

41
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:26.810
possible.

42
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.320
You know that these other worlds exist and that other people are just out there

43
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.630
running through their entire life from birth to death.

44
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.960
And they never experienced those worlds. And it's, that's,

45
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.570
that's weird because like you're running around.

46
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:42.200
Like I run into people because people know that I've done a lot of psychedelic

47
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:46.430
drugs. So I'll run into people that know and they've done it too.

48
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.520
And they look at you and they'll, they'll talk to you like, Hey man, you know,

49
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:52.760
I did this because of you, like a buddy of mine said that to me the other day,

50
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.470
you gave me the courage to try this psychedelic drug. And I was like, oh,

51
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.930
what was it like? And he's like, did he take, he took DMT. And he was like, um.

52
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.940
<v 2>That's a little bit more advanced. I would imagine.</v>

53
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.650
<v 3>When this guy's a, he's a bad and Navy seal,</v>

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.350
but never had an experience like that. Then what was his experience with it?

55
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.060
Well, I mean, I would have to talk to them more in depth, but what,

56
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.940
when everybody does it, you,

57
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.680
what you get when they're describing it is just sort of like trying to use

58
00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:29.130
words to describe something where there's no references.

59
00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:31.980
It's not the words don't work. You're like,

60
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:34.920
you could kind of tell me what it was like, and I could kind of go here. Okay.

61
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:38.280
I kind of see that because I've done it. But if I D if I hadn't done it,

62
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.040
there's no way I've known. I have nothing. There's no.

63
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.070
<v 2>Like somebody trying to explain their dream to you. Well, that's,</v>

64
00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:44.904
what's similar.

65
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.690
<v 3>In this stuff. DMT is actually indogenous,</v>

66
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.980
it's it exists in the human body and they believe that it comes out in your

67
00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:53.814
dreams.

68
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.660
They believe that when you're dreaming your body's releasing some of that stuff,

69
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.380
they don't, they don't totally understand it. Right.

70
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.940
It's one of those weird things where they,

71
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.770
they really only found out that mammals created in the pineal

72
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:11.280
gland within the last few years, the Cottonwood research foundation,

73
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.170
which is a connected to a Rick Strassman who wrote that book, a DMT,

74
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:19.670
the spirit molecule. He ran a bunch of FDA approved. I think,

75
00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:21.750
I believe the only FDA approved, uh,

76
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.580
tests on DMT where they shot it into people in, um,

77
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.410
a clinical setting. How did you consume it? I was freebasing it.

78
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.513
You freebase it.

79
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.700
<v 2>Really? Yeah. Like a fiend. Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.600
<v 3>Like a fiend. It's like a glass bowl connected to like a tube.</v>

81
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.190
And you light the bottom of the bowl. The DMT sits inside the biz. The,

82
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.900
it looks like a white powder. I go white, almost yellowish white powder,

83
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.920
depending on which one you take, the five methoxy DMT is white.

84
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.030
And then the other stuff was more like white with like a little bit of yellow to

85
00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:01.260
it. And you take, it tastes like burnt plastic. It tastes terrible.

86
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.250
And you take a big, deep breath. You want to take like three big inhales.

87
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.640
The first time I did it only took one. And I just got to the door.

88
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.100
I got like to the door of the DMT dementia. And I was like, what is this?

89
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.020
This is weird. It was really weird, but I didn't even know what weird was.

90
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.620
Cause like 20 minutes later I did a second one. And the second one,

91
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.670
I took way more.

92
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.840
I took like three big hits and then it was almost like you're in a Slingshot or

93
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:26.310
catapult. It was like,

94
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:29.940
you could feel the tension like to drink and all of a sudden

95
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.570
shot through these colors and lights into like,

96
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.930
what felt like some new place.

97
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.730
What is your physical doing during all of this laying there? Laying there? Yeah.

98
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.460
One time recently, I did it like the last time I did,

99
00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:50.130
it was a couple of years ago. I opened my eyes in the middle of it.

100
00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:53.610
It was very strange. It's like, I can almost see reality,

101
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.430
but it was all real pixelated. And it was like,

102
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.220
I was life through like dirty saran wrap or something.

103
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:06.010
It was all very strange. And then I closed my eyes back and I went into the,

104
00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:10.880
the, the experience of the psychedelic realm is more vivid than regular life,

105
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:14.270
which is real strange. Cause it doesn't feel like you're on a drug.

106
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.540
Cause you're still you. That's another part of it.

107
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:20.630
It doesn't change your like when you're drunk,

108
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.360
it changes the way you think like you think different.

109
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.840
This is not that this is like, you think the same way,

110
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:31.430
but you're being confronted with something that's insanely alien,

111
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.390
just alien to everything that you know, to be true.

112
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.830
And then there's all these things around you that seem to be alive and they seem

113
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.560
to be talking to you and communicating you the last time I did it,

114
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:46.040
it was a bunch of jokers that were giving me the finger, like gestures,

115
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.860
gestures with like, you know, they have the little bells,

116
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.910
they were all like shaking and give me the finger and like spinning around me

117
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:56.510
going, you. They were mocking me. And the,

118
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:00.710
the thing that I got from it was like, oh, I take myself too seriously.

119
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.100
I need to be mocked. And they were mocking me. And as they were mocking me,

120
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.130
I relaxed. And then they, they like pointed at me.

121
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.620
<v 4>Like, ah, you got it, you get it. You get.</v>

122
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.370
<v 3>It. Cause you can, you know, you can get lost. You can take yourself seriously.</v>

123
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:17.090
And you want others to take you. So like, what is the grossest kind of man?

124
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.410
Like the kind of man who wants everyone to tremble. When he walks into a room,

125
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:25.490
once, you know, rose pedals thrown at his feet, he wants everyone to call him,

126
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.510
sir. And be uncomfortable. Everyone would be uncomfortable because he's a man.

127
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.320
Yeah. You know, and that kind of guy responds very poorly to being mocked.

128
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:36.920
Right. So I think that it was like letting me know, like, Hey,

129
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.040
you got a little of that in you. You need to get that out of your system.

130
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.940
Especially as a person who's a professional mocker.

131
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.530
I'm a macro things.

132
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.940
<v 2>Are we are stand up.</v>

133
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:51.380
Mockers there's a lot to be Mo how long does it last for 15 minutes. That's it?

134
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.850
Yes. And what about the micro dosing? That's it?

135
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.150
<v 3>Well, this V this video that you plan, that's kinda, it's kinda like that,</v>

136
00:07:58.151 --> 00:07:59.890
but way more intense.

137
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.540
<v 5>In our experience called Iowasca that you can all have exactly what works.</v>

138
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:06.580
I haven't tried it a different time. Well.

139
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.230
<v 3>It is a no. Um,</v>

140
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.180
see the thing about Iowasca is it lasts longer because it's orally. You,

141
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:17.110
you see that that's probably more similar and you can get there on a

142
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.550
Iowasca and DMT. It's the same thing. It's dimethyltryptamine, it's just,

143
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:26.260
when you're taking it with Iowasca, your body is processing it, uh,

144
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.280
orally, and you take it with, uh, something called an Mao inhibitor.

145
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.110
Mao inhibitor. Mio is a monoamine oxidase that's produced by your gut.

146
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.700
And it processes a DMT naturally that exists in

147
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.670
plants. So like, there's a lot of plants that have DMT in it.

148
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.400
And if you just like, if you were eating grass,

149
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.530
like some sort of [inaudible] grass or something like that,

150
00:08:47.531 --> 00:08:50.860
it's really rich and DMT. So if you were eating, you would get high off,

151
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.970
you would get high as fun, but monoamine oxidase that's produced by your gut.

152
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.130
It breaks that stuff down. So it's not orally active. So if you ate,

153
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.380
if you took some DMT that you would freebase and just ate it,

154
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.840
it wouldn't do anything to you because your gut would break it down.

155
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.680
But then if you took it with an Mao inhibitor, um,

156
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.970
preferably the kind of plant-based Mao inhibitor that they use in Iowasca

157
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:15.540
because they know like th those Mao inhibitors that people take,

158
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:19.110
like sometimes people take them as a medication. Those can be dangerous.

159
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.210
They're they're much more, much more potent.

160
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.020
And there's all sorts of weird side effects. I've heard of people taking, um,

161
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.790
pharmaceutical, Mao inhibitors,

162
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.160
and then they take mushrooms or something else with them.

163
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:31.920
And they really could them up like real bad. Cause.

164
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.290
<v 2>They're, cross-pollinating, they're drug use all.</v>

165
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.730
<v 3>Kinds of wacky to your brain.</v>

166
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:38.850
That your brain is probably not really you're red lining your brain.

167
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.410
Your brain may stay together or you might go shine on you.

168
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.080
Crazy diamond, go on and go off the deep end. Yeah.
