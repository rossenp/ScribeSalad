1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.120
<v 0>Said all right, everybody.</v>

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.480
I need you to poke go to the polls and then everybody

3
00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:11.080
in the audience was like, uh, ditching, you never saw that.

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.360
<v 1>No, now you are, you are, you're a progressive,</v>

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.400
but you're not necessarily a Democrat. Well, I mean,

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.110
you're not necessarily like ins port of anyone. Who's,

7
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:23.710
you're not a loyal Democrat.

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.790
<v 0>So I describe myself as populous left. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

9
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:30.510
that's how I would describe myself. Populist means, you know, I support, uh,

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.350
the policies that would help ordinary people. Um,

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.710
and I vote based on the issues. And so if there's a politician,

12
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.950
that's for the policies I'm for that's who I'm gonna support and that's,

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.940
I'm gonna argue for. Um, so I'm very,

14
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.220
very critical of what we call corporate Democrats,

15
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:50.980
which are Democrats that represent wall street and represent big pharma and, uh,

16
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.540
the military industrial complex and for-profit health insurance companies and,

17
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.740
um, super critical of the Republicans also. So, you know, that's why I,

18
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:00.620
co-founded a group called justice Democrats.

19
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:04.450
And the whole idea was to basically do a populous left takeover,

20
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.610
the democratic party, where you get rid of the cists in the party,

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.770
and you have people who will represent the working class. And, uh,

22
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.570
we've been pretty successful so far. There's still 26, um,

23
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.450
justice Democrats who were in the running and they, uh, can get elected.

24
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090
And there were, here's an amazing fact,

25
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:23.760
there were four politicians and the representatives that didn't take any

26
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:27.440
corporate PAC money, there's about to be 40. Wow.

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.800
And that all happened because of justice Democrats, our revolution,

28
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.360
which is Bernie Sanders group. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh, the P C,

29
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:37.320
which is another left wing organization. And basically what's happening is, uh,

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.960
people on the left who actually care about the substantive issues are standing

31
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:43.590
up and saying, we're not gonna take it anymore.

32
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.270
And we're tired of being lied to by politicians.

33
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.070
And we want people who are gonna actually represent us and represent working

34
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:50.230
people. Yeah.

35
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.230
<v 1>Well, that's, I, I love that.</v>

36
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.310
And I love that approach and there's so much partisan politics and there's so

37
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.470
many people that are just married to the idea of being connected to the

38
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.430
Democrats that they're willing to overlook.

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.540
Some Hane is faults and he old.

40
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.180
<v 0>Blue just won't do as, as Nina Turner says that. And I love that phrase.</v>

41
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.580
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. It, um,

42
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.820
that is a great phrase because it's so just hacky and partisan to be like, oh,

43
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.300
I'm on your team. So are you gonna vote for me here?

44
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.700
Let me do some platitudes and some cliches about how we're stronger together.

45
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.210
And we're gonna break down the barriers and you know, like, well, I don't, uh,

46
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.970
overtly hate minorities. So vote for me. It's like, oh, what a low bar?

47
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.530
Give people something to vote.

48
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.570
<v 1>For. That's a great point. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.370
That way I felt a lot of that during the Hillary Clinton campaign,

50
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.850
everybody was like anything but Trump, so we're gonna vote for her. But boy,

51
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.680
if let's just be honest, if you a viable can like, like.

52
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.760
<v 0>T that's right. T Abert great candy. If you.</v>

53
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.320
<v 1>Had TUL Gabbard and she was running for president,</v>

54
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.120
and she's also a woman and she's also left lane, but she cares about the issues.

55
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.360
She cares about the issues and she's earnest. Yes. Like when you talk to her,

56
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.640
you can tell she just isn't. I mean,

57
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.240
she's careful with her words because she's intelligent.

58
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.720
Not because she's deceptive. Yeah. And I, I would vote for her in a heartbeat.

59
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.760
There you go. I was just, we just messaging each other.

60
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.040
She was messaging me about my Netflix special. And I said, run for president.

61
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.030
<v 0>I want you to run for president. I mean, that would be you wonderful.</v>

62
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.970
I'm slightly.

63
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.750
<v 1>She could win, man. I think she can.</v>

64
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.830
<v 0>But I'm, I think she can win.</v>

65
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.550
I'm slightly butt hurt about Tosey because when I was on your podcast last time

66
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.750
I plugged her talking about how awesome she is. In fact,

67
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.510
I think I'm the one who originally showed you who she was. Right.

68
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.310
Did you know before me and that podcast, many people.

69
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.330
<v 1>Did.</v>

70
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.110
<v 0>So you had heard about her. Well, anyway, she.</v>

71
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.943
<v 1>Comes on the show.</v>

72
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.180
<v 0>Definitely one of them though, she comes on the show and talks about yeah,</v>

73
00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:44.300
new media's, uh, awesome. And there's a lot of great new media people out there.

74
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.020
She goes, Jimmy do, and then there's a pause.

75
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.060
And then you move on to the next topic. And I'm like, God, toey.

76
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.500
&lt;laugh&gt; I plugged you plug me, forgot, bro. I know. Let that go.

77
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.300
I'm being incredibly petty. And I don't even really mean what I'm saying.

78
00:03:56.301 --> 00:04:00.010
Cause I would still support her as a politician. 100% it bro,

79
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.650
this is some salt and it's headed your way. Tosey.

80
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.050
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; she'll remember now. No.</v>

81
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.970
<v 0>But she's great. She's great on the issues and um, yeah.</v>

82
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.410
<v 1>She's a genuine person. That's what, that's what I got outta her.</v>

83
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.730
Like what I got from talking to her, she's a genuine person and man, I mean,

84
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.570
maybe it's because she's from Hawaii and it's just a different place. It's like,

85
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.640
it's almost like a state. That's a small town. I mean, that's,

86
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.640
Hawaii's very small. Yeah. I mean, there's a million people in Honolulu,

87
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.560
but you get outside of Honolulu.

88
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.800
There's only a hundred thousand on the big island. Yeah.

89
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.600
I don't know how many Maui has, but I think it's only got a couple hundred.

90
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.680
<v 0>Thousand. I've never been to Hawaii before. Oh, it's great.</v>

91
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.600
It looks like a paradise. I mean, dude, the.

92
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.670
<v 1>Best is Lena. If you want to go somewhere and just chill ax,</v>

93
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.710
there's a four seasons in NY.

94
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.590
The entire island has 3000 people living on it. Oh wow. Wow.

95
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:54.670
It's great. And you get real island Hawaiians. Sure.

96
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:58.550
Like they're not like if you go to Maui, they're wonderful people.

97
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.220
They're great. But they've been groomed. You know what I'm saying?

98
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.140
Like people have taught them how to talk like regular white people &lt;laugh&gt;

99
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.860
whereas in, I mean, NY, they're just chilled out man.

100
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.060
And they just, they have that way of talking, you know,

101
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:19.060
they talk and you know what pigeon is? No, it's a real interesting sort of,

102
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.410
uh, I guess it's like a die elect of English. You would call it,

103
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.530
but they have really cool expressions. Like some, if, if they,

104
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:31.330
they say a lot of things, it would be choke. Like, uh,

105
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.810
like if you talk about like,

106
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.730
like a guy was explaining to me how many deer there were in this one place,

107
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.890
he goes, oh its a choke deer. There was choke deer.

108
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.960
<v 0>So it's kind of like a broken English with different words, sprinkled. That's.</v>

109
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
<v 1>Interesting. They use different words for different things.</v>

110
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:46.600
You'd have to be around them all the time.

111
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.040
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but there's also like a, just a way of talking.

112
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.440
That's like very, very interesting.

113
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.720
<v 0>That's kind of like, I think it's called Padua. Maybe it's called.</v>

114
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.040
I think it's uh, people who are Jamaican who speak in English,

115
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:00.320
but it's very broken English.

116
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 1>Yeah. Probably real similar. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.440
<v 0>And they love to.</v>

118
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.280
<v 1>Say Bumba clot. What does that mean? Blood clot.</v>

119
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.120
<v 0>I think Bumba clot. I think that's what it means. Right? Blood clot. I know.</v>

120
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:11.240
They also say blood clot.

121
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.320
<v 1>They say blood clot a lot. I think so. Yeah. That should come up. Very rarely.</v>

122
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.750
&lt;laugh&gt; well blood. I mean it's unless you're a doctor, I.

123
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.830
<v 0>Guess it's a way of saying stuff, you know something's terrible.</v>

124
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.310
It means or oh mother bag. That's what Buba clot means. Yeah.

125
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.390
Oh I was so you're even.

126
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.390
<v 1>Close. You're the whitest guy that's ever been in.</v>

127
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.350
<v 0>His room. I I guess, I guess the technical meaning would be blood clot.</v>

128
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:33.510
It's basically blood CLO blood clot. It's a medical term.

129
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.060
<v 1>Basically talking about sutures. Yeah. It's funny. Yeah.</v>

130
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.860
<v 0>But that, that flight to Hawaii must be, it's.</v>

131
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.700
<v 1>Not bad. It's five hours.</v>

132
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.580
<v 0>Oh, from here it's five hours. I'm coming from New York. Dude.</v>

133
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.500
<v 1>You fly here, you hang out for a couple days and you fly there. I gotta.</v>

134
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.780
<v 2>Interject again. The uh,</v>

135
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.220
top definition on urban dictionary says it's a cloth rag used to wipe one's anal

136
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:54.580
region. Oh, oh obviously.

137
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.180
<v 0>That was my second guess. &lt;laugh&gt; it'll be the BU.</v>

138
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.650
<v 1>But like a ALO with so Bulo was like cloth.</v>

139
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.570
wiping his. He's a cloth. Yeah. Like you'd call some of the bag, the cloth,

140
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.810
the wipe a but as a.

141
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.890
<v 2>As a word to replace, like or.</v>

142
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.970
<v 1>Or something like that. He's an wipe. Yeah. Right. That's mean that it's coffee.</v>

143
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:17.490
Blast wipes. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't heard that one. Wow.

144
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.040
When's the last time you heard an wipe? Butt wipe.

145
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.200
<v 0>I haven't heard that in a long.</v>

146
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.800
<v 1>Time. Yeah. White. When was class? That's like B Butthead. Yeah. Days.</v>

147
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.080
You're such a butt wipe. Wipe &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Um, anyway,

148
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:30.900
you're white.

149
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.320
<v 0>Yes. Very much so. &lt;laugh&gt; that's clear. People can see that.</v>

150
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.510
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; when you look at the potential candidates for 2020. Yep.</v>

151
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.230
Um, who, uh, on the left stands out. Is Gavin Newsom, is he gonna run?

152
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.630
<v 0>No, he's just too. He comes across as a little too. Politicy and smarmy. Ah.</v>

153
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.150
That's.

154
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.750
<v 1>How he striked me to you. You don't like him?</v>

155
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.631
<v 0>No. I mean,</v>

156
00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:53.750
I'm sure if I had a conversation with him and we spoke about the issues,

157
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.390
I would agree with him on most of the positions,

158
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.590
but I don't know if he really believes it and means it because he's a

159
00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:01.220
politician, right. There are politicians, real politicians. Yes.

160
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:02.340
They're politicians who I talk to.

161
00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:05.940
And I know that they mean it Tosey Gabbard would be one of those roun would be

162
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:08.980
another one of those. We spoke about him on the show. Last time I was here. Um,

163
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:11.580
obviously Bernie Sanders is another one of those. You know,

164
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:14.660
there's a really interesting politician coming out of, uh, West Virginia. Now,

165
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.620
I don't know if you heard about this guy,

166
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:19.810
his name's Richard O Jetta and he's running against a Republican named Carol

167
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.130
Miller. Get this he's running in west. Virginia is super deep red.

168
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.890
Like mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; big time Republican,

169
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.210
almost the most Republican it's tied probably with Mississippi as the most repo

170
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:30.850
conservative area in the country.

171
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.530
So this district Trump won by 49 points.

172
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.850
There's this Democrat Richard O Jetta running he's up in a poll against

173
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.720
public by five points. Wow. So you're probably thinking how the hell in a,

174
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:47.040
you know, a district like that can a Democrat be leading.

175
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.440
And the answer is very simple.

176
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.520
He's populist and he's fighting for working people and he's run these amazing

177
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.320
ads where he literally gave out his phone number in one of the ads and said,

178
00:08:56.321 --> 00:08:58.400
listen, if you're a constituent of mine and you have an issue,

179
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.560
call me and I'll tell you what, if a lobbyist tries to come into my office,

180
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.920
I'm gonna kick him out. I don't want you in my office.

181
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.280
I don't care about lobbyists.

182
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.480
I care about the people and he is running on all substantive issues.

183
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.960
He's taking no corporate PAC money. He's for Medicare for all.

184
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.320
So this is a guy who, you know, and by the way,

185
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:17.310
he's a veteran in Afghanistan and he's yes.

186
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.510
And he did vote for Trump. And now he's one of Trump's harshest critics.

187
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.390
And he said, listen, man,

188
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.750
I thought Trump was gonna be potentially good for working people,

189
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.710
but it just turns out he wasn't good for working people. So for example,

190
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.830
Trump ran as an anti outsourcing president.

191
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.350
He was against NAFTA and TPP and all that stuff in Trump's first year's

192
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:37.220
president, there were 93,000 jobs that were outsourced.

193
00:09:37.221 --> 00:09:40.380
That's even worse than Obama. Obama had 87,000 jobs outsourced.

194
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.660
So when you go through his record with a fine tooth comb,

195
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:44.140
even like the unemployment rate being low,

196
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.900
that's totally misleading because wages are falling. So if wages are falling,

197
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.340
you can't just brag about your economy being wonderful. And his tax bill,

198
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:54.060
83% of the benefits of the tax bill went to the top 1%.
