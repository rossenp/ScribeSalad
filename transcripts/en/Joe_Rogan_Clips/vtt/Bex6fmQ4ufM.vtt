00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 2>So tell me about your past. Like what, what about like, when you're saying,</v>

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.030
going through the system, you mean the judicial system? Like what,

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:10.530
what about your past was a.

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.280
<v 0>Yeah, I've been like in prison, stuff like that,</v>

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
that three and a half years in prison. For what? For assault?

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.820
Aggravated assault straight.

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.433
<v 1>That's weird.</v>

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.993
<v 0>Oh.</v>

10
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.770
<v 1>I'm.</v>

11
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.050
<v 0>Kidding. Well, you should've been at my courthouse.</v>

12
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.930
You should've been in talking, telling them to the judge.

13
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.440
I would have said that.

14
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.260
<v 1>To the judge, your honor. I think, I think this is a mistake. Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.713
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
<v 1>So three and a half years for that. And so people wrote you off,</v>

17
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.930
they felt like this is just, you're just going to be trouble your whole life.

18
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.450
<v 0>Yeah. Especially I had a full scholarship. I was already, I played the year.</v>

19
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.880
I ended up getting probation for that.

20
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.930
I ended up playing a year of college at Kilgore dream college.

21
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.310
And I ended up violating because I didn't have a job.

22
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.960
And I had to pay my fines and fees and show up to my own

23
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.010
meetings, which no one wanted to help me on to do.

24
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.590
And so I ended up getting violated, um, from that.

25
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.140
And it was only a two year probation at the time justification.

26
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:21.140
And so no one wanted to help me go to my class and

27
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.230
help me pay my fines and stuff like that because I was in college, you know,

28
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.160
didn't have any money. And so they violated me.

29
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:31.950
I went to prison for on a five-year sentence,

30
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.650
but I got parole three and a half years.

31
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.130
<v 1>So you went to prison because of the violation of not paying the fines. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.630
The, the, the feeling of being counted out by the system,

33
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.460
that's one of the main problems that most people have with our justice system.

34
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.190
They said it doesn't really rehabilitate people.

35
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.200
It makes people feel like there's no hope.

36
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.610
And in a lot of ways it makes them resign themselves to a life of crime.

37
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.810
<v 0>Oh yeah. Yeah. Then it's really nothing. No, nothing.</v>

38
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:05.460
They could really do to help somebody to re rehabilitate theirself. You know,

39
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.900
whenever they get out, there's no programs. They can really like jobs and stuff,

40
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.940
some jobs, but not really good paying jobs like that.

41
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.490
They really need to really survive out here.

42
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.770
<v 1>From going from that to becoming a successful martial artist.</v>

43
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.610
Like, and to be in, I know you don't think you practice martial arts,

44
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:31.260
but you definitely do to be a successful fighter. You've, you've,

45
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.420
uh, you've changed your future.

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.250
But I think you've also opened up a lot of people's eyes that maybe they can

47
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:41.040
change their future too, for guy like you can do it,

48
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.220
then what's the difference between you and a lot of other people.

49
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:45.054
Not much difference.

50
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.840
<v 0>Yes.</v>

51
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.840
My brother remind me of that all the time thinks he thinking that

52
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.030
the fighting is so easy because I could do it,

53
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:56.850
that he believed that he could do it. I'm telling you it's completely different.

54
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.470
It's not, it's your brother. Yeah. He's big. Yeah.

55
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.843
<v 1>Can you fight.</v>

56
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.710
<v 0>Where you can find it in the streets? You know,</v>

57
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.340
it's completely different fighting in the streets, mixed martial arts, but yeah,

58
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.200
in the streets he could fight. How old is your brother?

59
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.370
<v 1>31. I'm recruiting them right now. How much does he weigh? What is he?</v>

60
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.030
Where's he.

61
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.040
<v 0>At? Oh, there we go.</v>

62
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.900
My buddy shark though. You show you like five.

63
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.450
<v 1>10 [Inaudible] yeah.</v>

64
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.613
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.740
<v 1>You can be short and still be the heavyweight champion of the world. I mean,</v>

66
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:33.730
Mike Tyson too, you know? Yeah. But he's a,

67
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.930
is he interested in doing it?

68
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.580
<v 0>Yeah, he is. But, um, I told him, no, you're not doing it.</v>

69
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.140
<v 1>Really. Yeah. Why?</v>

70
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.340
<v 0>Because my brother too ghetto, first of all,</v>

71
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.050
they wouldn't the world wouldn't be able to handle someone like him really.

72
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.880
He's too outspoken. And he's real ghetto.

73
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.240
<v 1>Man. I don't know if you can tell him to tone it down a little bit.</v>

74
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.190
<v 0>I tell him that every day,</v>

75
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.030
whenever I talked to him and he always go on live and just want to be ghetto all

76
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:04.810
the time. So he can't be doing that. You gotta learn how to turn it off and on.

77
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.770
And he's like, no.

78
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.600
<v 1>It's weird. being famous, isn't it? Oh yeah. Yeah. But for you,</v>

79
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:13.990
I mean to, to come from being incarcerated,

80
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.790
not having a hope into being in this position now. And I mean,

81
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.000
I can only imagine it's gotta be completely surreal.

82
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.430
<v 0>Surreal. That's what I said. It's like,</v>

83
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.750
I really don't need to get high on nothing or drink anything,

84
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.100
but it's cool that it's a plus you know, the smoke a little weed here and there.

85
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.340
<v 1>Yeah. Relax. Yeah. Took the edge off.</v>

86
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.120
But does it give you more motivation to keep pushing to,

87
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:43.180
because you realize that what has been possible? I mean, you've,

88
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.190
you've done an amazing thing with your life.

89
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.810
<v 0>Yeah. So they gave me a lot of motivations. Um, like,</v>

90
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.490
cause I know how easy it is to slip up and go back into those situations.

91
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.430
Cause it was nothing but a street fight banded.

92
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:01.570
It ended bad for the guy I was going against and

93
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.940
ended up having to serve almost five years for. So it could still happen.

94
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.600
I can walk out of here and get into a street, fight with someone and be,

95
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.900
probably be way worse situation. You know?

96
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.790
<v 1>I think you got better lawyers now I think,</v>

97
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.880
but you're not, uh, you're, you're an easy going guy.

98
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.340
<v 0>Now.</v>

99
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.420
<v 1>But you weren't back then.</v>

100
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.220
<v 0>Then I was just, I think I had a lot of anger built up in me.</v>

101
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.150
I wish I still do now. But back then it was a lot more,

102
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.180
um, I believe it was just the way I was raised. You know,

103
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.360
wasn't showed that much love, you know,

104
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:47.340
in my household and just the family circle, you know,

105
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:51.430
I believe that's what led to a lot of my trouble in the streets.

106
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.170
<v 1>That's a lot of young man. Yeah. Do you feel like, um,</v>

107
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.130
you have a second chance with your children to show them love because you didn't

108
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:02.450
get that kind of love when you were younger.

109
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.310
<v 0>Oh yeah, for sure. You know,</v>

110
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.650
my kids is like completely different than how I was raised. You know,

111
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.150
I'm so happy that they're like making straight A's in school and making the

112
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:15.560
honor roll every, uh,

113
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.810
every year and getting already getting scholarships and stuff like that to go to

114
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.080
big colleges. And so it's like already,

115
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.350
as my life is already unbelievable as it is.

116
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:31.850
And just seeing that that's like making me so proud, so proud.

117
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.520
<v 1>That's amazing, man. That's what everybody wants. Right.</v>

118
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.360
What everybody wants is like a happy life where it all comes together.

119
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.880
And I think with a person like you,

120
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.190
you really appreciate it because it wasn't always like this.

121
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.170
<v 0>So I, I, I tell people all the time, I don't regret.</v>

122
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.710
I don't wish nothing like that. What happened?

123
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.240
I believe that I had to go through that situation to be a better person than I

124
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:59.060
am today. So it was like raising,

125
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.770
being raised without a father figure and stuff like that. I felt like to me,

126
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.630
everyone is different to me.

127
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:09.350
I felt like I had to go through that situation to be a better father,

128
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:11.960
be a better man here today. Because if not,

129
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.770
then I for sure would have been going in and out of there, you know.
