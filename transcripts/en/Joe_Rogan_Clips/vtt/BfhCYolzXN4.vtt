00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.543
<v 2>Tell me what you got there.</v>

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.521
<v 1>Yeah. In, you know,</v>

4
00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.280
talking about bear grease and trying to connect it to a podcast. I mean,

5
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.000
at some point I'll have to explain the metaphor of bear grease

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.680
what's explaining now. Well,

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.200
so bear grease at one time was this highly valued commodity,

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.790
I mean, use as a, a unit of currency on the American frontier and,

9
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.070
and, and bear, bear grease,

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.870
bear oil would be the rendered fat of a bear that would turned into liquid like

11
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:34.550
this right here. So this is, is for you. Thank you. Have you ever,

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.310
have you ever had, I mean, I know you've bear hunted,

13
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:38.150
but have you had bear grease before? No, I've.

14
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.780
<v 0>Only I've eaten bear. I've never rendered bear or cooked anything in bare fat.</v>

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.460
I've only just taken the meat and, and cooked it. Yeah. Usually.

16
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.780
<v 1>Slow cooking. So what you would do with that is you would cook with it.</v>

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.460
You would fry with it. You could make pastries with it.

18
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.780
You can use it to condition leather. You can use it.

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.773
It's supposed to be amazing.

20
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.100
<v 0>Condition pastries, right. For like it is.</v>

21
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.340
<v 1>Pie crust. Yep.</v>

22
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.690
And so there was a time when bear grease Bayard was

23
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:09.010
super valuable on the frontier before refrigeration, because bear fat stayed.

24
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.250
Didn't go ranted as quickly as pork. So like on the,

25
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.690
you would have pork and bear would be essentially the places where you would get

26
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:18.770
it. This lasted longer.

27
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.560
That'll lot last on the shelf at your house on refrigerated for

28
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.200
over.

29
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.240
<v 0>A year. Why is it, why does it last so.</v>

30
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.040
<v 1>Much longer? Just it just whatever the constituency of Bayard is,</v>

31
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.000
it just stays good for that long.

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.840
So going back to this metaphor of the name of bear grease in our podcast,

33
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.990
we're, we're exploring things. And even in the, in the, in the, in the,

34
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.950
you know, the, the tagline of the podcast,

35
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.590
we say that we're exploring thing or things that are forgotten but relevant.

36
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.550
And we're searching for insight in unlikely places. And so like this bear,

37
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.910
bear grease, I brought you some stuff that you can do with bear grease. This is,

38
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.950
uh, this is some bare fat li soap.

39
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.300
If have you ever used animal tall soap? No. Like just for like bathing,

40
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.380
washing your hands. I don't have man. That's incredible stuff. Yeah.

41
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.660
It really is a hundred percent all natural. I mean, it's, it's, it's a,

42
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.500
it's a ancient process of using lie and animal tall. What is lie? Exactly.

43
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.090
Lie is, um, Diagon, if you hadn't asked it's, I mean, it's a,

44
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.690
it's a chemical,

45
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.490
it's a caustic chemical that you can buy just about anywhere, but, uh,

46
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.650
shoot. How did used like H two something, something that they used to use Ash.

47
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.370
Oh, they used, they, they got the lie from Ash. There it is. And, uh,

48
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.873
uh.

49
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.640
<v 0>It's a metal hydroxide traditionally obtained by leaching wood</v>

50
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.560
ashes. Yeah. Or a strong alkaline, which is highly soluble in water, producing.

51
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.400
<v 1>Caustic in AOA solutions, sodium sodium hydroxide. That's what, what it is.</v>

52
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.840
So they would get it from like burning wood. Yeah. So they, they,

53
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.600
the real primitive method for making soap from, from animal tall.

54
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.040
And you could use, you could make animal tall soap out of beef towel,

55
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.080
anything but bare fat lie soap is, uh, is,

56
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.950
is our specialty not, but it, um, it's,

57
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.270
it's supposed to be real good for your skin. It's you know,

58
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.070
because do you sell this no hour, especially you never sell it. Just give away.

59
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.070
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not, not for sale,

60
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.350
but did you make this? Yeah. Yeah. And so what are the, what's the ingredients?

61
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.630
So just lie and four ingredients,

62
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.580
bare fat sodium hydroxide, lie water, and then just essential oils.

63
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.540
We just food smell. Yeah. Yeah. So it smell, smell, smell good.

64
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.420
What are the essential oils smell? Like? One of them,

65
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.820
we had a bunch of different kind of oils that we added in like peppermint,

66
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.220
whatever. I don't know. Sometimes I'm amazed at how, uh, you know,

67
00:03:56.221 --> 00:04:00.170
kind of like hygiene conscious that bear hunters are like making so open stuff,

68
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.290
because the other thing I brought you, Joe, and I know you don't, you don't,

69
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.410
you don't run a beard, but, uh, this is some bear grease beard oil. Oh.

70
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.370
That I made. And so that is a combination of three things.

71
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.530
So it's, it's cheating just a little bit, but it's, it's,

72
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.130
it's one part barrel oil, one part almond oil,

73
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.920
one part ha Hoba oil and then essential oils. And I mean,

74
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:27.640
you can drip it out, put it on your hands and um, Ooh, that smells good.

75
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.680
Yeah. It's interesting. And then the last one here,

76
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.080
and then I'll start talking about my metaphor again, if, if you're, if you want,

77
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.360
but this is a bear grease hand Sal.

78
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.630
And so oil has all kind of folklore around it.

79
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.830
And I'm in the process of like an anecdotal research,

80
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.190
very serious project of exploring all these folk tales of

81
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.190
bear grease and bear oil. And so it's healing properties. Yeah. Yeah. They,

82
00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:01.380
they say, I mean, back in the day bear oil,

83
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:06.100
would've been used to relieve arthritis, pain. Um, they say,

84
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.580
and you can find this all over the internet that bear oil cures, baldness,

85
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.900
which obviously is like a big piece of folklore. Right.

86
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.140
But it's still just fun.

87
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.010
But going back to the idea that bear grease has all these uses in is that

88
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.490
this is thing that at one time was the currency.

89
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.130
And if you poll the United States 330 million Americans, and you said,

90
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.570
what is bear grease?

91
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.050
I mean like what percentage of people would even know what it was probably like

92
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.090
1% of 1%. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's been forgotten.

93
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.920
And so there was a time when,

94
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.320
so there's an archaic unit of measure of a barrel.

95
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.040
They used to take the tanned neck hide of a deer,

96
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.000
which would've been a part of the,

97
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.480
the buck skin that wasn't usable the neck hide and they would've sewed it

98
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.720
together and they would've used it to have stored bear oil and they called it

99
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:05.040
an eel. And I.

100
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.200
<v 0>So they would make a container out of it, like a.</v>

101
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.880
<v 1>A contain almost an eel of bear oil. Huh. And it's just a wonder,</v>

102
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.640
spell it like eel. Well, it it's, you know,

103
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.430
it's been probably 10 years since they've actually seen it written it's I think

104
00:06:17.431 --> 00:06:21.190
it's E L L E like, oh, um,

105
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.550
an E of, of barrel oil. Would've been a unit of measurement.

106
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.670
So like you could have gone to the store and you're like, well,

107
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:31.710
I got two ills bear oil, you know, I'd like some flour. I'd like some whatever.

108
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.950
Wow. And, uh, you know, it's just,

109
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.140
it's a wonder that we don't call the us dollar, you know, and E just you,

110
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.780
what I'm saying,

111
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.380
cause the buck is essentially connected to the value of

112
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.420
a Whitetail deer skin that was tanned out and ready for tanning.

113
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.580
And that became equivalent to a buck for $1 for $1. Wow.

114
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.020
And so, so again,

115
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.020
this idea that there's some pretty amazing stuff that's forgotten.

116
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.770
And then as hunter is,

117
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.570
we're very interested in using as much as we can from these animals

118
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.890
that we're taking very interested in that.

119
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.170
And so a bear offers a whole nother market of

120
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:15.970
commodity that really no other big game offers in that you know, of,

121
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.360
of the big game that we hunt. Like let's say an elk. I mean like, you know,

122
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:21.800
you're gonna, you're gonna keep the meat.

123
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:25.040
Obviously that's the number one thing you're gonna keep his horns,

124
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.080
but very few people would even keep the height of that animal.

125
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.240
And certainly they're not rendering down elk tall Whitetail deer would have the

126
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:39.030
same sequence of usable commodities, man, a black bear.

127
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.750
We have incredible meat. We,

128
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.350
I would, I would venture to say that 90%,

129
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.190
maybe 80% of black bears that are killed in north America,

130
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:56.350
their hides are tanned. They have usually,

131
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.990
especially in the fall will have an incredible amount of fat,

132
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.300
which can be rendered down into all these incredible, healthy, usable products.

133
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.980
And, uh, and so, I mean, like we have,

134
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.220
we use my point is we use more off a,

135
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.460
of a bear than we do almost any other big game animal that we hunt.
