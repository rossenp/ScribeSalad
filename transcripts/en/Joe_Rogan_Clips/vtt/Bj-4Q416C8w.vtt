1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So, um, I want it to, uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.140
to meet the, uh, I'll start in Maryland, where I live.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.090
I want to start with the clan leader from Maryland.

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.900
You could have several different clan groups in the same state and they are

5
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:16.920
rivals with each other.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.250
And you can have chapters of those same fandoms within your state.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.710
So this guy named Roger Kelly was the grand dragon for the state of

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.960
Maryland for this guys clan group.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.590
And Roger Kelly at the time had the largest Klan group in Maryland.

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.923
<v 1>How many members.</v>

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.330
<v 0>They don't give out numbers, but, uh, Roger had probably just over 200,</v>

12
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.100
which is a very high number for that time period.

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.690
Um, sometimes it's only, they only have 10 members, some, you know,

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.600
to have an internet presence, but only one guy that's sitting in his basement,

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.190
you know, putting out something. But, uh, anyway, this guy didn't,

16
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.470
I want him to introduce me to Roger Kelly. I want,

17
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.790
I want Roger to be my first interview. And he was terrified. He said, no,

18
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.940
I can't do it, Darryl. We both get in trouble. I said,

19
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.920
but you're not in the plan anymore. Is it doesn't matter?

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.990
I can not take a black man to the grand dragon.

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.940
So he was concerned genuinely from my safety as well as his own.

22
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.793
And I said, well, look,

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.490
why don't you give me Mr. Kelly's address and phone number. And, um,

24
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.430
I will go to his house and talk to him. He would not do that.

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.190
I begged and pleaded for 20 minutes.

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.840
He finally gave me Mr. Kelly's address and phone number on the condition

27
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.210
that I not tell Mr. Kelly, where I got it. And I said, okay, then he warned me.

28
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.044
He said, Darrell.

29
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.750
<v 2>Well, that guy could crack under pressure. Yeah. Oh yeah. A lot.</v>

30
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.740
<v 0>Of them. Oh, I wanted to tell you why, why he got banished. Okay.</v>

31
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.650
But that's coming, that's coming later. He warned you. Yeah. He warned me.

32
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.190
And he said, Darryl, do not do that little ride to Kelly's house.

33
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.020
He'll kill you. And then he said, there's a bar up in Thurmont, Maryland.

34
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.710
Now, you know, Thurmont, Maryland. Uh, you don't know it for the clan,

35
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.130
but that was one of their headquarters, you know, Thurmont, Maryland,

36
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:06.440
because it's also the home of camp, David, the presidential retreat and,

37
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.610
and the headquarters for the class right there, right down the road.

38
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.420
That's hilarious. Yeah. And Thermo at the time was an all white town.

39
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.520
Anytime a black person moved in or interracial couple or a gay couple,

40
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.440
somehow mysteriously across will be burned in the yard and boom,

41
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.170
they move right out. Now. That is not,

42
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.760
that does not mean that every person in Vermont is in the clamp because they're

43
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.360
not in fact, most white people up there wanted the clan gone,

44
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.930
but that's where it was headquartered. So, um,

45
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.500
he said there was a bar up there where they hang out every Saturday night.

46
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.780
And if I go to that bar, I'm sure to find Roger Kelly and, um,

47
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.690
you know, unless you're out of town rallying somewhere, he says,

48
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:51.600
but I don't guarantee you that Roger will even talk to you,

49
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.180
but you're safer to approach them in a public place.

50
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.130
Then I'm going to his property.

51
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.490
<v 2>Did he give you a photograph of him? How'd you find know? No, I.</v>

52
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.720
<v 0>Knew Roger Kelly looked like, cause he was always in the newspaper on the news,</v>

53
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.810
you know, being interviewed, something like that. I never met him, but I knew,

54
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.760
you know, his image. So he drew me a little map, how to get to this place.

55
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.190
And so it's on Saturday night, we turned that thing off and um, he,

56
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.050
uh, he says, um.

57
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.450
<v 1>Uh, do not, um.</v>

58
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.930
<v 0>Do not, you know, approach on his own property. I said, all right. So</v>

59
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.570
I, you know, I'm a musician I'm working Saturday nights. I can't go, you know,

60
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:37.680
go chasing the Klan on Saturday nights. So to hobby. Yeah.

61
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.640
So at that point it wasn't as a full-time profession. Um,

62
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
I called my secretary who books, my band. I said, you know,

63
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.230
do I have any Sundays off? I figured Sunday is still part of the weekend.

64
00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:51.720
Maybe hangs out there on a Sunday too. She said,

65
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:54.060
she found me a couple of Sundays. And I said, okay,

66
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:56.670
I'm going to go find this Roger Kelly Guy. She goes, well,

67
00:03:56.671 --> 00:04:00.390
I want to go with you now. Here's the problem. She's white.

68
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.070
Not that I have a problem with that.

69
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.340
But a black man with a white woman walking into a clan bar.

70
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.743
<v 2>Could be more of a.</v>

71
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.940
<v 0>You might find them sooner than you want. So, um, I said, I said, you know,</v>

72
00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:14.280
Mary? And she said, no, no, I want to go. I said, all right, you know,

73
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:17.400
you go at your own risk. She said, all right. So we drove up there,

74
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:19.890
this particular, Sunday evenings, about an hour and a half from my house.

75
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.540
And my guy gave me perfect directions. There's the place right there. Boom.

76
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.280
We locked the car, walk up these steps. And I told her, I said, look,

77
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.840
I'm going to walk in first. You, you walked right in behind me.

78
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.030
If I turn around and face, you start running and I'll be behind you.

79
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.980
And she says, all right, let's go.

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.080
So we walk in about seven 30 on a Sunday evening place

81
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:47.280
was practically empty.

82
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.490
I would say maybe no more than six or seven people in there.

83
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.200
A couple of guys in the back playing pool, a guy or two sitting at the bar.

84
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.310
And the guy had told me that this was a clan bar.

85
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.310
And what he meant by clan bar is the plant doesn't own it.

86
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.400
That's where they hang out and he'd, he described it to me.

87
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.780
Then when you walk in the door to your left would be a row of booths.

88
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.710
And the first two booths closest to the door when you come in,

89
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.060
are reserved for the clan. So, uh,

90
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.530
I looked over there and nobody was sitting there. So I'm looking around,

91
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:26.130
see if I recognize Roger Kelly. And I didn't see anybody that looked like him,

92
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.120
which did not mean that some of these people weren't clan. Um,

93
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.510
but I figured out what, and to my right was a, um,

94
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.820
a long bar behind the bar was a mirror and scotch taped to the

95
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.860
mirror was a picture,

96
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.020
an article from the Washington post newspaper had a picture of Roger Kelly.

97
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.120
They'd interviewed him about something. He,

98
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.340
the NAACP was suing them over some kind of cross burning ceremony or

99
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:57.230
something. And I recognize the article. I said, wow. Yeah.

100
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.690
And there's a big Confederate flag on the back wall.

101
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.870
Like you have the U S flag right there. Um,

102
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.800
so I knew I was in the right place or the wrong place,

103
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.030
but now you want to look at it. Right? So, uh,

104
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.890
I didn't see anybody who looked like Roger Kelly. I figured, no,

105
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.710
I drove an hour and a half to get up here. You know,

106
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:17.990
I don't want to go home empty handed,

107
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.150
but I didn't want to just walk up to somebody and say, Hey, excuse me, sir,

108
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.720
are you in the clan? So I said, you know,

109
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.090
Mary and I are standing in the middle of this bar,

110
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.310
basically looking stupid and not knowing what to do. So I said, come on, Mary,

111
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.340
let's go over there and sit. And one of those first two booths,

112
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.100
because if the plan is in here,

113
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.690
they will come to us and then we'll know, and then we can ask them, Hey,

114
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.400
you know, we want to see Roger Kelly. So we went over there and sat down.

115
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.020
Nobody bothered us. Everything was cool. Eventually we migrated over to the bar.

116
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.010
I chatted up the guy sitting next to me, like I was lost in some directions.

117
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.990
Very nice gave me directions. We failed. So we left.

118
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.260
Um, the next morning, Mary walked out of my house.

119
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.340
I gave her a Roger Kelly's number Monday morning. I said, give him a call.

120
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.541
I said,

121
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:14.870
tell him that you're working for somebody who's writing a book on the clan.

122
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.460
Would he consent to sitting down with your boss and give him an interview?

123
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.590
However, do not tell Mr. Kelly that I'm black.

124
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.820
If he asks, you know, don't lie to him, but don't allude to it.

125
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:33.530
Don't give him reason to be curious. She understood. And the reason why,

126
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.140
um, I did not want him to know that was a,

127
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.660
I figured, you know, if he knew that, um, he meant I gave you the interview,

128
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.570
but if you agree to do the interview,

129
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.460
then obviously he would see that I'm black. When he,

130
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.010
when he meets me and he could decide right then and there,

131
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.690
if he wants to continue it or not. But I want him to see me first. And secondly,

132
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.140
um, if he agreed to do the interview, knowing that I was black,

133
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.060
he may have different answers prepared in the interim than he would have for a

134
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.520
white interviewer, as opposed to a black interviewer.

135
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.590
So I want it to be spontaneous, candid.

136
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.300
So she understood and that she called him and he agreed to do the interview.

137
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.060
So we set it up for the motel above the silver dollar lounge up

138
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:24.800
there in Frederick, Maryland at five 15 on a Sunday afternoon. And, uh,

139
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.360
Mary and I got there, oh man, I don't know, several hours early.

140
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.880
Um, I gave her some money,

141
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.210
sent her down the hall to get us a soda pop out of the machine,

142
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.070
put it in the ice bucket, fill it with ice, get it all cold. Uh, so I, you know,

143
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:44.570
I could, I could offer, um, Mr. Kelly, a beverage, a cold beverage.

144
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.610
I had no idea what this man would do once he laid eyes on me and saw that I was

145
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:54.110
black, we come in the room. Would he attack me? Or would he walk away?

146
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.830
You know? But in the event I want to be hospitable. So she got the soda pop,

147
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.470
put ice buckets set on the dresser. Now

148
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.420
just by happenstance, the way the room is laid out.

149
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.840
If you are standing in the hallway, in the doorway of the room,

150
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.990
looking into the room, you can not see who's in the room.

151
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.380
You have to literally walk in the door and turn to your right.

152
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.450
And the room was laid out back there.

153
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.170
So there's no way you can know who's in the room, standing in the hallway.

154
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.390
And so I took advantage of that.

155
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.740
I took the lamp table to the lamp off and put it in the most obscure corner of

156
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:29.574
the room.

157
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.930
I put a chair on one side for me and a chair on the other side for Mr. Kelly.

158
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.000
And I had a little bag beside me like duffel bag. And in my bag,

159
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.300
I had a cassette recorder, blank cassette tapes,

160
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.460
and a copy of the Bible because the two Klux Klan claims to be a

161
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.660
Christian organization.

162
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.520
And they claim that the Bible preaches racial separation.

163
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.600
Now I've read through the Bible. I've never seen that in there.

164
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.620
So I want to be able to pull up my Bible when he brings it up and say here,

165
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.800
Mr. Kelly, show me please in this king James version,

166
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.770
chapter and verse where it says blacks and whites must

167
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:15.330
be separate. So I'm all prepared, right? Right on time at five 15,

168
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.513
knock on the door.

169
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.310
I'm seated there where you can't see me until you come in the room,

170
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.590
Mary hops up. And by the way, Mary's white. And, uh, as I,

171
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.290
as I mentioned before, so she goes around the corner,

172
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.870
opens the door and walks.

173
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:35.670
What is known as the grand Nighthawk Nighthawk in clan terminology means

174
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.400
body guard security. So a grand night Hawk, good names.

175
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.620
<v 2>The names is so ridiculous. Cyclops is treads and wizards. It goes on and on.</v>

176
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.220
It goes on. Of course, a grand club.

177
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.240
<v 0>Ran clubby by all kinds of stuff. Anyway.</v>

178
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.630
So the grand Knight Hawk, which means slightly guarded the grand dragon,

179
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.030
like an Imperial Nighthawk,

180
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.640
be the bodyguard to the Imperial wizard in walks into this grand Nighthawk.

181
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.660
He's wearing military camouflage. And, uh,

182
00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:09.860
on one side of his chest is that clan emblem that red circled white cross blood

183
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.930
drop on the other side are the initials,

184
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:16.220
KKK and embroidered on his Beretta said Knights of the KU Klux Klan.

185
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.300
And on his hip, he had a semiautomatic handgun and a holster.

186
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.850
He comes in and Mr. Kelly is walking directly behind him and a

187
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.200
dark blue suit and tie.

188
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:33.560
And when the Nighthawk turned the corner and saw me, he just froze.

189
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.540
And Mr. Kelly did not realize that his Nighthawk had stopped short and he

190
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:42.530
slammed into his back and knocked him forward. And so they're stumbling around,

191
00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:47.060
regaining their balance and looking all around the room and I'm just watching

192
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.320
them. And I could see the apprehension in their faces. You know,

193
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.910
I could read it, you know, they,

194
00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:56.810
they thinking did the desperate give us the right room number, you know,

195
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.690
or it was just an ambush and what's going on here.

196
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.930
So I stood up and I displayed the palms of my hands as,

197
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:07.630
as to say a I'm unarmed. And I walked forward,

198
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.110
I stuck up my right hand. I said, hi, Mr. Kelly, I'm Daryl D.

199
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.560
And he shook my hand. He, because my hand and the Nighthawk shook my hand.

200
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.860
So, so far so good. I'm doing, I'm doing well. I said, come on in,

201
00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:24.030
come on and have a seat, please. Mr. Kelly sat down even better.

202
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.690
And the Nighthawks stood at attention then Mr. Kelly's. Right?

203
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.860
So I'm going to sit down opposite of them. Right. And Mr. Kelly says to me,

204
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.630
Mr. Davis, do you have any form of identification? I said, sure.

205
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.890
I produced my wallet. And I handed him my driver's license.

206
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.470
And he goes, oh, you live on such and such street in silver spring.

207
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.390
Now beside me a little concerned, why is this man? Really?

208
00:12:51.391 --> 00:12:56.010
My street address, all he has to do is look at my name and looked at my picture,

209
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.640
match it up to me and give me back my license here. He is.

210
00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:03.810
I'm looking at my address. Is he going to come burn across my lawn? What's up.

211
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.320
So I did not want to let him know that he had, you know,

212
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:08.460
unnerved me a little bit,

213
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.630
but I wanted to let him know under no circumstances are you to come to my house,

214
00:13:12.631 --> 00:13:16.170
uninvited within a, you know, nefarious intentions.

215
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.240
So I said to him, I said, yes, Mr. Kelly, that is where I live.

216
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.660
And you live at. And I named his house number and his street, you know, that,

217
00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:31.020
that the former guy had given me that way. I was implying, Hey, you know,

218
00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:34.800
you know where I live, I know where you live. If you come visit me,

219
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.740
I'm going to come visit you. So there were so, you know,

220
00:13:37.741 --> 00:13:42.180
we're going to confine all this visiting to this motel room. So he smiled.

221
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:44.250
He nodded his head like he understood.

222
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.910
And I did not find out that day.

223
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.710
It was several months down the road that I had been presumptuous.

224
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.270
I had no reason to fear Mr. Kelly coming to my house to do anything stupid.

225
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.850
What had happened was one of his clan members lived right

226
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:05.490
down the road from me. I didn't know that.

227
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.010
And Mr. Kelly would have to travel down my,

228
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.060
my street to get into that neighborhood where this plan member lived.

229
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.750
He simply recognized the name of the street. That was it, pure Cohen.

230
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:20.250
So he wasn't trying to threaten no, not at all, not at all. So, um,

231
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.001
you know,

232
00:14:21.001 --> 00:14:25.680
and today that same plan member is in a federal prison who he'll be there for a

233
00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:28.620
long time. He would later commit a hate crime,

234
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.120
which landed him to the federal penitentiary. So, um, anyway,

235
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.690
we got on with his interview and, um,

236
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.070
within 10 minutes, uh, Mr. Kelly,

237
00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:45.120
let me know why he would hate people like me. Uh,

238
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:50.100
black people are inferior. Uh, we are prone to crime there. Uh,

239
00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:54.830
we were criminals. That is why there are more blacks in prison than whites.

240
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.490
Now that's a half truth. Um,

241
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.270
there are indeed more blacks in prison than white people is not because we

242
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.670
prone to crime. Like you said,

243
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.900
it's because of inequity in our judicial system where whites in the same

244
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:10.190
predicament, uh,

245
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.200
either don't get the same jail time or don't go to jail or whatever. Um, anyway,

246
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.180
so I'm a criminal. I also said that black people are lazy. Uh,

247
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:23.780
we don't want to work while we prefer to scan the government welfare system.

248
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.680
We're looking for handouts and freebies and all that, where white people,

249
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.950
you know, you know, they, they work et cetera. Um,

250
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.360
and also this book called the bell curve had just recently come out

251
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.850
and, uh, you know, the one that was very controversial. Exactly.

252
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.300
So, you know, he had, he had jumped on that and he said, well, you know,

253
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:48.320
it's a known fact, you know, they say the world's biggest authorities. They,

254
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.450
you know, you never see who they is, right. They say, um, that, uh, you know,

255
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:55.580
black people have, have smaller brains than white people.

256
00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.080
And that's why their IQ is not as high. So I guess the bigger the brain,

257
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.570
the more intelligent you are. So now I'm sitting there listening to this guy,

258
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.140
tell me that I'm a criminal and I'm lazy and on welfare.

259
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.630
And my brain is smaller than his.

260
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.820
What he was saying was indeed offensive.

261
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.230
But here's the difference between me and most other people.

262
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.810
I did not take offense to it. I tell you why I got to take offense to it.

263
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.540
Why should I be offended by somebody who knows nothing about me?

264
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.850
He only met me 10 minutes ago.

265
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.900
He sees the color of my skin and has made this assessment.

266
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.820
So why should I take offense to somebody who's telling a lie?

267
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.620
I just let them roll on with it.

268
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.320
<v 2>She developed this kind of clarity.</v>

269
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.210
It's very unusual to not be offended when someone's judging you

270
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.770
instantly and saying disparaging things about everyone that looks anything like

271
00:16:56.771 --> 00:16:59.950
you just right off the cuff freely, right in front of you,

272
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.950
how did you develop this clarity to just not be offended by that?

273
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.600
<v 0>Because it didn't make sense what he was saying. Of course. So I figured,</v>

274
00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:12.550
you know, how could I be offended by somebody who's, who's all twisted. Right?

275
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.200
You know, who, who, who obviously doesn't have the,

276
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.520
the foresight to see that he's wrong. I want to learn more about this,

277
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:24.190
which is coming from right. And so now see,

278
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.810
that's what usually stops a conversation. And then,

279
00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:31.540
and then people get into combat. Yes. You know, and then it goes nowhere.

280
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.040
So I was not offended by it. So then roll on with it. And then when he finished,

281
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.920
you know, and he was, he was proud of him, you know,

282
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.050
explained to me why the stance I, so, you know, when Mr. Kelly, I mean,

283
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.790
you know, I'm, I'm gonna be straight up with you.

284
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.190
I don't have a criminal record. I have been on welfare.

285
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.230
I've never measured my brain,

286
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.180
but I'm sure it's the same size as anybody else's and he's whatever.

287
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.760
And we go on, well,

288
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.420
every now and then the cassette would run out of tape. Right.

289
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.300
And I'd reach down into my bag and pulled out a fresh cassette.

290
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.650
Or Mr. Kelly would pound the table. Mr. Davis, the Bible says, I reach down,

291
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.513
pull up the Bible.

292
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.860
Every time I'd reached down like this to get the Bible or the cassette out of

293
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:17.694
the bag,

294
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.350
the Nighthawk would reach up onto his hip right

295
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.340
now. That was cool. I mean, I got that. That's his job.

296
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.360
His job is to protect his boss. He has no idea. What's in my bag.

297
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.650
That's a little distracting though. Isn't it? Well, yeah.

298
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.750
But, you know, I realized that these people are afraid of me. Right.

299
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.560
Okay. So, you know, I had to be cool. I'm not afraid of them. Right.

300
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.300
So I have to be cool, but, uh, but be transparent. All right. So, you know,

301
00:18:50.301 --> 00:18:55.220
he's doing his job and just like, you know, when, um, when you get put, well,

302
00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:55.580
you know,

303
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.150
maybe you don't get pulled over as much as I do right by the cops at night, but,

304
00:18:59.151 --> 00:19:01.760
you know, I can tell you right now, you know, when, when, uh,

305
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.140
when you get pulled over and, uh,

306
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.200
and a cop tells you to get your license or whatever,

307
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.950
and you it's in the glove is in the glove box and you reach,

308
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.790
he gets a little more tighter on his hand, he's protecting himself.

309
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.570
So Nighthawk was doing that. And I got that. So, um,

310
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.250
know this kept happening. And, um,

311
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.150
after a while he realized there was no threat in the bag.

312
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.910
And I went in and out of the bag and I docked didn't move.

313
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.650
He was relaxed just over an hour into this interview,

314
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.340
there was a sudden, a very quick, I mean,

315
00:19:37.341 --> 00:19:41.900
less than a second noise in the room, which at that, that was it.

316
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:48.170
And it happened so fast out of nowhere that my ear could not

317
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:49.460
discern what it was.

318
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.080
I just came out of the blue and I'm studying inclusive than you and I are right

319
00:19:54.081 --> 00:19:58.880
now because the table was smaller to Mr. Kelly and the Nighthawk was

320
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:03.860
here and it was close right there. And I flew up out of my chair,

321
00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:06.290
hit the table, um,

322
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.560
because my ear could not discern what the noise was.

323
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.090
I perceived it to be an ominous threatening noise.

324
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.340
Um, and I knew, I knew for a fact that Mr.

325
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.380
Kelly had made this noise, where did it come from? Why did he make it? Um,

326
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.540
and how did I know that he made it? I knew that because I didn't make it. So,

327
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:33.440
you know, you know, if you, if you don't want to accept responsibility or,

328
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:38.360
you know, you're not responsible, what do you do? You assign blame. Right. And,

329
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.970
um, so I flew out of my chair.

330
00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:45.200
I hit the table and my mind was racing.

331
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.491
What did I just do?

332
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:51.010
What did I just to cause Mr. Kelly to go off and make some threatening

333
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:55.600
noise? You know, I instantly put everything in perspective. We're enemies.

334
00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.580
He's the head of the clan. I'm a black guy. And now, you know, and then I,

335
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:03.640
I heard that former Klansmen's voice in my head, Darryl,

336
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.660
do not fool with Roger Kelly. He will kill you. So I didn't want to die.

337
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.510
And in that split, second,

338
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.440
I have gone into a survival mode.

339
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.660
And when you fear for your life, that's what you do. What was the noise?

340
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.910
I'm going to tell you in a cell. Yeah, it was just, that was it. And, um,

341
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:30.010
because it was unexpected and it was so short and I couldn't discern it. Uh,

342
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.030
you know, I went into, into self-protect mode and, um,

343
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.160
I can hit the table. Well, when you fear for your life, as I said, you know,

344
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:42.850
you go into survival mode and in survival mode, you know, you're only,

345
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.560
you can only do like one of four things. Some people they just pass out,

346
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.380
they think because the fear is so great.

347
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.300
Their brain cannot process it and it shuts down and they pass out, uh,

348
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:56.950
other people there,

349
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
their muscles contract and they get tense and they can't move and you can be

350
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:02.020
punching them, kicking them.

351
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.200
And they won't even be deflecting the blows they're, they're all constricted.

352
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.680
That's called paralysis by fear that you're too afraid to move.

353
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.690
The third thing people will do is to run away from whatever the fear is.

354
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.790
And that is your best option.

355
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.440
When something scares you that bad take off separate yourself as quickly as you

356
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:24.940
can, from that fear put as much distance between you and the fear as you can.

357
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.660
And that would have been my choice. Had it been an option,

358
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.640
but it was not an option for me because you cannot outrun a bullet in a motel

359
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:37.660
room. Right. So I was not armed.

360
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.170
My secretary was not armed. The only person who I knew for sure,

361
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:44.500
who was armed was the Nighthawk. You know, you could see his gun right there.

362
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.360
And I didn't know if, uh,

363
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.690
if Mr. Kelly had a weapon up under his suit jacket or not.

364
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.690
All I knew was I don't want to die today.

365
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.670
So I chose the fourth option, which was to do a preemptive strike.

366
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.480
You get them before they get you. So when I flew out of my chair,

367
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.340
I was on a dive across the table.

368
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.570
I was going to grab Mr. Kelly grabbed the night off and slammed them down to the

369
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:10.690
ground and take away the night Hawks gun. Whoa. No,

370
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.160
it was going to happen back quickly. Okay. I think pretty fast,

371
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.430
sometimes a little too fast, but I'm glad I hit the table.

372
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.090
Cause I'm looking right into his eyes trying to figure out, like,

373
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:25.150
what did you do? I didn't say one word to this guy,

374
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.380
but my eyes had locked with his eyes. It was like, I just see right through him.

375
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.840
And I let my eyes do the talking. I knew he could hear my eyes. Um,

376
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.100
my eyes was shouting at him saying, what did you just do? Well,

377
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:43.480
his eyes had fixated on my eyes. He didn't say a word either,

378
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.720
but I could read his, his eyes are saying to me, what did you just do?

379
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.720
And then Nighthawk had his hand on his gun looking at both of us.

380
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.730
Like what either one of y'all just do.

381
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.030
Mary was sitting to my left on top of the dresser because there were no more

382
00:23:59.031 --> 00:23:59.864
chairs.

383
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:05.180
And she realized what had happened as she began explaining it to us when it

384
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:10.160
happened again, the ice and the ice bucket. Have you gone to melt? Oh Jesus.

385
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.690
And the cans shifted down the ice?

386
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.110
<v 2>No, that was it. So the tension was so thick,</v>

387
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.710
the ice in the bucket, wasn't just like a normal,

388
00:24:20.711 --> 00:24:22.640
like if there was ice in the bucket right now, it'd be like, oh,

389
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.600
it's just noise. Yeah. You were just on edge.

390
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.370
<v 0>Absolutely. Absolutely.</v>

391
00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:31.810
And the cancer just fallen down and you'd been talking for an hour. Yeah. Yeah.

392
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.950
And they've been sitting there before Mr. Kelly came in. Okay.

393
00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.240
And we'd forgotten about it.

394
00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.290
I offered him a drink when he first got there and he said, no, but, um.

395
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.060
<v 2>So we're going to get to, it was like, so you're,</v>

396
00:24:43.061 --> 00:24:46.330
you're talking to him for an hour and in that hour is detention.

397
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.560
Detention is not being alleviated at all. He's explaining everything to you.

398
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.600
He's telling you his theories,

399
00:24:52.601 --> 00:24:55.630
you're being very calm and just letting him speak. Yeah.

400
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.770
But you are still so on edge, just being across from this guy that,

401
00:24:59.771 --> 00:25:00.850
that sound right.

402
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.730
<v 0>Right. Because it came out of nowhere, you know,</v>

403
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:08.920
it came out of nowhere and um, I mean, yeah. You know, the detention had had,

404
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:13.510
uh, had deescalated, all that kind of stuff as we got more into the hour.

405
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.550
Um, but I think, you know, we each were aware, you know,

406
00:25:18.551 --> 00:25:23.050
this is not a normal situation in a black kind of clan leader. Um,

407
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.460
so you know, each, each one was still a little wary of the other kind of thing.

408
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.900
Right. Um, but we, we were mutually respectful.

409
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:37.000
Okay. So then, um, it happened again and, you know,

410
00:25:37.001 --> 00:25:37.960
we began laughing.

411
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.030
We began laughing all of us at how ignorant we had all been.

412
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.760
I won't say that this was a learning moment, but it was a teaching moment.

413
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.950
And the learning would come later. The, um, the,

414
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.560
what, what was taught was this all because

415
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.180
some foreign and underscore highlight,

416
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:09.010
circled the word foreign entity of which we were ignorant.

417
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.350
That being the bucket of ice cans of soda entered into our little comfort

418
00:26:14.351 --> 00:26:16.930
zone via the noise that it made.

419
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.520
We became fearful and accusatory of each other.

420
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.560
So the lesson taught is ignorance, breeds, fear. We fear those things.

421
00:26:26.561 --> 00:26:28.240
We don't understand. All right.

422
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.040
If you do not keep that fear in check that fear in

423
00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:36.790
turn will escalate and breed hatred

424
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.600
because we hate those things that frightened us.

425
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.030
If you don't check that hatred,

426
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.240
it in turn will escalate and breed destruction.

427
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.730
We want to destroy those things that we hate. Why? Because they frighten us.

428
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.360
But guess what? They may have been harmless. And we were just ignorant.

429
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.730
And we saw the whole chain unravel to almost completion.

430
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.910
The last component being destruction stopped,

431
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:10.440
just shorter that had I pounced across the table and hurt one of them or had the

432
00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:13.470
Nighthawk drawn his gun and shot one of us. You know,

433
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:17.280
that that would have been the destruction. Um, fortunately that did not happen.

434
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.410
We did see that that whole chain unravel to completion

435
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.170
three years ago on

436
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:30.150
August 12th, 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia.

437
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.160
Okay. Which is like two hours from my house on August 12th,

438
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.660
2017 and Charlottesville, Virginia.

439
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.320
There was a lot of ignorance in Charlottesville.

440
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.280
There was a lot of fear in Charlottesville.

441
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.060
There was a lot of hatred in Charlottesville.

442
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.350
And what did it culminate in? It culminated in destruction.

443
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:57.240
When a white supremacist got inside his vehicle and drove full force

444
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.900
into a crowd of counter protestors, trying to murder them.

445
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:06.090
He succeeded in injuring 20 and a and murdering a young lady

446
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.520
named Heather Hyer. Um, so that,

447
00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:14.400
that whole chain is there. If you want to solve this problem of racism,

448
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.570
we need to stop focusing on the symptoms.

449
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.830
Don't worry about the fear. Don't worry about the hatred. Those,

450
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.010
those are just symptoms. Let's I putting a bandaid on cancer.

451
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.160
You got to go down to the bone and treat it at its source.

452
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.410
The source of all this is ignorance. Ignorance can be cured.

453
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.830
The cure for ignorance is called education.

454
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.770
So you fix the ignorance.

455
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.430
There's nothing to fear because you fear what you don't know when you cure the

456
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.630
ignorance. You know, something, there's nothing to fear.

457
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.630
If there's nothing to fear, then there's nothing to hate.

458
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.170
If there's something to hate, there's nothing to destroy.

459
00:28:55.650 --> 00:29:00.570
So we need to focus on the ignorance and we address it with exposure and

460
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:02.970
education and conversation.

461
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.830
We spend way too much time in this country talking about the other

462
00:29:07.831 --> 00:29:12.360
person, talking at the other person, talking past the other person.

463
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.650
Why not just spend a little bit of time talking with the other person.
