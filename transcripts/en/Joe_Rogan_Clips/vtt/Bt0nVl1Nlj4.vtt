00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.400
We've never been in a time where literally nobody knows I have a string of text

3
00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:10.280
messages from, uh, Alex Jones. Yeah. Like, uh, that will, uh,

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.600
change your opinion. If you, if you smoke enough weed and you don't smoke,

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.920
will you ever a weed smoke? I smoked a lot of weed for a very long time,

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.600
but will you? That's when I discovered Alex Jones, when I was 13,

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.950
when I was smoking, we weed listening to him on the GCN network.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.790
But when you got clean, it wasn't weed. That was a problem. It was no,

9
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:30.030
it was the cocaine and the, the booze and the pills. But weed was always there.

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.670
I've never been a cocaine user. I've never used it,

11
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.270
but I do love that buck cherry song. Oh yeah. It's great. It's great.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.430
It almost makes you wanna do cocaine. It's a great drug. I mean,

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.100
don't do it if you're problems, but Alex left, I,

14
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.980
I haven't even gotten to them because I got the, the, this is a real,

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.420
I changed my phone number. Yeah. Not that long ago. Right.

16
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:51.860
And I change it every few months now. Yeah. And it doesn't matter.

17
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.020
Do you get random texts from just anybody? Oh yeah. Random. Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.660
But this, this, these are all,

19
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.940
all these are voicemail messages and look at all these videos he sent me to

20
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:04.210
watch and all these websites he's convinced. Yeah.

21
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.970
That it's a weaponized, uh, virus that leaked from a lab.

22
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.930
Well, there's a lot of people that are saying that in Wuhan,

23
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:14.530
obviously they have that lab, right? Yes.

24
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:18.330
Whether it's a bio defense or bioresearch laboratory something,

25
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:22.720
there something's there something in Wuhan where the disease is. Somebody said,

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.680
now this is kind of convincing that maybe there were people set

27
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.800
backdoor selling the animals that they were experimenting on to wet markets.

28
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.880
Like if you are broke and you guard at the Wuhan lab, you're like, Hey,

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.600
I'm just selling bats and dogs for extra money.

30
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.150
And he sold maybe of the wrong ones. And now we have this issue. Really?

31
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.230
Where'd you hear that? I mean, that's on the internet show. &lt;laugh&gt; oh, well,

32
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:51.110
as long as it's on the internet, I mean, it's there, but I mean,

33
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.030
but now every theory has as much weight as any other theory right now,

34
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.190
right now. Yeah. Well,

35
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:01.470
because legit scientists that are actually like one of the things they found out

36
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.940
is that the origin of the virus in New York city,

37
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.500
it comes directly from Europe. Apparently they can tell that interesting.

38
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.780
Somehow find out no idea,

39
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.740
find out how they can tell do they trace it back to like patient zero with like

40
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.820
the first part? I don't think don't do that. I don't think so.

41
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.620
They do some sort of tracing. Right? Cause that's the new, yeah.

42
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.090
I of Google and apple working together to get tracing software.

43
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.050
See that's that's what scares me. We, we talked about that the other day.

44
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:31.650
If you have to have everything on your phone,

45
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.210
like showing that you're positive and being, you know,

46
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:35.850
you have to have a phone everywhere. You don't have a car,

47
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:38.730
you have to take out your card that you're positive to get into Applebees.

48
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.770
And how are you gonna help me? What's what? How are you going to help me?

49
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.010
Magnis helmet or,

50
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.240
and start with the helmet and then you're gonna take we're.

51
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:50.120
We're gonna sit down and I'm gonna give you a reading list. Why are you dressed?

52
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:53.560
Like a mannequin? You are dressed like a J crew mannequin.

53
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.680
You shop at J crews, James, like it's 2003 James. First.

54
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.560
I like those shirts, James.

55
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.720
<v 1>Yeah, I do too. But looking at you, you can't Tell's James first.</v>

56
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.760
<v 0>They make nice shirts. Now do you wearing a white beat underneath?</v>

57
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.400
<v 1>Oh dude. Jesse. What? You're wearing a white Peter underneath.</v>

58
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.400
Like you're in a play from the forties, dude. What the is wrong with you? Look,

59
00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:14.100
dude.

60
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.870
<v 0>Who wears a white under me? Keeps my torso warm. You've got,</v>

61
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.830
it's not hold on. What's the temperature. It keeps my, it keeps my 78.

62
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.870
It's unbelievable.

63
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.710
<v 1>Dude. Have you ever worn a color? I'll explain. Have you ever worn a color?</v>

64
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.430
I'll explain besides earth tones. Listen, Brian.

65
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.750
<v 0>It's 80 degrees out. I know. Unbelievable Joe. Listen, it keeps my lower.</v>

66
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.510
It keeps my lower back. My, my mid body warm. So if I have to generate torque,

67
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.220
gotta throw a kick. Gotta throw. I'm not gonna twist my back. So my back stays.

68
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.100
You should never kick anybody. I saw your kicks. First of all, I wanna say this.

69
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.033
You're welcome.

70
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.700
<v 1>On what dude. How about this? You welcome. No, for my special coming.</v>

71
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.820
<v 0>Out, you always, how many wife beaters you own dude.</v>

72
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.620
<v 1>That's what he wears underneath. He wears underneath.</v>

73
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.340
<v 0>Dude. My wife won't let me wear tank tops.</v>

74
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.780
<v 1>You know why? Because your wife is smart and fashionable, but you dude,</v>

75
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.810
you look like he, if you take off that shirt, you have a wife beater on bro.

76
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.130
Yeah. You have an actual wife beater on. You have a real.

77
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.050
<v 0>Wife beater. My wife. You should talk.</v>

78
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.330
My wife's like you already look like a wife beater. Don't wear one.

79
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.570
&lt;laugh&gt; that's what she said to me. &lt;laugh&gt;.

80
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.663
<v 1>That's hilarious.</v>

81
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.450
<v 0>I'm like, that's great. Okay. You do look. You have a very hard look. She said,</v>

82
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:19.930
you look like a meat head. Yeah. She goes, you know,

83
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.240
wanna like give people that your face. I knew you had a,

84
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:26.720
you looked your face one time you were interviewing Randy couture and you had a

85
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:29.600
wider head than Randy. So that's not true. That shows you.

86
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.480
<v 1>What's weird is that you can always bring, uh,</v>

87
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.920
a conversation around to a man's anatomy. That's what's weird. That's true.

88
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.120
That is what's weird. And now since beginning of anatomy, yeah,

89
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.310
you're getting older. Hey, but why are you? You? But what? But no, it's cool.

90
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.910
So when I saw you, when I, I see old videos of you,

91
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.670
you look healthy and now you don't not look healthy. Yeah. But you look less.

92
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.670
No, right? You look less. Listen. Me,

93
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.950
you look like you're wearing a Brian Callas. So don't ever listen.

94
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.550
<v 0>No, no, no. Now hold on. Okay. What? Now this is my house. Number one.</v>

95
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:01.820
You're welcome. Well, now you for Joe Rogan.

96
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.620
<v 1>Right now. No I, but we're and now we're closer than you. Yes. Yes. We're.</v>

97
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.540
We're we're closer than.

98
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.140
<v 0>You. That's impossible. So Joe Joe said to me a long time ago,</v>

99
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.700
he probably remember us. He said, he goes, Hey, I go, what? He goes,

100
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.980
this Chris kid, you know, &lt;laugh&gt; that sounds like,

101
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.260
and I said, I said, what he goes is he? And I go he's all right.

102
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.730
And, and then Joe goes, okay. Oh, so.

103
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.850
<v 1>You gave him your, my, my good blessing, the.</v>

104
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.250
<v 0>Door open. Now, if I wanna shut the door &lt;laugh&gt; if I wanna shut the door,</v>

105
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:31.610
I make a call. I, I glance at him wrong.

106
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.570
I glance at him and you banned.

107
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.370
<v 2>In a nutshell, uh, Manson believed that, uh,</v>

108
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.560
there was going to be a race war and he wanted to incite this race

109
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.480
war because he had convinced his followers,

110
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.680
that through messages he received from the Beatles white album,

111
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.560
from their lyrics, from biblical, uh,

112
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.760
old Testament prophecies that, um,

113
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.440
he had been told that he was gonna be the savior of the world.

114
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.000
And once the race war started,

115
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.920
he would hide his family in a bottomless pit in the desert.

116
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.880
And when the race war ended with the blacks winning,

117
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.750
the blacks would be framed for, for murders. Um, they were, would,

118
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.110
the Manson family would emerge and repopulate the planet with their perfect off

119
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.630
offspring and dominate the blacks. Um.

120
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.750
<v 0>This was Vince Bugliosi well, he narrative.</v>

121
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.710
<v 2>Or there was talk of that.</v>

122
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:33.710
There was a philosophy of heter Skelter at the spawn ranch, where,

123
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:37.660
where they lived in 68 and 69, that Manson would discuss.

124
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.460
But whether or not it was the motive for the murders is,

125
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.820
is I raised serious questions about that in.

126
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.570
<v 0>The book,</v>

127
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.860
mans would discuss it in that way that there was going to be a race war and that

128
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:51.420
they would emerge and then their offspring.

129
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.620
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Except for the fact that, um, what's question.</v>

130
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.770
So the way Bui was able to convict Manson Manson

131
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.170
wasn't at the Tate house. When the murders happened,

132
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.890
he had in the official story, dispatched Susan Atkins, Patricia CRE Winkle,

133
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.850
Leslie Kasabian and Tex Watson to the house,

134
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.490
the former house of Terry Melcher. They didn't know who lived there,

135
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.240
but just to kill every and has Manson allegedly said,

136
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.480
leave something witchy.

137
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.080
He wanted it to look like blacks had killed these. Uh,

138
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.200
all he knew was they were wealthy, beautiful whites,

139
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.800
and he wanted to ignite the race war because if the Panthers got

140
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.550
blamed for these murders, then the police would crack down on them.

141
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:43.950
They'd revolt. The revolution would happen. It would be app.

142
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.070
It would spread across the whole world.

143
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.110
And then when it was over and the blacks had prevailed, they were too dumb man,

144
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.630
and believed to be able to run the world.

145
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.510
That's when he would come out with his followers of their whole and the desert

146
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.540
and take over the planet. Now,

147
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.260
BU OSI said in interviews that I didn't have until

148
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.700
after he and I stopped speaking,

149
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.260
which is when he started threatening me with lawsuits and other things in the,

150
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:13.380
in the about 2006, seven,

151
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.100
I discovered two or three interviews he gave in the early seventies where he was

152
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.970
asked you if he believed that Manson really believed this craziness.

153
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.530
And BOSI said, I don't think Charlie believed in it. He got his followers to,

154
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.530
but he never believed in that he was too smart. He was a con man.

155
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.410
<v 3>And right there, you know what, Joe,</v>

156
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.970
I don't wanna feel like I'm CVS or anything right now. But I wanna say,

157
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.000
we all know when it comes to Corona, there's certain things that go before,

158
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:43.320
you know, if you have Corona or you kind of feel it, right?

159
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:46.040
Your sense of smell and your sense of test. That's why Joe,

160
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:48.600
you're not gonna believe this. Right. I came up,

161
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.360
I came up with a one of a kind, this is a specific to me.

162
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.800
It's the Donnell raw show. Okay.

163
00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.240
Now I don't know if you're familiar with a smell called black ice, black ice.

164
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.440
Do you know what black ice is? No. You know what black ice is? I don't.

165
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.400
<v 0>Know. I wouldn't.</v>

166
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.120
<v 3>Lie to you. No, you don't really know what the black ice air freshen is. I.</v>

167
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.080
<v 0>Don't think so. Do.</v>

168
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.110
<v 3>You know what it is? You don't know. Okay. You're gonna,</v>

169
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.630
I bet you you'll know this. I mean, I've all you know, for like, for a car.

170
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.710
All right. You know this one, you know the Royal pine air freshener, right?

171
00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:23.270
Yeah. Those little cheese that the white one.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:33.070
Yes. You racist this say, yo, you,

173
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.910
is there another color? So.

174
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.220
<v 0>Let me, lemme just tell you right off the bat. Oh my hate. Listen,</v>

175
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.980
I I'm a car freak. Right? I hate air fresheners. Right? I got,

176
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.740
I don't like them. Right? I wanna smell car. I wanna smell. It's not about,

177
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.340
I wanna smell gasoline.

178
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.140
<v 3>And it's not your car. It's not about your car.</v>

179
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.260
Like you've not been into a Cadillac, a black, a black owned Cadillac.

180
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.970
You never had a ride with Snoop dog or any of the hiphop dudes, right? No.

181
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.090
That's like in the culture, black culture, black ice is just the.

182
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.610
<v 0>Smell. You always have to have it in your car.</v>

183
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.730
<v 3>If you wanna get simplicity back in the day. &lt;laugh&gt; you know what I'm saying?</v>

184
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.650
How to smell right? Yo, yo Joe, I'm not drug. So.

185
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.490
<v 0>It's oh my God. It's a tree though. Yeah. It's a tree. It's.</v>

186
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.440
<v 3>The same. It's the same thing. As a white man's air freshener. The thing it's.</v>

187
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.273
<v 0>The same shape.</v>

188
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.320
<v 3>It's the black lives. Matter of air freshen as Joe matter.</v>

189
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.400
<v 0>It is hilarious though. They pretend, look,</v>

190
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.640
it's like a tree made outta chemicals. But.

191
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.360
<v 3>With the woods, Joe, I don't want distract, but getting back to the candle, um,</v>
