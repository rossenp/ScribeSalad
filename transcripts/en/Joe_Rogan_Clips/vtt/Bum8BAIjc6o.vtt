WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. We have an idea. I actually brought some,</v>

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.170
some Sanskrit to show you. You want to see some Sanskrit?

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.310
<v 1>Can you put it up on the screen that it's under the, the Soma tab? Oh,</v>

4
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:16.130
look at how beautiful that is. There it is there writing it in Sanskrit. God,

5
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:18.830
it's so pretty. Do you want me to read it for you please? You can read that.

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.400
Yeah. So.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.910
<v 0>This was my major in college. So at the, in the very middle there, you can see</v>

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.780
[inaudible] and what, what he's saying there, um, is this is from the rig Veda,

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.190
right? And then it's, it's the oldest literature in Western civilization. Uh,

10
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.130
we, we think it's, uh, among the European languages,

11
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:44.090
it's the oldest recorded literature that we have. It could be 1500 BC,

12
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.200
1700 perhaps much earlier, like the Iliad and the Odyssey in Greek.

13
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.460
This is the mother tongue of, of all the Indo-European languages. Uh,

14
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.930
and what they write about a lot is so ma which is both a God and the juice that

15
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.630
is pressed from this God. And what they're talking about there is,

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.980
is making this ritual potion very much like the cookie on that we find among the

17
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:08.510
ancient Greeks and here Soma is described as a mixed potion.

18
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.400
Yamashita means mixed with barley Guevara from Sanskrit go

19
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.530
gov is milk mixed with milk.

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.310
And so I've read all the theories that you have about what Soma was,

21
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:22.850
whether it was the Amanita Muscarella mushroom or some silicide and containing

22
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:25.790
species or, or DMT. Uh,

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.530
the way that they describe Soma here is always a mixed potion, which, um,

24
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.990
so in this case mixed with barley and, and milk.

25
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.540
<v 1>So that would be an Earl, got some sort of.</v>

26
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.630
<v 0>Already they're mentioned. I mean, and so that's,</v>

27
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:43.250
that's what rock Hoffman and Wasson were saying in 1978, um, we have,

28
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:47.090
we have literature from the seventh century BC,

29
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:48.320
it's called the [inaudible], where they record these ingredients, uh,

30
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 of what the cookie on was you asked, like what, what, where's

31
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 the actual evidence? So in the seventies, we didn't have much, it starts with the literature, which is what classes 

32
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.153
do. And so there's this [inaudible]

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.420
that was discovered in 1777 a year after we declare our independence from

34
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.560
Graham's people and what they, what they found in their, in, in line. Okay,

35
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.603
great.

36
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.420
<v 2>We're in Texas man. Absolutely. Well done. I'm all for independence.</v>

37
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.860
So like, I'd like to be independent of my own country, if possible, as well.

38
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.130
<v 3>Texas has taken refugees at the moment. Isn't it?</v>

39
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.560
<v 1>Well, that's, what's happening here. That's why we're here.</v>

40
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.790
We're we're refugees from the country of California, this nation,

41
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.970
state of California. Um, so why,

42
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.730
why do we know why they combined it with milk?

43
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.890
And it was it just so that it was easier to consume.

44
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.220
<v 0>That that's what we don't know. We don't know why the cookie on was,</v>

45
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.980
it was this mixed thing either, but so in the him to Daimler,

46
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.340
they record these ingredients. It's Alfie, which is barley, who daughter,

47
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.020
which is water and, uh, Blake on which means mint. And that's all we had.

48
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.870
<v 1>So there doesn't say milk, you say milk. That was in Selma. And so, yeah,</v>

49
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.120
I'm sorry, which they.

50
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.490
<v 0>Mixed with all kinds of things and not, and not just barley and milk,</v>

51
00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:09.690
but also honey, as a matter of fact, Soma is often identified with Magoo,

52
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.280
which is honey in Sanskrit.

53
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.180
<v 1>Ken, uh, speculated that there was, uh, there was a transfer,</v>

54
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.900
uh, in culture of a psychedelic based culture to an alcohol based culture

55
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.520
based on climate change.

56
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:28.050
And also based on preserving things in honey and that honey would create

57
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.240
Mead and Meade, which, uh,

58
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.900
if people don't know is an alcohol beverage that's actually made with honey

59
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.690
[inaudible] is,

60
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.590
do you think that this was the case with the use of honey as

61
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:44.070
well, that is used as a preservative or was it used to,

62
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.720
to make it taste better, more palatable? W we, we don't know. We don't.

63
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.950
<v 0>Know that that's the problem.</v>

64
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:53.430
When we're talking about ancient plants and fungi plants, especially we,

65
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.260
we don't know what plants they're talking about.

66
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.100
So the ancient literature records all kinds of plants across the right.

67
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.310
<v 2>If I could, if I could jump in Joe you're, you're absolutely right.</v>

68
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.990
There was a secrecy that surrounded the use of these potions in the ancient

69
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:09.480
world. There's a case from,

70
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.280
from Athens of the potion from elusive is being used for recreational

71
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:14.911
purposes.

72
00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:19.320
And this is roundly condemned by all concerned that it should only be used for

73
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.680
the, for the sacred and spiritual purposes of which it was intended.

74
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:25.860
So there was a great deal of secrecy, uh,

75
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:30.570
that surrounded the use of these potions and the potions were a doorway or a

76
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.660
gateway into another level of reality.

77
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.340
And what's fascinating from a looses and many other ancient accounts is the way

78
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:41.790
that people come back, having lost their fear of death,

79
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.550
that they don't regard death as the end anymore.

80
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.260
It's just another stage on the journey,

81
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:51.000
just the beginning of the next great adventure. Uh, and, and, um,

82
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.540
it it's, Brian is absolutely right to draw attention to the,

83
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.910
to the modern work with psilocybin. And again,

84
00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:01.050
we find people who are terminal cases who are imminently facing death,

85
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.340
losing their fear of death as a result of, of using psilocybin.

86
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:09.840
So we can begin to see connections between what we understand about these

87
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:13.190
extraordinary substances in the modern world and how the ancient world used

88
00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:14.024
them.

89
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.820
<v 1>Th th that does seem to be a universal theme, this, uh,</v>

90
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:21.960
this theme of alleviating the fear of death. And this, this,

91
00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:25.650
this comes up constantly with people that I know personally,

92
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.220
that have had it had these psychedelic experiences. They, they say, well,

93
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:31.000
I feel like I went to heaven.

94
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.640
I feel like now I understand why people believe there's this perfect afterlife.

95
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.660
That I've.

96
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.493
<v 2>A lot of,</v>

97
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.240
a lot of the critics will say that it's some kind of natural human

98
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.860
tendency that we don't want to die, and that we're afraid of death. And that,

99
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.750
um, that, uh, religions provide us with some sort of solace, uh,

100
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.730
some, some sort of feeling of security, but I don't think that washes a tall.

101
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.620
I think it's,

102
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.910
I think what's striking about the psychedelics is it's a direct experience that

103
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.540
the person has. They have an experience. It's not a teaching.

104
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.280
It's not something that they're told about.

105
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.370
It's not a scripture that they read is an experience that they have,

106
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.440
and that experience eliminates the fear of death. I think Brian, by the way,

107
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.390
uh, having written the mortality Kiva, which I've only provided the forward, uh,

108
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.400
I think Brian is absolutely right to be a psychedelic Virgin, um, in,

109
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.660
in my case because I have used psychedelics and many other substances,

110
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.660
a lot of my critics just try to write off all my work,

111
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.350
whether it's on lost civilizations, uh, or on psychedelics,

112
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:41.180
they tried to write it all off as the rantings of a sort of drug fueled maniac.

113
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.320
Uh, and I think it's very smart of Brian, very smarter, Brian,

114
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.090
not to put himself in that situation.

115
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:49.730
I hope he will work with psychedelics in the future,

116
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:52.880
but I think he was right not to work with psychedelics before writing this book

117
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:54.470
and to concentrate on the evidence.

118
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.640
<v 1>Uh, Michael Pollan, who, uh,</v>

119
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.300
later in life experienced psychedelics and, uh,

120
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.750
wrote pretty brilliantly about them for me. Now,

121
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.210
he's one of the more interesting, uh,

122
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.080
people to discuss it because Michael's an investigative journalist. He,

123
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.060
he D he.it takes deep dives into these subjects.

124
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.250
And his deep dive into psychedelics was incredibly illuminating. And so for him,

125
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.970
I really enjoyed talking to him about it. And I really enjoyed his book as well.

126
00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:25.420
His,

127
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.350
his perceptions of it were really unique because you're talking about a guy who

128
00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:32.050
lived his whole life without them, you know,

129
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:36.700
and then really dove head first for his book. It's kind of.

130
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.970
<v 2>What happened, kind of what happened to me when I, when I wrote supernatural,</v>

131
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:44.530
I had, I had apart from one experience with LSD in 1974,

132
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.390
I hadn't used any psychedelics until I began to research a supernatural back in

133
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:50.500
the early two thousands.

134
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.470
And because I'm a kind of boots on the ground researcher,

135
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:55.990
I felt it was essential that I have these experiences.

136
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.370
What I couldn't guess was the way that the experiences would utterly change and

137
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.200
transform my life. And I, I can understand from a level of personal experience,

138
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.420
why psychedelics do lie at the root, I think of all the world's religions,

139
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.370
uh, and those religions are now busily at work, trying to deny that connection.

140
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.650
<v 1>Well, th they're not just trying to do it.</v>

141
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.640
There's many people in science that are trying to deny these connections too.

142
00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:22.030
And it's,

143
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.690
it's so unfortunate that the people that are trying to deny these connections or

144
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:28.810
the significance of these experiences haven't had them.

145
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.030
I don't think anybody who has a dimethyltryptamine experience can just dismiss

146
00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:37.420
it as being no big deal. It's too. It's too crazy.

147
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.720
The F you need to do it, sir.

148
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.663
<v 3>This guy.</v>

149
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.770
<v 1>I mean, just the fact that it's,</v>

150
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.060
it's one of those things where everyone who does it comes out of it saying,

151
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.030
I can't believe that's real. Yeah. I can't,

152
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.280
I can't believe you can just get there that quickly,

153
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:57.750
that three and all of a sudden you're in Narnia. I just,

154
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.860
I guess not way more intense than Narnia what it's doing,

155
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:02.900
and.

156
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.890
<v 2>You're in a place where entities are actually communicating with you and</v>

157
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.510
speaking to you and teaching to you. I mean,

158
00:09:08.511 --> 00:09:13.370
this is another aspect of psychedelics is the moral aspect of psychedelics

159
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.300
critics and enemies of psychedelics want to associate them with some kind of

160
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.470
immortality,

161
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.860
but actually anybody who's worked extensively with psychedelics will know that

162
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:25.910
they contain moral teachings, whether it's the mushrooms or whether it's LSD,

163
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:30.680
they cause us to examine our own behavior, our own impact upon others,

164
00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:35.660
to question our unkindness to others and to give us at least, uh,

165
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.190
the push to,

166
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.640
to begin to be better people and more nurturing and more caring people for

167
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:45.230
others. So this strong moral element in psychedelics again, is totally ignored,

168
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.300
uh, by, by, by the critics who just want to demonize these substances for,

169
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:51.590
for reasons that I think are rather sinister, actually.

170
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.660
<v 1>Yep. So, so the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

171
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.780
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

172
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.210
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

173
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:05.930
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

174
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.920
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

175
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.720
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
