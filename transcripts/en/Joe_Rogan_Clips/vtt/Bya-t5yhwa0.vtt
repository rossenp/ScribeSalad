<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.750
Anyone defending institutional wall street right now got an envelope with photos

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:11.610
of themselves at Jeffrey Epstein's birthday. So what's with Jamie's, uh,

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.860
just pulled up with that. And when Tim was talking about,

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.320
is this insane situation that's happening?

6
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.560
It started out with game stop on with, with these,

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
these intelligent Vipers from Reddit decided they were going to figure out,

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.840
well, what, what they, here's the thing, wall street speculation.

9
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.950
And these people that have been these hedge fund guys,

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
they've been manipulating the stock market in a very similar way forever. Yeah.

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.680
But these guys on Reddit decided to get together collectively.

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.830
And what is it called? The, the S the subreddit called wall street bets.

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.350
So wall street bets decided that these hedge funds were

14
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.780
shorting game stop. Right?

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.150
So they decided we're going to buy games that were going to their whole system

16
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:59.070
up just to boost game stuff. Well,

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.910
just to see if they could and just the it's fun, it's fun.

18
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:07.430
So a bunch of people bought game stop stock game stopped

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.180
stock rose higher than it's ever risen in the entire history of the company.

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.510
I think it was up 11000%. Is that the case?

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.390
The actual percentage. Yeah. I don't.

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.230
<v 1>Know. I might've made that number up. Sounded good though. Didn't it? I mean.</v>

23
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.160
<v 0>And it never been higher than 50, 60 bucks,</v>

24
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.810
and it shot up to three to $400 at some point yesterday,

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.760
a little bit, but just.

26
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.940
<v 1>It's crazy. That's a crazy jump for no reason.</v>

27
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.620
And it was all because of these guys.

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
So this is where it gets complicated because now regulars do me a favor

29
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:47.640
and go to soccer, uh, his, uh, Instagram page,

30
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.790
because he gave me permission to play this today because he,

31
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.070
he talks about how this is really exposing

32
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.120
the actual corruption in the stock market and real market manipulation,

33
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.510
because they're trying to do something about the fact that these wall street

34
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:08.340
guys are getting over and like hedge funds have lost billions of dollars

35
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:12.390
because it's so, but the thing is that now that these guys it was play,

36
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:13.230
it let's play it real.

37
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.610
<v 0>Quick. This was the one you sent me yesterday, right?</v>

38
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.940
<v 1>No. Um, yes, the one from today.</v>

39
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.940
Um, let me, um, I'll send it to you late and reform.

40
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.350
<v 0>Uh.</v>

41
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.590
<v 1>Perhaps let's see.</v>

42
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.350
<v 2>Well, I have a confession to me.</v>

43
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.560
This is the first story that's excited me in a long time,

44
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.960
covering the pandemic and Trump and stop the steel and Capitol riots and

45
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:41.250
the Biden presidency.

46
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.960
It's been a real bummer and I have not felt a pep in my step like this in many

47
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:46.560
months.

48
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.790
And it is now thanks to a bunch of Redditors going after the people I despise

49
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:54.750
the most in our society speculators on wall street. By now,

50
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.490
I'm sure that you're all familiar with the story.

51
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.610
Hedge funds and billionaires took out a massive short position on the company

52
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.720
called game stock.

53
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.920
A band of Redditers on a subreddit called wall street bets called their bluff,

54
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.880
drove the stock up to the tune of thousands of percentile.

55
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.800
More to force those hedge funds to liquidate billions of dollars in losses

56
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.110
while the Merry band of Redditors gets rich.

57
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.330
It's the ultimate David and Goliath story,

58
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.310
underemployed and unemployed sitting at home in their pajamas using the power of

59
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:28.720
the internet and new trading platforms like Robinhood to destroy the Kings of

60
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:29.890
American finance.

61
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.300
We are never going to go back to the old ways of doing business and wall street

62
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.540
knows this. So what's their solution. It's one that we,

63
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.170
my friends must resist absolutely at all costs.

64
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.640
Now they know that they do not have a monopoly on manipulating the market.

65
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.230
They are going to do everything in their power to go after you and people like

66
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.880
me who are not on the side of the billionaire elite, as I laid out yesterday,

67
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.770
they are already going into overdrive on CNBC who started off yesterday by

68
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:04.060
inviting the literal CEO of the NASDAQ on to call for more

69
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.100
regulation. Let's take a listen to that. Again.

70
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.860
<v 3>The things that we're talking about is maybe misinformation and a pump and dumps</v>

71
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:14.050
and it's occurring on social media. Again, it just,

72
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.750
I'm wondering whether that's part of the same problem,

73
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.700
the type of regulation that, that, uh, that we finally need to, uh, to consider.

74
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.820
And like I said, we should always have a light touch with regulation, but

75
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.020
you're, you're seeing the way things can get started again.

76
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.660
And this is different and maybe it's Reddit. Maybe it's not Facebook,

77
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.890
but you're seeing the, the, the, the same situation. Th this point,

78
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.750
it's not about an election. It's not about a.

79
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.600
<v 1>Pause for a second pause for a second. He's also calling for regulation. Yes.</v>

80
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.190
They never call for regulation. He's super like him.

81
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:52.480
The last thing that guy wants in terms of like being able to manipulate the

82
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:55.090
market and make as much money as possible regulation.

83
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.800
So him calling for regulation is kind of hilarious and him saying that they're

84
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:04.570
manipulating it with social media, like this is literally what they do. Yep.

85
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.180
It's what they do. Yep. Keep going.

86
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.340
<v 3>There are interesting things happening that that seemed to be spawned to some</v>

87
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:17.110
extent, or at least at least blown out of proportion by social media again,

88
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.920
Medina.

89
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.271
<v 4>Well, I,</v>

90
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:22.150
I do think though that as we look at these new technologies that are there

91
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.880
available to everyone and including investors,

92
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.870
I think it's also important for regulators to understand that, you know,

93
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.100
manipulation is manipulation,

94
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:33.520
whether it's happening through a new technology medium or it's happening through

95
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.354
traditional mail.

96
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.220
I think it's just a matter of making sure that we understand what the behavior

97
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:39.551
is.

98
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:43.030
What's underpinning the behavior and working appropriately with the regulators

99
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:45.640
to, to, uh, to manage the situation.

100
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.210
<v 1>It looks like a female version of the blind scientist from contact with Jodie</v>

101
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:53.380
foster, Tommy, me, she doesn't pull up an image of that guy.

102
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.600
He's a famous on this clip have issues. He has Richard Ramirez teeth.

103
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.660
It's a nightmare contact contact with Jodie foster.

104
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.110
Go to images back the guy in the far, right? Yeah.

105
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.250
Oh, a little bit. Come on, give me a picture. Yeah. I'll give you that.

106
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.900
Come on right there. You gotta go back to her. No, they looked pretty similar.

107
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.950
Yeah. I get called

108
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.680
almost identical. So Chris, the cheek bones in the mouth,

109
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.390
they share that it's not him or her.

110
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.440
I don't mean to dead name or mis-gender okay. Keep playing it.

111
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.970
<v 4>Appropriately with the regulators to, to, uh, to manage the situation.</v>

112
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.100
<v 2>Yeah. You heard that correctly.</v>

113
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.450
The guy from CNBC who hates regulation is now calling for more regulation.

114
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.190
And the CEO of the head of one of the largest trading exchanges in the world is

115
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.700
agreeing with him. Notice when hedge funds manipulate markets,

116
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.670
when they screw over regular people in different companies.

117
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.960
When wall street requires billions of dollars in bailouts and floats from the

118
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.720
federal reserve, there isn't any call for more regulation,

119
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.010
but a couple of average Joes on the internet make money at the expense of a

120
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.740
billionaire hedge fund. Well, that just can't stand.

121
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.910
And I'm not exaggerating here just showing you one clip the idea across the

122
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:15.110
American elite right now,

123
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.310
is that what has happened with GameStop is unacceptable. Don't believe me,

124
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.050
check this out as GameStop and other stocks, soared Arthur Levitt, Jr.

125
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:26.390
He decided to weigh in. And if you don't know who that is,

126
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.400
it's the former sec chairman who literally presided over the.com

127
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:33.740
bubble and was appointed by bill Clinton,

128
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.460
who perhaps more than any president is responsible for much of the

129
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:40.760
financialization of our economy. Beginning in his administration,

130
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.280
Levitt wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg calling for a full agency investigation into

131
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:51.050
online stock trading platforms and said that social media is taking

132
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:53.270
advantage of users, behavioral psychology,

133
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.180
and pushing them into dangerous territory. Okay.

134
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.790
Maybe I don't even really disagree with that,

135
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.330
but doesn't it just tell you everything that this is what they want to

136
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:05.630
investigate now that this is what they want the government to do something

137
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:10.250
about. Now don't underestimate how mainstream this view is yesterday,

138
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.750
the white house press secretary said Janet Yellen is monitoring the situation.

139
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.480
Elizabeth Warren tweeted out that we needed more regulation.

140
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.740
The state securities regulator for the state of Massachusetts said gain stock

141
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.150
trading should be halted for 30 days. And the sec now says,

142
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.000
they're working with regulators to assess the situation,

143
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.680
review the activities and other participants, like I said, Hey,

144
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.210
maybe that's justified,

145
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.070
but you people are silent on the crimes of the actually influential people

146
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.190
who rig our economy on a daily basis.

147
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.840
You want a near perfect corollary billionaire investor, bill Ackman.

148
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.540
He went on CNBC in March,

149
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.560
2020 to give an emotional interview to say, hell is coming.

150
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.450
And that hotel stocks would go to zero.

151
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.840
His interview sparked a panic sell on wall street.

152
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:05.460
It is seen in retrospect as one of the precipitating events of that drop.

153
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.220
Guess what? At the exact same time,

154
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.050
right after that interview Ackman was buying billions of dollars in the

155
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.930
stock as it hit rock bottom. In fact.

156
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.413
<v 1>A.</v>

157
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.520
<v 2>Billion dollars in bets against the market as it was.</v>

158
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.790
<v 1>Okay. Let's pause. And there's going to billionaire man,</v>
