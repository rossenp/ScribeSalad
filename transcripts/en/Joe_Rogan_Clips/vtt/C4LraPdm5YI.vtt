00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So you.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 1>You first get on television,</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.260
you first do these six and then your magic evolves and your magic

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.880
goes from being just magic to some of the more insane things you've done.

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:19.370
Like standing in a block of ice for how long did you do it for 78, 63 hours?

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.240
Cause.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.940
<v 2>I'm always late. So I showed up late. So I missed like,</v>

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.790
what are the length of time I was supposed to do? So that's all,

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.360
but I'm always late. I made it here on time though. Didn't I? You were early.

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.190
Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. But bro,

11
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.970
I rode the motorcycle here and was flying because I had to,

12
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.020
I wanted to be on time.

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.430
<v 1>So I flew. Yeah. Um, the, the ice thing. Why,</v>

14
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:44.900
what made you decide to stand in a block of ice for 60 plus hours? I'll.

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.180
<v 2>Tell you that. So you were saying, how do you go from the.</v>

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.320
<v 1>Magic tricks to the extreme physical endurance and so studying.</v>

17
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.640
<v 2>Houdini and all that stuff.</v>

18
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.820
And then there's a poster of Houdini that I loved where he was. It was,

19
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.300
he was buried alive, but he never did the stunt. He died before he got to duke,

20
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:03.500
but he was going to be buried alive, underground in a coffin. So I stare at,

21
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.980
I love that poster since I was a kid. It's like in a magic books,

22
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:10.310
you see that poster in any way. So bill again,

23
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.100
the guy told you about bill collusion comes up to me and he's like,

24
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:15.470
what about this? And he shows me an image of a,

25
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.170
in the insecure that was buried alive for a month. He was like,

26
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:20.660
what if you pretend to be buried alive in central park,

27
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:23.990
we'll sneak you out and you'll come back a month later. And I was like,

28
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.820
I always wanted to do like Houdini, like things, but I never want to copy,

29
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.360
but that one he never did. So I was kind of like, well, that's interesting,

30
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.560
but what if instead of doing it the way he did it, what if I did it?

31
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.230
And everybody could see that I was buried alive.

32
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.400
So what if I was really just buried alive? Like, it can't be that hard.

33
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.460
He's like, yeah, you can't do that. And I was staying at his place.

34
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:50.090
So we got a coffin from Queens. We're actually dealing, was buried.

35
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:53.180
I bought a cough when we brought it back to his house and then I would just

36
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:56.120
practice sleeping in the coffin then suddenly I know.

37
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.040
But then suddenly I realize you don't eat food.

38
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:00.440
And then if you have a little thing to go to bathroom, I did four days,

39
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.590
like nothing. So I'm like, okay, I can do a week. And that was it. And then,

40
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.120
then I pushed the idea of doing the bird alive and convince people to let me do

41
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:08.830
it publicly.

42
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.280
And what's funny is like firemen and stuff like would come to the stunt in the

43
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:16.940
middle of a bite and they would shine like holograms at me and their lights and

44
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:18.950
stuff and they, oh, that's the ice. But,

45
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.240
and then they would assume that I wasn't actually in there. Okay. So here,

46
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.150
so back to this one. Well, well.

47
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.990
<v 1>Let's go, boom, but let's, let's not jump around. So the buried alive thing,</v>

48
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.200
where did you do it physically? Um, that was in New York.

49
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
<v 2>City on the west side. Uh, Trump had like this,</v>

50
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:40.370
a bunch of properties that he was developing and I was like, uh,

51
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.430
I want to be buried alive on one of your properties. Is that possible?

52
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:44.264
He's like, sure.

53
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.170
He just sent me his driver and I went around and that's where I did my first

54
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:51.400
thought. And it was, how could they see you though? And then Jimmy MetAware,

55
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.250
who I do, who liked? Yeah. So it was see-through but right.

56
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.100
And then we put six tons of water on top of it. So that's basically, and then,

57
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.770
so it was there. Well, there was hall. See those two big holes.

58
00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:06.870
So the oxygen was being, see the holes above my head.

59
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.620
So the air was being blown in and out,

60
00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:13.290
but it's pretty straightforward like that. One's not, to me,

61
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:16.260
not that impressive. Like if I said to you, you just laid there for a week.

62
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.530
Yeah. But you know what? The heart is the hard part. I mean,

63
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.700
short body and the lose weight. And I was like, but the hard part of it is, um,

64
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.870
th and you wouldn't, you would never anticipate this being the hard part,

65
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.760
but if you're not used to like peeing while standing in front of lots of people

66
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:36.690
staring at you, it's actually really hard. So, so I'd be burned alive.

67
00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:38.820
And I had to truckers to bond and all that stuff,

68
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.730
which is like a column with a catheter or whatever. And, um,

69
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.040
and people are there the whole time. Like it suddenly became like an event.

70
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.410
So there was never like, and I was, they were like, oh, we'll cover it.

71
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.790
So no one can see. I'm like, no.

72
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:54.420
Then people are going to think I'm sneaking in and out. So I had to learn.

73
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.190
So I would close my eyes.

74
00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:58.680
Like when you were a kid sleeping at you'd have those dreams,

75
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:03.120
I'd have batches of it. It would take me hours. I'd finally be able to pee.

76
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.540
Right. But that, and by the way, I didn't eat for a few weeks before,

77
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.840
so I had no food. So that was the other, wasn't an issue. But, um,

78
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.920
what happened by midway through the stunt people I'd be waving and smiling and

79
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.980
like pee. And it was like nothing, you know,

80
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:21.270
but these are things that you don't consider when you're practicing in your

81
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.853
often in your house.

82
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.320
<v 1>You didn't eat for how long? Two weeks before. Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.650
<v 2>But I was always into fasting. I read Sid Arthur as a kid,</v>

84
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.380
and I had done like a, a week with just water and, you know, new, all the new,

85
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:35.214
the body's really good.

86
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.350
<v 1>So you were comfortable with the fact that you were able to fast and that,</v>

87
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.460
that wouldn't be an issue.

88
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.640
And you were comfortable with the fact that you were getting air and where are

89
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:46.230
you drinking water from? How are you getting water?

90
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.640
<v 2>A little bit of water in there that I could suck through a thing like that.</v>

91
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.040
And that was fine. It was like, it was enough.

92
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.220
<v 1>How much water do you think you drank over the week that you were in there?</v>

93
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.490
<v 2>Uh, I don't know. They always say it was like just a little bit,</v>

94
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.580
but it was a good amount. Was like, uh, I dunno, probably

95
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.040
probably three liters a day or something.

96
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.210
They say he did tablespoons a lot, but no, it was, it was,

97
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.500
it was like a normal amount. So, and then by the way,

98
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.220
I did 44 days with nothing but water and I did nothing but pure H two O so it's

99
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:22.820
not even like it had minerals in it and body was full recovery.

100
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.780
And my starvation expert, who's like one of the top guys in the world in London,

101
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.650
my doctor at the end thought that I was cheating. So they put me on an ice.

102
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.590
<v 3>Filled water. So it was a company called.</v>

103
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.440
<v 2>H two O and their things it's just pure.</v>

104
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.310
<v 3>Yeah. This exact tilt. Right, right. Which.</v>

105
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.680
<v 2>Which is irrelevant by the way. But,</v>

106
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:47.600
so I had nothing but pure H2O for 44 days

107
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.250
lost 60 pounds.

108
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.390
BMI bone mass index dropped 33%.

109
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.730
<v 1>That's what I was getting at. No, no, it was bad.</v>

110
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.900
<v 2>No, it wasn't good. Yeah. It wasn't.</v>

111
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.280
But doctor thought I was cheating because he's an addition, by the way,

112
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.870
my friends that were with me that are, you know, magicians and the guy building,

113
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.040
they're like, you need to take these vitamins.

114
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.870
And they hand me a handful of sugary vitamins. And I'm like, no,

115
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.260
it's just because I, if I'm going to do it, I want to like, actually do it.

116
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.590
Right. Right. And, um, if I would have taken those vitamins,

117
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.490
I feel like my metabolism wouldn't have gone into starvation and I might've had

118
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:26.210
irreversible damage from it. So the fact that I actually did it,

119
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:30.200
I went into starvation mode and the body protects itself. That's interesting.

120
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:33.740
What I was saying is the starvation expert that now I have a paper published in

121
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.890
the new England journal medicine with them, which I'm pretty proud of it. But,

122
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.750
um, he, he didn't believe me.

123
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:42.320
So he put me on an IV and right away the phosphate levels reacted.

124
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:43.760
And I almost went into shock.

125
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.060
So I almost actually did die when they refit fed me.

126
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:51.350
So his papers called the refeeding syndrome. They say like after world war two,

127
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.290
when they rescued the, from the, from the camps, uh,

128
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.260
the Jews and everybody was starving, the camps. And they,

129
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.810
a lot of soldiers gave them like candy bars and stuff.

130
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:04.130
And all of a sudden their systems went into shock and they died from not being

131
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.143
re fed the right way.

132
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.160
<v 1>So what is the correct way to refeed someone, if they have any slowly.</v>

133
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.010
<v 2>Bring them back so that you don't have what happened to me,</v>

134
00:07:12.011 --> 00:07:16.330
which is phosphate levels go all crazy and very small amounts of food. Yeah.

135
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.830
But then two days later, I,

136
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.700
somebody sent me a trunk from Harrods full of food in low bird,

137
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.530
like a Fred at the, and I was giving it to all the nurses and doctors.

138
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.780
Cause I knew I shouldn't eat it. And I was trying to do it right then,

139
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.070
like in the middle of, at night,

140
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.030
I woke up and had like a bag of potato chips and then, um,

141
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.540
a bagel and I was right. It was like the most,

142
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.470
I also didn't go to the bathroom for a month and a half.

143
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.520
But think about that. So.

144
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.220
<v 1>It take you to recover from one of these things.</v>

145
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.580
<v 2>That one, I feel like I never fully recovered from, but</v>

146
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.040
I had an, I wouldn't recommend anybody does that like goes like super,

147
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:59.920
super long with no food. But, but by the way, so.

148
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.140
<v 1>The recovery, you don't think he ever recovered.</v>

149
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.150
<v 2>My, my body always goes like this now. It's always confused. When I like train,</v>

150
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:10.070
I go up down really quick, really easy. And it was since that.

151
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.680
<v 1>Your body freaked out because.</v>

152
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.450
<v 2>I feel like that, but there's no way to prove that. But, um.</v>

153
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.410
<v 1>That's a common thing though, with people cut weight for fights. Really? Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.650
They, they get to a certain point when they have kidney failure and yeah.

155
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:24.610
And then their body.

156
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.240
<v 2>Exactly. That's what happened to me. And I keep having problems with my kidneys.</v>

157
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.310
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And I have a spot on my kidney right now. Yeah,

158
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.110
yeah.

159
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.480
<v 1>Yeah. Wow. That's a, that's a real common one with guys. Uh, Daniel Cormier.</v>

160
00:08:39.481 --> 00:08:41.590
I actually had to drop out of the Olympics because of that.

161
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.180
I didn't know his kidneys failed. Yeah. Kidney failure is a big one with, uh,

162
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.650
fighters, kidney stones too. For a lot of guys. Who've cut. Wait. So your,

163
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.870
that was probably in your opinion,

164
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:56.760
the one that damaged you the most or left the most residual. So.

165
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.780
<v 2>The most difficult one was the ice by far the,</v>

166
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.500
the ice was a monster. And the reason why was because,

167
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.360
and now there's also something great about it. So it was a warm November.

168
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:11.370
So the air coming through was like, you know,

169
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.390
it happened to be a 68 degree three-day spread,

170
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.070
which led to the ice,

171
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:20.790
keep dripping the cold on me and it's radiating this way,

172
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.660
but I'm also standing up in one spot completely still, you can't sleep.

173
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.360
Cause if you fall asleep and the present to ice, you get frostbite,

174
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:29.070
you have to cut your skin off. Right.

175
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.280
So I'm staying completely awake the entire time.

176
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.170
And it's a difficult situation on our 55. Exactly.

177
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.340
Are I look back at all of it.

178
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:43.140
And my friends knew my eyes just go out and I'm now hallucinating.

179
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.120
Like you could never,

180
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:49.410
ever no hallucinogenic drug will ever give you those kinds of

181
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:53.850
hallucinations. And what was it at? First of all, it's amazing.

182
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.420
But it's also when it goes into that nightmare part, it's scary.

183
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.970
But there's also that amazing part of it.

184
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:02.520
And if you have people are after that stunt, now,

185
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.610
whenever I hallucinate on stunts, I have friends there that I say,

186
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.580
I'm going to start hallucinating, just talk me through it.

187
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.030
But so here's when I started realizing that I was hallucinating because you

188
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:15.450
don't know when you are. Right. Um, and by the way,

189
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:18.600
the one stunt than ever did was sleep deprivation. If you remind me,

190
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.260
I'll explain that whole thing, but I w I'll forget. But so, um,

191
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.730
so what happens is when I started realizing it is I need to know, uh,

192
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.990
like what time it is. Cause I'm done at 10:00 PM. Cause it was live on ABC.

193
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:34.210
So I'm like, I need to know how much longer I got to go through this. Like,

194
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.680
because it's getting tough. So in it's there, the glass, by the way,

195
00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:42.060
and my doorman would come and like news or whatever Fox news said,

196
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:46.770
David Blaine, um, is not really the, I, they did a special on it an hour long,

197
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:50.100
special on Fox saying that I was never in the ice.

198
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:53.850
And I had a double of me that was at the ice. I'm switching up and bound with

199
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.470
burgers.

200
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.780
<v 3>And reading. Yeah. No Fox.</v>

201
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.710
<v 2>TV station. Yeah. Yeah. So they did,</v>

202
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.710
but they did a one hour special that I was never in there. So my dorm,

203
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.810
they get away with doing that. I don't know. I don't care.

204
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:09.920
But listen to my dorm, my dorm man, who comes to this is the funny part though.

205
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.030
So my door man, that comes to see me, he he's, um,

206
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.080
he knows me so well and he was buried alive and he's so nice. Right.

207
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So he comes to visit me in New York and um, he,

208
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:25.040
he walks up to the ice and he sees me and he's looking at me all weird.

209
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.700
I wasn't hallucinating it. So it came at me all weird. Then he leaves it there.

210
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.430
But I go back, I was like, what's up? He's like

211
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.850
that. Are you sure that that was you and nice. Could that have been you?

212
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.070
I was like, what do you mean? He's like, okay, well it's, you know, so he,

213
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.020
we go on that special airs now he's convinced that it wasn't me.

214
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.290
And I.

215
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.880
<v 1>And especially as why you're still going to know that's after.</v>

216
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.230
But he already thinks.

217
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.990
<v 2>Because he doesn't believe it. My friends, my best friends,</v>

218
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:59.020
when I was buried alive, they didn't think I was really doing it.

219
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.170
They thought it was a tray. Right. So, so he, he asked me, he's like,

220
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.700
there's was that really you?

221
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:10.900
Because they said that you were a double of yourself and you were switching.

222
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.860
And I was like, Eddie, but you looked at me like, how,

223
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.570
if I have a twin brother, like, where is that identical twin brother. And why,

224
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.070
why would I switch up? So anyway, so back to the, um, back to the,

225
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.970
but I get to 55 hours. So I'm looking around and I need the time.

226
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.260
So I go like this, like, what time is it? And the guy goes

227
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.170
4 0 2. Yeah, too. So I'm like, okay,

228
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.130
that means we have like another six hours or whatever it is, right. By the way,

229
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:47.550
my time estimations are. So I'm like, okay, wait.

230
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.620
Or it might've been two of them. Wait, wait, wait. And I wait. And I'm indoors.

231
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:57.210
It's hard. I'm like, things are moving. Everything's weird. Spiders walking up.

232
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.660
People are like sitting in the ice from waiting, waiting.

233
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.950
Voices are talking to me and I'm talking back to right. But I'm waiting,

234
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.701
I'm waiting.

235
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:10.560
And I wait for like a few hours before I ask anybody the time again.

236
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.020
And I see somebody and I'm like

237
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.400
the guy and the guy goes.

238
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.640
<v 1>Okay, 4 0 3.</v>

239
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.880
<v 3>Oh no. And that's when it.</v>

240
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.250
<v 2>All crashed. Yeah. It was like, when that, when I,</v>

241
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.690
that connection and then the hallucinations were just rampant in my eyes were

242
00:13:30.691 --> 00:13:33.570
all crazy when the drill was when the chainsaw was coming through.

243
00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:34.560
I tried to grab her.

244
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.550
<v 3>Yeah. So see, look at that. Oh, you're gone.</v>

245
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.560
<v 2>Okay. But sudden,</v>

246
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.360
but now that I've learned that sleep deprivation is one of

247
00:13:45.361 --> 00:13:47.490
the most amazing ways.

248
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.210
If it's controlled to go to another place it's like that.

249
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.680
<v 1>No, but I want to get to that. But before we get to that, like,</v>

250
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.330
while you're in there, what are you doing? Occupy your mind? Like, how are you,

251
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.470
did you have, were you using meditation where you just thinking,

252
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.720
were you just winging it? Like so, okay.

253
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.260
<v 2>So for some of them, what I do a big P first of all, yeah.</v>

254
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:13.980
A lot of things you get that you have free time to think like there's no phones,

255
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.640
no distractions. So aside from the physical, but,

256
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.540
but the one thing that I use with everything is kind of like a breakdown of

257
00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:24.960
numbers. I'm like, okay, this much I have to get to this point.

258
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:27.510
Then when I get to this. But even when I run on a treadmill, Mike, okay.

259
00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:30.330
I have to get to this point, which means, let me get to the halfway point.

260
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:33.690
And I'll consider that when I'm holding my breath, I do same thing. Like, okay,

261
00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:37.710
I need to get to 15 minutes. So let me get to seven and I'll start at seven.

262
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.900
Then at seven, I'm like, okay, I'm at seven left.

263
00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:42.150
I have to get to another three and a half and three and a half.

264
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.540
And then what I always do is whenever I'm training, I always go past it.

265
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.840
So it's the same thing. So like when I'm running a treadmill, I'm like,

266
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:52.760
if I have to do, let's say like, you know, 3.1, whatever it is,

267
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.530
I set that as my target.

268
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:58.340
But then I always go like another half a mile past it because I won't,

269
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.580
you can't quit before because then they'll be in the mindset that okay,

270
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.030
I can stop before. So like anything that I do, I use numbers to get there.

271
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:08.090
I get halfway. And then I push the Gulf further every single time,

272
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:12.020
no matter what, which is. So it's a mathematical system.

273
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.600
<v 1>Right? So you're, you're,</v>

274
00:15:13.601 --> 00:15:16.960
you don't necessarily have any sort of meditative techniques.

275
00:15:16.961 --> 00:15:18.640
You're just concentrating on the numbers.

276
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.980
<v 2>For breath holding all the time.</v>

277
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.580
Every time I do a breath hold now the ice was kind of,

278
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.000
there was like a breathing thing and I didn't really know much about it back

279
00:15:28.001 --> 00:15:30.640
then, but I was like more like fighting it. Like, what is it.

280
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.970
<v 1>Like on your ankles or your knees and your back, everything swells.</v>

281
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.070
<v 2>Up like a demon really bad and all that stuff.</v>

282
00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:39.220
And the pain is excruciating and unbearable, but yeah, it's, I mean,

283
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.480
you're waiting and.

284
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.870
<v 1>You didn't have any residual effects of that.</v>

285
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.170
Just my ankles and legs were really swollen so.

286
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.330
<v 2>Longer than that, but yeah. Yeah.</v>

287
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.180
<v 4>Now, has anybody ever tried to break that?</v>

288
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.830
<v 2>Uh, I don't know. I hope not.</v>

289
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.820
Not cause I w I don't care about how I just don't want anybody to hurt

290
00:15:57.821 --> 00:15:58.654
themselves.

291
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.960
<v 1>Imagine, like, someone does something so high profile, like you did that,</v>

292
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.390
that people would be like, Hmm, I'm going to try that.

293
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.350
<v 2>I mean, I think it's too weird. So people aren't really like, oh, I want to do,</v>

294
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.940
but there's billions of people.

295
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.420
<v 1>I would imagine that someone would step in and try to emulate that.</v>

296
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.920
Obviously it was. So I pray.

297
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.130
<v 2>Not. And that's why I pray. My daughter never becomes a magician,</v>

298
00:16:18.131 --> 00:16:21.520
even though she's so amazing at it, because if she started doing these things,

299
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.850
I like, if she's going to bump her knee of like, I have a heart attack.

300
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.550
<v 1>That's the problem with being a parent, right?</v>

301
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.860
The things that make you amazing are your ability to overcome adversity.

302
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:35.890
And then you shelter your children from adversity. You know,

303
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.140
it's all my favorite people are all,

304
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.320
they all came from a very tumultuous childhood.

305
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.610
They all came from like turmoil. And no one wants that for their child.

306
00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:48.670
You want to protect your children weird. Okay.
