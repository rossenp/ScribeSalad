00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.510
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I remember cause I was joking with them.</v>

2
00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:09.620
I remember a long time ago, the grill, 93, this old Dick Doherty room.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.730
I remember that joint.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.930
So two guys were about ready to go at it and the club and the bouncer gets them

5
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.880
outside. Okay.

6
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.940
And this guy is trying to say his point of view and he put his hand on his

7
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.180
shoulder. He goes, he goes, uh, he goes, no, all I was trying to do. He barely,

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.700
barely went like that on his shirt. And he goes, okay, first of all,

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.290
don't touch me. That's what the bouncer said.

10
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:31.490
And just immediately it was here and then it went to here and then those two

11
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.920
guys started yelling at each other. And then within,

12
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.920
I don't know what the he just twisted the guy up and took them out.

13
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.450
And I forget who the I was with. We will die and laughing.

14
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.380
And it just became a catchphrase between us when he would come up. Hey bill,

15
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.940
you're working this weekend. Okay. First of all, don't touch me. Just how you.

16
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.990
<v 1>Just, you immediately just escalate it where.</v>

17
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.810
<v 0>It just becomes a, what the. And then first of all,</v>

18
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:58.370
don't touch me from 90% of guys is immediately going to put you in your ego or

19
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.850
it's like, oh. Now, now he's on top of me and I'm the. I gotta,

20
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.540
I gotta at least get a little, uh, get his eyebrow level.

21
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.540
I have to come back with something else. It was inevitable.

22
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:10.850
The second he said that, first of all, don't touch me.

23
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.080
I did like the three slide steps down because I learned that young watching

24
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:16.490
fights, you know.

25
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.220
<v 1>You don't want to have a really good seat. Cause it's like a tornado.</v>

26
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:21.200
You don't know where it's going to go. And you think,

27
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:24.710
you think you like 20 feet away? I haven't met, met me.

28
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.520
<v 0>At a Bruins game, the old Boston garden. And it was like one of those, you know,</v>

29
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.510
just everybody's smoking. I probably couldn't smoke in the garden at that point.

30
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.250
But I just remember like, like smokey bars and.

31
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.780
So we went in there and everybody was hammered.

32
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:38.300
I was hammered drinking like half and reference, remember the green death,

33
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.960
right? Like this was like 6% alcohol. So, um,

34
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.580
some like one of those two rows of fans fighting, which is always great.

35
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.900
Cause like the people that are a row up or just throwing down these guys pounds,

36
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.590
there's always a loafer lay in there. Right. Um, Mike, Milbury picking it up.

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.880
So I remember the cops ran up there and I ran up to,

38
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:03.320
to watch the fight and they started grabbing guys and coming down the stairs and

39
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:05.480
it was the Boston garden and there was nowhere to go.

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.600
And I just remember this big cop bounding down the stairs.

41
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.270
He literally had a handful of this guy's neck.

42
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.910
It was like his whole neck and his juggling, this guy was.

43
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.003
<v 1>I just remember.</v>

44
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.770
<v 0>He was going to try and try to push me down the stairs,</v>

45
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.770
trying to push me down the stairs. And he came down like, and I was trying.

46
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.990
<v 1>To get out of the way. And I forget, I think the guy who.</v>

47
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.590
<v 0>He had grabbed, like his knee hit me in the back. You know, I just,</v>

48
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.020
I just got caught by the debris of this guy running by.

49
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:33.410
And that's when I kind of learned like, uh, you know, when, to,

50
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.400
how to watch your flight,

51
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.250
which you watch your flight and you're looking at your exits. Cause like I said,

52
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:40.490
it's like, you don't know where it's going to go. And uh,

53
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.040
I had learned that lesson. So when I saw that guy say that, uh, uh,

54
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.830
first of all, don't touch me. I was just like, okay, slide over here.

55
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.770
But some other people settle in, in front of me. I can do.

56
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.030
I liked them when that.

57
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.980
<v 2>That's the same as if yeah.</v>

58
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.880
You want to be above slightly above looking down at all the altercations

59
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.230
to get a better viewpoint there. Anyway. Yeah.

60
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 0>I suck at it. I stopped fighting in like junior high. That was it. I just,</v>

61
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.780
I knew, I mean, I just knew I was like, this is not my thing.

62
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.300
I can't slip a punch. I am slow as.

63
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.650
<v 1>I got a big head. I got to target.</v>

64
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.000
<v 0>This is not going to go three rounds. It's just not, um,</v>

65
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.390
I fought up until like six around sixth grade.

66
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.770
I think I probably had my last one.

67
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.520
And then all of a sudden kids started getting a hundred twenty,

68
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.881
a hundred thirty, a hundred forty pounds.

69
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:32.800
And they started being blood and people missing a couple of days of school after

70
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.690
a beat down. I was just like, you know what? A kick?

71
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.370
I think I'll be the funny guy.

72
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.100
<v 2>It's weird. How things go sideways like that when there's a feeling in the air,</v>

73
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.470
when whenever chaos breaks out like that.

74
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.560
And it's a real melee is a feeling in the air. Like, it's just like,

75
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.830
you feel it. It's like, oh, this is nuts. Like this is,

76
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.510
this is really dangerous. Yeah. There's a, um, uh,

77
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.420
a mob mentality feeling that you get. It's real weird when things go crazy.

78
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.250
<v 0>I remember it took me, uh, having to leave Boston for about seven years.</v>

79
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:09.330
I was gone for seven years before I finally walked into a bar and just felt the

80
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:11.730
normal energy of, I think the city's changed a lot,

81
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.630
but like that sort of that tail end of the craziness,

82
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.880
I walked into a bar and you could just feel it. It's like,

83
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.170
somebody's going to get suckered. Like not now. It's about 90 minutes away.

84
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.070
You can just feel the level of drunkness the energy.

85
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.700
<v 2>Well guys would go out, looking for fights. Some guys would go out,</v>

86
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.040
looking for fights. Yeah, I know. There's a guy.

87
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.010
He used to train with Mike Blake. He used to work at the rat scholar.

88
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:37.680
He was a bouncer. He would go, he would wrap his hands.

89
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.630
He would wrap his hands on his way to work.

90
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.950
<v 0>I knew a guy. I knew a guy tape, his wrist and.</v>

91
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.750
I knew a guy who was a bouncer and he used to bring a mouthpiece. So we go to,

92
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.690
uh, to work, but he used to carry it all the time.

93
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.270
And I remember when he would get, when he would get in a fight, he would,

94
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.360
it was, it was something where he would, it was a Malka who biked down.

95
00:04:57.361 --> 00:05:00.660
It wasn't like what you guys were, but it was totally psyched.

96
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:03.120
The other guy out, like he would come out and he would just put this thing in.

97
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:05.250
And the guy would be like, this guy brought equipment, like.

98
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.240
<v 1>Is going on here. And I remember.</v>

99
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.900
<v 0>One time he got, he got suckered. He knew it was gonna be a fight.</v>

100
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:14.430
And I figured, well, for some dumb reason,

101
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:17.430
he sat down on the stairs and the guy was standing above him.

102
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.130
And one of his friends jumped down and just punched him.

103
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.860
And I saw the mouthpiece. It was like busted Douglas Tyson.

104
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.520
I saw his mouthpiece fly towards us. And then just,

105
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.720
I sh I shouldn't tell these stories cause why? I don't know. Cause I, you know,

106
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:35.310
it's my version of what it was a long, long, like 30 women names.

107
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.520
I was like 30 years ago. And what happened was we were

108
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.520
in an off-campus apartment and I can't believe, want to tell a story.

109
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.130
I'm gonna tell a quick version, uh.

110
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.810
<v 3>Tell the overs. No.</v>

111
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.300
<v 0>Two of my buddies left to go upstairs. It was one of those, you know,</v>

112
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.010
those old Boston, it looked almost like a three family house,

113
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.530
but it wasn't one of those big ones that has all apartments in it. Right?

114
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.420
So they left the party.

115
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:07.220
We were on in the first floor and then they went upstairs and like

116
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.940
20 minutes, they came back. One of my buddy's shoulders was separated.

117
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.020
The other guy, fat lip.

118
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.860
And he had a flat top to him and we had this big gash coming right down here and

119
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.550
blood coming down his face. And we were like, what the happened?

120
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.070
What the happened? We just asked this guy for drinking.

121
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.510
The whole party started beating on us.

122
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.240
So this whole mob goes up the stairs to go fight the

123
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:33.770
party. Right. And I'm going upstairs. Like, what the am I doing my big head?

124
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.550
I'm going to get knocked out here, but I have to go cause of my friends.

125
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:40.940
So we go up there and uh, we hear the party.

126
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.090
So my buddy, the mouthpiece guy,

127
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.020
like the most innocent voice ever knocks on the door, he goes, Hey, he's like,

128
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:50.660
is there a party going on in there? Right. And the door opens up.

129
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:54.260
And it was like a west wild west movie, like a saloon fight.

130
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.760
Just haymakers. I remember, I didn't even want to go in. I was so scared.

131
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.500
Cause I was like, oh my God, this is going to be nuts.

132
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:03.590
And just the mob just sent me in and it was just like,

133
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.670
everybody's just throwing.

134
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:08.540
I remember this dude jumping over my back punching face. Right.

135
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.720
And the smoke clears and it all settles. You know, it was, I was like 15,

136
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:16.790
second melee and it all settles.

137
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.870
And we look at the party and there's like six or seven guys,

138
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.680
six or seven girls in is like a board game. That's tipped over.

139
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.860
And we had gone to the wrong party. Swear to God.

140
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:32.360
I know this sounds like a joke. The real party where they got hit was upstairs.

141
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.510
And I don't know, I don't remember what happened, but they,

142
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.180
they were actually rich kids and they sued my friends for going in,

143
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:41.690
whatever the dumb they did. We all went into the wrong party.

144
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.950
And they were in there having like a couples thing and they were playing like

145
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.950
monopoly or something. And all of a sudden there was a knock on the door. Hey,

146
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:52.040
is there a party? And then everybody just came running and.

147
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.980
<v 2>I can imagine them.</v>

148
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.400
<v 0>That's what I'm saying. That's why I didn't want to tell. Cause I felt,</v>

149
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:01.210
I felt really like, yeah. I felt back.

150
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.470
<v 2>When I was in high school,</v>

151
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.580
the first real brawl that I ever saw was when I was like

152
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.220
17. I think it was a senior in high school.

153
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.380
And there was a rich kid that moved into the neighborhood.

154
00:08:11.381 --> 00:08:14.440
He wanted to make friends. So he put on this crazy party.

155
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.940
He just invited everybody.

156
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.530
So kids from all kinds of different high schools were coming. Yeah. Newton,

157
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:24.220
north Newton, south a bunch of kids from all sorts of other places. And uh,

158
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.840
I happened to be at the right place at the right time when I saw it pop off at

159
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.410
people were already robbing this guy.

160
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.070
I saw people taking stuff out of bedrooms and running down the stairs with it.

161
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.130
It was real sketchy. Cause it was way too many people for this guy's part.

162
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.510
But then this girl I still to this day, don't remember what she did.

163
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.020
She either slap this kind of phase or she threw a drink in his face.

164
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.930
I don't remember. I think she slapped him, but I,

165
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.980
what I remember is he Uncorked up perfect. Right-hand on her.

166
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.380
He know how to punch. Like I remember thinking, wow,

167
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:57.510
this guy is trained because he, he snapped it. Joe,

168
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.540
always the commentator. Listen, I've been doing it for a long time,

169
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.750
but whatever she did, I'm pretty sure she slapped him. But he didn't [inaudible]

170
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.380
it was a perfect right hand. Hit her right in the face. Her head goes back.

171
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.030
His guy behind her catches her. She's totally unconscious. And then

172
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.920
chaos chairs flying bodies,

173
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:25.700
piling it up and I'm on the stairs. So I'm watching this through the railings.

174
00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:28.400
I see the guy punched the girl as I'm coming up the stairs.

175
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:33.290
I see it all play out. I'm like, holy. And I'm like, I gotta get out of this.

176
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.190
And there was pile. I didn't, I didn't hit anybody. And nobody hit me. I,

177
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.930
it was like a movie like, excuse me, pardon me? Crawling out. I

178
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.710
dodged everything. Meanwhile, uh, I was fighting at the time.

179
00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:48.680
I was traveling to tournaments all over the country and fighting.

180
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.980
So my friends were looking for me. They're like, you know, go get Joe.

181
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.780
And there's piles of people brawling and I'm just duck in the piles and that,

182
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.390
and then I ran into my friend, Jimmy and I'm like, where is everybody?

183
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.180
And we grabbed our friends and got in the car and drove off and we were laughing

184
00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:04.460
our asses off. But it was like when we left,

185
00:10:04.461 --> 00:10:06.770
the cops were just starting to arrive. There was piles of her,

186
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.170
beating the out of each other on the lawn.

187
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.040
<v 0>My friend, my friend who separated his shoulder in that fight,</v>

188
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.740
we popped it back in and he went back up,

189
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.900
threw a punch with the same arm and missed it, came out again.

190
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:23.540
And I remember him flopping on the ground, like a fish out of water.

191
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.320
And afterwards we sent him like, do, why didn't you throw the other hand?

192
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.920
And he goes, cause I wanted this hand to get its revenge. I sweat.

193
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.170
He had made his part of his body, like a karate movie.

194
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.130
<v 1>Like to avenge shoulder's death.</v>

195
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.550
<v 0>And I have to tell you something when people, uh, talk about, you know,</v>

196
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:48.290
you're a funny comedian and blah, blah,

197
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.120
the characters that I grew up with and what I loved about what they did and what

198
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:56.450
they said was they weren't trying to be funny. Like he was dead.

199
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.600
<v 1>Serious refridge for this part. Yeah.</v>

200
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.950
<v 0>And then we would drive it home hammered and we would three abreast,</v>

201
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.690
uh, in, in the, uh, the, uh, the pickup truck.

202
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.930
It was this guy's dad's truck. And he had the flat top.

203
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:15.440
So he's got dried blood on his forehead and we're just driving home and nobody's

204
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.274
saying anything.

205
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.110
And the dude in the middle has got these sunglasses on and he's just sitting

206
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:23.330
there like this. And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere,

207
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:28.070
he just goes like that scared the out of me. And I didn't,

208
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:31.400
I was like, dude, what the are you doing? And he goes, oh, sorry. He goes,

209
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.110
he goes, I took a little acid. He goes, I was looking at this bug.

210
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.110
He could, it goes, I thought it was on the windshield.

211
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.750
It goes, it turned out. It was on the inside of my glasses.

212
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.380
I don't know if that was true, but two there's only like,

213
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.320
I there's no way you could ever reenact how much he flipped it.

214
00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:55.120
Like how much you would freak out on asset. If you thought a bug was over there.

215
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.510
But then your mind told you that it was on the inside of your glasses.

216
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.980
And I just remember all three of us just crying, laughing,

217
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:07.510
driving home at this and just, just the whole situation.

218
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:11.890
And that was like, that was like every weekend of my life for like,

219
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.520
um, probably like two and a half, three years,

220
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.350
every single weekend. And we used to go in to a, this,

221
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.300
there was this club and uh, this bar and Chelsea without board. Yeah.

222
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.460
W I got to it. I was such a baby face.

223
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:30.340
That was the only place where he gets served. Right. So it's a rough place.

224
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.840
Yeah, it was. Yeah, it was, it was. Yeah. And they were like selling a

225
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.080
blow out of there. So they didn't give a.

226
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.830
If you look like you were 12 years old, like I was, when I go up to our auto,

227
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:44.440
my, my vodka Collins was like the only role you,

228
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.430
um, I wasn't of age, like 19 or 20, probably 20.

229
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.530
And I would go in there and I just remember one time standing outside that bar.

230
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.630
And there was this dude who looked like Rob Helford from Judas priest, just,

231
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.910
totally gacked out of his mind, standing in front of his motorcycle.

232
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.170
And he was telling this story about riding his bike and his drug thing.

233
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:14.980
He got stuck. He just kept saying, I'd go around the apex,

234
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.910
go around the apex, go around the apex right now, hammered.

235
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.150
And I'm like making fun of the guy in front of him, to my buddy.

236
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:24.880
I'm looking at my buddy and I'm so face I go and going around the apex,

237
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.910
I've gone around the apex and he's hitting me. Cause the guy staring at me.

238
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.680
Oh yeah, no, it was, it was a, uh, and I didn't underst like,

239
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.250
cause I never did Coke, so I didn't understand what was going on.

240
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.550
I'm gonna leave it at that. I didn't understand what was going on,

241
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.300
but all I know is I just seem to be the guy that wanted to go home first.

242
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.060
I'll.

243
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.670
<v 2>Leave it at that. That was a dangerous place. Boston was.</v>

244
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.163
<v 0>No I had,</v>

245
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.620
this is when I figured out what the was going on was one time I went into the

246
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:55.670
bathroom by myself to take a leak. And it was one of those things you walk in,

247
00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:00.090
there was a sink, there was a standup funeral. And then there was a, a stall,

248
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.860
which just had one toilet. And I walked in and there was two legs guys in.

249
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.130
Then I was like, what the those guys do. Right.

250
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.170
So my already out and I'm taking a and they opened the

251
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.830
thing. Cause it didn't have a latch opened up.

252
00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:17.700
And they had like the F they were doing blow and I was taking a cause it was

253
00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:20.220
weird. It was two guys in there and I kind of glanced over as I'm already.

254
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.880
I look over and this guy's all hammered and like a little werewolf's like,

255
00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:24.930
what the are you looking.

256
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.850
<v 3>At? No, it's just like pee.</v>

257
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.340
<v 0>Didn't wash. My hands was after that one. No, there was a lot, there was a lot.</v>

258
00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:38.580
I don't know why, because a lot of like,

259
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.860
like easy targets really got hit and I was beyond an easy time and somehow I

260
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:48.510
just never, I, I, you know, I never asked I, yeah, I did.

261
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.090
I did. Cause I already got really, uh, I was not as tough as my friends were.

262
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:57.530
My friends were lunatics, you know, but uh, you know, my, my grade was cool,

263
00:14:57.531 --> 00:15:01.490
but like the grade above me in grade below me, they were like some, they were.

264
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.570
<v 2>Crazy,</v>

265
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.450
crazy friends that grew up in other places they would say they didn't

266
00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:09.100
have the same amount of fight stories.

267
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.370
I think Boston is a particularly fighty place. You know what I'm saying? I.

268
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.220
<v 0>Don't know. Yeah. There was something going on. But I mean,</v>

269
00:15:18.221 --> 00:15:23.140
I think a lot of those east, like New York and uh, this, thing's going out. Um,

270
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.850
a lot of those, uh,

271
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.620
like I find the people in like new England,

272
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.430
long island tri-state area, it's all sort of the same.

273
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:38.350
<v 2>Savage Savage children of immigrants. That's what it is.</v>

274
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.190
Yeah. But you go out to the.

275
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.640
<v 0>Midwest and that's like German, a lot of Slavic people, Polish people.</v>

276
00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:46.690
So I mean, that's, I don't know. I think they just had more space out there.

277
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.830
So it wasn't as intense. You weren't so like packed in.

278
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.550
<v 2>In a cornfield. There's something about Boston though. In particular,</v>

279
00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:59.050
I think even more so than New York, Boston was just a lot of fights. Man.

280
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.120
My boxing coach got his finger bitten off on a fight. He was on PCP,

281
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.090
got bit his finger off. And uh,

282
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.590
he had his toe removed and replaced his finger with a toe.

283
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.350
I tell you this. Now I remember they, that was, that was the move back then.

284
00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:18.610
So he had it curved permanently so that he could still throw ride hooks.

285
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.880
So his, uh, his, when you would shake his hand,

286
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.820
he would always give you one of these. He was like, yeah.

287
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.800
<v 0>No, the guy from Boston too, he had this weird looking nose and some guy it bid,</v>

288
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.130
bid it off and have it reattached guys last years, dude.

289
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:35.140
That's why I'm saying why, you know.

290
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.510
<v 1>Smart around sixth grade. I was just like, yeah,</v>

291
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:41.440
this is like the common blood sport. Like I think I'm going to try to.

292
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.620
<v 0>Be funny here, but yeah, there was a lot of, um,</v>

293
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.690
those all also a lot of, you know, the sports scene back in Boston is just, uh,

294
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.680
was insane. Wow.
