00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.840
<v 1>A big, uh, step forward, a big improvement was the hypnosis.</v>

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.120
The whole process of hypnosis is a sort of a deep

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.600
relaxation at the same time. You're confronting this,

5
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.720
these memories that helped a lot.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.070
<v 2>The problem that people have have with some hypnosis sessions is that you can be</v>

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.550
led into false memories.

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.190
<v 1>True. And I think that does happen. I think, you know, having been at many,</v>

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.070
many, uh, UFO gatherings,

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.390
I think some people are mistaken about their experience. Um,

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.780
I believe, and this is just my personal opinion on down. I, I,

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.100
I try to stick strictly to what I experienced and then

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.700
my own mus my own philosophy that I've had 45 years to develop. Uh,

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.620
I, I think that probably some people do have extremely unique,

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.090
uh, dreams that seems so real that, uh,

16
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.170
the actual physical event didn't happen. And I've,

17
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.210
I've tried to argue with people about how, um,

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.170
evil their intentions would be, you know, and I'm saying, uh, you know,

19
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.370
the decades that we've been having these sightings, if they,

20
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:24.360
with that sort of technology want to, uh, replace us on this planet,

21
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.040
we never know what hit us. No, I, I, I don't think that. And actually,

22
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.400
I think they're so advanced that if there's sightings, it's not an accident,

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.360
it's not like they slap their forehead. Ugh. Humans spotted me again.

24
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.920
I have to be more careful next time, you know? No, I,

25
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.510
I think they'd be perfectly capable of being undetected. We never have any,

26
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.910
I think these little glimpses are probably, uh,

27
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.110
a generalized,

28
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.470
a customization that we might need as a species, but maybe on the other hand,

29
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:59.550
there's some more individual interest.

30
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.830
And I used to be really skeptical. I'd hear stories.

31
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.740
People were describing them as having some particular interest in them.

32
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.300
And I think I'd tell 'em, you know,

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.100
that'd be like them walking by Anthi and saying, you know,

34
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.460
I think I'll have a conversation with that little aunt right there. Right. Uh,

35
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.780
uh, humans are a bunch of savages, but at the same time, I,

36
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.130
I believe they probably do have &lt;affirmative&gt; if you saw one,

37
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.170
when you were eight years old and you see one as an adult, uh,

38
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.004
they know it's you,

39
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.050
their ability to process data and retain it and store it is beyond anything we

40
00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:38.730
can imagine. I think we're on the verge of that kind of, uh,

41
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.640
paradigm shift with, uh, something I would call the, uh,

42
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.240
computer brain interface.

43
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the minute we can do that kind of thing. Uh, it's uh,

44
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.960
kind of scary about the possibilities, but, uh,

45
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.120
I've been at conferences where people talk about these beings as being

46
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.840
predatory or evil. Uh,

47
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.360
one guy was trying to tell me that they capture people,

48
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.040
dissect 'em and dump their body. And I said, oh, okay.

49
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.600
Name one. And he goes, well, so and so, and I go, no, no,

50
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.110
not the guy who puts this out there.

51
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.350
Who's the victim who was found, cut to pieces. And then he,

52
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.830
I said, so name one. And he gives me another name.

53
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.950
It was still somebody who's promoting this theory. Uh, and he,

54
00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:35.110
he just didn't get, I said, who's, what's the name of the victim? And he,

55
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:38.070
he couldn't come up with one. So I'm, I'm skeptical about that.

56
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.700
<v 2>Well, anytime there's a fantastic subject,</v>

57
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:44.420
whether it's UFOs or psychics or Bigfoot,

58
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:49.380
or yet you find these people that just wanna believe, you know, and it's,

59
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.820
uh, very disheartening. There's something about that. Like,

60
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.380
it's hard to separate truth from fantasy.

61
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.260
That's true with a lot of these folks and that's.

62
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.690
<v 1>And I think there's a lot of fantasy and delusion going on. Yeah. And, uh,</v>

63
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.330
I have encountered other people that I do have, uh, uh,

64
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.330
do believe had legitimate experiences and experiences, but, uh,

65
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.283
um,

66
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.290
I wouldn't consider them in the majority and that's an unpopular view.

67
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.920
<v 2>But, uh, no, I, I share that view, you know,</v>

68
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.680
I'm not completely skeptical, but I'm skeptical enough. I just,

69
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.440
I also know that it's in,

70
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.320
it's an aspect of human nature where people want to tell stories that

71
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:36.200
make them unique without actually having to have done anything special in their

72
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:37.120
life. They want to be special.

73
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.990
And some people tell stories that make them out to be very special because

74
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:46.550
they've been chosen to have this unique experience with an extraterrestrial you

75
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:49.470
haven't, they have, and it, it, it makes them,

76
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.830
it satisfies these delusions of grandeur that some yeah. And.

77
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.190
<v 1>I, people personally try to downplay that aspect of it. I say,</v>

78
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.300
I really favor the idea that this was an accident.

79
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.780
It was precipitated by my foolish move of getting too close.

80
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.460
I believe they probably just took me aboard in order to correct damage that, uh,

81
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:16.420
they were, uh, part of that, uh, uh,

82
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.860
was even unexpected for them.

83
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.980
<v 2>So did you have physical damage that you could see?</v>

84
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.050
<v 1>Uh, no, but, uh,</v>

85
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.370
one thing that leads me to think that all of the repairs they might have done

86
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.090
weren't complete was my initial, uh,

87
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.370
EEG brainwave scan.

88
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.610
And this was done at the same hospital where Muhammad Ali did his,

89
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.320
and it was very, uh, what do you call, uh,

90
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:49.240
regular what's the term? Um, um, double blind,

91
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.920
uh, Dr. Candel did not tell the technician what I was in there for mm-hmm

92
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.100
&lt;affirmative&gt;.

93
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.840
And so he wasn't looking for some particular thing would support or deny my

94
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.520
experience. So he just, uh, described an unusual pattern,

95
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.880
uh, in the brain that in another brain wave scan years later,

96
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.000
wasn't there anymore. So, uh, what.

97
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.160
<v 2>Was this unusual pattern?</v>

98
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.350
<v 1>I'm trying to think of the exact wording.</v>

99
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.510
It was a BI synchronous wave alternating from front

100
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.910
to back. Uh, I remember those words,

101
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.270
but I have, uh, the report for both from both EEGs.

102
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.220
So I've been, uh, interested in finding someone who might have, uh,

103
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.220
been hit by lightning or, uh, you know,

104
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.460
some electrician that raised up against a wire and had a,

105
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.980
a huge amount of energy come through the brain and,

106
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.260
and see if an AEG compares to this weird pattern that they're

107
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.010
describing there. But, uh, uh,

108
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.010
there's a lot of speculation opened and I of course have done trying to figure

109
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:07.170
out why, what, uh, happened there. And there's, uh, some amazing,

110
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.610
uh, things that, uh, sometimes, you know,

111
00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:15.490
I try to stick to the stuff I can document stuff that, uh,

112
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.560
where I have other witnesses, um,

113
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.680
and that, you know, documentable that's, that's what I, uh, go for it. I,

114
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.920
I have this information concerning the EEG documents of it,

115
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.773
you know.
