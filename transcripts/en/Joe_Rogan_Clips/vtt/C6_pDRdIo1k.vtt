00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.890
<v 1>What is stopping particularly people from</v>

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:08.724
the left,

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.200
including intellectuals from recognizing the differences

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.630
that there are differences in people that follow

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.810
the peaceful version of the religion,

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.730
and then people that follow the more radical version of the religion that

8
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.710
wants to convert people. Like what, what,

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.600
what is stopping them from recognizing that this is an issue because

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
it's, it's almost like an agreed upon

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.550
reluctance to discuss it,

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
to acknowledge it and to automatically classify any discussion as

13
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:53.430
Islamophobic. And I've seen this labeled this,

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.590
this label put on you, that you are Islamophobic. Yeah.

15
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.180
<v 0>So the term Islamophobia is obviously very much a Western term.</v>

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.690
It's an opportunity opportunistic term. Um,

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640
the worst has gone woke and the, uh,

18
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
they feel, uh, uh,

19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
an intense regrets for some of the things that were done by

20
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:25.920
the ancestors.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.540
And so you have names like homophobia,

22
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.260
uh, sexism and so on.

23
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.330
And Islamophobia is,

24
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:41.220
I would say a term that is put right in there to explode to that situation.

25
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.630
It's, it's, uh, in my, the way I see it is it's an artificial term,

26
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.690
but let's set that aside and let's see why it is that

27
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
Western leaders go along with

28
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.410
the assertion. That Islam is a religion of peace. There's nothing to see here.

29
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.810
It's just a small group of people who have lost their way

30
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.950
and they would have been violent anyway. But in, in general,

31
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:15.660
Islam is a religion of peace. Number one, a lot of leaders,

32
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.840
contemporary Western leaders.

33
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.390
They don't know much about religion, even their own,

34
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.780
and they don't want to. I mean, you could find out,

35
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.740
you could be ignorant of something, pick up a few books and just find out.

36
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.780
I think number two,

37
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:38.610
there is a sense that because the west is a really powerful

38
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:43.290
way, it's matters economically powerful, more powerful than any Islamic country,

39
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.950
militarily, more powerful, diplomatically, more powerful.

40
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.590
It is almost that parent child relationship where

41
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.390
it is. We'll just let them come along. They'll grow up.

42
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.010
They'll come to our way of seeing

43
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.300
if they want to believe that Islam is a religion of peace. Let's,

44
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.160
let's say it's alone. Let's come up. Let's do along with them with some people.

45
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.750
I think that is the case.

46
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.270
And then along came ISIS and they saw that you couldn't do that.

47
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.450
And you are now dealing with people who truly believe.

48
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.150
And I think it was a matter of time before people in Washington and Berlin and

49
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.460
London and so on thought, wait a second. It's not only that they believe it.

50
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.180
It is in the Quran. It's in the Hadith. It's in the history of Islam.

51
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.830
We better do something about that.

52
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.450
That's when you start to see a shift in how

53
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.120
the confrontation or the clash of values is

54
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.090
approached. The latest example, if you let me,

55
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.340
is the president of France in France for the last

56
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.750
20, 30, 40 years, they were saying, there's nothing to see here.

57
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.440
Islam has evolved. It's just like Christianity.

58
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.830
It's either a religion of peace or it's irrelevant altogether.

59
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.580
All religions are going to go away. We are, we are,

60
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.190
we're now living in the post religion age

61
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.850
in 2021,

62
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.710
there is a law right now that has gone through the law house of France.

63
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.660
And it is being debated in the Senate where they're talking about,

64
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.910
if that law gets passed,

65
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.920
then Muslims who are accused of trying to

66
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.840
separate their communities from the rest of France along

67
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:44.020
religious lines are going to be stopped by that law.

68
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.910
There'll be normal homeschooling. They will be told, uh,

69
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.670
the values of the Republic prevail anywhere that

70
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.730
there's a clash between Islamic values and values of the Republic,

71
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.080
the values of the Republic prevail. And he is saying if that law passes,

72
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.950
that's all going to be enforced. Think about that.

73
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.160
<v 1>How would they possibly enforce that?</v>

74
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.050
<v 0>I look, I'm just as curious as you are, right?</v>

75
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.000
<v 1>They've also banned had jobs on the beach too, right? Haven't they done that.</v>

76
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.020
<v 0>I get a mixed story about, is it the hijab or the burka? So it's an attack.</v>

77
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.680
There are attires where you can take a scarf and cover your head.

78
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.330
I guess that's not a band anywhere. There's no debate about that.

79
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.450
But there's something about the thing that covers your face.

80
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.550
And there's been a lot of debates in Europe about that.

81
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.020
And part of the, some of the participants of that debate are saying,

82
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.860
we're not talking about religion here. It's all about security.

83
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.510
We need to see everybody's face.

84
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 1>So out the window.</v>

85
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.780
<v 0>Because of COVID because of COVID.</v>

86
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.720
And there are other things that are out of the window because of COVID because

87
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.100
you just asked me,

88
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.990
how are they going to enforce those rules of stopping Muslims from

89
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.590
separating themselves from the rest of society,

90
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.380
through their associations, through their schools,

91
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.710
through everything that they do that make them say,

92
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.480
we don't want to have anything to do with France,

93
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.460
even though physically they're in France, right?

94
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.050
I think they're going to use some of the measures that they applied on some of

95
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:31.160
the laws that they applied during COVID.

96
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.090
They are going to assume powers that all of us thoughts,

97
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.120
a liberal society would be very careful with. And now they're not.

98
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.460
So I guess that's what they're going to apply.

99
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.960
There'll be breaking into people's homes, mosques, associations, whatever,

100
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.520
looking for Islamist materials of dour.

101
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.440
Dour means the proselytizing and, and,

102
00:06:56.441 --> 00:06:58.640
and they will try and put a stop to that.

103
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.540
They'll try and police literally what goes into people's minds and comes out of

104
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
their mouth.

105
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.710
<v 1>Wow, that seems very dangerous to.</v>

106
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.410
<v 0>Me. And COVID made it possible.</v>
