00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I had a gambling problem for a little bit. Did you?</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.060
Yeah. What kind.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.620
<v 1>Of sports in a casino? A lot of sports.</v>

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.310
<v 2>Gambling problem, like what, what made it a problem? What, what.</v>

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.960
<v 1>Made it a problem is that it was really taken up a lot of time and I'd never</v>

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.220
gotten to real trouble just because I was, you know,

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.190
constantly working. I had great weeks, I had bad weeks,

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.220
but it was just if you're, you know,

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.560
betting on stuff every other day or whatever,

10
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:35.400
then that means you're kind of on tilt and not able to function most of the

11
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.230
time. And that's when you were drinking a lot too.

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.980
This is when I was drinking a lot too.

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.830
So I was drinking and gambling and gambling and then getting up at midnight.

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.030
No, that was, that was that's quarantined.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.300
<v 3>Sleep scales, regular sleep schedules.</v>

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.290
<v 1>You know, drunk stuff, you know, four or 5:00 AM, but how'd you kick it,</v>

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.500
kick the gambling habit, the gambling,

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
I had to just really take a look at what I was doing and then what,

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.840
how it was serving me and look at the other stuff that I was doing.

20
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.490
And that's also gambling investing. And so realizing I had that outlet,

21
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.660
it just wasn't in sports or, you know,

22
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.870
throwing some dice, but you can gamble. Why, you know,

23
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.740
investing in a company early, you can gamble by getting a building.

24
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:26.910
You can gamble by, you know, trying to produce your own show out of pocket.

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.930
All of these other things.

26
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.340
<v 0>More. Yeah, sorta, it's more of an invest.</v>

27
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.290
<v 1>Though the vest, but if it, you know, investments go bus companies, you know,</v>

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.780
people that have put, you know, millions of dollars,

29
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.080
billions into to companies that quibble that ad.

30
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.290
And so that was invested and people,

31
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.230
they were really hyped about it and wrote big checks.

32
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.910
And so it was really realizing that and just realizing that, you know,

33
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.440
when I, when I was, you know, looking at a game and it take up time,

34
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.450
cause I would get really into it and research the history with teams and look at

35
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:05.690
all these other match-ups. And so I could, I should,

36
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.520
I could spend that time and, and mental energy on something else.

37
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.503
That's more productive.

38
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.490
<v 0>Uh, well, that's.</v>

39
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.170
<v 2>A wise way of looking at it,</v>

40
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:18.290
but a lot of people don't when they get sucked into something,

41
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.500
it's very hard to get it. Like we were just talking about video games,

42
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.620
but my addiction to video games, I just had to go cold Turkey.

43
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.700
I just had to step away and go, I can't do this anymore. And just,

44
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.990
I figured it out and I stopped, but that's not easy to do sometimes.

45
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:36.020
Like sometimes look, whatever it is about gambling,

46
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.160
like whatever switches that pops off in your brain that gives you that dopamine

47
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:40.730
charge.

48
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.190
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean,</v>

49
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.860
there's certain bets that are just

50
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.570
super pleasurable, but if you,

51
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.350
if you bet the total in a NBA game,

52
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.910
you bet over and you're, they're alive. The total is say the,

53
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.430
what, you know what? The two teams will score 200 points and that's,

54
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.320
you're rooting for every score.

55
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.420
<v 2>Everybody, everybody.</v>

56
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.520
<v 3>You exist yet yet free throws,</v>

57
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.450
free throws soda has, you.

58
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.530
<v 1>Know, a couple grand on a game and you're rooting for both teams.</v>

59
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.610
<v 3>Live. And I know what's wrong with this guy. Any total,</v>

60
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:22.990
any total score?

61
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.400
<v 1>Yeah. You hockey, whatever soccer you, if the goals are over three,</v>

62
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.160
then you ruined football team. You don't care if it's, you know,

63
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.050
two to two or four to nothing or 54. That's a tiny, yeah.

64
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.840
The over bed is super high.

65
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.540
<v 2>Jamie, you gambled a little, right? Yeah. Yep. I gamble on fights too, right.</v>

66
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.230
Yeah.

67
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.670
<v 4>Sure. I really have a gamble on the old.</v>

68
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.270
It's more fun to gamble on the over-under on rounds and too. You're like,

69
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.170
don't hang on. Hang on. Right, right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah.

70
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.820
<v 1>Who did I, I w I'm trying to think of some memorable fights. I had some money.</v>

71
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.990
I think, uh, I had, uh,

72
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.910
I have rumble Johnson against tech, Sarah.

73
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.403
Oh.

74
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.680
<v 4>Ooh. That was a brutal knockout I had. Yeah. I had rumble rumble.</v>

75
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.260
<v 2>Over everybody except Cormier. Yeah. For whatever reason,</v>

76
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:16.710
Cormier has got his number, but rumble hits anybody. They go night-night,

77
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.940
he's coming back, hit his board. So he's coming back.

78
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.190
Might come back as a heavyweight. Oh wow. He's huge now. I mean, huge,

79
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.800
like two 50 gigantic.

80
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.510
<v 1>I'll tell you that. My craziest gambling story, Oop,</v>

81
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.270
I taught I've told her on stage, but this is the most,

82
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:41.040
this is where it was like, it was really bonkers. Um,

83
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.350
so I started, I w I was bad and with a bookie,

84
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.560
uh, but I'll use a site, you know, but it was, you know, if I won,

85
00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:57.540
the guy was send, send money. He sent a bunch of money in $500 money orders,

86
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.580
or, you know, I would just send a PayPal, whatever. And it was,

87
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.570
it was like that. But the thing was that since you could just do it like that,

88
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.880
it made it, it's like sending a text.

89
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.740
You're just doing it on a site is so it doesn't,

90
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.570
it's not the same as holding the cash and bed.

91
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.660
And where you really have to think about is getting just typed it real quick.

92
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.650
And so you're doing, you know, these large beds. So after a while,

93
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:26.100
my tolerance was, I needed more and I was on a hot streak.

94
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.530
And so I asked my friend for another bookie with a higher limit because the

95
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:35.760
limit on my one was like two grand. And so he found this,

96
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.770
he knew this guy that do 5,000 a game, uh,

97
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.050
and so dance, but then it's 5,000 on the honors.

98
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.240
So it's not, you're not putting up five.

99
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:52.980
He's not because I was putting up five with my physical and his

100
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:57.920
time. I probably wouldn't. But because it was like 5.5 here and I, a hot streak.

101
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.700
I was betting on a lot of hockey at this time. And I was getting,

102
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.130
I had a high street going higher so much in my gambling buddies,

103
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.700
Bozeman and CS eight, sorry, calling me hockey, Hannibal. Cause I, this was bad.

104
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.650
Not a Vegas golden Knights were doing really well. That was their first season.

105
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.610
And, uh, black Hawks were hitting some stuff. So I was doing parlay.

106
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.320
So if you parlay a $5,000 bet with, uh,

107
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.000
you know, with the total of something, then not five is, uh, you know,

108
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:29.540
12, 15 wins. So I had a good run.

109
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.140
And after a week I was up a hundred thousand cash

110
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.110
and, uh, I love a hunt. And so, and it, but I'd never put in any money.

111
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.570
So it was just, I got this a hundred thousand from type.

112
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.100
And so I meet up with the guy in Chicago and, uh,

113
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.220
and I mean, I pull up next to his car and he,

114
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:54.050
he had me a hundred grand cash in a, in a brown paper bag. Whoa.

115
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.200
And did you do like.

116
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.770
<v 2>The demean more thing? We throw the money on the bed and roll around naked. No.</v>

117
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.550
<v 1>I put it on the table and kind of just really looked at.</v>

118
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.990
<v 3>I thought I kept it free considering I kept the catacomb.</v>

119
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.000
I just put it on the table.

120
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.530
<v 1>What the a hundred is just, yeah. Oh, how.</v>

121
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.000
<v 2>Big is a hundred thousand dollars in all hundreds? It was.</v>

122
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.850
<v 3>Crazy. It's a lot, but.</v>

123
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.290
<v 1>It's not, you know, isn't that massive. It's a couple,</v>

124
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.040
it's a few stacks. Yeah. And it was,

125
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:31.390
it was so because there was no real

126
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.140
effort to get that money. I didn't value it like that.

127
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.040
And so in my head, the gamble,

128
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.640
mine isn't that happy is it's like, it wants, it, saw that, you know what,

129
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.460
let's get them 400 a month and the next week proceeded to go

130
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:50.260
down, uh,

131
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.080
go down like 90 grand on it. And so he started hitting me up,

132
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.560
Hey, can I get that 90? Um,

133
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.030
and so I was too prideful at the time. I didn't want to give him the cash.

134
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.470
I just want, he, we had an agreement to do PayPal out on some stuff,

135
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.940
but he, of course it wasn't, he didn't want to do PayPal for no 90.

136
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.090
You do PayPal for, you know, two, it was two, three,

137
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.920
but I was in a zone of, I don't want to, I can't deal with giving his cash back.

138
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.343
<v 3>Yes. So.</v>

139
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.130
<v 1>And so he's asking for his paper and I PayPal him the 90 grand,</v>

140
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.170
and then he sends that back.

141
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:37.780
<v 3>So.</v>

142
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.940
<v 1>Now we plant hot potato.</v>

143
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.740
He wants to cut internet hot potato with 90,000 hours. Uh,

144
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.470
and, and yeah. It's so it was this really, it was intense.

145
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.320
Cause I was like, yo, is this. And then he hit me up a, a see,

146
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.880
we see you going to be in Brooklyn.

147
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.340
And so I try to, I puff up and just kind of say, Hey,

148
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.020
you don't want to show up to Brooklyn dog.

149
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.590
I gotta make sure I tried to talk some, Hey man,

150
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.900
where you going to come to Brooklyn? You going to get touched? Like, don't.

151
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.110
<v 0>Come to my show said that, yeah. I just texted him that thing, like,</v>

152
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:15.570
don't come through Brooklyn. I said, you're going to get touched.

153
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.930
<v 3>I texted, I'll just try to, I was out of my mind, I was on tilt, man.</v>

154
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.810
I was being ridiculous. Cause I wanted, I didn't want to Welch,

155
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.130
but I just didn't want to pay.

156
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.510
<v 1>Like that. And so eventually you tried to pay, we send it back any,</v>

157
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.200
eventually just took it. But um, yeah, that was,

158
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.180
he took what the 90 via PayPal, even though that probably was a heat, you know?

159
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.240
Yeah. That's bad for the taxes. It's bad for taxes or whatever.

160
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.740
And so I actually called him this week to have like, yo,

161
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:50.180
sorry man. I was.

162
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.820
<v 3>Says yo poor form on my part.</v>

163
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.220
<v 1>My bad. I don't gamble.</v>

164
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.230
<v 3>No more. Sorry to put.</v>

165
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.790
<v 1>You through that and bring heat on you. And, and it wasn't, but it was that's.</v>

166
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.620
That was the wildest one man, while it was like, it just had me in a, in a,

167
00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:16.070
in a real irrational zone. My friend delete all that. No.
