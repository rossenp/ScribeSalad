00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.640
Did you see the thing with Don lemon on CNN with those two guys where they

3
00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.920
started mocking Trump supporters and,

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.680
and pretending they're stupid and using a Southern accent and I'm like,

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.760
you guys, that's gonna be a deplorable moment. Prejudice. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.360
And you're pretending it's funny, which is even more offensive as a comedian.

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.150
And you know, that ain't funny. And Don Lemon's like, and then afterwards,

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.533
even worse,

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.550
he says he didn't realize that people were being mocked and he didn't

10
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:32.470
hear all of it. Yeah.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.390
<v 1>He said he, he, he was laughing over them speaking or something. He said,</v>

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.100
he hear the whole.

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.550
<v 0>Realize that they were saying things were offensive. I'm sorry. I would never.</v>

14
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 1>Well, because some forms of prejudice are okay. And some aren't okay. Right.</v>

15
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.540
You know exactly. The one I really love about the social justice law.

16
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.980
Maybe this is just a British thing, but they're all really ageist.

17
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.860
They've got a real problem with old people. Right. All white people,

18
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.260
all white people. Right. Well, well, there's that form of prejudice.

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.581
I think it's cuz of Brexit,

20
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.700
because disproportionately older people voted Brexit. So they're like, oh,

21
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:02.170
I don't care about old people. In fact,

22
00:01:02.171 --> 00:01:03.490
you even have like the left leaning papers,

23
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.450
like the garden and the independence. So talking like, well,

24
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.330
they're all gonna die off soon. And then we can have another vote. Yes.

25
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.570
But that's not how it works. It's like, it's not like old people die off.

26
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.530
And then there are no more old people. Like people get older,

27
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.290
people change their minds. It was really, but it was also really toxic.

28
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.330
It was this thing of like, uh, you know,

29
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.250
they they're up the future for the young and they they're all, you know,

30
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.920
it was really ugly. Yeah. And for some reason,

31
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.200
these people who claim that imutable characteristics must be protected.

32
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.520
Doesn't matter if you're old. Yeah. Or go for you if you're old or if you,

33
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.553
like you say straight white male.

34
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.640
<v 0>Straight white male is the old themselves.</v>

35
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.280
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But I, I dunno how you can see that as anything is hypocritical.</v>

36
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.360
Well, to make that point.

37
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.910
<v 0>You you're logical and you're intelligent. You're Jack, of course you can't,</v>

38
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.470
but they're woke, you know? I mean, it's, they,

39
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.150
they might as well be in that heavens gate cult. It's the same thing. Well.

40
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.990
<v 1>I think,</v>

41
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.470
I wonder if a lot of it is coming from the media is coming from the press is

42
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.150
coming from the we've got, I dunno what it's like. I mean,

43
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:58.630
we saw that article from the New York times. Yeah. We've got stuff like that.

44
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:00.510
We've got this paper, the garden and the independent, they,

45
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.543
they are pushing this stuff.

46
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.740
<v 0>Hardcore itself every.</v>

47
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.700
<v 1>Single day, you know? And there's a lot of hate clicks too. Yeah. Oh, oh. They,</v>

48
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.340
so if, actually, shall I give you this example?

49
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.220
Do you know whether I trolled the independent, the newspaper? No. Right. So I,

50
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.900
um, wanted to test as an experiment. Right?

51
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.020
Whether they were published something really stupidly woke just because it's

52
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.820
woke. Right. So I submitted.

53
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.730
<v 0>An article, James Lindsay and, and right. Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.090
<v 1>Like, like on a smaller scale, you know, but I, I,</v>

55
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.330
I thought I wrote an article arguing that comedians ought to be prosecuted for

56
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.610
hate speech. Right. That, that mentioning a few comics mention.

57
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.530
And it was so obviously a hoax.

58
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.570
And so obviously stupid and I made up a name and I sent it and they got back to

59
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:43.370
me like, this is brilliant. We love this. This is amazing.

60
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.920
They really loving it. And they published it.

61
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.400
It's still online and what's even worse. Where is it?

62
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.440
<v 0>How can someone, how can we find it? Right.</v>

63
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.440
<v 1>It's called, uh, the name is Liam. If you search Liam Evans, is that.</v>

64
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.360
<v 0>Your name? Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.440
<v 1>In that my faint Liam Evans independent,</v>

66
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.640
and the headline is something, uh, like it's something to do with comedy.

67
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.480
If you search that, it'll come up. Hate speech, hate speech. Or, um, how.

68
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.400
<v 0>Many of these online fake names do you here? It is right.</v>

69
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.240
<v 1>As a comedy EFIC, I'm appalled at disgusting jokes,</v>

70
00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:14.440
creeping back into the industry. &lt;laugh&gt; and look at underneath,

71
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.040
look at the tagline, comedians crying free speech. Isn't good enough.

72
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.750
Hate crime law should apply to all of us. Now, the thing about this article,

73
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.870
if you take the fourth letter of every sentence,

74
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.430
it spells out to Tony McGrath wrote this,

75
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:31.230
you gullible hacks &lt;laugh&gt; and they published it and

76
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:34.550
it's still up there and this is a mainstream.

77
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 0>Oh my God. That's hilarious.</v>

78
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.620
<v 1>It's a mainstream newspaper. It's a, it's one, one of our major.</v>

79
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.740
<v 0>It's amazing that you we're able to encode that.</v>

80
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.100
<v 1>Well, it also shows that they did all editing.</v>

81
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.180
They just took it because they loved what it was saying. Yeah.

82
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.740
And of course the point isn't to try and fool people or be mean to people or

83
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.060
anything, it's, it's exposing this thing that the media, if, if the woke media,

84
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.500
if it furthers their agenda,

85
00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:59.890
they'll publish anything by someone who wasn't even known.

86
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.970
He had no online presence, this guy, it's just, they agreed with the.

87
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.890
<v 0>Sentiment. And so, so they published it in their paper. You just be a random,</v>

88
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.130
random, random person sends it in and they're like, brilliant. Yeah.

89
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:13.730
They just agree. And they put it in a national paper. That.

90
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.610
<v 1>Was the independent it's it's, you know, it's it's um,</v>

91
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.840
I can't believe them it taking it down yet. &lt;laugh&gt; they will now, well, I only,

92
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.080
only sort of revealed it a couple of months ago in this speech I gave,

93
00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:28.480
it was the one where I was with Peter and, uh, James Lindsay. And, um,

94
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.120
and it went online. But I suppose not many people know about it, but that, yeah.

95
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.920
They'll probably take it down now. Yeah. Now, but you know,

96
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.000
'em because I actually think raise your standards, you know? Yes.

97
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.750
But you don't stop feeding us this, this ideological.

98
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.870
<v 0>I think there's an issue too,</v>

99
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.150
with online journalism that these people are basically

100
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.470
fighting for their own survival. Right. There's not a lot of money in it.

101
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.350
It's hard to get clicks. You have to have click bait titles.

102
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:00.350
You have to attack people for things like in order to get like real

103
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.820
engagement. Yeah. You,

104
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.420
you have to kind of give into a certain amount of madness. Isn't.

105
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.901
<v 1>That depressing.</v>

106
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:11.740
That's the same reason why the most extreme ideas on Twitter get more retweet.

107
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.140
They get rewarded. Don't they with, with likes and retweets and everything.

108
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:16.420
Yeah. It's like the whole, but that shouldn't,

109
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.260
I have a real old fashioned view of the media. I, I, I,

110
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.980
I want to hold them to high standards.

111
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I don't want them to be going for click bait and saying

112
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:25.890
the most extreme things. I know, I think you're right.

113
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.810
And I think they do it for that reason, but I, I, I just wish they wouldn't.

114
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.450
I mean, save that for some like the Huffington post doing stuff,

115
00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:35.410
like women are evil. That was one headline. Women are evil and, you know,

116
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:38.250
stuff like, like Buzzfeed does it as well. And you just think, but,

117
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.250
but when it comes to sort of reputable publications,

118
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.520
like the New York times and you know, like the Washington post,

119
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.493
why are they pushing this?

120
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.920
<v 0>I think they're struggling.</v>

121
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.560
<v 1>So you think it's just about.</v>

122
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.393
<v 0>Money?</v>

123
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.440
I think that's a viable way to generate clicks and clicks is what generates

124
00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:56.640
income. And I think there's a real issue if you,

125
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.360
I know guys who are journalists and, and women as well,

126
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.440
who will tell you that if their articles do not get a certain amount of

127
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:08.320
engagement yeah. They're in trouble, you know, they can't just print things.

128
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.960
Everything has to be something that is engaging. It has to be,

129
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.750
it has to be attractive, but even look what Facebook's algorithm does. Right?

130
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.790
Yeah. I mean, one of the things that Facebook's algorithm does,

131
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.710
is it sort of in some way, encourages people to be upset about things,

132
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:28.870
because it shows you a lot of things that you engage with.

133
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:32.230
And a lot of times people tend to engage with things that they're upset by.

134
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.510
Yeah. So whether it's abortion or second amendment or whatever the subject is,

135
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:39.500
right. If you have an engagement with that and you, you,

136
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.340
you respond a lot and you start,

137
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.340
and that's what they're gonna show you over and over and over again.

138
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.820
And it's really more of a symptom of what human beings are attracted to.

139
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.420
A lot of times we're attracted to things that upset us, but.

140
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.700
<v 1>That's gonna spiral further and further out control. I mean, ideological, but,</v>

141
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.930
but &lt;laugh&gt; the, the culture is being moted is engineered by &lt;affirmative&gt; by,

142
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.010
by all of this stuff out there. And, and that's the argument.

143
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.890
<v 0>Against Facebook, right? The culture wars being engineered by algorithms.</v>

144
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.730
<v 1>Yeah. And although I I'm really torn on this actually,</v>

145
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.090
cause I'm so I'm so against censorship in all, its, you know,

146
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.170
I really am of course me too. Um, but I want,

147
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.170
I want if journalists and commentators had high standards and we're just being

148
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.480
honest first and foremost, um,

149
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.680
and they had integrity and they weren't just after clicks. Then we,

150
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:25.080
then half of this, half of this stuff would go away. I feel some.

151
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.880
<v 0>Of it would go away. My question is they weren't doing this 15 years ago.</v>

152
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.080
No. So what will they be doing 15 years from now? Well, will this wear out,

153
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.620
will this.

154
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.520
<v 1>Dry up? So that's the question is, are we gonna reach a tipping point? Right.</v>

155
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:38.750
That's the question? Right?

156
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.910
Because every time I think we are nearly at the tipping point,

157
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.750
they double down and it gets worse. Right. So, you know, after Trump's election,

158
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.570
for instance, right.

159
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.270
Almost immediately you had the women's March and I didn't really know what that

160
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:55.630
was about. Like it, it, it was, it was some people were marching for feminism.

161
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:57.790
Some people were marching for environmental issues. Some people were March.

162
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.220
It was really incoherent. Yes. A lot of them were dressed in the pink, hats and,

163
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.660
and giant vagina costumes and stuff like that. I thought, but what,

164
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.540
what are you protesting here? Are you saying that? You know, and,

165
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.980
and a lot of them had banner saying, not my president, right.

166
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.620
So they're protesting against democracy. Then in that case,

167
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.260
same thing in the UK, when, when we just had our general election,

168
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.460
it was a big March with loads of people with banner saying not my prime

169
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.780
minister, Boris Johnson, not my, well,

170
00:08:18.781 --> 00:08:21.450
he is your prime because we had a democratic, uh, mandate.

171
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.330
And that's how this works. Right. So I think what are you PR, but seriously,

172
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:26.370
what is the point of that protest?

173
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.330
<v 0>Like I think they're just showing unity.</v>

174
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.570
They're showing that they're all together in their anger about this and that

175
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.400
in the future,

176
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.410
they're gonna be a combined force and they're gonna make sure that this doesn't

177
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:38.970
happen again. I.

178
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.560
<v 1>Think there's a better way to do it with out generating so much resentment.</v>

179
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.200
Right. I think, I think there's a, there's a more sophisticated approach,

180
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:48.920
which is to say that democracy sustained on the principle of the losers consent,

181
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.020
where any,

182
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.080
any democracy is gonna have a substantial proportion of the population who did

183
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:56.600
not vote for the leader of that. Sure. And, and, and, and you have to have that.

184
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.360
And the best way is to, is through, uh, cogent,

185
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.880
persuasion and sensible discussion and of the issues, um,

186
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.200
not dressing up as a vagina. &lt;laugh&gt;, that's just.

187
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.160
<v 0>My key on that. Yeah. No, I, I agree with you in many ways,</v>

188
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.480
but I also think for them,

189
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.310
it's also fun to get together with a bunch of other like-minded people and you

190
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.990
know, and then there's the, the men who joined in, Hey, girls, I'm with you.

191
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.550
Okay.
