<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.770
<v 1>Like they're telling people not to scream at Disneyland. Do you know that? Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.800
Yeah. They told me when you go on rides, don't scream. Like, okay,

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.310
I'm going to mime it. I'm going to wow. That's.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 0>That's.</v>

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.520
<v 2>So they also tell you to keep your arms and hands.</v>

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.180
<v 1>Down and no one ever, no one ever does that. Right? Yeah. I hope people scream,</v>

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.640
set a protest. They're probably going to stop people from screaming.

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.070
Now they're probably going to tell people, because, you know, look,

10
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:28.920
they don't want an inspector to come there and say, Hey, people are screaming.

11
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:31.070
We're going to shut this place down. You know,

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.820
they've Disneyland has been closed for a year and they're losing some insane

13
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.730
amount of money. It's like $300 million a day or something crazy.

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.680
Like it's nuts. I might've made that number, pull that right out of my.

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.120
How much money is Disneyland losing per day while Disneyland's being closed?

16
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.540
I think it might be a hundred million. I really do. I think.

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.351
<v 0>Isn't that?</v>

18
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:55.860
What it cost for a chiro at Disneyland chooses a chiro at Disneyland,

19
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:56.694
a hundred million dollars.

20
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.830
<v 1>It's less than that.</v>

21
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.713
<v 0>Yeah. There's got to.</v>

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.340
<v 1>Let's guess before I say a hundred million, what do you say? Um.</v>

23
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.980
<v 0>I'll say 50 million. Okay.</v>

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.740
<v 1>I like what you're doing prices, right? Let's go.</v>

25
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.090
<v 0>I just have no idea. A hundred million seems like you guessed a million.</v>

26
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:18.150
I would have been like, maybe I would probably guessed half of that.

27
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:19.320
That just seems like so much.

28
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.510
<v 1>It's way more than a million. Disneyland is huge and it's really expensive.</v>

29
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.120
And then you've got Disneyland and California adventure on the same part.

30
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.400
<v 0>I've barely, I can count on one hand.</v>

31
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.300
The amount of times I've had more than $2,000 at once in my life.

32
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
So I don't have a concept of what a million dollars.

33
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.840
<v 1>It's a lot of money, but it's not a lot of money. If you run it Disneyland,</v>

34
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.320
I that's probably their rent. What do you got Jamie.

35
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.160
<v 2>Giving me just Disney's overall disease. A gigantic company.</v>

36
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:49.200
So it's not breaking it down just for Disney.

37
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.710
<v 1>Did you write Disneyland is losing. Yes. Yes.</v>

38
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.700
<v 2>I'm looking at how much is Disneyland's daily revenue and then.</v>

39
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.610
<v 1>No, no, no, no. Just say how much is Disneyland losing per day.</v>

40
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.291
<v 2>Disney,</v>

41
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:05.490
the company and how much they lost in China and Orlando and the TV channels.

42
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.260
<v 1>Have you write Disneyland? Yes. I know there was an article.</v>

43
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.040
Jamie will get it. I know he will. I have faith that.

44
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.180
<v 0>There's gotta be like a middle ground. You know, there.</v>

45
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.010
<v 1>Like let people do whatever the they want.</v>

46
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.780
<v 0>Like let people do whatever the they want.</v>

47
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.710
And like put those little dots where people can stand a little bit further

48
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.690
apart. I think we should have been doing that anyway.

49
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.790
I've always thought handshaking was disgusting.

50
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.520
I think we should all stop shaking hands for the rest of our lives.

51
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.870
When I was looking back at my old material, I found two separate bits.

52
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.790
I tried to write about how shaking hands is nasty before

53
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:46.500
COVID. I didn't even realize I felt that strongly about it, except that I did.

54
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:49.680
I was always like a fist bumper or like better yet.

55
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:53.880
Don't touch me after shows. You don't have to touch me, dude.

56
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.510
I've had men kiss me on my mouth after shows.

57
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.190
I've had people like grab my stomach after show.

58
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.790
I've like people put their hands on me and try to touch me. And I'm like,

59
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.300
we don't it's it's.

60
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.210
<v 1>It's just you and your man. How many.</v>

61
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.240
<v 0>One took me awhile to add that up? I tried to fish.</v>

62
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.700
I was like, I mean, men have kissed me on my face.

63
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.800
One guy kissed me on my mouth,

64
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.030
but I was pushing him off of me and yelling stop. What the are you doing?

65
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.150
And like the people with them were like laughing. And I was like,

66
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.730
what the is your problem? This is not. I snapped on him.

67
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.580
I yelled at him and then I didn't shake anyone's hands after that.

68
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.810
<v 1>That's the difference between being a woman comic and being a male comic dudes</v>

69
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.270
have never tried to kiss me. I've never had a guy. Just me.

70
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.470
<v 0>Honestly. Don't even believe you. I feel like dudes have tried to kiss you.</v>

71
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.150
I feel like you've probably been kissed on the mouth by more with.

72
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.820
<v 1>Uh, a couple of women had tried to kiss me, but it's not threatening. You know,</v>

73
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.560
that's the difference is that danger.

74
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.700
<v 0>Into it just cause you.</v>

75
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.390
<v 1>Know, it's not dangerous. Like they can't really rape me.</v>

76
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.463
You know what I'm saying?

77
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.410
<v 0>I feel threatened on your behalf, but I respect your right to feel safe.</v>

78
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.620
Thank you for I'm glad that you.

79
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.800
<v 1>Safe feeling threatened on my behalf,</v>

80
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.780
but my point is like a woman is not physically scary to me where a man is

81
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:14.520
physically scary to a woman here. It goes deep info. Uh, okay,

82
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.030
here it goes 12 million per day while I'm way off. Yeah,

83
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.870
that's just for Disneyland. 12 billion per day.

84
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.550
Based on 2000 God, I was like 300 million Corona virus closures,

85
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.180
cost Disneyland, 7.9 million per day and Disneyland, California adventure.

86
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:31.740
4.1 million per day.

87
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.920
<v 0>Yeah, it's in.</v>

88
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.020
<v 1>Orlando. So when you start adding it all up,</v>

89
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:41.310
it starts getting to be Disney world in Florida lost 25 million per day.

90
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.780
It's way bigger though. Oh, interesting. Magic kingdom. 8.8 million per day,

91
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.570
animal kingdom, 5.8 million per day.

92
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.680
Epcot 5.2 and Hollywood studios. 4.8. Oh,

93
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.540
okay. I was way off. I was going to go with a billion a day. How about that?

94
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.470
So what is it 14. Is that what it said? 14 million today.

95
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.290
That's still a shitload of money. Add that over 365 days.

96
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:11.700
And you got a lot of cheddar. So that's three, 250 million a week.

97
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.920
Yeah. Yeah. That's billions billions of dollars.

98
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.560
Just because someone told them they have to shut that. I mean,

99
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:21.450
they would have definitely lost money period.

100
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.570
There's no way to not lose some money. Everybody lost some money,

101
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:27.090
but to lose that much money is just from.

102
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.880
<v 0>Well, and then if you think about those workers,</v>

103
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.440
think about how much they could possibly be collecting an

104
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:38.460
unemployment. And it's gotta be a hundred bucks a week. I mean,

105
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:41.490
it's gotta be so low if they were minimum wage workers,

106
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.320
because you just get a fraction of that.

107
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.060
And where can you live on a hundred bucks a week? Like where can you pay rent?

108
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.700
What room can you, what closet can you rent?

109
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:52.830
I'm not talking about having your own apartment. I'm saying like,

110
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.870
where can you live for that amount of money? You.

111
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.290
<v 1>Can't, you can't, you have to live your parents and you have to hope they,</v>

112
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.740
they can pay their mortgage. It's interesting.

113
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:05.480
Like what we just did there is basically what's happening in California in terms

114
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:09.920
of fear of COVID like when there's a person

115
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.180
that ramps it up so high, like a hundred million dollars a day,

116
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.440
you came in 50 million a day, right? That was your estimate.

117
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.590
After I came in with a hundred million a day. But meanwhile, we're both way off.

118
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.540
Like that's in a sense, like what in California, everyone's like,

119
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.810
we're all going to die. Everyone's going to die. And then if you're reasonable,

120
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.110
you're like, no, only like 30% of us are gonna die. And then you're like,

121
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:36.350
wait a minute. It's not even that 30% would be wild.

122
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.690
That's what I like the bubonic plague killed. Well,

123
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:40.880
that was what a lot of people were seriously worried about.

124
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.920
I've had people express to me today that 5% of people that get COVID die.

125
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.090
I'm like, bro, that's not possible. That's not true. It's not true.

126
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:51.500
It's less than 1%.

127
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.300
And then you also have the problem of die from COVID or die with

128
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.440
COVID because most people who die have an average of 2.6

129
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.680
comorbidities. And I think they've recently elevated that.

130
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.360
I think it's more than that now,

131
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.830
which means they have either diabetes or some other cancer, some,

132
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.160
some other disease that makes, makes them extremely vulnerable.

133
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:14.420
Then they get COVID and then he dive.

134
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:18.560
It doesn't mean you should minimize the fact that they died and COVID definitely

135
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.000
killed them because if it wasn't for COVID,

136
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:21.140
they would have probably stayed alive,

137
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.120
