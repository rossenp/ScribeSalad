00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.240
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you think that Bernie's too left?</v>

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.440
Do you think he's still for a lot of the country? Yes.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.240
Do you think that's the media.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.040
<v 1>Ask the wrong question? Yeah. The media asks and there's a debate tonight.</v>

5
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.360
The media asks the wrong question, which is what would you do?

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.520
This is a question that only makes sense. If you're running for king,

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.590
the question should not be, what would you do?

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.510
The question is what can you get through?

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.230
What can you propose that Mitch McConnell will not either block

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.110
or you can override with votes, cuz that's a very different discussion. Mm.

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.990
What Bernie Sanders wants to do.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.950
We shouldn't even be talking about cuz it's not going to happen. The free.

13
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
<v 0>Education. Yes. Came back student loan, debt.</v>

14
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.620
<v 1>Medicare for all Medicare, for all, you know,</v>

15
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.940
all these possible all as long as the,

16
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:51.180
unless the Republicans self deport.

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.940
Even if the Democrat wins the election,

18
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.740
there's still gonna be half the country that's de Republican and half the

19
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.530
Congress is gonna be re and this just,

20
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.330
and a lot of Democrats are not for this stuff. You know,

21
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:09.170
when the Democrats took over the house in 2018,

22
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.330
it was moderate Democrats who won their elections. It wasn't the, the far left.

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.870
So.

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.690
<v 0>So you get four years of spinning your wheel in the mud.</v>

25
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.480
You get well hoping to get some traction. Yeah.

26
00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.400
Even if he gets in again.

27
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.640
<v 1>It's what can get through Congress. What can you get a consensus on? What,</v>

28
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.920
what can you make possible Obama? When he did healthcare said, yes.

29
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.400
If we were starting from scratch,

30
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.920
it would make sense to go for a single payer system.

31
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:39.360
But we're not starting from scratch.

32
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.390
We're starting from a system where most people already have of health insurance

33
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.950
through their employer. It's a crazy story. How that happened.

34
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.550
It was world war II and they couldn't raise wages cuz that was the law.

35
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:54.150
So they had to find a way to give employers something else.

36
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.150
So they gave them health insurance, but that's what we have now.

37
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.230
And a lot of people like it or say they like it.

38
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.990
I don't think a lot of people like arguing with their insurance come,

39
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.220
but they're afraid of something worse. And I don't blame them. You know,

40
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.500
if you're gonna tell me the government and I'm a Democrat,

41
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.820
but if you're gonna tell me the government is gonna smoothly handle taking over

42
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:17.780
something that large, I am gonna be a little skeptical.

43
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.900
<v 0>Well, it should be. They don't smoothly handle anything. There's no evidence.</v>

44
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:22.380
They smoothly handle anything. Right.

45
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:25.250
Other than maybe delivering the news well are delivering, uh, the mail.

46
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.890
<v 1>Look again as an old school, progressive.</v>

47
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.010
When you go down the list of things that the progressives have accomplished,

48
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.810
especially in my lifetime, I, I cheer them all social security.

49
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.610
Well that wasn't my lifetime, but they improved it in my lifetime.

50
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.730
Medicare Medicaid. These are great programs. I mean, before social,

51
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.920
the senior poverty rate was like in the 28% or something.

52
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:52.120
And then it went down below 10. It was a success.

53
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.000
But when you look at what the government really what their big successes have

54
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.240
amounted to it's passing out money. That very often they don't have.

55
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.200
That's what they're really good at running a giant healthcare

56
00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:06.810
system.

57
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.800
Especially when the politicians who are proposing these systems will not a

58
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.000
talk enough about, we gotta cap the gouging.

59
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.750
You can't pass out all this money with, if you're, if you're gonna allow people,

60
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.950
hospitals, pharmaceutical companies to charge char, anything they want.

61
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.870
When the price of an EpiPen can go up from $12 to 1200 overnight,

62
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.070
that just can't happen.

63
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.870
And also they don't ask the people to lift a finger,

64
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.540
to take care of their own health nobody's healthcare systems gonna work.

65
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.700
Unless you involve people have some sink skin in the game.

66
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.980
You can't like not tell the people, look,

67
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.220
you can't keep eating as much as you want.

68
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.220
And as of food as you want and expect us to cover the bill. You just can't.

69
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.260
<v 0>That is not something that anybody wants to hear though.</v>

70
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.090
<v 1>I know because I did that editorial. And, and then I know.</v>

71
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.890
<v 0>I remember that people got.</v>

72
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.650
<v 1>Upset at you. Well, people here's the story. People did not.</v>

73
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.250
People loved it until James Cordin said something.

74
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.770
<v 0>Oh, that's right. He had that whole, first of all, he did that.</v>

75
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.290
And in doing that made fat jokes.

76
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.680
<v 1>Which was which I did not by the way, Jesus. Yeah. My mine talked about obesity,</v>

77
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.200
cheap.

78
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.280
<v 0>On it. Morbid people look, morbidly.</v>

79
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.600
<v 1>Obese people. First of all,</v>

80
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.720
he missed a great opportunity to literally save lives.

81
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.360
If he had taken the opposite approach, he took the, the easy way out.

82
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.480
Of course you can always get applause for saying, oh,

83
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.910
let's let's boo. The mean who's told the truth. That's not brave. Um,

84
00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:44.530
first of all,

85
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.470
my point was a that you can't solve healthcare unless you

86
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:52.190
ask the people to participate in that. That was one.

87
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.070
And also that we've gone to this place where

88
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.790
we're proud of it.

89
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.060
We're proud of being unhealthy weight Watchers had to take the name,

90
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.100
weight and Watchers outta their title.

91
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.100
<v 0>It's WW. Now it.</v>

92
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.980
<v 1>It's like we, what it see &lt;laugh&gt; being fat.</v>

93
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.860
Isn't bad. What's bad. Is someone pointing out that fat is bad.

94
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.660
But I mean, I read the statistic in that editorial,

95
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.330
40,000 people a month,

96
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.170
a month die from obesity.

97
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.730
That's a crazy number. That is a crazy number.

98
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.810
We have to somehow reverse this idea that we have in this country.

99
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.090
Not just about obesity, but about a lot of things where I'm perfect,

100
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.130
the way I am. Hmm.

101
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.240
I am just birth the way I am. And if you say different,

102
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:49.120
you're a very bad person. That's not a good place to be.

103
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.520
<v 0>It's not healthy for anybody. It's you're, you're protecting people's emotions,</v>

104
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.840
but shielding them from a possible right moment that might

105
00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:01.120
make them realize that they are eating themselves to death.

106
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.520
<v 1>And right. I mean, look, I said it also in the piece,</v>

107
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.920
Beau's in the eye of the beholder. That's fine. Whatever you think is beautiful,

108
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.480
that's your deal. But health is science. Yeah. That's science.

109
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.440
And when we get apoplectic, we,

110
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.910
and there's 50 deaths from shootings or something a month.

111
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.910
Yeah. It's very bad. And we should be serious about that problem.

112
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.030
But 50 versus 40,000 every month.

113
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.430
And that's just what they're counting from. The big ones, cancer, diabetes,

114
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.510
and heart disease.

115
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.380
There's literally nothing about your health that is improved by being

116
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:44.740
overweight. So, you know, I said, we, we shouldn't taut people,

117
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.460
but you know, compare it to anything else.

118
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.980
I also owned up to the fact that I used to drink too much and I smoked,

119
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.740
but I didn't defend it. When someone said, you know,

120
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.460
you went kind of hard last night with the drinking. I didn't,

121
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.090
how dare you drunk. Shame me. Well, the weird thing said, you're right. I.

122
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.650
<v 0>Did the weird thing about cord too is he's not that fat.</v>

123
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.810
Like he could fix that in a couple of months. That's not that.

124
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.130
<v 1>Hard. No, he took his, it was a, it was opportunistic.</v>

125
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.530
And IM I felt like that too. Yeah. He could have,

126
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.210
he literally lost an opportunity to save lives because as someone who does

127
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.120
struggle with weight, he could have taken the opposite approach and said,

128
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.960
you know, he, bill makes a really good point and um,

129
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.800
we should, we should look at how we are dealing with this. I,

130
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.520
I noticed Jillian Michaels, the fitness expert took a lot of.

131
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.473
<v 0>For Lizzo.</v>

132
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.680
<v 1>For Lizzo. Yeah. And you know, if,</v>

133
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.790
if you wanna be whatever weight you want to be, that's fine.

134
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.590
But it's wrong to shame a fitness expert for saying this isn't healthy. Well,

135
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:46.351
it gets even crazy. She said,

136
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:48.790
it's not gonna be that amazing when she gets diabetes.

137
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.550
<v 0>Yeah. And people want none. Diabetes has nothing to do with weight. Uh.</v>

138
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.190
<v 1>Diabetes has for sure everything to do with it for sure. It does also, they,</v>

139
00:07:56.191 --> 00:08:00.500
they, they lie. They say things like, well, it's the fat gene it's there.

140
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.940
You know, there's not a, it's not that. Or here's another one. And look,

141
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:08.780
this is valid. It's valid that in this country, it is a lot harder to eat.

142
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.260
Right? If you are poor. Yes.

143
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.020
And we should totally address that. Yes. Doubt if it's on any candidates,

144
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.920
top 10 list.

145
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.490
But the way the food situation and subsidies are done in this country is

146
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.470
horrible.

147
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.170
But given that let's not just throw up our hands and say,

148
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.090
we're the can't do country. And because it's harder,

149
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.850
let's not even try. Yes. It is harder to eat right. On a budget.

150
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.530
But I'll tell you something, something you never need to have with your food.

151
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.360
So soda, which is a large part of it. Okay. And you'll save money.

152
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.080
You don't have to have soda. You don't have to have a Snickers bar,

153
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.000
a banana's 19 cents. So it's Unimpossible.

154
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.920
<v 0>Adele got recently because she got.</v>

155
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.920
<v 1>Skinny. Yes. Because she got healthier.</v>

156
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.800
That's was also a part of my thing was fit shaming, not fat shaming.

157
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.040
People go eat something, eat something. I'm fine. What,

158
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.480
so you can feel better about your weight problem.

159
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.000
I should eat and get fat too. Well when.

160
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.190
<v 0>Heavy will have a fan or have someone that they're a fan of,</v>

161
00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:21.390
that's also heavy, like James Gordon, like, so he's heavy.

162
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.150
He's got people in the audience that love him and they love him standing up for

163
00:09:25.151 --> 00:09:28.710
other heavy people. Yeah. We're fine. We're fine. He's one of us. We're fine.

164
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.390
I think they felt like that with Adele. Adele was this fantastic singer,

165
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.380
super talented, extremely popular and overweight. Like, yeah,

166
00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:42.020
it's fine. It's fine. I'm like Adele, everyone's fine. It wasn't.

167
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:42.940
But then she loses weight.

168
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.180
Like you feel like she's betraying you because one of the reasons why I liked

169
00:09:46.181 --> 00:09:48.540
you is cuz you're fat now you're not fat anymore.

170
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.380
<v 1>It wasn't that long ago that we were applauding people when they lost weight.</v>

171
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.450
Yeah. I remember when, remember when Oprah came him out that time where she was,

172
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.250
oh, this was like in the eighties I think. But she had lost a whole bunch of,

173
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:04.930
well, there's a picture. You, it's a very famous picture. I think she's,

174
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.490
she's like in jeans and she's got a, like really thin waist and you know,

175
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.050
she was raising her hands and triumph and everyone was applauding.

176
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.890
I guess that's bad now because again,

177
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.080
and you have to be perfect the way you are. And if you criticize that,

178
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.040
then you're a bad person.
