00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>I have this morning, I saw a video.</v>

2
00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:04.830
We were talking to mother right before the podcast about the guy in India.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.320
He was trying to convert them, apparently January Sam.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.570
And they shot him full of arrows. Well,

5
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.300
the one of the last uncontacted tribes in the world,

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.700
but what a doofus what'd you think was going to happen? Right?

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.070
Jamie said the guy's been there before. Right? Did he say that?

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.260
So they knew him, the other guy? Well, I don't know.

9
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.400
The people that killed him knew him.

10
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.030
Wouldn't they say there's between 50 and a hundred people on this island.

11
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:25.920
I believe. See if he can get a good article on it.

12
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.360
Is that the number I'm trying to pull up?

13
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.670
So there was like 50 or 50 to 150 people. They don't exactly know.

14
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.290
Um, and they,

15
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.060
they came there just say from it's the size of Manhattan's an

16
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:43.710
island and they came there from Africa, like, what is it? 60,000 years ago.

17
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.930
I had read them. I don't remember exactly where.

18
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.063
<v 1>They are wherever.</v>

19
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.270
<v 0>Earlier India. Yeah. Yeah. Somewhere in India or near, near, near India.</v>

20
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.050
So island, this dude was trying to bring them to Jesus.

21
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.530
And they said, if you liked the guy, we'll introduce it to them.

22
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.790
They filled up full. Oh wow. It's in the middle of nowhere. Oh, that's.

23
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.390
That is in the middle of nowhere. So they came off of Africa.

24
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.740
That's crazy how the spread down,

25
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.350
see all that. That's crazy. Yeah. You know, it's interesting too,

26
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.980
in England they call, uh, people from India, Asians.

27
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.020
They think of that as Asia.

28
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.550
Cause it is [inaudible] but we got weird with Oriental at some point in time,

29
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.780
Oriental became derogatory some weird way. Yeah.

30
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.030
Oriental was normal. Like Oriental rugs.

31
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
That was like a thing you'd go to Oriental rugs. That's like,

32
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.870
if someone was saying, you know, spit toothpaste, like, Hey, Hey,

33
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.850
you can't say that anymore. But at one point in time, Oriental was like a total.

34
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.090
This is a real thing. Yeah. It was part of the language. Um,

35
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.540
but so now we say Asian, cause we try to be politically correct.

36
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.570
But Asia was giant.

37
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.800
There's a lot of different kinds of folks in Asia. You know, what, what were.

38
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.780
<v 1>Those like? The, the people that ended.</v>

39
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.150
<v 0>Up on that island one dude, they people that.</v>

40
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.400
<v 1>Yeah. How the do you you're running away from something to end up.</v>

41
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.740
<v 0>Well, everybody's that's you know,</v>

42
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.150
if you read about the migration of people from Africa spreading out,

43
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.570
that's a big part of what they're doing is trying to get away from people that

44
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.980
are trying to kill them. Yeah. Like it's all either they run out of resources,

45
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.780
they run out of food or they're being,

46
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.230
they're being forced out of areas like new people come in,

47
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.460
people escape and survive and did our entire history. As human beings.

48
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.620
It's like bigger, more powerful human beings,

49
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.560
move into an area and kill and rape and then spread,

50
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.470
spread out and then keep going. And everybody else just keeps going.

51
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:43.470
And then they eventually fortify in the distance and get a new city and they try

52
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.650
to hold them off. And the new people are coming through. I mean,

53
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.450
there's so many instances from the Mongols to the Romans being go back and back

54
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:53.310
and back all through history. But if you broke it down,

55
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.010
if you looked at it like a math problem, like what's happening here,

56
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.963
here's what's happening.

57
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.040
These groups of people get together and then they develop some that kills other

58
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:01.620
groups of people. And they push into those groups,

59
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.040
people and try to their checks, just steal their money, their checks,

60
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.870
eat their food. And then they do the same thing.

61
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.410
And then people go back and forth and, and this is all people have done.

62
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.530
Like there's never been a time where no one was at war.

63
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.130
Like if you've ever gone through human history, there's no like, well,

64
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.410
there was a period of a hundred years where there was no war.

65
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.453
It's never happened.

66
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.100
<v 2>It never happened. You're the best guy to ask about this.</v>

67
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.940
Isn't it impressive how they built those arrows. Right? The craftsmanship.

68
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.870
Cause they're proper.

69
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.420
<v 0>Era. What they look like. They have pictures of the arrows.</v>

70
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.370
<v 2>But apparently he digested the arrows hitting him.</v>

71
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:37.180
So the way I was thinking it was in order for an arrow to be done properly.

72
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.940
Right. And you could aim and then hit someone and kill them.

73
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:41.920
It has to go through the whole structure.

74
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.990
<v 0>The pelvis. No, it doesn't have to. I mean,</v>

75
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.600
especially the kid hit him a bunch of times. You know,

76
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.690
if they hit them a bunch of times, they got a shot him in the guts, arrows.

77
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.900
But I don't think they have arrows because they need them to survive. Right.

78
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:56.680
So there has gotta be island animals and they're hunting these animals,

79
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.870
but it's not that hard for these people in these kind of tribes to is if

80
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.890
they have the proper wood on the island, you know, they, um, they've been,

81
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.520
people have been making bows and arrows for a long time and they they'll use

82
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:14.140
certain fibers from certain trees and they weave them together and make a bow

83
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.401
string. And you know,

84
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:20.320
if they have enough good wood and they have good fiber and they

85
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:25.030
have the knowledge, I mean, even if they don't have metal, you could still,

86
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:28.090
to this day I found one in Nevada. I found an old,

87
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.420
I don't know what era it's from, but I found a, an Arrowhead, but what,

88
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.760
why was actually bow hunting?

89
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.230
I found an actual Arrowhead from some native American tribe that they'd left by.

90
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:41.500
And apparently they were like really common. Like people find them all the time.

91
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.070
Cause you think of the thousands of years that the indigenous people were here

92
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.770
and all the different animals they shot with bows and arrows.

93
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.130
They figured out how to do it. Yeah. So these people must know how to do it too.

94
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:54.010
And if they have enough good stone to make, you know,

95
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:57.250
something Flint or something similar to make the arrowheads,

96
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.500
or maybe they're using something toxic,

97
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.030
maybe they have some sort of toxic plant and they just dipping the tip of a

98
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.370
sharpen tip into it. Okay.

99
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.200
<v 1>If you dip the tip in something toxic don't can you eat.</v>

100
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.180
<v 0>That meat? You can apparently, but.</v>

101
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.050
<v 1>Not the area.</v>

102
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.540
<v 0>Near the question. It's a good question. I don't know.</v>

103
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:21.250
But a lot of these tribes that shoot things that they shoot things with poison

104
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.870
on the end of their arrows, you know? Yeah. Well, the idea is that they just,

105
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.320
they want to eat it. Right. They don't, if they don't hit it perfectly,

106
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:30.850
they're not going to wait for the perfect shot.

107
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.970
They're just trying to hit it so they can hit it in the or in the neck or

108
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.690
wherever the they hit it. If they have poison that thing's going to die,

109
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.490
you know, they use poison for a lot of weird to the, a use poison to fish.

110
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.140
It's really strange. They taped the poison, the fish. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy.

111
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:50.580
They take this plant and they smash it up and they make it.

112
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:55.390
It's like this green pea. I think that was that the Yanomami of, um,

113
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.770
some more maybe Bolivia, something like that.

114
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.620
It's one of those tribal peoples that lives almost,

115
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.180
almost uncontacted but still some con like they'll have like under Armour

116
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.330
t-shirts on and share it. It's weird. It's weird. But they, you know,

117
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.590
the barefoot and they take these plants and I forget what the con what plant it

118
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.830
is, but they smashed this plant up and make like this green pulp.

119
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.660
And then they put this pulp in these ponds and these fish just float.

120
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.250
It's some sort of toxin and it just these fish up and they just float up to the

121
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.250
top and then they go and scoop the fish and take them out of there.

122
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.300
But it like paralyzes them. It's not toxic to us, I guess. I don't know, man.

123
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.170
I mean, maybe they just said.

124
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.090
<v 1>But I guess you, you have to be really hungry to think, okay,</v>

125
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.570
I'm not killing enough or getting enough fruits or vegetables,

126
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.400
I'm going to poison these things.

127
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:47.480
And I'd rather die being poisoned than starving to death.

128
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.290
<v 0>Well, I think these people have been on the edge of survival.</v>

129
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.760
Like they've figured out survival down to like everything in their area.

130
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.410
They know what's edible. They know what's dangerous, what to avoid,

131
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:05.300
what to cultivate, what to seek out. They just, you know,

132
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.280
they know how to do it. So if these people are on a,

133
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.470
if it's a resource rich island,

134
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.540
it seems to be like an island in the middle of the ocean,

135
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.480
as long as they don't kill too much,

136
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.370
as long as they keep a certain healthy population of animals around.

137
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.400
And they're cognizant of that is this, these people,

138
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.230
the video I found on YouTube 2008 where some fishermen or someone found them and

139
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.880
gave 2000 coconuts. Wow. So these people apparently,

140
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.810
um, if you, if you follow the story,

141
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.770
they came from Africa 60 something thousand years ago. Wow.

142
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.060
And I guess probably during the ice age,

143
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.630
the coastline was very different, right? The water levels were way lower.

144
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.120
And then when the ice all melted the oceans rose, and then we get, we got now,

145
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:54.500
so maybe it was a much larger island or maybe it was like the bearing landmass

146
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:56.420
where you could get across it before.

147
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.270
<v 1>And they must speak a language that no one else,</v>

148
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.140
not even close to anything else since it's been like so long.

149
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.090
<v 0>Man, here's it combined with Lang throw it here is combined with body language.</v>

150
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.860
They seem to have a link. Hmm.

151
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.130
So they were like telling them to throw things and they giving them coconuts.

152
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.780
That's pretty cool.

153
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.560
It's crazy how friendly they are without knowing who the person is and where

154
00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:21.960
they're from. Well, I mean the dudes giving them free food.

155
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.900
So I think they're pumped. Yeah. Again, a bunch of free coconuts.

156
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.780
That's definitely a way to confront with people. Yeah.

157
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.320
<v 1>That guy, if that guy had coconuts, instead of a Bible.</v>

158
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.870
<v 0>I may still be alive. He probably through Bibles. They're like, you it.</v>

159
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.400
<v 1>Date, the Bible. They're like.</v>

160
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.720
<v 0>Look at that. Imagine some guy just showing up and giving you free food.</v>

161
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.960
Can you see my Dick? Is that, what is it?

162
00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:50.400
What is this video videos outrageous. That's a real translation. Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.470
I, I really, um, so it says a wooden acts similar to a mountain. Yeah.

164
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:58.770
That's a crazy looking and carried by all men. So they, yeah.

165
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.460
So they might not even have like metal.

166
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.350
It seems like if he's got a wooden ax, I wonder if they have what,

167
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.380
what they're using for arrowheads and stuff like that.

168
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.790
This kind of interests me. Oh dude. It's fascinating, man. The thing is,

169
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:19.590
it's real. What's weird about it is you can't really go there like yeah.

170
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.150
Jay, you guys ever read or watch that, um, that movie about, um,

171
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.560
the city of Z, the lost city of Z, is that what it was called? It was about, uh,

172
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:34.260
an Explorer from England who amaze way to south America and eventually got eaten

173
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:36.720
by cannibals, allegedly they think, oh,

174
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.040
but he was looking for this last Mayan or Aztec city. Was it a Mayan city?

175
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.840
Lost city of Z? Uh, Amazon. Yeah. So he was looking for some,

176
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.510
you know, apparently, and they've, they know this for sure.

177
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.280
Now there's some really, really,

178
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:54.420
really ancient cities in the Amazon and they don't know what they are.

179
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.660
They don't know from when they don't know who, who built them.

180
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.150
So they don't even know from who the it's different culture. Well,

181
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:02.550
it's a culture that's long gone. And it's the,

182
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.060
the area where they had the city has been absorbed by the jungle. So they,

183
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.231
they find it,

184
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:11.220
I think either from satellites or from some kind of imagery where they're

185
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:16.020
noticing these really obvious grid patterns that indicate irrigation

186
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:18.300
and that they had fields and they had streets.

187
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.890
And so this there's this English Explorer. What was the gentleman's name?

188
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.140
Harry faucet. Here's it? Yeah. It's the, book's not bad per se. Percy faucet.

189
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.100
And so this, this dude, uh, went to the jungles of Brazil, uh,

190
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.300
multiple times looking for this lost city of gold, 1860. So yeah,

191
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.040
so he, it was really, it's a cool movie, but not, it's not the best movie,

192
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:45.300
but it's cool. Cause it's like you, you get to see the lost city of Z.

193
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.450
He found it before he was killed. No, no, no.

194
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.070
He found something he found. So I don't want to spoil the movie,

195
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.680
but it's um, it's not a bad movie.

196
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.450
What's interesting to me is that these people,

197
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.510
you just got to put yourself in the mind of people that lived in 1860 and they,

198
00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:06.210
they literally had no idea what the was going on in south America. They just,

199
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.650
but someone would come back.

200
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:12.180
And so Arthur has a story of his journeys down the jungle

201
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:13.890
river and the guy would stand up.

202
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.940
We met that uncontacted tribe and they would talk about I've brought back pot

203
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:20.520
pottery. And this is a spearhead and you know,

204
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.280
and here's drawings of the animals that I saw.

205
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.940
He's got drawings of crocodiles and giant Paranas and sh.
