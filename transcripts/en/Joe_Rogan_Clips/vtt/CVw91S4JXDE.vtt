00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 1>Experience, you know, last night during the golden globe was going on,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.680
there were some jokes going on by Ricky DVE that we could probably talk about

4
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:08.920
later, but, uh,

5
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.600
60 minutes was probably going on a different channel at the same time.

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.040
And they had, uh,

7
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.880
a report with some new evidence that nobody has seen yet. Oh geez.

8
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.590
They have some, uh, autopsy, photos and photos from inside his cell.

9
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.090
Whoa.

10
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.230
<v 2>You the photo, the photos online. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get em, of course.</v>

11
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.030
<v 0>Yeah. I didn't know. This was just released.</v>

12
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:33.350
I saw this last night and I saw one of the photos and it looks real.

13
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.430
<v 1>So I watched the 15 minutes that they put together,</v>

14
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:40.950
which is mostly just about like the, uh, incident in the,

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.180
in the cell and surrounding it. I'm just gonna show you the pictures of,

16
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:49.020
because we can't watch their thing. Let me try to get the 13 images.

17
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:49.840
Cause they're all.

18
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.060
<v 2>Am I scared?</v>

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.540
<v 1>No. I mean, it's just.</v>

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.820
<v 2>I'm scared already. I'm scared already because of, uh, Iran.</v>

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.501
Why aren't the pictures?

22
00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.060
I don't wanna be scared of this video of them whacking this dude,

23
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.530
you know, they whacked in yes, hun.

24
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.570
That's a hundred percent the fact that they thought they could get away with

25
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:09.170
that. That's so crazy.

26
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.770
Like that is such a crazy thing to try to get away with this gigantic

27
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.290
international case. Hey, what happened to the cameras? Oh, broke, man.

28
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.330
I don't know. Sucks. They hung.

29
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.970
<v 0>Himself. They needed a couple days to make the videos and stuff like that.</v>

30
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.920
<v 2>He tried. Yeah, exactly. That's the problem. So fake.</v>

31
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.280
He tried to hang himself before and they're like, Hey, don't do that again,

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.720
HES, like, all right, won. Gimme my belt. Gimme my shoelaces.

33
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.360
Gimme whatever the that guy strangled me with &lt;laugh&gt;.

34
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.680
<v 0>Yeah. These footage are all fake.</v>

35
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.520
<v 1>Right? No, no. Hold on. I mean, I don't know why it's not.</v>

36
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.400
They're very realistic.

37
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.190
<v 2>Eddie Bravo in here immediately.</v>

38
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.430
<v 1>Okay, here, here we go. Uh, pull this up here.</v>

39
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.470
So this isn't from his cell. This is inside there.

40
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.150
I'll put these up on the screen. Uh, so this was the cell he was in by himself.

41
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.870
Okay. I said he used a bunch of these orange jumpsuits,

42
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:58.790
which I guess were already in there. He tied them.

43
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.623
<v 2>Around his head.</v>

44
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.030
<v 1>I guess there's a,</v>

45
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:04.340
there is a little like spotlight up here are on the top of the, uh,

46
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.220
grate where the window is,

47
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.300
where you could see maybe there was something up there.

48
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.100
But the thing to remind remember here is that he was, uh, about six foot tall,

49
00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:16.700
185 pounds. Um, there's one other thing like on this ladder here,

50
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.100
there is also some other things I'll get into in just a second.

51
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.380
That would be easier to use than tying all this together.

52
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.250
But they showed there's. The other thing here was this,

53
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.330
this was about four feet off the ground and they do show a, a noose,

54
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.090
which they're saying was what he used.

55
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.130
But as the doctor sort of said that the noose that this show picture of,

56
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.770
which is what you can see in the top right corner here, which, and just playing,

57
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.210
oh.

58
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.970
<v 2>That's Dr. Michael Badden. That's that guy from the HBO auto autopsy show.</v>

59
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.080
<v 1>For some reason, I can't I'll find it in a second,</v>

60
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.760
but the picture that shows his actual neck doesn't seem like this noose

61
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.800
caused that wound.

62
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.640
And it's a little bit lower than it probably should have been. Oh Jesus. Um,

63
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.640
so they're showing some of these other, this is some of the pictures of him.

64
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.960
This is the, the bone, his jaw, the Hoy Julio bone thing. His jaw was broken.

65
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.040
Well, there's the fracture that they said wasn't consistent with, uh, hanging.

66
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.920
It's more consistent with, um, a murder, a homicide. And he said,

67
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.480
this is Bain's words. Is that usually he's seen it.

68
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:18.000
And maybe like one bone break and sometimes two, but there were three fractures.

69
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:18.751
And he says like,

70
00:03:18.751 --> 00:03:22.190
he's almost never seen that in any of his cases he's ever looked over.

71
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.110
<v 2>Hmm. And you would think, uh, it would be,</v>

72
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.230
if you're gonna hang yourself from such a short distance,

73
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.510
it would be even harder to get a fracture like that. Right.

74
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.990
Cause you're not like jumping on, like in an old Western movie,

75
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.510
like Clints would movie when they would hang him, hang 'em high.

76
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.220
<v 1>So the one thing that they also had a in here was he left a note, oh Jesus. Uh,</v>

77
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.260
the note said like, there was like four things. It said first that the, some,

78
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.060
it had the name blur out, but it said this person left him in a shower,

79
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.740
locked for an hour. It then said someone else gave him like burnt food.

80
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.490
And then bugs were crawling over his hands. And he just wrote no fun,

81
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.570
but there's a ballpoint pen.

82
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.810
Like the one I have in my hand sitting right next to it. And they like,

83
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:08.970
if you knew he was on suicide,

84
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:11.570
watch you wouldn't give him a ballpoint pen that he could kill himself with.

85
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.610
<v 2>Jamie, you should be a God detective is whatI.</v>

86
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.330
<v 1>This is what they're saying. And he had his, uh,</v>

87
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.290
his sleep APM machine was in there. It was,

88
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.920
you could see an extension cord coming in the hallway into his room that

89
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.320
he could have just used that to kill himself and hang himself or the nine jump

90
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.040
jumpsuits. Why does.

91
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.440
<v 2>He have nine jumpsuits? Yeah. The jumpsuit thing is freaking like,</v>

92
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:33.640
they're trying to explain it by bringing in some, some new witness.

93
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.640
<v 1>So somehow this is actually a different video.</v>

94
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.760
That's shown a couple different things than what I saw this wearing.

95
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.480
I didn't see this arm thing and I didn't see the picture of his.

96
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.150
<v 2>But the arm thing looks like an injection spot. Is that what it looks like?</v>

97
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.550
<v 1>I guess. So here's the actual, this is what I saw. Here's the note.</v>

98
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.630
<v 2>What does this say? Sorry. So it says it's at 60 minutes.</v>

99
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.310
Get their watermark all over it. It's so funny. Sorry, 60 minutes. Thank you.

100
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:55.870
Thanks for getting this. So.

101
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.190
<v 1>Kept me in a locked it's blurred right here.</v>

102
00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:02.780
It says the name is board kept me in a locked shower or one hour neck

103
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.300
or, uh, someone, I don't know the name send in burnt food, giant bugs,

104
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.860
crawled on my hands and then no fun. And then they're saying, and then he could,

105
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.580
but then this ball point pen was next to it that he could have stabbed himself

106
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.020
in the neck or whatever, you know? Yeah.

107
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.460
<v 2>It's hard to kill yourself with a pen. Yeah. But do they get pens?</v>

108
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.570
That's.

109
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.690
<v 1>Usually, but this is.</v>

110
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.050
<v 2>Like a, you know, high profile case. I, yeah. I don't know. It's just,</v>

111
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.890
yeah. I don't think you should have a pay.

112
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.410
It might look it's so it's bad to say either way,

113
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.290
if you don't know, and I'm guilty of that a hundred percent.

114
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.850
I'm like that guy didn't kill himself. I'm talking. Oh,

115
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.160
I'm not talking in terms of, we have to understand this is really important.

116
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.680
Here's the, uh, we're, uh, we're doing a podcast when you're doing a podcast.

117
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.400
You don't have to be factually accurate. You just have to talk.

118
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.320
And hopefully if you up, you correct it. And it's funny. Um,

119
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.840
I'm not a science expert,

120
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.040
but when these guys are saying that the guy died by strangulation,

121
00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.280
there's all these points of consistent strangulation.

122
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.880
And it takes forever to get these pictures.

123
00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:09.040
And then there's the video cameras didn't work.

124
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.760
And this is the second time he tried to kill himself.

125
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.640
And he's a high profile witness and a really, really,

126
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.550
really important case involving pedophiles that the highest levels of

127
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:19.190
government. Yeah, I wouldn't,

128
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.670
I would think that that's the kind of guy you whack. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

129
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.750
<v 1>You're also according to the procedure, you're not,</v>

130
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.030
when there's a suicide there,

131
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.470
you're not supposed to move the body and take it to the emergency room.

132
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.230
You're supposed to treat it as though it was a murder or like a crime scene.

133
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.230
What's crazy. Is.

134
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.390
<v 2>That it's so high profile like even is in,</v>

135
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:39.260
because this is most likely how they did it forever. Right?

136
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.260
Like the people that whack people, they were probably like, you know,

137
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.540
I was doing comedy before the internet. &lt;laugh&gt; they,

138
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.460
they were probably whacking people before the.

139
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.740
<v 1>Internet. Right. Do you wanna see? I found the graphic image. Sure. Okay.</v>

140
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.780
Oh yeah. I'm that scared? Don't see if you don't wanna see it, Brian. But.

141
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.980
<v 0>I saw that he has weird texture on his cheek. I thought.</v>

142
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.010
<v 2>Interesting. Brian, like tell me more.</v>

143
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.610
<v 0>Like bed marks almost like he was.</v>

144
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.970
<v 2>Um, maybe I think that's just the blood rush to his head. Yeah, bro,</v>

145
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:07.250
that guy got strangled. That looks like a strangled guy.

146
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.770
<v 1>Yeah. That's what I thought or.</v>

147
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.730
<v 2>Or choked from a, but the thing is like, there's.</v>

148
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.090
<v 1>No blood on, that's the thing. There's no blood on that. No.</v>

149
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.760
So they said was the noose that did it and there blood on his body.

150
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:21.920
There's no pictures of him in the cell. It didn't take any pictures of that.

151
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:22.120
Wait.

152
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.680
<v 2>Hold on. There's no blood on the noose. They said killed him.</v>

153
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:26.960
But yet there's blood on his net. Correct? That.

154
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.793
<v 1>Was pointed out by the.</v>

155
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.160
<v 2>That's insane. That's impossible. If they did,</v>

156
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:34.480
they really do a test of the rope that they supposedly said, just show him.

157
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.600
<v 1>A picture of it. And it looks very clean. A, the unused and.</v>

158
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.390
<v 2>Well orange, maybe the red doesn't show up that clean on orange.</v>

159
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.270
Can we look at it again? Um, I think this should, I think we should probab look,

160
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.110
I wanna say for sure that killed him.

161
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.750
<v 1>And the lawyer she's talking to and the piece is his, uh,</v>

162
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.950
former cellmate's lawyer. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he's just, ah, no,

163
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.853
it's obviously.

164
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.030
<v 2>Bro. The former cellmate is my favorite part of the story. Yeah.</v>

165
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.700
Gigantic Dick ex cop. Who's our murder and a drug dealer.

166
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.860
&lt;laugh&gt; and he's huge. He's a gorilla,

167
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.660
a straight up gorilla, big Italian gorilla.

168
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.580
And they put him in jail with that guy. Come on, man.

169
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.540
They probably come on, look at his neck.

170
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.730
Okay. So they're examining the thing they, this is Dr. Michael Badden from HBO,

171
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:25.690
correct? Correct. And uh,

172
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.930
he's examining the thing that was supposedly used to kill him.

173
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:30.290
And he's saying there's nothing on it.

174
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.770
And he's showing the actual lacerations around the neck that show clear blood.

175
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.130
And he says, it's too low in the neck too. That that's what, that's.

176
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.280
<v 1>Her population right here. She says, if he, if he did what you thought, like,</v>

177
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:42.800
which would've been like leaning forward on the ground,

178
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:44.600
that it probably would've been a little higher under the jaw.

179
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:46.640
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; not down at the base of the neck kind of,

180
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.560
but who that's a little bit tough to say, I.

181
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.880
<v 2>Guess you weren't there. Well, that's I,</v>

182
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.440
I would imagine if you're killing somebody like that,

183
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:57.560
they're trying to get away people that are trying to get away, do that. Right.

184
00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:00.520
If you're killing him from behind, if that guy's holding him down.

185
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.800
Oh, come on, man. Look at his neck.

186
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.400
Hmm. So hold on, though. Is any of that break actually breaking the skin?

187
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.470
The thing is, it looks like a wire. It looks like a wire to me.

188
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.270
It does look like a wire. That's why it looks way too thin to be that yeah.

189
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.910
That thick, that thick thing. Cloth noose. I mean maybe,

190
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.390
maybe that thick noose thing is really strong fabric,

191
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.310
but that looks like a wire. Me man.

192
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.710
But wouldn't a wire just slice right into your neck too. Yeah.

193
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.980
It looks like that's more like blood rising to the skin mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

194
00:09:35.981 --> 00:09:38.500
than, than an actual cut. Yeah. That's what I'm thinking too.

195
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.460
It looked before though, like it was a cut.

196
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.060
So maybe there wasn't really that much blood that actually came through the skin

197
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.460
and maybe all that, um, that cloth just,

198
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.180
maybe it's really thin and it gets down like a wire.

199
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.460
Like if you choke somebody with, um, like a, a bandana,

200
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.371
you know, like if you,

201
00:09:57.371 --> 00:10:01.170
you had like one of them bandanas that hippies put on their dogs and you, uh,

202
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.730
choke someone to death with one of those things. I,

203
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.370
I gotta think it's gonna make a very small mark.

204
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.890
I don't think it's gonna make a thick mark.

205
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.490
If you like got someone in like Aniel choke, it's one of those things and, yeah.

206
00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:15.850
That's a strong, it would, it would get thin like where it was.

207
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.600
You like the actual point. Yeah. Yeah. Would that make a mark like that?

208
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.600
That I'm sure someone now is gonna go start myth busting, like how to,

209
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:28.160
what it looks like if you do do that test and like they have to murder someone

210
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.800
to find out if it's true, just get another piece of.

211
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.760
So we'll find out later today. I'm sure the whole thing strange man.

212
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.910
It's so a look.
