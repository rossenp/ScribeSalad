00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>Experience. And then you also have this crazy green drink that you were.</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.240
<v 0>Telling me about. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So this right here is, um, Lina, uh,</v>

4
00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:11.680
ever since I changed my diet up,

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.960
I need to have a couple of these every single day and it, uh,

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.240
makes me feel good, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't eat meat anymore,

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.000
so I know you're a big meaty yeah. Eat.

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.870
<v 1>Fish or any of that? No, nothing.</v>

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.810
<v 0>All vegan.</v>

10
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.750
<v 1>All vegan. When did you.</v>

11
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.550
<v 0>Become vegan? Uh, probably about, oh man.</v>

12
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.430
I wanna say probably about almost two years now. Really? Yeah.

13
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.630
Almost two years now. Like it love it love, but it's changed my life, man.

14
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:35.630
It's been, it's been one of the things I can honestly say.

15
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:40.270
That's just revolutionized my, my complete everything. It's it's,

16
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.020
it's, it's been everything that that's, um, lately that has, you know,

17
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.260
changed me from a mental standpoint, physical standpoint,

18
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.300
and even a spiritual standpoint.

19
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.500
<v 1>I definitely think it changes the mind because this all meat diet that I've been</v>

20
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:59.540
on that changes your mind the other way. It makes you more aggressive. Yeah.

21
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.410
Too much. So yeah. Have to work out extra to keep the, keep the demons at bed.

22
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.410
It's the blood. It is. It's that, it's also like, if you think about it,

23
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.650
if you, if your body thinks, okay, I have to eat animals all the time.

24
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:16.250
Cause all this eats as animals. Right. Right.

25
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.210
If your body thinks that your body's going to sort of take on the

26
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.040
characteristics of, I think that's a predator mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

27
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.240
You would become more. I mean, this is obviously like some bro. Psychology,

28
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.183
some moron,

29
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.560
but I would say your body is gonna think I'm more aggressive. I,

30
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.880
I have to chase down and kill it. Yeah. Right.

31
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:39.480
That's that's you have to be more predatory. Your body has to think that way.

32
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.360
<v 0>I can get with that. It, it makes sense though. It makes sense.</v>

33
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.510
<v 1>Did you do it right after you retired?</v>

34
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.590
<v 0>Um, you know, I kind of, not right after I retired,</v>

35
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:51.750
it was kind of something that, um, that kind of just happened. Like I, uh,

36
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.950
ever since I, um, like cuz I do mushrooms, right? Uh,

37
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.950
oh yeah. Yeah. So it was, it was, it was when I did a, uh, like when I had a,

38
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.980
a really, really deep trip that just caused me to, to uh,

39
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.860
have one of those ego deaths mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and when I had the ego death,

40
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.300
I was like in a state where this knowingness was coming to me and it was like,

41
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.100
you know, I was like, uh, it was all day. It was, I, I did a, uh,

42
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.380
a mushroom ceremony. Mm. And it was all day and I was just out in the sun.

43
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.890
It just, you know, in my own mind. And then, um,

44
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.850
I was smelling real bad and then I smelled myself and you know,

45
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.170
you catch a smell yourself. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And I was like, oh my God,

46
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.590
I stink.

47
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.090
And then &lt;laugh&gt; the knowingness said like you stink because you eat dead

48
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:40.730
rotting flesh. And it said, if you want to eat, if you want life,

49
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:45.120
then you eat life. That's what this knowingness said to me. And, and I was like,

50
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.040
that's a strange thought to just come into my mind like that mm-hmm

51
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.440
&lt;affirmative&gt;. And then after that, no kidding.

52
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.520
Like I just lost my taste for meat. It just,

53
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.160
and I used to eat all kinds of meat. I would eat, I would eat pork. And,

54
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.600
and I was, you know, big into pork and big into like all kinds of meat.

55
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.720
I was never one of those diet guys at all. But after that happened to me,

56
00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:08.680
after I had that experience, it was just like one of those things that, um,

57
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.560
that I just couldn't help, but go into, like, I just lost it.

58
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:17.360
Taste for me one trip. Yeah. I mean, well, it was, well, it was,

59
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.110
it kind of started one in a, um,

60
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.230
like about eight months before that I did the toad

61
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.350
and then the, to was one that, that really was the catalyst for everything's a.

62
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.910
<v 1>Lot of people listening, going, what the is he saying? You did the toad.</v>

63
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.670
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So five M O D Mt. Which is the toad and the,</v>

64
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.500
to was one that was, I guess, the,

65
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.820
the catalyst of busting that gate open.

66
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.660
<v 1>And that's a crazy psychedelic. Yeah. That's a very underrated psychedelic. Oh.</v>

67
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.500
<v 0>My God. It, it, that, that will, yeah.</v>

68
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.660
<v 1>That's the, the first really I had done mushrooms before, but I did a,</v>

69
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.980
a fairly small dose. I mean, fairly small in that I could walk around.

70
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.850
I was pretty whacked out, but I could walk around a couple grams,

71
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.370
but the five me O DMT was the first one where I just ceased to

72
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:11.330
exist. I just stopped. And it made me really aware of ego, really aware of like,

73
00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:13.130
even the way I expressed myself,

74
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.410
the way I would frame sentences and say things. I was just,

75
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.760
I was trying to sound cool. Yeah.

76
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.480
Or I was trying to portray something in a way, like,

77
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.400
not just trying to portray the information, but trying to impress people.

78
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.880
And it made me like, feel real gross.

79
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.520
<v 0>Yeah. Well, that's, that's the thing like when, um,</v>

80
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.760
I had my five experience, it was, uh, man, I just never,

81
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.430
I never thought that, um,

82
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.950
consciousness could be so vast and so big. You know, when I, when,

83
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:48.870
when you have that experience with the five MBO,

84
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.470
it just like it made this consciousness make look as if like it was,

85
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.670
uh, a, a drop in a bucket, you know, just like a little drop in.

86
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.860
I got to experience the ocean of consciousness and that right there was,

87
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.980
it was the most humbling experience I ever had, you know, just to, uh,

88
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.380
feel my ego, who I thought I was,

89
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:16.220
what I thought I was completely just annihilated and to feel what

90
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.460
I actually was, you know, it was, it was crazy.

91
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.130
I feel like regular consciousness that most of us exist in most of the time is a

93
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.530
veneer. It's a very thin veneer. Yeah.

94
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.450
And through some things you get a taste of what's under the surface through

95
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:35.050
meditation and yoga and all these different methods that people use.

96
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.530
Holotropic breathing, you get a taste of what's underneath the surface,

97
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.920
Kundalini yoga, apparently Kline yoga, apparently never really done it,

98
00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:46.280
but some people say you could really trip out if you do it, uh,

99
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.600
in a certain way. For long periods of time,

100
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.880
people have like very intense psychedelic experiences akin to DMT.

101
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.320
<v 0>Yeah. I had like a, um,</v>

102
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.960
like a Kundalini kind of experience, like a note awakening where it was like a,

103
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.800
uh, as I just had, um,

104
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.520
felt like the top of my head just completely was gone. And it was,

105
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.640
it was like, I was just open to

106
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.030
all like the information. It was, it was a easy, it was like I had no,

107
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.070
no, no, no head. Like, it was just,

108
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.350
I was just information was just pouring into, but no roof.

109
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.510
<v 1>No roof was this from Kini.</v>

110
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.950
<v 0>No, it, it was, uh, it, it was from mushrooms, but oh, it was from similar, but,</v>

111
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.150
but I felt, but I felt that, um, that,

112
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.500
that wanted to lean the experience where you see the light mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

113
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.420
it was like this really intense light that, that happens in, in my head.

114
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.460
And it was just, boom. You see, you see the universe.

115
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.260
<v 1>You know? Well, you know, that, um, that thing about the center of your head,</v>

116
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.220
that's what the there's,

117
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:56.300
there's a lot of speculation on what the Egyptians were trying to draw when they

118
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.770
were drawing certain images, but there's certain temples that seem to mimic,

119
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.971
uh, certain,

120
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.610
certain shapes in these temples that seem to mimic the pineal gland.

121
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.730
Like even the eye that there's that famous Egyptian eye that has that sort of

122
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.890
dip down. Yeah. And that weird sort of Egyptian shape,

123
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.440
there's been a bunch of different scholars that have tried to figure out what

124
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.680
exactly that meant. And one,

125
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.560
one of the theories is that that's a cross section of the pineal gland.

126
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.600
And they think that what they were emphasizing was that,

127
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.640
that is the area where the brain produces all the psychedelic chemicals.

128
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.960
And they, they, they speculated this for a long time, but Dr. Rick Strassman,

129
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.400
uh, he's the guy that wrote that, uh, book, uh, DMT,

130
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:42.070
the spirit molecule and actually a documentary on it that I hosted. And he, um,

131
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.910
he's done a bunch of work with this Cottonwood research foundation where they've

132
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.630
shown now that it exists in live rats and that it,

133
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:52.990
that it is actually produced by that gland,

134
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.830
that DMT is actually produced in these animals by this one particular gland that

135
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:01.060
they as associated with spiritual awakening with the third eye.

136
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.260
So it actually is a real thing. That feeling that you get. Yeah.

137
00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:08.420
And the thing about mushrooms it's really interesting is mushrooms actually

138
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.540
mimic natural human neurochemistry.

139
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.340
There's five MEO, DMT there's N N DMT.

140
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.050
And then what mushrooms, the, what it's processed to the way,

141
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.570
the way it, uh, your body processes, it becomes something called four Fox,

142
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.130
four Oxy, N N dimethyltryptamine. So it's real, it's all real close, real close.

143
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.890
I might have butchered that technical description, but that's, it's,

144
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.130
it's real close to human neurochemistry. So your body absorbs it very easily.

145
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.960
Your body takes it in your body, knows what it is, your body know, doing it.

146
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.240
<v 0>See when I was, um, I like mushrooms because the mushrooms,</v>

147
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:47.880
so the five me was so powerful that you,

148
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.000
you can't really get a handle on what happened. Like I,

149
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.400
I came back from being away for like 17 minutes and I'm just like, whoa,

150
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.520
that was intense. You know,

151
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:00.520
I felt as if like I was everything all at the same time and it was, you know,

152
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.200
so many different things that was just happening,

153
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.960
but you really can't unpack it because it's, it's,

154
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.560
it's incomprehensible to an extent for, for the larger extent,

155
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:12.080
because you you're, you're dealing with, you know,

156
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.390
concepts that the human mind can't even grasp because there's no vocabulary to,

157
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.550
to speak about it. You know? So, um, when I did the mushrooms,

158
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:26.430
the mushrooms were kind of like the rivers and the lakes that leads to the

159
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:27.010
ocean.

160
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.910
And it helps me understand how I am part of something so big

161
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.950
and something so grand. So when I, when I did my,

162
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.580
when I have my mushroom experiences, they were all different in some,

163
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.460
in some respect, you know, like, um, like whenever I, I do go deep,

164
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.020
cause I like to go deep. I don't, I don't,

165
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.500
I don't play around with like micro dosin. Yeah. Micro do. I mean,

166
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.780
I do microdosing sometimes, but I like to get in there with like five grams,

167
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.050
you know, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; 10, you know, that's how you know, it's up.

168
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.650
Yeah. Those big ones, the big doses where you,

169
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.890
you get kind of scared once you ate it. And then, you know,

170
00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:05.490
you got like 40 minutes before it kicks and you're like, oh boy,

171
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.090
just turn it back now. There's no turning back now,

172
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.930
but that's the thing about it when you face that, that fear mm-hmm,

173
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.530
&lt;affirmative&gt; of just going deep and it's helped me out so much.
