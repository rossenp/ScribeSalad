00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 3>Welcome to episode</v>

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.340
1,666.

4
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.960
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.880
<v 1>There can be only one. Why? I don't know. It's the rules.</v>

6
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.980
Thumbs, the rules, terrible.

7
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760
<v 0>Rules, worst rule. But.</v>

8
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
<v 1>For, for episode, 1,666, there was only one option. That was you.</v>

9
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.960
<v 0>Oh, thank you. I'm honored by that. Thank you so much, Joe.</v>

10
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.100
It's so nice to be here.

11
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.750
<v 1>Dude. So nice to see you.</v>

12
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
It's you're such a good friend that every time I see you, I'm transported.

13
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.150
Like there's no time lost. You know what I'm saying?

14
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.900
When you're so tight with someone that when you see them again,

15
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.760
you're like transported.

16
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
Like you're immediately back to where I last saw you again. There's no like,

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.950
Hey God, haven't seen you in a while. How are you?

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.350
<v 0>It's like, yeah. Yeah. That's real friendship. I mean, that's it.</v>

19
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.000
If it's not that, what is it?

20
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.230
<v 1>I'm super concerned about this weird catching fire. We're surrounded by candles.</v>

21
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.140
And uh, I believe this wig is flammable.

22
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.920
<v 0>Yeah. That way it gets from China. I don't know what it is.</v>

23
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:40.500
That could be some bizarre synthetic. That could be anything.

24
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.070
<v 1>This is the hair of a billionaire who said the wrong. No.</v>

25
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.653
<v 0>And they just.</v>

26
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.610
<v 1>They probably made him grow his hair first,</v>

27
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.840
probably kept them in a tunnel somewhere and made him eat rats,

28
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:56.010
whatever rats he catch. Yeah. And just give him hair vitamins,

29
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
DGN. When his hair was long enough to make a wig out of it, they let him go.

30
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.490
<v 0>That's a lot of work to get some help.</v>

31
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.010
<v 1>Yeah. Now all he does is coach John Siena.</v>

32
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.700
His job is to coach Johnson. I want to say.

33
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.190
<v 0>Well here, that was really weird.</v>

34
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
That was one of the weirdest things I'm not a fan of or not a fan of John seen a

35
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.480
no John Siena opinion, but that was just an.

36
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.010
<v 1>Odd, it was scary.</v>

37
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.190
<v 0>Cause they want it's a lot. I guess it's just a lot of money, man.</v>

38
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:27.570
The Chinese dollar to.

39
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.190
<v 1>Here's how much money it is ready for this, that movie made $160 million.</v>

40
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.600
The opening weekend, I believe 134 million of it was from China.

41
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.123
Oh God.

42
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.760
<v 0>Oh God. We got to get in. Let's do our apologies.</v>

43
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.040
<v 1>I need to learn Mandarin and started talking.</v>

44
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.300
Started doing my acting manager. It sounds cool. It sounds great.

45
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.860
Well amazing.

46
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.250
The most impressive thing about that video was not just China got John seen at a

47
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:04.630
cook, but also that John CNS speaks perfect Mandarin.

48
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.400
Yeah. How long does that take?

49
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.820
<v 0>It's a mystery. I don't know, man. It was just strange. I was like,</v>

50
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.160
that's some really, really the most it's again like, you know,

51
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.530
we're watching that fight. Oh my God.

52
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.850
When we're watching that fight last night and you're just watching it and you're

53
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:26.080
trying to make sense of the new reality, you know? Cause it's like,

54
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.160
you gotta accept it,

55
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.500
but he's wearing a peek at shoe medallion fighting like the best

56
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.010
boxer alive today, you know? And,

57
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:39.430
but you ha you have to watch it from the perspective of like, well,

58
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:44.050
this is what is happening now because otherwise you get this weird spinning

59
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.500
vertigo. Like what the universe in mind?

60
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.030
Same thing when you're like watching John Sienna do some weird

61
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:56.080
apology and ma and Mandarin, it's the sense of like what?

62
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.790
This is a malfunction, this is a breakdown. I don't get this.

63
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.380
When in the history of the United States,

64
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.420
like imagine like some old video of like John Wayne doing some

65
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.520
apology in another language, it's just.

66
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.280
<v 1>Weird. It is weird, but it's a warning to, to everybody, right?</v>

67
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.540
The people that don't, they're not taking this sort of cultural shift seriously.

68
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.250
When you see an enormous alpha male and John Siena,

69
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.170
John's seen his arms are so big.

70
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.300
It looks like they're supposed to be a foot longer,

71
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.040
but someone saw them off and put like a fist here.

72
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.611
It's like,

73
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.600
if my forearm like w went down only to here and then the fist was there,

74
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.860
his wrists are enormously sleep. He's such a gorilla. Right.

75
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:46.510
And to see that guy saying it in Chinese and you read what he

76
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:49.660
actually said, it's like, uh, it's hard to say, right.

77
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.720
Because one thing I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. I was like,

78
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:55.930
what did he actually say? Because I don't speak Mandarin. Right. Right.

79
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.730
I w I wish someone maybe that spoke Mandarin could translate it and tell me

80
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.350
whether or not that was accurate. Right.

81
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.700
I'm assuming it was accurate because I haven't heard anything. You know,

82
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:09.310
people who speak Mandarin, must've gotten a hold of it since that. Sure.

83
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.740
But it was just weird to see an apology for just saying that a country exists.

84
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.970
That's essentially what it was. Right. He said, Taiwan is a country.

85
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.040
And he said that, I mean, that's all he said wrong.

86
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.060
Like Taiwan was going to be the first country to see the movie.

87
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.280
<v 0>Yeah, that's right. You can't say that. Which is. You know,</v>

88
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:33.820
also that thing that just popped up, they said it was a mistake,

89
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.220
but being apparently made it so that if you image search

90
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.460
the Tiananmen square guy, holding the suitcase,

91
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.800
didn't show up on the day of,

92
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.060
on the anniversary of the Tiananmen square massacre. And so everybody's like,

93
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:53.980
what the? Just like, are you, are you like owned by China now?

94
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.450
You know, that's, that's a, that is a really strange form of invasion.

95
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.320
Isn't it? It's like,

96
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.220
it's not the normal kind of invasion where we're thinking about invasions from

97
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.000
old historical versions of invasions,

98
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:11.600
but that's not how it works anymore. Now it's, you know,

99
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.150
if you get your technology into another country,

100
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.800
if you become the supplier of a lot of their pharmaceuticals,

101
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:22.850
if you all these things, then you don't really need to invade,

102
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.190
you know what I mean? If you've bought up a lot of their.

103
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.400
<v 1>Property, you don't need to fly in with jets. You don't need, cause.</v>

104
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.640
<v 0>You're buying it. And you're like, that's like, to me, that's the,</v>

105
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.450
that's where countries like the United States,

106
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.550
what makes him so amazing is also this huge, terrible weakness,

107
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:45.410
which is they have a permeable membrane shaking it in there easier than

108
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:50.360
other places, you know? And like, especially now with the ability to like,

109
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.860
just have a thousand AI bots running various Twitter accounts

110
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:59.690
expressing kind of similar sentiment regarding whatever the it is you want to

111
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:04.520
promote. Whoo. That's crazy. You could just warp people's minds anyway.

112
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:07.910
You want, I mean, you know, we, I, we have, no,

113
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.250
I'm not just talking state agencies either. I mean,

114
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:15.110
just cobbles of like an Arcus you feel like just around with the

115
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.820
Zeit guys could theoretically just put out a ton of

116
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.580
bots or phone banks of people putting weird ideas into the culture

117
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:27.800
that, you know, you hear it enough times you start thinking like,

118
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.260
I guess that is true. That must be true.

119
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:33.050
I don't know if you've ever had the thing happen where you're just scanning

120
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:36.260
Twitter and you see some completely wrong,

121
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.640
like deeply wrong fact and physics, but you didn't,

122
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.460
you were just or something. So you're like, well, that's interesting.

123
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.820
And then later you repeat it without looking it up to see if it's true.

124
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:49.340
And then you go back to see it. This happened, I mean,

125
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.850
you realize like three tweets above that tweet.

126
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.810
It's like the guy's like, I'm the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe.

127
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.650
I mean, I go.

128
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.570
I repeated some fact I heard from a guy who thinks he's the

129
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.590
reincarnation of Maryland and literally at dinner, you know,

130
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.610
that's what I'm saying. Is it leaks out? And so it's just trippy. You know,

131
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:14.480
it's just weird.
