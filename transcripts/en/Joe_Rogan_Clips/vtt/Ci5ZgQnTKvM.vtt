1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>It's just like, okay, that's the Democrats. Well,</v>

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.080
why do they need a political voice? Well, to, to,

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.210
to keep the hierarchy from degenerating into rigid tyranny as part of the

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:11.910
political discussion. But now the problem is,

5
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.090
is in the PR this is the problem with the left. Is that, well,

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.990
what's the hierarchy. It's a tyrannical patriarchy. It's like, no, it's not.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.510
It's partly corrupt like every system, but it's less corrupt than most systems.

8
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.380
And there's a lot of elements of it that are devoted towards self-improvement

9
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:32.160
self-monitoring you have to be a little nuanced and subtle about these sorts of

10
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:34.890
things. And you can't throw the baby out with the bath water.

11
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:39.480
And the leftist rhetoric has got so intense that the, the idea is, and,

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.240
and people believe this while the world is going to hell in a hand basket,

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.160
everything is getting worse in all possible ways.

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.780
And there's systemic racism everywhere,

15
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.920
and it's utterly unfair and it should be torn down and rebuilt. It's like, no,

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.800
it's actually functioning unbelievably well,

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.010
even though it still has its problems, you know,

18
00:00:56.011 --> 00:01:00.720
and there's a big difference between saying there's systemic racism everywhere.

19
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.740
And the reason that there isn't perfectly equal outcomes is because of prejudice

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.690
and saying, no, no, look, the system is functioning. Let's say at 75%,

21
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
it's doing all right. It's got some problems, including systemic prejudice,

22
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.500
which hopefully will work themselves out across time.

23
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:19.770
And which show every bit of evidence of doing so.

24
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.700
And so we don't need a radical solution, you know, and,

25
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.690
and one of the things I've started to do with my Twitter account is to tweet out

26
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.880
good non naive news, because one of the things that's happening in the world,

27
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:36.180
and there's been half a dozen books on this or more written in the last five

28
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:37.380
years by credible people,

29
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:41.820
is that the distribution of the idea of individual

30
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.480
sovereignty and property rights and free market economies, et cetera,

31
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.860
out into the rest of the world is making the non Western world is making the non

32
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.130
Western world rich really, really, really fast.

33
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.730
So between 2000 and 2012,

34
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.990
the rate of absolute poverty in the world fell by half half.

35
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:04.230
It was the fastest period of economic development in human history.

36
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.000
We beat the UN. We beat the optimistic UN target by three years,

37
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.090
staggering. Um, you know, the,

38
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.830
the rates of child mortality in Africa are now lower than they were in Europe.

39
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.480
In 1950,

40
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.590
the fastest growing economies in the world are in Sub-Saharan Africa,

41
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.050
many millions of people,

42
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.580
millions of people a month are getting access to this incredible technology.

43
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:33.540
That's embodied in cell phones, right? People have access to fresh water.

44
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.890
Like they've never had access before the child. The kids are,

45
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.370
kids are getting immunized at a rate that's, that's unfair.

46
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.920
That's that's unprecedented. And,

47
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.390
and yet we have this idea that's become rampant in the west,

48
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:52.170
that there's something ultimately corrupt about the patriarchal tyranny and that

49
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.990
it has to be dismantled right down to its core.

50
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800
And a lot of that's being taught by the activist disciplines in universities,

51
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:01.180
and I don't get it. It's not acceptable.

52
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.580
<v 1>So they see these hierarchies and their proposal to</v>

53
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.100
level everything off and to take away the insane power at the very

54
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.990
top is equality of outcome is unproven unproven in terms

55
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.580
of it's never been, it's never been done successfully to a utopian.

56
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.970
<v 0>Right? Well, I, and I'd also don't even think you can do it in principle,</v>

57
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.930
because if you accept the proposition that the propositions I laid out,

58
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:30.940
which is you have to pursue things of value.

59
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.590
And if you pursue things in a value, in, in a social space,

60
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.440
so you do it cooperatively and competitively, you do it with other people.

61
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.440
Then you're going to produce differential outcome because people will be

62
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.920
differently good at it. It was like, okay, you don't believe that. It's like,

63
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.120
okay, do you listen to random selections of music online?

64
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.040
Or do you do what everyone else does?

65
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.450
You go for the one 10th of 1% of songwriters and you only listen to them.

66
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.070
You only listen to the one.

67
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.000
You only read the productions of one 10th of 1% of writers.

68
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.590
You only listened to the podcasts of one 10th of 1% of podcast

69
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.920
broadcasters, right? When you watch sports on TV,

70
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:13.870
you only watch the athletic contributions of one 10th of 1% of athletes.

71
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.920
So like, where's the equality exactly. Where's that in your life,

72
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.470
you people who are pushing for equality of outcome,

73
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.030
you manifest that in anything you do, you don't, you're unbelievably selective,

74
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.650
just like everyone else. And the reason you're selective is because you,

75
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.680
there are things that are happening that need to happen,

76
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:34.810
or that are entertaining and interesting.

77
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.770
And you want the best in all of those realms. That's how it works.

78
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.800
And there is a best, that's the other thing that's so painful.

79
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.220
And that that actually is painful. You know what?

80
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.670
Here's a problem of dispossession, a real problem.

81
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.700
One way to not do very well in any hierarchy is to have a low

82
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:59.440
IQ. And so IQ is normally distributed.

83
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.230
And if you have an IQ of less than 85,

84
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.290
it's hard for you to read well enough to follow instructions.

85
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.940
That's about 10% of the population might even be higher than that. Okay?

86
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.700
So given that lack, how are you going to compete?

87
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.160
And the answer is you're not because low IQ is a good predictor of

88
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:21.850
poverty. Now they spiral because, you know, if you're, if you,

89
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.330
if you're cognitively, if you're on, if you're,

90
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.890
if you're less cognitively gifted, then, and you have children,

91
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.470
they're going to be in a less enriched environment, these things spiral,

92
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:34.540
but you still have the essential problem.

93
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.730
That's the essential problem of the dispossessed.

94
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:41.230
It's like hierarchies are complex tools to attain necessary goals,

95
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.670
but they dispossess people.

96
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.080
What do we do with the people that they dispossess the answer is we don't know.

97
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.100
So we have to talk about it constantly to figure out how to solve it,

98
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.200
because it's an ongoing problem that transforms.

99
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.480
And that's the reason that political dialogue is necessary.

100
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.760
And then the danger is,

101
00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:00.020
is that the political dialogue will polarize into the radical left,

102
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.150
no hierarchies whatsoever, or the radical, right? Our hierarchy is 100% right.

103
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:09.470
At all costs. And so those are the, we have the eternal problem.

104
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.840
And those are the two poles that we have to negotiate between.

105
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.910
<v 1>It's interesting because the accusation has always been that what the left is</v>

106
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:21.140
trying to do with this equality of outcome thing is sort of an infantile

107
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.200
[inaudible] of the populace, right?

108
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.250
And the best example of that is sports. Um,

109
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.910
when you look at sports, clearly the best people win, right?

110
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.710
The fastest runners win the race, the people that have the best strategy.

111
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:40.310
When the game, the infant, infant, that's a weird word.

112
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:42.560
Infantiles lization I never get it right.

113
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:45.710
But of that is what we do with children,

114
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.430
where you get participation trophies. And no one wins. You know,

115
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:50.990
when my daughter was three years old,

116
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:55.220
she was in soccer and they didn't keep score, but everyone knew,

117
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.220
everyone knew these kids scored and they didn't at the end of the game,

118
00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.690
they didn't announce a winner. There was no.

119
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.150
<v 0>You can't have a soccer game without keeping score.</v>

120
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.780
It's not a soccer game anymore. It's something else. But the score was.

121
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.470
<v 1>Of course it just wasn't discussed. Of course it was the strangest thing.</v>

122
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.310
But this is to treat these little kids cause they couldn't handle it.

123
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.100
She cried when the other team scored. I'm like, that's,

124
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.200
it feels bad when they score. So it feels good when you score.

125
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.130
It's very difficult to say that to a three-year-old.

126
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.980
So she going to run Hills, is she going to practice,

127
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.380
drill so that she feels that good feeling more.

128
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.780
And then there's a point where that becomes too far.

129
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.380
There's a point where you become an obsessive over winner, right?

130
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:38.150
And this is the people that want to crush their enemies.

131
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:41.690
Then you become Conan the barbarian. This is, this is the far end of it.

132
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.660
And this is what the left is terrified of. Right? Yep.

133
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.550
The idea of the left is the demure, the soft, the, the, the, the,

134
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:53.780
the people that are kinder and gentler. The idea of the right is the conqueror.

135
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.610
The people that, you know, they're work hard, play hard, go kick, go America,

136
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:02.150
that kind of. And so these are the type of people that are going to be crueler.

137
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.980
They're going to do what it takes to win.

138
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.170
And the people that you would consider that would like equality of

139
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.860
outcome are the people that are trying to slow that down. Does this make sense?

140
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.310
<v 0>Yes, absolutely. And I think that's how it lays itself out temperamentally,</v>

141
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.690
psychologically.

142
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.000
<v 1>This is the motivation for all this. Yes, yes.</v>

143
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.110
<v 0>Yes. And it's well, and the radical left is, is compassion gone mad,</v>

144
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.070
although it's also envy. Let's not forget about that because, well, absolutely.

145
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.390
It means one reason to stand up for the dispossessed is because you're

146
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.870
empathetic and empathy is not an automatic good.

147
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:38.360
This is something we make a big mistake about. We think, well,

148
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.230
I am feeling sorry for you. Therefore, I'm good. It's like, no,

149
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:45.980
I might be feeling too, sorry for you. I might not be demanding enough of you.

150
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.800
So, and that's the terrible devouring mother, you know,

151
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:52.790
from a psychoanalytic perspective, everything you do, dear is okay. It's like,

152
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:57.030
no, it's not. Oh, so, so one of the things that John Piaget,

153
00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:58.330
the developmental psychologist,

154
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.480
he was very interested in figuring out a way out of this.

155
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.360
And it's very much relevant to your concept. You're you're talking about,

156
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.270
about athletics. Okay. So, so imagine this,

157
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.200
because this is also something that points the way to a proper morality,

158
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.810
which was actually something that John Piaget was very concerned about.

159
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:13.590
He wanted to,

160
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.740
he wanted to reconcile the distinction between religion and science.

161
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.990
That's actually what drove him, even though he was,

162
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.440
people don't know that he was arguably the world's greatest developmental

163
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.620
psychologist. So, so here's the idea, you know,

164
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:29.280
how you tell your kid to be a good sport? You say, don't,

165
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.710
it doesn't matter whether you win and lose, it matters how you play the game.

166
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.280
Okay. So I've been unpacking that in my lectures because it's really,

167
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:36.150
really complicated.

168
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.680
It's like you tell your kid that and they look at you and they think, well,

169
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:44.400
what do you mean by that? Aren't I supposed to try to win. It's a soccer game.

170
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.950
I'm trying to, I'm supposed to win. And you say, well, yeah,

171
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:49.530
you're supposed to win, but it doesn't matter whether you win or lose.

172
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:52.080
It matters how you play the game. You know that that's right.

173
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:54.900
But you don't know how to explain it to your kid. You say, well,

174
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.230
you want to be a good sport. Okay. So imagine this, this is how it works.

175
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:02.100
And this is crucially important. So first of all,

176
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.830
life is not a game.

177
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.900
Even a game is not a game because a game is most of the time,

178
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.690
a game is the beginning of a series of games.

179
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.920
So let's say that you're on a soccer team while there's a winning the game.

180
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.550
But the game isn't the issue. The game is the whole series of games.

181
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:24.000
So maybe the game is winning the championship and winning the championship and

182
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:27.930
winning ad game are not the same thing. And the reason for that is, well,

183
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.700
maybe if you want to win a game,

184
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:32.400
the best thing to do is to let your star player make all the moves.

185
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.530
But if you want to win a championship,

186
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.980
maybe the best thing is for your star player to do everything he or she possibly

187
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:41.520
can to develop all the other team members. That's a different strategy.

188
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.750
And the reason it's different is because it iterates across time. Okay. So I'll,

189
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:48.120
I'll tell you a quick story. So when my kid was playing hockey,

190
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.880
when he was about 12 or so, he was in the championship game,

191
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.350
just at a local arena, you know, and it was really fun to watch.

192
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.970
The teams were pretty equal,

193
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:01.890
which is something that you want so that everybody can expand their skills while

194
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:05.880
they're playing. And it was like five seconds to, to the end of the game.

195
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:09.090
And the other team made a breakaway and came down and the guy came down the ice

196
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:11.250
and scored. It was beautiful goal. And it was four, three.

197
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.470
And that was the end of it. Right? And all my kids team,

198
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:15.990
there is the kid who was the star and he was a pretty good hockey player.

199
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.550
He came off the ice and he was very annoyed about what had happened.

200
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.690
He smashed his stick on the cement and was complaining about the refereeing and

201
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.620
acting as if he'd been robbed and his father came up and instead of saying,

202
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.520
get your act together, kid, that's no way to display yourself after a loss.

203
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.390
He said, oh yeah, man, you were robbed that the referees didn't ref, right? And,

204
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.730
and you played the best and you should have wat.

205
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.130
And I thought you absolute son of a.

206
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.570
You're ruining your son. And then the question is why?

207
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.990
Because his son was the star and was trying to win. Why was he ruining his son?

208
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.620
Well, you're trying to train your son, not to win the game.

209
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.310
You're trying to train your son to win the championship.

210
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.390
And so that's a series of games, but then life isn't, the championship.

211
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.620
Life is a whole bunch of championships. It's a whole sequence of them.

212
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.090
And so what you're actually trying to train your son to do is to be a contender

213
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:11.380
in the entire series.

214
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.400
And the way you do that is by helping him develop his character.

215
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.930
And the character is actually the strategy that would enable him to win the

216
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:23.680
largest number of games across the largest possible span of time.

217
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.170
And one way you do that, if you're a kid is like, well,

218
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:29.290
what do you want to do with your kid? You don't want to teach him to win.

219
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.640
You want to teach him to play well with others and that's to be reciprocal.

220
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:37.140
So that means to try to win, but also to pay attention, to, to,

221
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.410
to developing the other people around him and not to put winning the game,

222
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:45.070
above everything at all times. So then he's fun to play with,

223
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.620
and this is absolutely crucial. You get, you can,

224
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.430
you can help your kid become fun to play with between the ages of two and the

225
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:55.420
age of four. If your kid is fun to play with, then what happens?

226
00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.100
Kids line up to play with them and adults line up to teach him.

227
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.410
And if kids line up to play with him,

228
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.710
then I have friends his whole life and he'll be socialized and he'd be invited

229
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:07.450
to many games. Some of which he'll win.

230
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.520
All of which he'll be able to participate in.

231
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.030
And if he's fun to play with and adults will teach him things and then he wins

232
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.520
that life. And so when you say to your kid,

233
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:18.400
it doesn't matter whether you win or lose matters, how you play the game.

234
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:20.680
What you're saying is don't forget kid,

235
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.440
that what you're trying to do here is to do well at life.

236
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.640
And you need to practice the strategies that enable you to do well at life.

237
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.200
Well you're in any specific game and you never want to compromise your ability

238
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:35.050
to do well at life for the sake of winning a single game.

239
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:40.300
And there's a deep ethic in that. And it's the ethic of reciprocity in games.

240
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.070
Part of the reason that we're so obsessed with sports is because we like to see

241
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.060
that dramatized, you know, like the person we really admire as an athlete,

242
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:52.810
isn't only the person who wins. We don't like the narcissistic winners,

243
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:55.420
they're winners. And that's a plus. But if they're narcissistic,

244
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.410
they're not good team players, they're only out for themselves. Then we think,

245
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:03.190
well, you're a winner in the narrow sense, but your character is suspect.

246
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.530
You're no role model, even though you're a winner.

247
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.310
And it's because we're looking for something deeper, we're looking for that.

248
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.600
The manifestation of character that allows you to win across the set of possible

249
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:18.160
games. And that's a real thing. That's a real ethic. It's a fundamental ethic.

250
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.950
<v 1>I think what you're pointing out, that's very important is we're,</v>

251
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:22.810
we're searching for the person.

252
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:26.470
Who's got it all nailed someone who tries their hardest,

253
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:30.640
but is also honest enough about the

254
00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:34.750
circumstances to not cry foul when it's gone.

255
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:35.980
The other person's way.
