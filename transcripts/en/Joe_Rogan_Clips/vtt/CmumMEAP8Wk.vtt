1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I was 13, 14. I lived through that.</v>

2
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.920
I'd see her in the window with pants on.

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.810
She looked delicious and finally, summer of 79,

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.330
I'm getting all up with some friends of mine and I've been drinking nips that we

5
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.960
snorted some angel dust. And we'll listen to led Zepplin too.

6
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.710
If you're going to like buddy led Zepplin too, is the album to get you away.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.250
That starts off with a whole lot of love that just gets your hips moving.

8
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.580
And then it goes into the lemon song and he's talking about squeeze me,

9
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.150
baby to the juice runs down my leg. I'm like, that's it?

10
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:40.020
That juice is running down my leg. My mother was a flower check.

11
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.740
She had flowers everywhere. I put on like a shirt. I swear to God,

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.990
it had to be about 10 cause she would walk the dog at night,

13
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:48.330
but the husband was 15.

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.560
The dog would sleep that the husband would pass out by eight.

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.350
So she would take the dogs out for the 10 o'clock,

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.990
the last she would put them down and you know,

17
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:02.790
they were kind of blind French poodles and she would still wear the tidy

18
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:03.840
whities. You know,

19
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.820
the defense Dixie deuce Daisy in the seventies

20
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:13.440
before Daisy was invented. She already had the Daisy on with the shirt.

21
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.770
And I remember being on that angel does hide in the weeds,

22
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.000
like with the flowers I had flowers for.

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.550
I was going to bring a flowers,

24
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.450
but my plan was to attack her like this jumper in the thing,

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.700
throw it down and get with the flowers.

26
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.240
This is how crazy I'm going to attack her. Like I couldn't take it no more.

27
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.280
Like I wanted to marry her. Like that's how up I was on angel dust.

28
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.860
And I was on angel. This, it was what I would teach. See crystal,

29
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:45.000
call it what you want. It's animal tranquilizer, no matter how you look at it.

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.340
And I remember that I ran up on her and she turned and she goes, Coco,

31
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:54.030
what's going on? I go and I just stopped when I go fight. I'm in love with you.

32
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.350
And she's like, what are you talking about?

33
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.430
I'm like fab in love with you for two years. I want to run off with you.

34
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.540
my mother. I'm like, I just let's get a job. Let's let's leave.

35
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.430
And she's looking at me like why? Like I was retarded first,

36
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.180
all she's looking at me like this kid is snap. And she goes,

37
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.480
you've been drinking. I'm like, I still love you to take the flowers.

38
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.880
And she goes, I tell you what if I divorced my husband I'll consider it.

39
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.180
And I was like, okay, I gotta live with that. Can I give you a kiss?

40
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.190
I like kissed her on the cheek and I could feel the heat going up my head.

41
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.650
And finally, as I went to turn away, I looked at her legs.

42
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.700
You had the juicy has legs in the world. I go, can I touch your thigh?

43
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.670
And she goes, go ahead, Joe Rogan.

44
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:43.560
I touched her kneecap and my Dick just exploded sperm.

45
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.980
I ran away like Steven, Steven Seagal.

46
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.390
He runs like a retard with that little limp. It was the Steven Seagal run.

47
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.070
<v 1>There's actually a town named after the last guy who died, Lovette, California.</v>

48
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.620
The last guy who got killed by a grizzly bear just out, out.

49
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.700
<v 2>Hunting. Was it almost.</v>

50
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.950
<v 1>Probably being a dude that was alive back then?</v>

51
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.433
<v 2>Terrifying.</v>

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.380
<v 1>You experienced this in China. You're you're what, uh,</v>

53
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.050
what are your precautions? Are you allowed to bring bear spray?

54
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.440
<v 2>So we had an air horn. We had a whistle,</v>

55
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.920
a whistle. Yeah. So they say that the boat,

56
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.760
the biggest attacks happened from where Tibetans out farming,

57
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.710
doing their business in the mountains. They,

58
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.900
they they're in the forest and they surprise.

59
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.790
They come up at the top of the hill. There's a bear there.

60
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.240
And obviously the bears shocked. It's scared. And it just attacks.

61
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.670
<v 1>And that does happen with bears in America.</v>

62
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.820
<v 2>Say, yeah. So they would say I'm pretty much take a whistle, taken our horn,</v>

63
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.210
make yourself aware while we make the bear aware that you're,

64
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.850
that you're present, you're approaching. Uh, normally they would be,

65
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.690
they would scare off they'd run away, but there was a local that told me that.

66
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.720
So they have these big to better masters. Have you seen the two better masters?

67
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.190
Like the dogs that God,

68
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.270
the two tonight's terrifying more of a problem than that.

69
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.260
The wolves they were for me. Um, cause they can scare away.

70
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:01.600
The wolves scare with snow leopards, the bears.

71
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.140
But this one local was telling me that he wasn't living in his garage,

72
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.240
which is like a white felt tent like a year.

73
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.470
He was living in a concrete hut and he had a courtyard with a fence.

74
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.110
The fence was open, but just outside the fence it's to better,

75
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.010
must've chained up.

76
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.430
And he said that this bear wasn't phased about the Tibet must.

77
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.690
If it walked straight past it into the courtyard and was scratching its steel

78
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:26.830
door whilst he was hiding in one of his empty cupboards. And it lasted about 30,

79
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:28.870
40 minutes. And he was telling me this story and I'm like

80
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.690
scratching against this steel door. I'm just in a tent in the wilderness.

81
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.300
<v 1>Man. They're monsters. If they weren't a real thing.</v>

82
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.770
If grizzly bears or brown bears, weren't real. And then they were in a movie,

83
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:46.750
you'd be like what? The poor guy. And imagine you, you like you,

84
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.220
someone would ask someone like you, like why in the world, if you know, there,

85
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:55.810
there would you going to want to walk for that long bear

86
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:56.644
country?

87
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.580
<v 3>Where's your heart? And my heart is a,</v>

88
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.260
I get to,

89
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.640
I get to be black for a summer in my mind.

90
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.920
So there's something in it for me.

91
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.740
The other thing is I get to hold up to nature,

92
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.260
the insane self-involved hypocrisy of artists

93
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.880
and what they think they're allowed to do on occasion. Just my opinion.

94
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.920
And also Ben, who is a masterful artist and director,

95
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:33.940
probably the closest thing to a Charlie Chaplin that I've experienced in my

96
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:38.440
lifetime. He writes, he directs, he acts, he, if you had seen him,

97
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:40.540
when he was directing this movie, you would have been like,

98
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.400
I'm watching David lean. I'm watching chaplain, I'm watching Coppola. He,

99
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.540
he knew exactly what the vision for this was. He executed it.

100
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.220
It was impossible to not have it be an offensive nightmare of a movie.

101
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.240
And 90% of my black friends are like, dude, that was great.

102
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.230
<v 1>What about the other 10%?</v>

103
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.910
<v 3>Um, you know, I can't disagree with them,</v>

104
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.430
but I know where my heart was. Yeah.

105
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.410
And I think that it's never an excuse to do something that is out

106
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:19.370
of place and not of its time. But to me it was just putting a,

107
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.390
it was a blasting cap on and by the way,

108
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.210
I think white chicks came out pretty soon after that. And I was like,

109
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.020
I love that. I was like, that was great. Yeah.

110
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.920
<v 1>Yeah. Well it might be the last time we see that,</v>

111
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.270
unless things change, it seems like no one can really,

112
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.340
I don't think you could do blackface anymore. I mean,

113
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.180
we almost lost the prime minister of Canada because he did brown face.

114
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.060
He pretended to be Saudi Arabian. Right.

115
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.400
He did Arabian nights in high school or something like that.

116
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.530
<v 3>It's a,</v>

117
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.980
it's an interesting and necessary meditation on

118
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:59.570
where is the pendulum? Why is the pendulum, right?

119
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.090
Yeah. Where's the pendulum, uh,

120
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.770
maybe cutting a little into what could be perceived

121
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:11.480
as, as heart in the right place, openness of its time.

122
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:13.580
But again, I mean, you know,

123
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.010
there's a morality clause here on this planet and it's a big price to

124
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:23.720
pay. And I think having a moral psychology is, uh, is job one.

125
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.140
So sometimes you just gotta go. Yeah. You know,

126
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.430
I AFT up again, not in my defense,

127
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:35.990
but Tropic thunder was about how

128
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.800
wrong that is. Yes. So

129
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.710
I take exception.

130
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.150
<v 4>Was heard the media and the DNC got together and they were like, Hey,</v>

131
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.330
let's do this. Cause it was coordinated. This didn't come out of nowhere. Right.

132
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.370
And the CNN to see that story,

133
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.880
CNN wrote these two people who heard it from these other two people who were not

134
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:59.810
even going to name and that's on CNN, that's CNN. That's how they do it.

135
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.153
It's so crazy.

136
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.380
<v 1>Digging their own grave though. What they're,</v>

137
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.530
what they're doing is they're making themselves less and less relevant.

138
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:10.160
And they're making guys like you and independent people more and more relevant

139
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:11.120
and more and more trustworthy.

140
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.520
<v 4>And that's why they keep going to the catnip of,</v>

141
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.230
of Russia gate or Trump's tweets or whatever impeachment and this phone call to

142
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.780
the thing. And eh, you know, look how they look,

143
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:24.020
how the media runs interference for the establishment. It's amazing. Like,

144
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.980
you know, to pretend that the Bidens aren't corrupt, I know.

145
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.470
And to have people come out and go, that's a lie.

146
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.270
That's no corruption it's been looked into.

147
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.290
There's no corruption that a guy has an $83,000 job on a board in a country.

148
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.960
His dad just helped overthrow. What do you do?

149
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.470
<v 1>Crazy. It seems like it might be a little corrupt. Well,</v>

150
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.210
the conversation where he tells the prosecutor that if, if he's not gone,

151
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.210
you don't get the billion dollars. Right. What do you know? They fired the guy,

152
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.403
right? Like if you saw that.

153
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.000
<v 4>So yeah, I've saw that video in there,</v>

154
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.280
but their defense to that is they're saying, but that was corrupt.

155
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:59.550
And the next guy was even more tougher of an investigator,

156
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.400
but that guy was investigating Barisma at the time.

157
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.070
And that guy did say later that guy who got fired,

158
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:07.080
said I got fired because I was investigating Barisma.

159
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.820
He said that in a court document. So, uh, believe me they're all right.

160
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.150
And why didn't they, why didn't they impeach Trump on the monuments clause?

161
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.890
Why didn't they do that? Why did they do it on this?

162
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.000
So that's him benefiting office position in government it's because they all do

163
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:25.590
it. Why do you think? Because it would bring up everything.

164
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.290
It would have to, Hey, Hillary Clinton. I mean,

165
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:32.100
Chelsea Clinton just got a $9 million job for, she deserves it. Oh my God.

166
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:35.550
She did. She does the best. Uh, so, uh,

167
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.490
and people are saying that people are saying what's wrong with the woman using

168
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.810
her degree. She has three degrees.

169
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.420
I wonder how she was at four able to afford those three degrees.

170
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:47.250
I wonder she overcame all those obstacles. Did she, did you know what I mean?

171
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.720
So if they're all corrupt that that's, that's, that's the story.

172
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.460
And that's why we have Donald Trump.

173
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.230
<v 1>Clinging to this system. That's.</v>

174
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.950
<v 4>Why we don't have a functioning medical system or a functioning banking system</v>

175
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.590
because Barack Obama was paid off by the bay,

176
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.620
by the health insurance companies and the wall street banks.

177
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:07.410
And that's not me saying that that's Dylan Ratigan award-winning Bloomberg

178
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.670
reporter says that.

179
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.760
<v 1>How'd they pay him off? Uh.</v>

180
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.920
<v 4>Well, he has a, I dunno if you notice,</v>

181
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:17.510
he just bought a house at Martha's vineyard, from the guy who owns the Celtics.

182
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.020
He sells his 40 has 49 acres. It's got a lot of money, 49.

183
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.520
That's more acres than Kevin Hart. Wow. That's a lot of acres.

184
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.560
So there's a lot of acres. Yeah. That's that's the guy,

185
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.490
who's a community organizer. I guess it was a gated community where.

186
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.130
<v 5>I don't know red skeleton. I mean,</v>

187
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:41.280
there's some people I thought were never bill Cosby, I must say.

188
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.630
So it was on that list really? Oh yeah. He never thought he was funny.

189
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.900
Never thought he was funny.

190
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.220
<v 1>Even when he was doing bill Cosby himself, like back at the album days.</v>

191
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.450
<v 5>And I may have missed some stuff he did, but everything I ever heard,</v>

192
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.190
even when I was a kid and I saw him on TV, I'm like, no, this is corny. I know.

193
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.410
I feel very, very, uh, ahead of my time. I never liked him.

194
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.510
I did.

195
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.540
<v 1>Well. It was one of those things where if you had said any of this,</v>

196
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.140
that you're saying 10 years ago, people would have been furious at you.

197
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.660
Well, now these.

198
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.460
<v 5>Like somebody told me he was a creep back in 1983.</v>

199
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.370
<v 1>And someone told me in 94. Yeah.</v>

200
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.170
<v 5>So I, and it was somebody I liked not somebody I was romantically involved with,</v>

201
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.830
but a girl who he was horrible too. And, uh,

202
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:34.050
I never liked him after that as a person.

203
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.950
<v 1>That makes sense.</v>

204
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.540
I had heard from people on the set of news radio that he drugged girls,

205
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.870
it was like one of those weird things that you heard as a room,

206
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:47.580
like why does he do drugs? Girls like bill Cosby, people cosmic.

207
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.090
We're talking about the same guy. It's not like Steve McQueen's team McQueen.

208
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.620
We'll get them confused. Right? No. I.

209
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.080
<v 5>Mean his dad America.</v>

210
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.000
And you have to wonder why a guy who could, uh, get laid,

211
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.720
uh, even as a married man. Um,

212
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.170
that's obviously a sick head,

213
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.040
but I also know a guy who was a promoter and,

214
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.960
and told incredibly ridiculous stories

215
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:19.630
about things that bill Cosby did that were not sexual,

216
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.760
but just informed me that what his kink is,

217
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.770
is part of a much larger sickness about control and making people

218
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:33.010
do weird things because he can.

219
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.320
<v 1>Let me tell you what I heard. And you tell me what you heard.</v>

220
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.720
I heard he makes people watch him eat Curry.

221
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.810
He would make the whole staff come into his dressing room and we'll watch them

222
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.653
eat.

223
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.210
<v 5>I hadn't heard that exactly.</v>

224
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:46.750
But it's exactly in line with what I heard that he would, uh,

225
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.260
do things like make you, um,

226
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.420
what was one of them like he would order food and then he would say, you know,

227
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.150
scoop out the, uh,

228
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.480
the doughy part of the hamburger bun after you wash your hands and put

229
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:05.950
it back on the hamburger.

230
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.620
Or once he asked them to send him the

231
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.990
soap that he hadn't finished using in the dressing room,

232
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.550
like collect it, send it to, you know, just like crazy,

233
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.043
crazy.

234
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.530
<v 1>They like it they're like something different or they're tired of these people</v>

235
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:29.830
that sound like politicians, you know, you hear, you know, pick a person,

236
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.701
Elizabeth Warren,

237
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:34.390
you hear them talk and you feel the coming out of their mouth while they're

238
00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:38.230
talking, you know that they're playing a role, you know, with Trump,

239
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.090
he might be arrogant. He might be crazy. He might be ridiculous, but that's him.

240
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.420
That's that guy. I bet if you're around him all day long, he's like that.

241
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.150
I mean, that's th that's the thing that Pete,

242
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.770
one of the things that people like about him,

243
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.130
he's like that all the time that that's who he is. Yeah. Like he's not,

244
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.860
he doesn't need to. He's Donald Trump.

245
00:13:56.861 --> 00:14:01.000
He's a multi-billionaire who is now the president of the United States.

246
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.840
So it's like, he doesn't feel the need to put on an act for anybody.

247
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:08.290
So when he comes out and says he died like a dog like that,

248
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.730
that's how he would talk.

249
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.850
<v 6>Yeah. Yeah. No, I think the consistency, I think you're right there is,</v>

250
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.330
there's an element of, look, I'm tired. I am tired of the. I mean,

251
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:16.991
I see what you're saying,

252
00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:21.640
but I guess what I think then is what are the chances that you get to 28? Well,

253
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.920
we're in 2020, look at that. Um,

254
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.890
but we get down in November to the election and people are just exhausted by it.

255
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.710
Right? So they wanted something different. Now they've had it.

256
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.040
Are they going to get to this point in November and get ready to vote and think

257
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.890
I can't take another four years of it. Even though it's entertaining,

258
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.023
I'm exhausted.

259
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.700
<v 1>People don't like change. They get scared of change.</v>

260
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.420
And if things are going well economically. And if, you know, if,

261
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:47.290
if it turns out that this thing with Iran doesn't turn into anything disastrous,

262
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:50.320
by the time November rolls around, I think he's going to win in a landslide.

263
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.670
I really don't see unless Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard get

264
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:58.970
together. And then everybody goes, you know what? That would work. Like,

265
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:01.580
this is a, this is a real combination of people that I could,

266
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.533
I could get behind,

267
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.930
unless it's something like that where there's like some overwhelming candidate,

268
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.770
but I don't see that I D then they seem to be pushing for Elizabeth Warren.

269
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.940
I don't see that she was a Republican most of her career.

270
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.570
And then she became a Democrat, like when she was in her late forties.

271
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.690
<v 6>I find maybe it's just me, but, but you know,</v>

272
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.640
I don't see a consistent policy message there. I don't see, um,

273
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.530
I don't see that happening for, uh, for, for her this go around. Maybe,

274
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.930
maybe it'll change. Maybe you need, I don't know. But yeah.

275
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.320
<v 1>Problem is, I feel like these people just want to be president.</v>

276
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.250
I feel like it's a self aggrandizement thing. They just want to be president.

277
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.880
<v 6>Argue with that about anybody in politics. So you could, you could say that,</v>

278
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.890
I mean, you, you know, you've met that person, right.

279
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.040
Who's in politics now who started out by being ahead of the Republican or

280
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.580
democratic club in high school. Right. That's all they want to do.

281
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.570
Then they're a state Senator. And then, then they say, oh,

282
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:56.060
am I going to run for Congress? And he's like, what the, what the? I mean,

283
00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.040
it's gotta be something, you know, the wiring's off a little bit.

284
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.470
<v 1>That's the problem, right?</v>
