00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.290
So what year was your incident and your, you have a very,

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.740
very famous incident. That's, corrob corroborated by actual evidence,

4
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.330
which is one of the rare ones. What year was it? And where did it take place?

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.700
<v 1>So it was 2004, November 14th. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.990
the it's really, if you draw San Diego to Ensonata Mexico,

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.620
we're about 60 miles off the coast in between the two we're doing workups.

8
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:31.850
So when we get ready to deploy, this was for the 2005 deployment.

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.410
We were going at sea for November and December of 2004. So we'd been out,

10
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.980
I had just taken over the squadron mid-October so I'd been the CEO for a month.

11
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.030
So we go out to, and we're putting the battlegroup pieces together.

12
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.820
So it's not just the, the Airwing, but we're, you know, we're,

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.070
we're on the carrier. We've got the cruiser,

14
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.960
we've got all support ships out there,

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.080
and we're going to integrate all the defenses and train as one unit.

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.390
So the exercise that we're going to do is an air defense exercise where there's

17
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.850
good guys, bad guys are all from internal, from the air wing.

18
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.680
So the bad guys today are going to be the Marines, uh, VMA 2 32, the red devils.

19
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.001
So they're going to launch,

20
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.830
they're going to go about a hundred miles south of the ship,

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.050
and we're the good guys. And it's we call it a two V two.

22
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.760
So it's two of us against two of them.

23
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.130
And we're going to work with the USS Princeton,

24
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:17.450
which is going to be the controller,

25
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.820
and they're going to control the blue forces.

26
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.000
And then the red guys are going to give us a presentation that, you know,

27
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.520
they're going to try and intercept so we can stop them from getting up towards

28
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.740
the carrier. So that's kind of the training set that we're all good.

29
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.400
So the Marines take off first and they start heading to the south.

30
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:35.540
Now we have no idea that for two weeks, this, the two weeks we've been at sea,

31
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.700
they've been tracking these things coming out of the sky.

32
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.620
And when I talked to the prince controller,

33
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:41.090
he's like up to about a dozen of them.

34
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.340
They would come down from above 80,000 feet.

35
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.010
They dropped down to about 20,000 feet.

36
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.540
They'd hang out and then they'd go straight,

37
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:49.130
back up after about three or four hours. Now,

38
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.090
when you say they been tracking them, who specifically, this is the USS,

39
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.450
the Princeton is tracking them.

40
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.320
They saw them on the Nimitz radar and the [inaudible] could see them. Um,

41
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.370
so cause they're out there, you know, that radar's on all the time in the spy.

42
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.670
One system on an Aegis cruiser is, you know, the state, I was probably the most,

43
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.380
one of the most sophisticated systems at all.

44
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.970
<v 0>So typically when something like this happens and there is some unexplained</v>

45
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:13.010
phenomenon, what do they do?

46
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.760
<v 1>Uh, in this case, you know, if it was, if we were in a threat environment,</v>

47
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.980
they would tell us, but we were off the coast of San Diego,

48
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:20.210
it's it doesn't come to the air wing.

49
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.550
So we have no idea that these things are out there at all.

50
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.140
<v 0>So they observe these things and they never bothered telling any you guys that's</v>

51
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:31.490
correct. So they just knew that these things had been visiting this area,

52
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.300
but they just allowed this training exercise to take place. Anyway. Yeah.

53
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.630
<v 1>I was talking to him the previous for the two weeks they would show up,</v>

54
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.380
but it was when we weren't flying. So the typical carrier schedule is, you know,

55
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:45.290
for us, it was about noon to midnight. It's a 12 hour day.

56
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.620
There's reasons for that. You can go a lot longer. They can, but for training,

57
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:51.590
we just do the 12 hour day thing and it's cyclic op.

58
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.810
So you got guys taking off and landing periodically.

59
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.890
So we were on one of the first goes, you know, it's, you know, noon,

60
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:01.090
one o'clock somewhere around and we take off the Marines take off first.

61
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.240
And my buddy cheeks, who's a CEO of the Marine squadron was one.

62
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.480
He was leading the red air they had, when he launched off the carrier, first,

63
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.550
they called him up and said, Hey, what do you got on board? Well, the,

64
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.451
the small,

65
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.540
the original legacy F eighteens don't have as much gas as the super Hornet.

66
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.070
Suporn's about 30% bigger.

67
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.580
So they start talking to them about fuel and based on how long we're going to be

68
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.050
airborne and everything else, they go, Hey,

69
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.510
why don't you just go ahead and proceed here, your cap point.

70
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.560
Cause we had just taken off and that's when the controller had come up and said,

71
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.280
Hey, I forget our cost since pride like dealers, usually what we went.

72
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.720
So that'd be like dealer one, one, uh, this is a prince and control.

73
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.530
What are you gonna, you know, say your load out. I kind of chuckled. He said,

74
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.100
I said, well, I got a cat M nine, which is, uh, it's uh, basically a,

75
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.700
just a blue metal tube with a seeker head for an a nine iron missile.

76
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.290
It's a training. It doesn't come off the airplane.

77
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.490
You can beat it with a sledgehammer.

78
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.540
That's the only way you're gonna get it off.

79
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.710
Or you gotta unlock the lugs with a key. So I'm like kinda chuckling. He goes,

80
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.790
well, Hey, we're going to cancel the training. So we're like, okay. He says,

81
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.670
we got real-world vector and they're going to send us out to the west.

82
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:04.780
So picture, if it's a, you know, if you got a clock,

83
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:08.020
the Nimitz is in the middle. Uh, we're a little bit south of that,

84
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:08.980
about 40 miles south.

85
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.110
And then the Marines are about a hundred miles south of the ship,

86
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.420
about 60 miles between the two of us.

87
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.470
So as this has all happened in my wingman is joining up and right,

88
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:21.160
and these are 18. So there's two people in each jet. So it's me and my Wizo,

89
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.690
which is weapons systems operator.

90
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.960
And I've got the other pilot and the weapon systems operator now, other jet.

91
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.320
So they tell us all this, Hey, we're going to real-world vector.

92
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.050
And they'd send us out to 700, about 60 miles away from where we're going.

93
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:34.090
So now we're going out even further out to sea.

94
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.520
We have no idea what we're in Herceptin.

95
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:39.250
And this is when the controller starts talking to us. He says, Hey, sir,

96
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.480
we've seen these objects. They've been for two weeks.

97
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:45.640
They've been coming down and he's given us the whole story. He says,

98
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.280
we need you to go investigate. We want to know what these are.

99
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.490
<v 0>But they're asking you to investigate in a jet. That's unarmed.</v>

100
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.240
<v 1>That's correct. Okay. Yeah, we have no, and there's reasons for that,</v>

101
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.260
that we don't fly.

102
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.140
We typically don't fly with live ordinance unless we're actually going into like

103
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:02.500
a combat zone or run a training range and we're going to shoot something.

104
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.560
And the reason is you can go through history of the Navy or air force.

105
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.660
If you put live missiles on airplanes,

106
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:10.030
and then you start doing training where you're squeezing the trigger.

107
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:12.850
Someone always messes. The switch algae up in, someone gets shot down.

108
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.080
It's happened multiple times. So we don't do it. You know,

109
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:20.790
there's times that we do, but it's rare. So we start flying out to the west.

110
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.470
Now I want you to think, cause the other pilot has a, you know,

111
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:25.990
when you talk to it's good, it's out there. It was a female.

112
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.300
When you talk to her, it's a,

113
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.410
she here's the kind of goes through the mindset of, Hey,

114
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:35.170
we're off the coast of Mexico. Real-world vector.

115
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.820
We have no idea what we're going to look at.

116
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.540
Probably drug runner because you get the drug runners coming up the coast.

117
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.740
So we're like, okay. So we drive out in the they're calling down ranges.

118
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:49.660
So they're telling us, Hey, it's 2 7, 0 at 30 miles at 20,000 feet. And it's,

119
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.961
you know,

120
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:52.270
and then you just count down the range and we're talking back and forth the

121
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:56.980
whole time. So they got to a point where they say, Hey, merge plot,

122
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.110
which means radars have resolution cells, you know,

123
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.780
range and as myth of what the radar can actually see,

124
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.460
once you're inside that box,

125
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.140
you can't tell the difference between me and the object I'm going at.

126
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.800
We're just become one big blob. So they call a merge plot.

127
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.120
And so the other jet is on my left-hand side. Um, and we're going to,

128
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.920
and I'm going to go to a clock code to make it simple.

129
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.700
So the object we're gonna end up looking for is right in the middle of the

130
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:23.534
clock.

131
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.290
And we are at the six o'clock position and my wingman is off to my left side.

132
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:32.210
So it's, she's further down with her wisdom. So as we're looking around, we,

133
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.290
we look to the right and there's a, it was yesterday.

134
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:40.640
It was a perfect example out here. The water is perfectly calm, no white caps.

135
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:43.460
I mean, it's literally a perfect San Diego, California day.

136
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.780
And we see whitewater something like if you see a sea Mount, you know,

137
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:48.471
rock underwater,

138
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.450
when you're standing on the shore and the waves are breaking over it.

139
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.290
And you're like, what is that?

140
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.680
It's usually because there's a rock under the water. So it looks like that.

141
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:56.660
But it's about the size of a 7 37.

142
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.620
It actually kind of has a shape of like a cross and it's pointing to the east.

143
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.600
So you've got the long part going east west.

144
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.400
And you've got a couple of things going north and south.

145
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.000
So as we're looking at it, cause that kind of draws our eyes. We're like, oh,

146
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.863
that's kinda odd.

147
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.160
We looked down and the window and the other airplane comes up and says,

148
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.400
Hey skipper, do you. And that's about what he gets out of his mouth.

149
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.830
And I'm kind of looking at the same thing I go, dude, do you see that?

150
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.150
What is that thing? And what we see is this white tic TAC looking object,

151
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.100
just above the surface of the water pointing north south. And it's going north,

152
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:31.790
south, east, west, it's just radically moving forward, back left right at will.

153
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.960
And it's moving around the disturbance, the whitewater that we see.

154
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.860
<v 2>How big is this thing.</v>

155
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.300
<v 1>Over time? It's about 40 feet long. And the way I estimate that is, I mean,</v>

156
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.710
I've got a lot of time fighting other airplanes.

157
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:46.010
So it's about that size of a Hornet fuselage. So that's what I say, 40 feet.

158
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.340
This thing's just going left. So the first thing you see when you look down,

159
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.730
you go, and this is where our eyes, it's not sensors. Right?

160
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:53.840
So we're looking down at this thing.

161
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:57.590
And first thing I think is helicopter right there at th they helicopters

162
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:59.900
typically stay below 200 feet when we're out there and they're just driving

163
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.020
around. We're pretty far away from the ship for a helicopter for one of ours.

164
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.320
So what is it? So the first thing you look for is rotor wash. You know,

165
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:08.990
if you've watched any TV show that starts kicking the water up and you can see

166
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:12.920
that it's really easy to see from the air. So we're like, huh, no rotor wash.

167
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.660
Matter of fact, don't see any rotors. Don't see any tail rotor, don't see any,

168
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.270
you know, the main rotors are like, it's kind of weird.

169
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.560
So as we're driving around,

170
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:24.560
we're looking at this thing we get to about the nine o'clock position.

171
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.300
How far away are you from this thing?

172
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.690
I'm at 20,000 feet and it's right down on the surface of the right off our right

173
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:34.010
side. So I'm probably maybe a couple miles, lateral and 20,000 feet.

174
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:35.990
And we're just watching it move around. And.

175
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.080
<v 0>So it's very small in your eyes. Um, not.</v>

176
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.681
<v 1>Overly small.</v>

177
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:42.890
I mean an airplane down that low it's 40 feet and you could see pretty well,

178
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.630
it was pretty clear. So I'm like, okay. So I said, I'm gonna go check it out.

179
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.270
That's what we're trained to do. The other pilot says, Hey,

180
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:52.760
I'm gonna stay up here. And I'm like, that's perfect.

181
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.320
So now can we get some separation? We'll get it from different views.

182
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.920
And the other airplane we'll have kind of a God's eye view,

183
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.910
everything that's going on as I go down and check this thing out.

184
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.570
So I start driving around and it's still doing its Ford back left, right?

185
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.680
It's still pointing north south. We get to about the 12 o'clock position.

186
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.740
I'm just in a nice, easy dissent, a reason. Cause I'm going to ask,

187
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.130
can you go more aggressive? You can. But when you're out over water,

188
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.390
the water looks the same at 20,000 feet. Is it does it 2000 feet. You don't,

189
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.230
you know,

190
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.440
so you can easily put yourself in a nonrecoverable position if you're not paying

191
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.710
attention and you go into the water. So I got this nice, easy to send.

192
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:28.380
I get to about 12 o'clock. And as I'm coming down, you know, I,

193
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.590
I could guess probably about, you know, 18,000 feet now,

194
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.180
a couple thousand feet below the other airplane,

195
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.640
the tic-tac just kind of rapidly goes and turns. So now it's kind of point east,

196
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.360
west and out Mears us. So it's above the surface, we're up high,

197
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:45.720
we're coming down and it starts coming up like, well,

198
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:49.500
this is getting interesting. So we kind of drive all the way around the circle.

199
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.910
I'm descending, it's coming up.

200
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.390
And I get over to about the eight o'clock position to the nine o'clock and it's

201
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:57.870
over at about the two o'clock position. Well, the quickest way, as we know,

202
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:00.370
as kids to get someone, you know, you can keep going around the circle,

203
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.170
nothing's going to happen. And you cut across the circle. Some about, I dunno,

204
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.300
probably two to 3000 feet above it.

205
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.140
And I just kinda dropped my nose aggressively and I cut across the circle and

206
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:13.650
it's coming this way. It's because I'm trying to fly to where it's going to be.

207
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.050
Cause I want to join on it. I want to see how close I can get to it. Right.

208
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.700
And as I'm pulling up,

209
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.120
it's kind of starting to cross my nose and it starts to accelerate.

210
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:25.350
And within about less than a second as I start to pull nose onto it and it

211
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:27.870
crosses right in front of me, it just goes, and it's gone.

212
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.750
So I called the other airplane. I said, Hey, you guys, you guys see that thing.

213
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.040
And they're like, sir, it's gone. We don't, we don't see it at all. So I'm like,

214
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:42.840
okay, that's kinda weird. So we, we don't see it. We're looking at same time.

215
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:46.470
I say, Hey, let's turn around and let's go back to see what was in the water.

216
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.270
You know, there's was there something there?

217
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:51.210
So he turned around we're right there. We haven't gone anywhere. It's gone.

218
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:56.340
Water's perfectly, there's no whitewater, nothing. It's just blue or like, okay.

219
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.700
So we turned back around now we're heading back out towards the east.

220
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.780
And I tell the controller. I said, well, I said, uh, you know,

221
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:07.770
I first said that I'm kind of weirded out. And I told my, my backseat or that.

222
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.340
And we start heading back and the, the controller on the Princeton,

223
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.080
he comes at me. He says, sir, you're not going to believe this.

224
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:14.730
But that thing is back at your cat point.

225
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.160
That was our original point where we were going to hold 40 miles south of the

226
00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:17.730
ship.

227
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.200
So this thing has went from wherever we were at to about 60

228
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:27.150
miles in, you know, maybe 30, 40 seconds. It's already over there.

229
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.970
And it just, and they didn't track it. It just appeared.

230
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.290
He just shows back up on their radar and they go, it's here. So we're like,

231
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:39.210
okay, so we fly back. We don't see it. We don't see it on our radar.

232
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.220
We don't see it on any of our sensors.

233
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.920
We do like two runs and we come back to the ship and land.

234
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.110
So as we're in our it's,

235
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:48.300
we call it the PR shop we're taking off our flight gear.

236
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.160
One of my crews is getting ready to go out.

237
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:53.060
And I think they were going to be on a tanker mission, but they had, uh, uh,

238
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.460
targeting pod on board.

239
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.290
So they launch off and we're telling them about this before. And I, and, uh,

240
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.400
the backseater, uh, Chad says, he's really determined.

241
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.560
He's going to find this thing. So he tells a pile, Hey,

242
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:06.394
we're going to find this thing.

243
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.110
So there's out driving around and in the back seat of a super Hornet, uh,

244
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.220
there's no stick,

245
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.640
but there's sites that controllers and there to control the sensors.

246
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.260
Cause that's what the weapon systems guys do.

247
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.350
And they can change displays really fast by just hitting a button.

248
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.480
And we'll flip from the radar to the targeting pod.

249
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.680
And the way the system actually works is when you see something on the radar and

250
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:28.630
you designated as your primary target,

251
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.110
all the other sensors will look at that point. So it's,

252
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:33.520
everything is kind of sync together.

253
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.140
So he picks up a hit on his radar and he goes to lock it up.

254
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.370
Cause I've watched all the tapes.

255
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.420
He goes to lock it up and immediately the radar can tell it gets signals back,

256
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.200
that it's being jammed. So in technically jamming is an act of war.

257
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.800
It starts jamming. The radar goes into a jam extrapolate.

258
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:54.370
A bunch of stuff happens on the scope. Well, he's smart enough to castle,

259
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.190
to his targeting pod and he takes a passive track.

260
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:59.260
And that's the video that you see of the tic-tac,

261
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.350
where it's just sitting in the middle of screen, real quiet. Um,

262
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.810
so he does that and he, and he goes through, if you watch the video,

263
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:06.070
if we had it, I'd go through it with you.

264
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:08.470
But they go through all the different modes. So he goes,

265
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:11.590
it's an IRR and an EO is TV. It's black and white TV camera.

266
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.380
<v 0>We do, we can get the video right online. Let's get the video. Jamie,</v>

267
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.890
where would you? Uh, can't show it to anybody. We can't,

268
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.860
we can't show it on YouTube, but you can see it.

269
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.690
And people will be able to go to it. You know what we'll do go to the video.

270
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.200
And we'll tell people when we're starting and we'll tell people what the title

271
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:34.380
of the video that you get to is, and they can sync it up themselves.

272
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:35.250
If they're watching it.

273
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.490
<v 3>It's publicly out, sir. Yeah. It's, it's publicly owned. It's you know,</v>

274
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:39.660
American government released it.

275
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.240
So it is actually something in the public domain.

276
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.880
<v 0>So you think we could play it on YouTube and not get pulled? Yeah,</v>

277
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.310
a hundred percent think so. Jamie is a government.

278
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.700
<v 4>That those things I would say, yes, we should be able to,</v>

279
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.550
but sometimes those things get messy. So let's take a chance.

280
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.623
Let's take a chance with this.

281
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.380
<v 1>I know if you go, if you're on a New York times article, there's a link to it.</v>

282
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.000
Had it gotten released would.

283
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
<v 0>YouTube is courageously with copyright stuff.</v>

284
00:14:03.001 --> 00:14:06.420
And we we've always been like two steps away from getting pulled off of YouTube

285
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.640
completely. It's a real disaster.

286
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.580
It's I understand from their perspective,

287
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.970
there's a lot of legal issues they have to deal with, but I have it.

288
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.220
<v 3>On a private server. I could maybe send.</v>

289
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.210
<v 0>Jamie issue. I believe though, is the actual copyright of the video itself. Oh,</v>

290
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.750
that's just,

291
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.750
it's a Pentagon released public domain and the Pentagon is going to come after

292
00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:27.540
us. I don't think so. So either.

293
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.583
<v 4>You find it,</v>

294
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.000
I want to find a good version of the video that doesn't have somebody Jeremy's.

295
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.160
<v 3>Unwatermarked version. Let me just look it up and Jeremy will get it to us.</v>

296
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.450
I have to figure out how to send it to you right here with give me a second.

297
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.190
<v 0>But do you have airdrop or could you airdrop.</v>

298
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.720
<v 3>It on? Have it pay? I got it on a page. A private page. I can send Jamie.</v>

299
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.490
<v 0>Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do you have Jamie's uh, info? Uh, no.</v>

300
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.720
Okay. I'll figure it out. You can send it to me and I'll send it to him. Okay.

301
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.610
That's pretty easy. Um, sorry to disrupt the momentum. No.

302
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.530
Um, but uh, I think it's probably important to be able to have this, uh,

303
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.200
the video itself. So you could just talk about it and, um,

304
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.510
we're about to yank it up here. Okay. Jamie wrote it down for you. There you go.

305
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.870
Just give me a second to get it up. Okay. And for people that don't know,

306
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.720
Jeremy, uh, also produced, uh,

307
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.510
Bob Lasar area 51 in flying saucers.

308
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:31.430
And he was in here when we had Bob Lazara and talk about Bob's experience

309
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.840
and Jesus,

310
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:37.040
if that wasn't a game changer for me and for a lot of other people,

311
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.670
this is a subject that it's so easy to mock you know,

312
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:44.840
this is why I think it's so important that we talk to people like you.

313
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.610
Because like I said, just your average every day, UFO,

314
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.150
crackpot, they believe everything in anything. Have you, did you,

315
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.080
had you ever had any UFO experiences before this?

316
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.740
<v 1>No. Th the irony and I, I tell this story,</v>

317
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.940
my mother-in-law she'll be listening. She, she, literally,

318
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.380
every time I would go home, she would ask me, Hey, do you see UFO GCF?

319
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.210
And I'd be like, no, I, when I first started dating my wife, she was a big,

320
00:16:10.211 --> 00:16:12.970
like national Enquirer. She had all the, the, the, you know,

321
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.030
supermarket tabloids. And I would always just feed her crap for it.

322
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.080
So this happens in, you know, and, um, I never say a word.

323
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.890
So my friends all knew it was a great story over beers. Cause they'd go, Hey,

324
00:16:23.891 --> 00:16:25.270
what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying. I go,

325
00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:27.520
I chased a UFO and they go out here I go. No seriously.

326
00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:30.280
And I tell them the story and they're like, dude, I go, yeah.

327
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.160
So I go home and, and, uh,

328
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.040
I had got asked by Lou Elizondo to do the New York times article,

329
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.740
which as like anything else, I always say no.

330
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.280
Like it took a bunch of times to get me on your show. Jeremy kept asking,

331
00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:44.980
asking, asking, and it was, thank you, Jeremy. He was like,

332
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.730
you gotta think my contractor's wife angel, who we were at a party drinking.

333
00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:50.320
And she goes, you gotta do Rogan. I go, what? She goes,

334
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.560
it's the biggest podcast on the planet. She goes, you gotta do it. And I go,

335
00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:55.750
all right, I'm going to do it just for you. I'm going to do this show.

336
00:16:55.751 --> 00:16:59.650
So shout out to angel. Yeah. From New Hampshire. So, um,

337
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.640
so my mother-in-law we're sitting there and I know the New York times articles

338
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.590
is going to come out. And so, um,

339
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.100
was it Thanksgiving in 20 when the article come out 17?

340
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:12.640
So it was Thanksgiving of 2017 and everyone had kind of left the house.

341
00:17:12.641 --> 00:17:15.760
So it's just my wife and my in-laws a couple of us sitting in the kitchen and I

342
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:17.830
said, Hey, I got to tell you guys this. They said what? I said,

343
00:17:17.831 --> 00:17:20.890
there's going to be, this article comes out in the New York times and I'm in it.

344
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.770
And they're like, yeah, I go, well, I chased a UFO. My mother-in-law's like, ha.

345
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.940
<v 4>She looks at my father-in-law.</v>

346
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.340
<v 1>He's rolling his eyes looking at me like, are you serious? And I go, yeah.</v>

347
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.930
And then she's like, you never told us. I go, I never really told anyone.

348
00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:36.790
I mean, my wife and kids knew the event happened,

349
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:38.110
but they didn't have all the details.

350
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.540
Cause it's just one of those things we just didn't. I just didn't get into it.

351
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.320
Is it.

352
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.100
<v 2>Classified? No, it wasn't at any point. No, there's a lot of rumors.</v>

353
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.880
<v 1>Out there that, uh, it was classified and the ship got locked down. No,</v>

354
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.220
it wasn't. It was, we were never men in suits did not show up.

355
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.950
Um, no one told us not to talk about it.

356
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.980
And this is because there's a lot of other people saying other things.

357
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:02.910
And I said this, look at it. Here's the context. So in the battle group,

358
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.450
you've got the Admiral, you got the captain of the ship,

359
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.240
the captain of the Princeton. And then you've got the other CEOs.

360
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.850
So in position-wise I'm probably as a CEO of a squadron in the top 20

361
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.410
out of 6,000 and no one came to talk to me.

362
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.650
No one came to take my tapes. No one showed up in a suit.

363
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:23.820
No one told me not to talk.

364
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:26.340
No one talked to any of my air crew that were involved in this. All,

365
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.780
there were six people total involved.

366
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:30.270
The two that shot the video on the four of us that looked at it for five minutes

367
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:34.200
with our eyes. No one, nothing. It just, uh,

368
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.370
and I can get into how, uh, the, you know, there's a report that, uh,

369
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.710
that George Knapp got released. It's a,

370
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.830
I call it the unofficial official report. Um,

371
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.650
and I had met someone and I'm like, Hey, can you find anything out?

372
00:18:48.651 --> 00:18:51.030
I had this incident. I know. Normally when you tell people this,

373
00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:54.670
they look at you like, dude, what are you smoking? And I'm like, no, no,

374
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.070
I'm good. I'm tested. And they go and,

375
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.330
and they said, well, let me, let me see what I can do. And I had got a call. Um,

376
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.110
I was working,

377
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.260
I was doing some aerospace work and I had gotten a call my cell phone from a

378
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:09.210
guy. And he said, Hey,

379
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:14.100
I want to investigate your incident. And I go, okay.

380
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.390
So he did, he investigated the incident and it was very, very thorough. I mean,

381
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:21.630
if you've read that it's about 10 pages long, then he, I mean,

382
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:22.650
he tracked down everybody.

383
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.650
He tracked down all the people that were the air crew that were involved.

384
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:29.470
He talked to track down the Admiral. He talked to you. I mean, he,

385
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.880
it was a pretty thorough report and I didn't think anything of it, you know,

386
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.730
because you know, you know, the people are worded it's out there,

387
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:37.980
so they want to do foil, but it was never released in a foil request.

388
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:41.880
I actually had the Navy call me, I'd been out of the Navy for like six years.

389
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:42.180
And.

390
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.900
<v 0>I said, explain to people that means freedom of information insurance.</v>

391
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.120
<v 1>So I got called, uh,</v>

392
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.750
by a public affairs person from the Navy and said, Hey,

393
00:19:50.751 --> 00:19:52.730
is this commander Fravor? And I said, yeah. And they said, Hey,

394
00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:57.590
do you know of any documentation on your UFO incident off the

395
00:19:57.591 --> 00:20:01.970
Nimitz? And I said official. And she said, yeah. I said, no.

396
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.380
Cause I knew the report existed.

397
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.350
But to me it was an unofficial cause I didn't know where it went. I,

398
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.230
and I had a copy of it, but because it wasn't official.

399
00:20:09.231 --> 00:20:12.980
Well then years later I find out that the guy who actually did the report was

400
00:20:12.981 --> 00:20:17.060
part of the ATP team. And I was talking to Lou Elizondo who runs that program.

401
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.310
And Lou showed me the documentation of the original.

402
00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:22.490
I think it's like 13 people that were part of a tip and they were fully exempt.

403
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.280
And I'm like, well, that's kind of, well, Hey, I know that guy.

404
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.510
He's the guy that did the report, which is why it never, ever came out until,

405
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.210
uh, George got his hands, has something.

406
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.070
<v 0>Freedom of information, act exempt.</v>

407
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.470
<v 1>Um, obviously DOD has the ability because I I'm, uh,</v>

408
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.110
I'm not a conspiracy theory person at all. I mean, I'll just tell you that,

409
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:42.780
you know,

410
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.840
and I think there's reasons that the government doesn't tell the public

411
00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:47.470
everything. Um, and I don't speak for the government,

412
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:49.150
but I think there's a good reason for that,

413
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:52.780
that not everything needs to go out to the public, but most of it does.

414
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.580
And they just, what they do is they put a clause on, Hey,

415
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:57.580
for this program or whatever we're doing, which would have been an ATEC program.

416
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.280
The work that they do and what they find is not,

417
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:02.290
it's not releasable through freedom information act.

418
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:05.230
There's probably other avenues to get that, you know, and then you go, well,

419
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:07.750
what really is freedom information? Cause I got into this on a,

420
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.270
I was talking to someone who was a conspiracy theorist and they said, well,

421
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:13.210
so-and-so wrote, and they're not getting any information on your event. I said,

422
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.430
so what are they going to do? They're going to call up.

423
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.130
You're going to put in your request for, for freedom information. You go,

424
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:21.430
here's what I want. It goes to some poor guy at the Pentagon. Who's like,

425
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.100
I have no idea what this is. And he searches around. He doesn't find anything.

426
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:26.020
He looks at his bud and I gain all for you. I go, Hey Joe,

427
00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:29.800
you got anything on the Nimitz incident and you go, Nope. And I go, okay,

428
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:32.590
well I didn't find anything. I looked, I did my due diligence,

429
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:35.740
but I'm not going to spend the next six months of my life doing a research

430
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:37.810
project for you. And then you get nothing.

431
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:40.030
And then you assume the government's covering up when the government really

432
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:40.990
isn't. They just, you know,

433
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:43.860
the guys doing the research doesn't know where to or access to.

434
00:21:43.861 --> 00:21:44.790
It just makes sense.

435
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.730
<v 0>Um, Jamie, we have the video. Okay, here we go. Now, explain what, what is,</v>

436
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.850
what are we seeing? Why are we seeing it in this, uh, this particular, okay,

437
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.750
we'll just kind.

438
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.980
<v 1>Of go around. And so if you look at the, uh, don't, uh,</v>

439
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.530
OPR is operate on the top left corner, NAR is narrow field of view,

440
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:06.360
which is zoom. Uh, I are at the top middle.

441
00:22:06.361 --> 00:22:09.150
It means it's an infrared mode. So instead of seeing color,

442
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.130
you're seeing temperature variations,

443
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.850
and these things are extremely sensitive to when like tens of degrees,

444
00:22:14.851 --> 00:22:17.760
they will tell you the difference due to color. So it'll go from black to white.

445
00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:21.600
So in this case, white is hot. So if you look down in the bottom left corner,

446
00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:25.530
it says wht, um, that's white. It means white as hot.

447
00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:28.290
So the object that you're looking at is hotter than the sky around it.

448
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.900
But we also notices is there's no plumes knock.

449
00:22:30.901 --> 00:22:32.820
If you're looking at an airplane, when you get closer,

450
00:22:32.821 --> 00:22:34.940
you'll actually see the exhaust coming out and there'll be a,

451
00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:35.910
a really glowing plum.

452
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.360
That's important as we look at the video and in a most of the stuff on here,

453
00:22:39.361 --> 00:22:41.460
you really don't need to know what you can look at is, uh,

454
00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:46.020
the bottom right corner. It says 19,990 and a B that's the altitude.

455
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.960
And uh, if you look up in the little words,

456
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.400
are it says HTG and then B a L T B it's autopilot. So it's on altitude hold.

457
00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:57.660
It's just flying, uh, for that. So you can go ahead and play the video.

458
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.820
And so those two bars next to the white object, that's a, that's a,

459
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.260
that's a passive track.

460
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.870
So what he's done is he's commanded the FLIR to track that.

461
00:23:06.871 --> 00:23:11.070
So what the system does is it uses a, it's actually tracking it contract pixels,

462
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.620
and it's just basically blocked those hot pixels,

463
00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:16.770
those white pixels from the black ones. And then you're gonna see now,

464
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.410
pause it real quick. So I'm at the top. See,

465
00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:21.210
it went to a white screen with a black object.

466
00:23:21.211 --> 00:23:24.390
This is a black and white TV mode. And you've looked at the top, says TV.

467
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.800
So narrow in TV mode is actually, you can get closer than narrow. And I are,

468
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.880
it's literally narrowing. I R is about medium and TV mode.

469
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.500
So there you can get closer with the TV mode.

470
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.490
So you look at it now in this case, you would actually start to see, um,

471
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.030
stuff going on and even in TV mode, because you get exhausted, you know,

472
00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:43.290
the black exhaust that comes out,

473
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.250
you'll usually be able to see of some of that coming out of the back and you

474
00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:49.130
don't see anything. This thing's just sitting there. And if you look at the, uh,

475
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.690
the top where it says three, right?

476
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:53.660
That's the pod is looking three degrees right in the nose of the airplane,

477
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.500
right? So he's just flying along the bottom numbers. Don't worry.

478
00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:01.250
Those are time. So it's 41 56. So go ahead and hit play.

479
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.800
And what he's doing is he's going, Chad's going through all the different modes.

480
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:07.940
Cause he's like, oh, I got it.

481
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.370
And he's going to try and see the best video they can get.

482
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.100
Now there's rumors that this video is like 10 minutes long. No,

483
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:16.910
what you're looking at is the entire video. Now notice where it says 99.9.

484
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.230
So hit pause real quick.

485
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.320
What that means is the why he's got the pod to targeting pod.

486
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.670
Cause that's his primary sensor right now.

487
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:25.790
The radar is still trying to look at this object and trying to range it.

488
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:30.860
And the radar can't get ranging on it. So the object is doing something to say,

489
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.200
I'm not giving you back. Cause it's just a Doppler radar.

490
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.820
Just like a police radar is a Doppler.

491
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.170
It's trying to get a ranging on you and it can't do it. So when it says 99.9,

492
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.800
the radar cannot see this object right now. It's not allowing it to.

493
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.050
<v 3>And I think that's super important, Dave, the way he explained it to me, active,</v>

494
00:24:47.051 --> 00:24:48.880
jamming, compared to passive jamming.

495
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.600
This is a technology that is actively jamming this system.

496
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.150
<v 0>Rather than something like stealth aircraft,</v>

497
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.360
which is the shape and texture of the yeah.

498
00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.830
<v 1>Because everyone thinks stealth is invisible. It's not, it's, it's just,</v>

499
00:25:02.831 --> 00:25:07.000
it's a technology to, to basically make it harder for radars to see you,

500
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.810
you know, and that's the whole thing. You know, if you look at, uh, you know,

501
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.860
airplanes that are nose on, uh, are harder to see than airplanes at the sides,

502
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.310
kind of like think of a barn door. If you're looking at the whole barn door,

503
00:25:18.311 --> 00:25:20.620
it's really easy to see if I turned the barn door sideways where it's really

504
00:25:20.621 --> 00:25:22.990
thin, it's gonna be a lot harder for you to see it. Got it. So that's it,

505
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.850
that's the easiest most basic way to look at this.

506
00:25:24.851 --> 00:25:29.080
So keep going and you can play again and you can look to the airplane is still

507
00:25:29.081 --> 00:25:32.080
sitting at 20,000 feet, it's doing 250 knots.

508
00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.160
He's going to go through different modes and try and lock it. And uh,

509
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.040
it's just kind of sitting in all of a sudden, as the video goes on,

510
00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:42.160
I think it's a minute and a half long. See, it's going to try and require it.

511
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.180
Recenters the pod. So it's, it's slowly drifting to the left. The,

512
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.700
the Hornet is still going on the same heading,

513
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.010
just kind of hanging out and they're just filming this thing.

514
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.520
And then when they get close, it's going to zing off the left hand side.

515
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.180
When you see it on a full, because you know, you think digital,

516
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.520
you'd be able to get a one for one copy. Unlike, you know,

517
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.230
when he'd copy your album to a cassette, you know,

518
00:26:02.231 --> 00:26:04.960
you lose a little quality will you still do in digital world and they're off it

519
00:26:04.961 --> 00:26:09.010
goes to the left. And that's pretty fast to leave that field of you on the,

520
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.710
when we have big monitors that we look at these when they come back.

521
00:26:11.711 --> 00:26:14.920
So we're looking at the original tapes. So say that again, please. Jamie.

522
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.730
<v 0>So when it's taking off how fat, when,</v>

523
00:26:18.731 --> 00:26:22.240
when it just sort of like leaves the field of view and it takes off to the left,

524
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.350
how fast is that going?

525
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.400
<v 1>Uh, I would say pretty fast. That's an estimate. If we had ranging, you know,</v>

526
00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:29.080
you could obviously do the triangle and go, Hey,

527
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.670
cause we know how big the field of view is,

528
00:26:30.671 --> 00:26:33.910
but for something to leave the field of view that fast with a pod just staring

529
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.210
is pretty fast. I mean, it, it just it's like out of here,

530
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:42.250
like nothing that we have now. Cause we can't, I don't care what airplane is.

531
00:26:42.251 --> 00:26:45.180
So let's just use the F 22 Raptor. That's probably one of the,

532
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.890
it's probably the best airplane in the world right now. Performance wise. Um,

533
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.890
it can't take off like that, especially if it's a hover. I mean, you're,

534
00:26:53.891 --> 00:26:54.541
you're talking something,

535
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:57.120
that's just sitting in space in the wind and then it just,

536
00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:00.240
all of a sudden accelerates airplanes don't work that way and it's not leaving

537
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:03.840
any exhaust plume. No notice there's none. And when you go back to the, the end,

538
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.090
you've been in the ER, zoomed in and there's no, you would see a plume.

539
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:09.924
If that was an airplane.

540
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.300
<v 0>It's creepy how it takes off. Yeah.</v>

541
00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.460
<v 3>With active jamming, it's intelligently controlled. There's no rotors.</v>

542
00:27:16.461 --> 00:27:19.220
There's no plumes. There's no exhaust. There's no tail fin.

543
00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.050
There's no tail number.

544
00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:24.230
This thing goes from a standstill takes off.

545
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.550
It's a propulsion system we don't have in our inventory and no other nation

546
00:27:28.551 --> 00:27:30.680
does. That's how it's understood by the government.

547
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.960
<v 0>Now that that's w w w so if the fastest plane on</v>

548
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.440
earth was trying to do that same maneuver,

549
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.520
this system would be able to track it. Um, yeah, well, yeah,

550
00:27:43.521 --> 00:27:44.354
it would stay with it.

551
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.810
<v 1>Until it got to the limits of the pod, you know, as far as looking to the left,</v>

552
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.560
but right. And you know, the radar would see it. I mean, we get,

553
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.990
you get close enough. You're going to, you know,

554
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.770
everything becomes visible because you get burned through with radar and how,

555
00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.180
how radars actually work. This one is, you know,

556
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.180
eat, you tell me, but this was it performance beyond. I mean,

557
00:28:08.181 --> 00:28:11.260
it's like when we saw it disappear, when it flew in front of my nose, I'm,

558
00:28:11.261 --> 00:28:13.280
I'm talking something I'm within a half mile of it,

559
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.460
looking at it and it gets in front of me and just disappears.

560
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.970
So take we'll just go to something that everyone knows is fast.

561
00:28:19.971 --> 00:28:23.450
Let's just say Sr 71, that's doing mock three, you know,

562
00:28:23.451 --> 00:28:27.830
the visibility's 50 miles. So even at 35 miles a minute,

563
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.240
I'm going to be able to see this thing,

564
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.290
turn into a little.as it goes off into the horizon for probably a minute.

565
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.880
The thing that we saw disappeared in a second, just gone.

566
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.560
And that's from two different angles.

567
00:28:39.561 --> 00:28:41.720
Remember the other airplane's 8,000 feet above me. Cause we,

568
00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:43.430
we get close to it at about 12,000 feet.

569
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.330
So the other airplanes above me looking down and when it disappeared, I said,

570
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:52.250
do you guys see it? And they said, no, it's gone. It just literally was. Okay.
