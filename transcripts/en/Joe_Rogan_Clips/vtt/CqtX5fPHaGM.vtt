00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 1>Experience. Like the last one to come up with a good one was like Scientology.</v>

3
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:09.560
Right? That's the last one that stuck. So that was, was, was that 20th?

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.400
El Hubbard? Yeah, just 20th science fiction author, by the way.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.040
And really genius, really bad science fiction author really bad, but it.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.870
<v 0>Talks a lot and says a lot to the power of per suaion. You ever read.</v>

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.350
<v 1>His stuff? No, I, I, I, you need to read his stuff. Okay.</v>

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.190
Is it like Harry Potter? It's all first draft. There's never a second draft.

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.870
It's the most nonsense and narcissistic, but it's bonkers.

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.990
Like it's the stuff it's bonkers. Like some of the, some of the reading,

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.470
like he would write these stories and he would get paid, like, you know,

12
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:42.180
like a penny word or some like that.

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.580
And he would write like a bunch of 'em for like strange times magazine and

14
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:47.260
stuff, like way back in the day. Like,

15
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:49.140
this is what he did before he created Scientology.

16
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.180
He wrote these stories and you know,

17
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:56.260
like what was the one that John Travolta movie that they made battlefield earth.

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.273
<v 0>That's.</v>

19
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.340
<v 1>Jamieie's a wizard. You are you on.</v>

20
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.810
<v 0>Just looking at it? You got that mushroom coffee. He's a wizard. Jesus.</v>

21
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.170
Are you in AI? Did.

22
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.050
<v 1>You ever see that? Did you ever see battlefield earth? It's oh.</v>

23
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.370
<v 0>With the eyebrows? Yes. Amazing. El Hubbar didn't write that. Yes you do.</v>

24
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.010
Are you.

25
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.843
<v 1>Kidding? Yes, did kidding.</v>

26
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.370
And it was John travolti's like lifelong dream to turn that movie into one of

27
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.810
the most preposterous movies of all time. He turned that book.

28
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.280
He turned that book into a masterpiece. He looks.

29
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.520
<v 0>Like every white guy who wishes. He was black. Look at the look at the dreads,</v>

30
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.310
but.

31
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.920
<v 1>Look at their they're supposed to be giant.</v>

32
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.840
And the humans are these little tiny people pick.

33
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.920
<v 0>Up by the next. Who is that? Is that.</v>

34
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.900
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

35
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.840
<v 0>For whitakeer. Oh.</v>

36
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.600
<v 1>My God. Yeah. So anyway, this movie is, uh, it's like show girls.</v>

37
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.630
You ever watch show girls for fun? A great movie for fun movie. It's so bad.

38
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.710
He' like, what in the? It's like, there's a lot of movies like that.

39
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.230
That are great because they're awful.

40
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.510
<v 0>I need to rewatch this. Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.070
He looks like a dude who hack sacks in a park during the day.

42
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.990
<v 1>Please do this for me and for your fans.</v>

43
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.230
&lt;laugh&gt; for me and for your fans spark up and do a fight companion

44
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.190
for battlefield earth.

45
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.620
You watch and battlefield for the first time and cue it up so that people could

46
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:07.020
watch along. They'll just see you,

47
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.540
but they could like watch battlefield earth on one screen and you and the other.

48
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.140
And if they cue it up at the same time, they'll get you reacting to the movie.

49
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.260
<v 0>That's such a good, I'm gonna do that for the next podcast.</v>

50
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.220
A great episode idea, right? That's a great idea.

51
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.180
<v 1>I think you might have to have headphones on because you probably couldn't have</v>

52
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:23.500
the content of it. Streaming.

53
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.690
<v 0>I, I, my mind is blown that he wrote, he wrote this, let me check.</v>

54
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.250
<v 1>Oh, dude, this on, you gotta read some of the stuff he wrote.</v>

55
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.450
You read some of the stuff he wrote and you go, this is.

56
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.290
<v 0>Terrible. Is it? So is this like, is this it's bad? It's terrible.</v>

57
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.130
It looks really good. It reminds me of like, it's.

58
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.050
<v 1>So bad. It's just like, what is, what the are you doing? Doing,</v>

59
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.960
are you.

60
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960
<v 0>Doing? But people like that. And I've,</v>

61
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:50.280
I've said this about Hitler and people who are, &lt;laugh&gt;

62
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.320
just people who have these massive capabilities of persueing

63
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.880
a, just a massive people.

64
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.600
<v 1>Like, like El, Ron Hubbard.</v>

65
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.560
<v 0>El Ron Hubbard. It's like a missed opportunity to do something good. Well, this.</v>

66
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.480
<v 1>Have you ever read that book? Uh, Lawrence was Lawrence Wright's book.</v>

67
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:15.920
Is that what it is clear? Is it, is it Lawrence Wright? Is that who wrote it?

68
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.910
I think it is. Um, the book on Scientologists. Amazing. I mean, amazing.

69
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.030
And they did a, uh, was it an HBO series he did on it?

70
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.463
<v 2>Uh.</v>

71
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.110
<v 1>They did some anyway. It, it just, it's a book about, like, about books,</v>

72
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.550
about it's a, about how he created it. How El Ron Hubbard created the, uh,

73
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.860
Alex giibney, Alex giibney director and screenplay. There must. Okay.

74
00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:42.580
That's that? But there was a Lawrence, there was a book written too,

75
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:45.780
that looking for, yeah, there was a book written too, going clear.

76
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.700
Maybe it's going clear. That's what this is called. That's called going clear.

77
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.460
<v 0>I wonder like, you know, in marketing, how there's like a tipping point to like,</v>

78
00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:54.420
where things become, like they're both, both titled the.

79
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.500
<v 1>Same thing. So going clear Lawrence right too. Sorry. Oh, okay.</v>

80
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.570
So I think the other one is the Alice giibney wreck. Did the law,

81
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.450
is that what it is? They're bothing yeah. Anyway, the, um,

82
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.890
the story behind it is he was self-help himself.

83
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.130
So he was psychologically kind of up and he was sort of self diagnosnosing and

84
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.730
selfmedicing give him self-therapy by taking a lot of these principles of, uh,

85
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:21.200
different self-help books and different psychology you books that he had read.

86
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.080
And then he started applying that.

87
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.920
And then he started putting that together with some like well UFOs, UFOs, and.

88
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.920
<v 0>Theons. And so like Tony Robbins on crack. But.</v>

89
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.000
<v 1>When I forget what the director's name and the going clear on HBO,</v>

90
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:36.360
it is it's amazing.

91
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.480
And one of 'em there's this guy who's a big time Hollywood guy who is in,

92
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.510
in Scientology. I forget what he did. He's a director, right?

93
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:46.190
He's Paul Haggas I think, yes, that guy and Paul, like, he's a really,

94
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.750
really respected Hollywood guy. Right. Makes movies.

95
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.550
And he's deep into this thing, right. Probably given him millions of dollars,

96
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:54.370
something like this.

97
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.670
And then finally he gets to read these handwritten notes that he's been waiting

98
00:04:58.671 --> 00:05:01.820
for. Like, this is the you're onto the next level. And he is like, is this,

99
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.100
am I being trolled? Like he thinks it's like, almost like a test.

100
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.500
<v 0>You believe next to level, like it's super Mario.</v>

101
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.380
<v 1>Brothers. Exactly. Like super Mario brothers, but.</v>

102
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.060
<v 0>That's kinda smart. That's smart marketing. Well, a fault, sense of achievement.</v>

103
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:17.420
Like you've achieved something different. And that's like, what I was saying,

104
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:19.260
like, do you think how in marketing,

105
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:22.810
there's like a tipping point to when things become viral and more popular,

106
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.490
do you think there was like a tipping point to,

107
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.410
to Scientology just the floodgate opened and then everybody was sort of, well,

108
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:30.370
here's the thing following.

109
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.690
<v 1>If you follow a lot of the tenants of things, like detics all these,</v>

110
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:37.410
self-help 10, if you follow the good stuff,

111
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.010
you can actually do better and you'll do better because you're also focusing a,

112
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.800
in the fact that you're following this path, that's gonna do better.

113
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.960
So your intention, your focus and your during,

114
00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:51.360
during your day is of improving mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and doing better and

115
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:53.360
applying all of that. Yeah. So a lot of people that,

116
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:56.480
whether they join this or whether they take something less benign,

117
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.280
like Tony Robbins stuff, which is very motivational, but without the cult,

118
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.640
mostly.

119
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.120
<v 0>I mean, he's not your guru. Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.200
<v 1>He's he seems really good for a guy that's experienced what he's</v>

121
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:13.000
experienced, right? Yes. To be that doing that kind of stuff for this long, I'm.

122
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.920
<v 0>Actually reading awake, awake the beast within, I.</v>

123
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.030
<v 1>I read a limited power, like in 1989 or somemething. Yeah. It was great. Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.630
It's a great, it's great. There's a lot of great stuff in it.

125
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.350
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but tho those people that, if you're,

126
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:26.750
if you're one of those people that's doing something like that.

127
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.510
<v 0>Like the giant at the beast giant.</v>

128
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.430
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;. Yeah. Who was the other example that I used? Um.</v>

129
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.390
<v 0>The, um, um, uh,</v>

130
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:39.860
the other motivational dude with Jamie help.

131
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.020
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; how did we both forget? I said Tony Robbins and who else? Uh,</v>

132
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.073
anyway,

133
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.740
point is there's people want something that

134
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.060
guides them in a positive direction. If they think it's gonna be Tony Robbins,

135
00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:01.290
or if thing it's gonna be Scientology, they're trying to do better. Right.

136
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.410
So if you say, well, Scientology really helped my life. It did,

137
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.930
but why did it help your life?

138
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.570
It helped your life because you decided to focus on doing better in your life.

139
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.650
And you used the tenes of Scientology, which some of 'em are really good. Yeah.

140
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.570
I read DS. At least I read like a couple of chapters. It's.

141
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.040
<v 0>Like religion.</v>

142
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.440
There are aspects of it that you can apply to your life in positive from it.

143
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.680
But then there's look how focused Tom cruises tribals the tribal side.

144
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:26.240
That gets crazy with everything.

145
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.000
<v 1>Though. Look how focused Tom cruises.</v>

146
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.040
<v 0>He is very focused. Where is he? Anybody know? He' he's.</v>

147
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.240
<v 1>In a bunker right now. He's an outer space. He' having his ankle.</v>

148
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.960
He broken half doing mission. Impossible. Do you see that?

149
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.360
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; here's see that.

150
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.510
<v 0>Was that when he jumped on the, the wall, dude.</v>

151
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.343
<v 1>He's like.</v>

152
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.430
<v 0>How old is he? Se 172. He's at least.</v>

153
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.270
<v 1>56.</v>

154

<v 0>Years old. He's 5,000 years old. He's from another galaxy. 57.</v>

155
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.350
<v 1>Okay. Do you think he, he could take him down seven years old, 57 years old.</v>

156
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.510
He jumps from one building all the way to the other with his rope attached

157
00:07:56.511 --> 00:08:01.100
to him. And mishits it. And slams his ankle into the side of the building.

158
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.500
You see his foot compress his ankles. Fucksville why do they.

189
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.750
Only one only other way he could have done it. Crazy helicopter.

190
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.790
So also he's flying this helicopter for real.

191
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.110
So he's doing this crazy helicopter stunt. Wow. For real, by himself,

192
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.510
by himself, this maniac. What's a drives range cars.

193
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.190
<v 0>Now, is that a death?</v>

194
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.830
<v 1>Is that a, do you remember when I said about playing pool, you watched someone,</v>

195
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.860
he pull in a movie color of money, dark. He looked good and color of money.

196
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.980
He looked do. Like, do you think there's a level.

197
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.820
<v 0>Of, um, socioopathy that's playing.</v>

198
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.660
<v 1>There. Why do you have to find negative? Why can't you just look.</v>

199
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.700
<v 0>At the, no, it was a question. I didn't say I offered a question out. They.</v>

200
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.900
<v 1>Are making it happen. Jesse May. Why you gotta look in the dark side. You look,</v>

201
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.860
is this your man? Why is it this half empty Jesse man, listen,

202
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.250
I Don do look at these crashes that he has riding his motorcycle.

203
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.690
You just gotta think out of all the people that have done all the action movies,

204
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.810
who is who's wild in this. He's the wild. He's.

205
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.810
<v 0>The Michael Jordan of action movies. He who's.</v>

206
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.530
<v 1>Wild than this. Like legitimately VIN.</v>

207
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.730
<v 0>Dieselel I just hrew. I just threw a name out there. I threw a name.</v>

208
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:15.490
I threw a name.

209
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.320
<v 1>I was like, he should be with that name. &lt;laugh&gt; it does.</v>

210
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.373
<v 0>In diesel.</v>

211
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.240
<v 1>I know it sounds don't. You have to be to make up that name then diesel.</v>

212
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.920
<v 0>It is a, it's a, it's a lot. It's a name that comes with a lot of attitude.</v>

213
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.920
Do you think Tom cruise is like a, is he a dare devil or is it he's a,

214
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.960
does he think he's does,

215
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:35.360
do you think he thinks he's imortal because of Scientology? Mm.

216
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.790
<v 1>I think he thinks he gets his own planet when he dies or is that a Mormon?</v>

217
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:42.190
That's a Mormon, right? Mormons. Get their own planet. They do. Yeah. Yeah,

218
00:10:42.191 --> 00:10:45.510
yeah. dude. There's a album from, uh,

219
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.070
Johnny and Marie or the Osman brothers. It's from the Osman brothers. And uh,

220
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.230
in the, inside the album, when you open it up,

221
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:53.870
it's from back in theay the album,

222
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.420
the name of the album is the name of this thing that happens when you get your

223
00:10:58.421 --> 00:11:01.380
own planet, when you die. And then there's all these different people.

224
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:04.500
They all have their own planet. &lt;laugh&gt; inside the album. Okay.

225
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.333
<v 0>We need to know that.</v>

226
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.180
<v 1>Uh, one title here. It is here it is. &lt;laugh&gt; it? The plan. Okay.</v>

227
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.900
<v 0>That looks like, is that it a cult?</v>

228
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.980
<v 1>Which one is it? Think it's.</v>

229
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.780
<v 0>That one? I think it's the one with the planet on it. Look at the pink people.</v>

230
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.770
<v 1>There's one that you open it up and then the inside of it,</v>

231
00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:24.170
it's got all the different, do I REM am I remembering we, no,

232
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:26.410
we did this before. I just, I know we did faster than Joe.

233
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.410
<v 0>Rogan. You're atreasure chest of information.</v>

234
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.850
<v 1>No useless. I told you my Chimp brain is overused.</v>

235
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.050
I can't imagine being like Tom cruise.

236
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.690
I can't imagine like someone is that it sounds like you can impossible to

237
00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:39.880
imagine. And how you manage all that. I, I mean,

238
00:11:39.881 --> 00:11:41.960
that's why the guy's jumping off buildings. He's hoping he falls.

239
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:42.780
You know't help.

240
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.840
<v 0>Him manage it it anymore. Scientology. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

241
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:47.640
That's how he manages it. We need.

242
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.473
<v 1>To start a new cult.</v>

243
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.880
<v 0>Even me is, so is,</v>

244
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.480
excuse my ni naiveness in this situation is the, um,

245
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.760
headman in Scientology still God,

246
00:11:56.761 --> 00:12:00.480
or is it Elron Hubbard is there is the entity that Don think, think.

247
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.800
<v 1>It's he's, he's not the head guy. I mean,</v>

248
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.920
they say things like to LRH and they salute him and.

249
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:11.240
But I think they think of him as like a guy who just sort of like brought them

250
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.133
the word.

251
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.830
And then the word is the true origin story of human beings with the thens.

252
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:19.190
And they were frozen. They threw into the volcano and the.

253
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.270
<v 0>So it's not necessarily the word of God.</v>

254
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.630
It's just the word of the aliens that he created in his books. It's.

255
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.630
<v 1>Well, it's an alien thing. It's like, I think, to,</v>

256
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.670
to paraphrase it and butcher it.

257
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.940
I think the idea is that you are like using this and then you

258
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.980
have this thing that's inside of you.

259
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.860
That really has come from like other galaxies.

260
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.220
And it was released here and now it's trapped inside your body or God,

261
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.020
some wacky. But the writing people believe that. Do the writing so bad.

262
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.540
You need to read. I, I can't.

263
00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.340
<v 0>Leave to Dodge, battlefield earth battle. I love a reason to watch a.</v>

264
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.210
<v 1>Movie. Please get high and do aycast please. You'll have to tell me.</v>

265
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.450
<v 0>You'll have to give me, I'm gonna ask you some pointers after.</v>

266
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.890
So I make sure I nail it.

267
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.450
<v 1>Just do it where it's just you and a bong and battlefield earth.</v>

268
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.530
That's what it should be called.

269
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.650
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; me a B and battlefielder and just use it and just tape it.

270
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.170
Yeah. You sitting there on the couch.

271
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.680
Crisross applesau B and every now and then you're like, oh, oh my God.

272
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.080
He just hold on. You're like, this is so crazy.

273
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.040
Movie is so wacky,

274
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.400
but that movie's probably a million times better than the book. The book itself,

275
00:13:25.401 --> 00:13:29.600
like I'm telling you, his writing was so awful that it's confusing. It's like,

276
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:33.920
how did he do this? And he even wrote, or he was quoted as saying,

277
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.190
if you really wanna make money,

278
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.870
start a religion really quoted saying that he would take pictures of him with,

279
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.150
uh, he had a captain's jacket on a bunch of medals. He gave himself &lt;laugh&gt;.

280
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.030
<v 0>I mean, it's like, it sounds like mental ill.</v>

281
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.350
<v 1>Illness. &lt;laugh&gt; dude, you have to read going clear. It's CRA I didn't read it.</v>

282
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.430
I did the audio show. Did you listen to it? I listen to it, but it's,

283
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:54.510
it's still reading. But's it's amazing. I actually going clear.

284
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.780
I read at least one or two of the chapters. I actually sat down and read it,

285
00:13:57.781 --> 00:14:02.500
but most of it, I listened to. It's amazing. &lt;laugh&gt; it's amazing. Like,

286
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:05.580
can you realize like what he was? He was like this guy who was mentally ill,

287
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:10.140
who was trying to self-diagnose and then self heal and then came up with this

288
00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:12.500
whole system of like dynamics,

289
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:16.650
this whole system of how to like manage your mind and, and, and met. And again,

290
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.623
for some people,

291
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.010
it actually is effective because he gives them a structure give, well, yeah,

292
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:21.530
I was gonna gonna say.

293
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.291
<v 0>Maybe, you know,</v>

294
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:27.290
the silver lining to his mania is that he managed his mania and then

295
00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:28.124
made.

296
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.050
<v 1>Cash. Yeah. But he is dead either way. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's,</v>

297
00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:36.360
that's what gets his to learn. Who knows? There's so much money.

298
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.760
Who' who't that trust?

299
00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:41.080
They they're like one of the number one real estate holders in all of Los

300
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:41.910
Angeles.

301
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.640
<v 0>It's creepy. When you drive by their, the main building and like.</v>

302
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.040
<v 1>Psychiatry kills. It's like, I got a guy with a head thing on electric.</v>

303
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.640
Have you ever seen that? Yes. Yeah. They people that go into there,

304
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.960
they don't even know they're going into a Scientology building.

305
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.400
They think they're going in for some anti-psychiatry thing. It is.

306
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.280
<v 0>It is a little, you know, the whole thing is misleading. The whole origin of it.</v>

307
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.240
<v 1>Is misleading. Well, what is misleading? The guy probably believed everything.</v>

308
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:07.000
He said, he's probably out of his mind.

309
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.360
If you really pay attention to who Elron Hubbard was,

310
00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:11.950
he seems like he was lying. Come ly. He was probably a maniac.

311
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.790
<v 0>Was he a result of the CIA Ks?</v>

312
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.230
<v 1>No, no. He's pre this he's before all that &lt;laugh&gt; um, but, uh,</v>

313
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.590
have you ever seen the interview where, um,

314
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:26.150
Tom cruise is on with Matt Lauer on the today show and Tom cruise is mad at

315
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:27.950
Brook shields is on psychiatric jugs.

316
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.550
<v 0>Yes. And he's like reaching out to her through like,</v>

317
00:15:30.551 --> 00:15:33.140
he's he he's saying how he can, like what she needs to heal.

318
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.860
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And he's, he's so intense, dude. He looksudeed.</v>

319
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.620
<v 0>He looks zooed on something. Look at his face. It's so intense.</v>

320
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.300
<v 1>I just think he's very adamant about this particular aspect of the</v>

321
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.660
Scientology, um, belief system.

322
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.650
And one of the things is they don't believe in psychiatric drugs.

323
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.610
There's got it. I'm sure. I'm pretty sure they don't believe in any of those.

324
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:59.090
Right? It's not, but, but the conversation is so interesting.

325
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.370
<v 0>I wonder if you did like a personality trait test of the people who are</v>

326
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:05.850
followers of the Scientology religion,

327
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.530
what the common denominator is amongst them. Dude.

328
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.810
<v 1>You really wanna see something amazing.</v>

329
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.520
You wanna see Tom cruise is graduation in speech. What was that?

330
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.920
That one way he stood on the podium and they gave him like the most amazing man

331
00:16:16.921 --> 00:16:19.760
of all time metal. They gave him a medal, like a gold medal.

332
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.960
It's the size of a hub cap. And it's hanging around his neck,

333
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:24.760
like flavor of flame &lt;laugh&gt; and he stayed,

334
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.560
look at this and somebody leaked this. It is amazing.

335
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.000
So the head guy of Scientology, that guy gets in front of him.

336
00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:35.030
They so loot each other because they're in the army.

337
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.870
They hug like in a crazy,

338
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.350
like they both probably came there and then Tom cruise goes up.

339
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.470
They give him this gigantic dinner plate of a, uh, a metal.

340
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.790
And this, this is like a, a pump up what speech. It's like a pump-up speech.

341
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:52.990
That was like a, a Scientology thing. Look, it's my,

342
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.180
he won most awesome human of all time.

343
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.180
And so he's standing there in front of this huge globe behind him.

344
00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:02.220
There's this huge image of the earth behind him,

345
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.340
this huge seal freedom medal.

346
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.180
<v 0>Of Val valor.</v>

347
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.380
<v 1>Val freedom, metal of valor. It's amazing.</v>

348
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.820
Most amazing person of all time medal. It.

349
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.060
<v 0>Off of what, what.</v>

350
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.810
<v 1>The it ever. You hate her. &lt;laugh&gt; Jesus Christ. Everything with you is hate.</v>

351
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.690
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; no, I'm just analyzinging.</v>

352
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.011
<v 1>But come on.</v>

353
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:23.010
Imagine how crazy you have to be to stand there in front of these people with

354
00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:25.130
this God dinner plate hanging off your neck.

355
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.930
And then at the end they salute to Elron Hubbard. They look,

356
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:32.410
they look at the picture of 'em they go to LRH. They do like this. It's amazing.

357
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.930
<v 0>It's a secret society's it is not.</v>

358
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.840
<v 1>'S a photo. There's the photo of L what's with.</v>

359
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.920
<v 0>The decor. It looks like the inside of look'.</v>

360
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.600
<v 1>Sallurate see that everyone gets up and salutes to LRH.</v>

361
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.360
<v 0>Dude. He looks like the thing from ghost busters, dude.</v>

362
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.720
<v 1>I would, the painting would, I would like to join just for fun Hugo.</v>

363
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.520
Remember that? See how much they can convince you. What is it?

364
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.600
<v 0>Vigo, Vigo. You know what I'm talking.</v>

365
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.440
<v 1>About? How much could they convince you if you had to live like a Scientologist?</v>

366
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.720
Like if you just said like, look,

367
00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.400
I am going to do a thought experiment and I'm going to study all their work and

368
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.320
I'm going to, uh,

369
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.160
be non-critical about all this and I'm gonna live my life by and I'm gonna do it

370
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.710
for th three years. &lt;laugh&gt;.

371
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.390
<v 2>Do you think people have tried to do that?</v>

372
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.630
Probably just like for fun on their own.

373
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.230
Cuz they're so bored and just thought like,

374
00:18:15.231 --> 00:18:17.990
well would happen if they did and like what, what happens if they get caught?

375
00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:19.470
Yeah, but you would have to be, or if they were.

376
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.350
<v 1>Desperate. Yeah. You'd have to be in the system.</v>

377
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.390
<v 0>What if they just want,</v>

378
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.750
that was like their last hope and they just were hoping it would help whatever

379
00:18:25.751 --> 00:18:28.350
issue they had. I'm sure that's happened both ways.

380
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.900
<v 1>How many people have looked at the success of Scientology though and going,</v>

381
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.860
I need to do something like this, but they never did probably.

382
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.900
<v 0>A lot. It look everything.</v>

383
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.540
Can you it's like a comedian looking at you being like, I, I, I should.

384
00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.500
I wish I thought of that.

385
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.730
<v 3>Okay.</v>
