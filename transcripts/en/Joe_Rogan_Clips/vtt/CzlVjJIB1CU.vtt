00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 2>So tell me what the training's been like. What,</v>

3
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:08.520
what was the first day you started to have a main training? &lt;laugh&gt;.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.640
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I would tell you, like, I was having anxiety for about a week.</v>

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.680
I couldn't sleep really.

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.880
I couldn't really eat because I had signed a contract with the PFL,

7
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:22.590
but I didn't have a plan. And it was, was bothering me. You was like, what the?

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.230
You know? So I'm like, okay, where I'm gonna train at? Who am I train with?

9
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:27.510
When do I start getting ready? Like.

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.790
<v 0>Was it a conversation with John Jones that brought you to Jackson? Michael,</v>

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.870
John?

12
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.270
<v 1>Um, I was actually gonna reach out to them,</v>

13
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.270
but thank God they reached out to me. Oh, perfect. Oh, thank you. Jesus.

14
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.310
&lt;laugh&gt;. Cause it was like,

15
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.500
I was already had hit up John mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; up on, um,

16
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.060
on Instagram and he was being all busy and stuff and he didn't get back with me

17
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:52.580
until I landed in Albuquerque. He was like, yo, you're coming to Albuquerque.

18
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:54.500
He like, yeah, I'm gonna push you up in a hotel. I'm let you drive my car.

19
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:56.660
And I'm like, dude, thanks.

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.540
But it would've been great to hear if you like last week &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.330
but he end up helping yell with that. And um,

22
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.930
I trained him for about like a good two or three weeks and, and, uh,

23
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:10.930
Johnny bones there the first week, like watching, uh,

24
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.450
kind of scoping a little bit. And it was like,

25
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.170
we just figured out that we were twins and that was the best thing ever,

26
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:19.770
because he's a hard worker, he's smart, he's strategic.

27
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.360
And we believe in hard work. And he started drilling me like, like,

28
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.440
like the coaches would just sit on the side and just watch us for three,

29
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.640
four hours. And they would see like I'm full of energy. I'm like, let's go.

30
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:35.800
What else you got? And you know, he was teaching me stuff and uh,

31
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:38.600
coach wink would come in a little bit. Sometime coach Jackson would come in,

32
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:43.190
but sometime it would just me and Johnny and they would be just kind of just

33
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:47.630
looking at greatness from the outside. And they would never give me any, any,

34
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910
um, you know, crap after. But like my,

35
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.070
like my first day going to the Jackson wing gym,

36
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.990
I looked at the cages and stuff and I was walking to the gym to the cage and I

37
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.710
thought to myself, I was like, what the am I doing.

38
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.710
<v 0>Here? When was the first day you grappled?</v>

39
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.420
<v 1>First day, first day, first day.</v>

40
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.460
And that's the thing I thought I said that in my head, I'm like, Jesus,

41
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:13.740
what am I doing here? &lt;laugh&gt; and I said it out loud. And then Misha,

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.300
who works with Jackson? When you gym, he looked at me, he's like,

43
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:20.380
Clarissa's gonna be okay. And I was like, what? And he was like, you just said,

44
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:22.740
Jesus, what are you doing here? I'm like, oh, I'm so outta my mind.

45
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.930
I thought I said it in like, I'm not even, I'm not even,

46
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.530
I'm not even saying right now. &lt;laugh&gt; so that's hilarious.

47
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.090
I'm like, I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just so like, right. I'm, you know,

48
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.050
just nervous new thing. And they were like, um, I think coach Jackson asked me,

49
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.410
he said, uh, what are you most worried about? And I'm like,

50
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.880
I'm not worried about the strike and the punching or the kicking.

51
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.280
I'm not worried about that. I'm like,

52
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.960
I'm just worried about being on the ground and not knowing how to get up,

53
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.560
like right. I've been having nightmares about this. And all of a sudden,

54
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:59.360
he just was like, all right, get on your back. Like what &lt;laugh&gt; that sounds.

55
00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.600
<v 0>Like.</v>

56
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 1>Greg, he like, we're, that's what we're gonna start with. And then he, like,</v>

57
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.240
we're gonna strengthen your weaknesses and also, um,

58
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.120
make it to where you can put everything together to where it's you.

59
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.080
And ever since that day, I've just been super comfortable. I think I had one,

60
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.350
one training in just where I was like, this was so hard today.

61
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.870
But then when we did the same thing, like the next day,

62
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.510
and I was way better and comfortable at it,

63
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.030
it's just like being on my back and having to fight off my back. It just,

64
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.190
it's just not what boxers do. Right. You know? So it was like,

65
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.710
it was uncomfortable, but we had been doing different stuff on our back,

66
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.220
but then just this one drill was like, oh man, this is stressful. You know,

67
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.900
I didn't feel like that. What.

68
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.780
<v 0>Was it like defending against ground strikes? Like when you're on,</v>

69
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:48.620
like when you're on your back and someone's hitting you. Well.

70
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.140
<v 1>That's the thing was that weird. We had,</v>

71
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.180
he taught me what the defense was and he said,

72
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.100
and you worried about somebody hitting you in the face,

73
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.620
but you gotta realize that they gotta,

74
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.300
they gotta make it past your feet to then get you to the face.

75
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.170
So it's like a lot of leg action really is. And a lot of, uh, shrimps,

76
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.370
a lot of, um, just keeping your feet there, keeping your hands up, being,

77
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.810
being defensive and knowing what to do when,

78
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:12.770
when they do get past your feet or like, or like what to do.

79
00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:15.970
So that's my thing of like, I'm not worried about it happening.

80
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.970
I just wanna know what to do when it, when it, when it does happen. Right. I,

81
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.000
I wanna have a game plan for everything.

82
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.440
And when they understood that they were like, you know,

83
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:27.560
you're a very smart fighter and they start teaching me.

84
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.080
And I learned stuff really, really fast.

85
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.600
I don't know because I'm younger or because I'm smart, but, well.

86
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.840
<v 0>You're the lead athlete. I mean, you understand your body at a very,</v>

87
00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:37.680
very high level. That's I think,

88
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.400
like I said earlier about whatever you want to do in life.

89
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.750
If you become an elite boxer, like you have two time Olympic gold medalist,

90
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.190
I think you could do anything. It's just a matter of,

91
00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:52.150
if you put the same drive and focus and dedication that you've done to boxing,

92
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.150
you could apply that to anything. Whether it's,

93
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:56.070
you wanna become a dedicated grappler.

94
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.670
I think you could be a world class grappl grappler a hundred percent.

95
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.700
You just have to dedicate yourself time. Yeah.

96
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.980
<v 1>Exactly. And that's what I'm gonna do. And I'm trying to,</v>

97
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.820
I think I'm supposed to fight in boxing again, like September, maybe December.

98
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.820
So this time I have here from April to September,

99
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.860
December is really gonna be focused on MMA.

100
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.580
So I'm putting in putting a putting in a time for it,

101
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.170
but then it's still just like this. Just gotta see how much I can consume.

102
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.970
Cause some to some days they teach me so much. And when I, when I'm like,

103
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.490
oh my God, like, like my brain is tired from thinking about all this,

104
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.170
but I learn it. And once I learn it, I get it.

105
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:35.810
And I take so many notes in my phone. Yeah.

106
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.450
And I got videos of stuff that I have in my phone. So when I'm at home,

107
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.960
I can do some of the training and do some of the just so I can just keep it in

108
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:48.000
my mind and keep it refreshed because I understand how important repetitiveness

109
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.440
is. Like it's super important.

110
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.280
<v 0>Yeah. It is. It's everything. And when you are,</v>

111
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.960
when you're training for ground fighting,

112
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.960
do you ever think of yourself as maybe competing in a wrestling tournament or a

113
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.520
jujitsu tournament or something like that someday? Nope.

114
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.520
<v 1>I, I don't look at that because coach tu who's my MMA coach,</v>

115
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.720
MMA Jisu coach and coach Jackson and coach win.

116
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.000
They said the best MMA fighters are the ones who don't,

117
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:14.280
how to mix everything up together.

118
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.310
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so sometime you go into just wrestling and you start

119
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:20.790
getting into wrestling mode and then you do Jisu when you start doing Jisu,

120
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:21.180
he's like,

121
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.910
it's you wanna know how to punch and throw your kicks

122
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.590
and punch and be defensive and everything together and do do Jisu stuff all with

123
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.870
the MMA style, which I feel like was super smart.

124
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:36.950
And I only can say this stuff because I asked them the same thing. Like,

125
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.860
I think I'm so competitive that when I found out about like the color of the

126
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:43.900
belts and just so I'm like, oh, I gotta be a black belt. &lt;laugh&gt; right.

127
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.700
And they're like, mm, not so fast.

128
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.820
Like we wanna teach you to Jisu and you to learn it, but you're not gonna learn,

129
00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.300
like the regular person will learn it.

130
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:55.660
You'll learn it strictly for MMA mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

131
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.730
And so you're is learning that it's like, once you get more

132
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.490
profound in MMA and you learn how to mix stuff up and you have enough to just

133
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.690
sort of get you to high, when you're against high level fighters who know this,

134
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.170
then we can start getting you more experience. And just,

135
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.250
but right now we want you just to do it, just to learn it with MMA style.

136
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.440
<v 0>Do you remember the first time you tapped somebody out?</v>

137
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.200
<v 1>Me? Yeah. I.</v>

138
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.760
<v 0>Haven't. You never tapped anybody out mm-hmm no. No.</v>

139
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.760
So do you do just playing jujitsu sparring? Do you roll?

140
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.120
<v 1>Yeah. I, I, I, I do rolling with coach Tusa,</v>

141
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:35.880
which some days its fun and some days it is not cuz he's,

142
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.310
you know,

143
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.110
he's a black belt I think with like stripes and stuff and I mean,

144
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:45.630
he doesn't take it easy, you know, he's super like I hate being grabbed.

145
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.590
So my main thing is like, oh, you grabbed me. Get off me. &lt;laugh&gt; right, right.

146
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.190
And he's like, no, you wanna do stuff that can advance your movement.

147
00:07:53.191 --> 00:07:55.230
How could you get in a position to where you're winning?

148
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.900
And at first my mind was completely defensive, which I'm super,

149
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.020
super relaxed at getting people off me. Like you grabbed me. Okay.

150
00:08:04.021 --> 00:08:06.340
He touched me here. Oh, he touched me here. Okay. Let get back here.

151
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.380
I'm on the ground. He showed me this let's work on that. But um, oh,

152
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.660
I see an arm bar. Lemme try to grab it, you know,

153
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.940
just being mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like that. But at first I was super defensive.

154
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.730
Now I'm like kind of offensive with it.

155
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.330
And when we're trying to do the whole logistic thing, I'm like, man,

156
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.050
it's still hard. It's a whole different level of breathing. Um,

157
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.410
just five minutes compared to two minutes that I do on boxing. Right.

158
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.850
Even though I spar three minutes,

159
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.210
but still three minutes compared to five way different. But um,

160
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.680
just getting that cardio up there and um, having to do like the wrestling stuff.

161
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:46.000
It's not, it's not easy by far, but it's fun.

162
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.680
Some days it's fun and some days I'm like, man,

163
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.200
I can't wait till this hour and two hours that we gonna get the hell outta here.

164
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.560
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; so are you doing any live jujitsu roles with other people other than</v>

165
00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:00.040
the coach or are you just doing it only with the coach right now?

166
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.240
<v 1>Uh, I've done some kickboxing sparring with other fighters.</v>

167
00:09:04.241 --> 00:09:08.680
I haven't done anything jujitsu yet. Um, but that's because of the timing too.

168
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:10.480
Like once we were really starting to get into it,

169
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.080
I had on boxing magic schedule and that was to me.

170
00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:16.550
I had to make that be more important than may at the time.
