00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 4>What did you say that Bert made a video of the homeless?</v>

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.360
<v 2>It's not as Instagram fast. If I can pull it up because crusher,</v>

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.170
he was driving up Highland avenue in Hollywood and was just saying like,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.110
he wasn't showing the whole video during it, but he was like at a stoplight.

6
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:18.330
And like there was tents the whole way up here.

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.850
And he's extremely like this also a really nice 10.

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.600
<v 0>People want me to talk to bird crushers.</v>

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.550
<v 1>Bird is the word I looking at.</v>

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.383
<v 0>Bird.</v>

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.450
<v 1>Oh, it's in his Instagram story. That,</v>

12
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.170
his stories will go on for years for a long. He goes,

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.240
it doesn't every 15 seconds might even be deleted.

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.170
<v 2>Now it's crazy.</v>

15
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.860
<v 0>Productivity wise. He's basically the Elon Musk of Instagram stories.</v>

16
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.290
<v 2>Because it's not showing up or it could be one of these.</v>

17
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.200
<v 1>Is it? Well there's so there it is.</v>

18
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.430
There's tents all the way up on a Highland people.

19
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.560
<v 3>We're living on this side of the street. This is insane.</v>

20
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.690
This is literally hundreds of tents everywhere. Uh,

21
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.350
by the way, that's a nice 10. Also, those are two very nice tents.

22
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.500
I wonder if the city's giving them out because we don't have a tent that night.

23
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.230
I mean, I'm not even joking. Our tent isn't even that nice.

24
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.623
<v 0>Wow.</v>

25
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.970
<v 1>That's a, that's a tiny image he showed, you know, you didn't,</v>

26
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:16.120
you didn't get to see the real homeless situation,

27
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:19.750
but Bridget fetisi sent me a video when she was driving by Venice and it's a

28
00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:24.070
minute and a half long of just straight tents as she's driving down the road.

29
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.230
Just nothing but tents. Yeah. How do you put that genie back in the bottle, Lex?

30
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.310
Wow.

31
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.460
<v 0>This is, oh, you mean it's a slippery slope now, listen,</v>

32
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:37.930
I've been thinking about, you know, a bunch of tech folks are moving to Austin,

33
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:42.070
right? In terms of, uh, uh, in terms of starting businesses.

34
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:43.960
So that's one of the questions they're asking, like,

35
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.900
where's this headed and you're talking about the homeless problem, but.

36
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.190
<v 1>The governor just today came out and said that if, uh,</v>

37
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.820
the city does not reimpose a ban on camping,

38
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.260
that the state is going to step in.

39
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.930
<v 0>Well.</v>

40
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.200
<v 1>Yeah, because people are there. There's safety concerns.</v>

41
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.830
People are openly deprecating on the streets. There's a, you know,

42
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.440
it's not nearly as bad here as it is in California,

43
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.120
but it's way worse here than I've ever seen it.

44
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.470
<v 0>Before. But you know, homelessness is, it feels like that's a symptom,</v>

45
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:18.640
not the problem. Right. I mean, is that, uh.

46
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.560
<v 1>It's hard to say because homelessness was horrific in San Francisco before the</v>

47
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.210
pandemic. Right.

48
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.950
And the concern is that when you are too

49
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:34.810
lenient on the homeless folks and just allow them to camp whenever they want

50
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.360
wherever they want, wherever they want, they just do it.

51
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.530
And if you don't put up rules, if you try to be progressive and open-minded,

52
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.860
it's like, these are, they'd like to have new words for them,

53
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.500
the unhoused and like that. And when you do that,

54
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.150
you open up the door for more of them to migrate there because there's like,

55
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:55.210
there was a video that somebody put up of them interviewing these homeless guys.

56
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.400
And like, why do you like San Francisco? And they said, first of all,

57
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:00.850
they give us food. They give us money. They, they let us, you know, they're,

58
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.070
they're really loose. They let us camp where we want.

59
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.880
And these guys had moved to San Francisco to be homeless,

60
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.273
which is a problem.

61
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.810
<v 0>But see, just like you said,</v>

62
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.440
that problem is tied up with the fact that a lot of people are struggling

63
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:16.900
financially because of COVID. So it's like, yeah,

64
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.950
it feels like trying to solve the homelessness problem.

65
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.500
Isn't direct tension with trying to take care of people who are struggling.

66
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.870
<v 1>Well, I think it shows that there's a problem with people losing a</v>

67
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.770
place to live and that the solution is not necessarily let them camp out

68
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.380
anywhere they want. I, they, there,

69
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:40.450
there should be some sort of a step that the government takes,

70
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:44.110
whether it's to develop housing or to build something for them.

71
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.320
But when you let them just camp and everywhere,

72
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.570
then you ruin all the other spaces, right?

73
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:54.490
Like the best way to keep the city intact and to try to help these people is to

74
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:57.760
implement some sort of a program where you provide housing for them,

75
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.380
letting them just camp on the street. That's chaos. Like now you've,

76
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.850
you've up everything.

77
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.800
<v 0>So this particular state government just seems incompetent at solving</v>

78
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.210
this particular problem,

79
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.840
but it also seems to be not very good at solving some other problems, right.

80
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.340
In terms of encouraging businesses to stay there, California, California, sorry.

81
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.323
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

82
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.070
<v 1>Well, it's, it's, it's, it's, over-regulated so crazy regulated state,</v>

83
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.151
you know,

84
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:29.740
and it's also very high taxes and there's a lot of people that are recognizing

85
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:31.870
that there's other places that don't have any state taxes.

86
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.630
Like why would I stay in a place that's described? It's there.

87
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.570
They're telling you, you can't work. They're closing down businesses.

88
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.820
Gavin Newsome today is there's a lawsuit got filed by more than 50 San

89
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:47.530
Francisco bay area restaurants and bars trying to say like, why,

90
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.740
why are we closed? Like this doesn't make any sense. You should,

91
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.330
you can't just keep doing this forever. And some places are starting to wake up.

92
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.100
My hope is that a lot of this was political as gross as that sounds.

93
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.450
And that now that Biden and Harris are in that they'll open things back up.

94
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:06.790
And the mayor of Chicago said this,

95
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.930
the mayor of New York has said we have to open things back up. And I'm hoping,

96
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.390
I'm hoping that they take this chance.

97
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 0>We'll go the other way as well though. Right. It's uh,</v>

98
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.130
the other way is now that there is a,

99
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.210
a Democrat in office that they could see that as a pass, to,

100
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.680
to pass further regulations and push this closed economy,

101
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:32.380
going into a lockdown further, why would.

102
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.213
<v 1>They do that though?</v>

103
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.520
<v 0>I, listen, I was started as a terrible idea.</v>

104
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.380
The long-term consequences on the economy are going to be potentially orders of

105
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:45.160
magnitude worse on our, like the fabric of our society.

106
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.440
So I don't know why they would do that.

107
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.440
The sort of the Michael mouse. So the devil on my shoulder. Okay. Michael

108
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.950
Wearing a white suit, uh, or the devil wears a suit and tie, right? Yeah.

109
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.690
That's a, bad-ass I've been listening to that.

110
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.970
How good is that guy as amazing to wall and your story, uh, sorry,

111
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.010
on a small tangent, your story that he doesn't,

112
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.960
he hasn't been on your podcast because.

113
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.100
<v 1>Working on a ranch, like as a rancher, as legit,</v>

114
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.630
like we reached out to them and was like, well,

115
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:18.110
he's working on the ranch right now. Like, what is he doing on that ranch?

116
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.590
He's a cowboy, like a legit cowboy. Like.

117
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.150
<v 0>There's literally no more bad-ass thing to do. Then turn down, uh,</v>

118
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.250
Joe Rogan experience, uh.

119
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.080
<v 1>Appearance, massive promotion. He's like, eh, I'd rather just rope steers.</v>

120
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.100
<v 0>Yeah. But the Michael malice devil, uh, argument is that, you know,</v>

121
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.420
that's one way for the government to gain more control or the populace is, uh,

122
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.640
to, to fearmonger say that there's a big problem. And that magnify the,

123
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.340
the sort of the narrative around how big that problem is. And unfortunately,

124
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:59.690
from my perspective, uh, as a scientist to use scientists to say, look,

125
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:01.640
scientists are saying, there's a huge problem.

126
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.620
Sort of use science as a tool of fear-mongering and then gain

127
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:10.340
further and further control of the pipe. That's the devil on the, on the,

128
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:11.570
on the shoulder. Yeah.

129
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.760
<v 1>I have to have an incentive to do that. Like,</v>

130
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:17.600
why would they want that kind of control while also devastating the economy?

131
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.910
They need the economy because they need tax revenue.

132
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:21.770
If they're not getting tax revenue,

133
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.080
how are they gonna feed the military industrial complex?

134
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:25.460
How are they going to feed all their businesses?

135
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:28.130
How are they going to feed the pharmaceutical industry? Like what we,

136
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.900
all these people that finance their campaigns and all these banks

137
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.630
that pay for them to speak after they get out of office,

138
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.320
where's the money coming from now? If there's no economy, I don't think that,

139
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.630
I think that's like one of them doom and gloom,

140
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.810
Q Anon type deals where people are thinking like, this is,

141
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:48.050
they want to kill half the population and you know, yeah, no.

142
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.710
<v 0>I agree with you, everything you said incentive wise, it makes sense.</v>
