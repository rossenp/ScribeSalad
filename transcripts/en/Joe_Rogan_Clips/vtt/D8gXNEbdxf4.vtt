00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You would like the only thing they could top this,</v>

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.530
for those who didn't see it, it's such a brilliant idea.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.430
It was the eggnog drinking contest. And you had to do a double shot,

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.690
like it was bourbon, but it was eggnog like every 30 seconds. Well,

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.850
panel returning champion was pat from Monache who had diabetes and

6
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:25.320
lost the total. It already,

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.720
it was just sitting there and then he continued to drink it.

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.770
Oh yeah. To do the bit that you came up with. Oh, I mean,

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.650
there has to be like a, um, you know,

10
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:41.880
when like a broadcaster can get into the sports hall of fame, just because,

11
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:45.720
you know, he never played the game, but he like, you know,

12
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.950
because of what he added to it, I always said the pat menarche should have been,

13
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:53.250
like, they should have been like, like a, like a chick Hearn, Johnny,

14
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:56.940
most sort of award that he can with his,

15
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.410
his health continued to drink. I remember when,

16
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:06.220
when people posted that video, everyone was saying fake, this isn't real.

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.540
And that may be a joint real. I was like, no, that was real. I was there.

18
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
<v 1>Plastic bags all over the ground. Remember they, they,</v>

19
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:14.670
they put plastic everywhere,

20
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.710
all over the ground because they knew that people are gonna throw up.

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.060
They had the garbage can ready.

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.050
And then pat Duffy leans his head over the edge of the garbage can.

23
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.280
And then pat from will Knocky just here, come, you see him. Ah,

24
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.390
and then it keeps coming. It keeps coming like way crazier.

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.310
<v 0>He just went, it just came out and then somebody kept shutting it off.</v>

26
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.260
And every time, I mean, it was like, it is, I can't,

27
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:43.110
I can't watch them watch this. You know, I still can't tell the story.

28
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.360
If I tell it in detail, I start gagging.

29
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.610
<v 1>Oh, see, fear factor killed all that in me.</v>

30
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.670
<v 0>I never I'll tell the one that makes me gag.</v>

31
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.380
I start to gag is when there was the dude

32
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.883
watch it.

33
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.890
<v 1>It was true. It was tremendous.</v>

34
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.620
<v 0>Do I say, I'll say it real quick. Just go through it easily.</v>

35
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.453
<v 1>You tear it up.</v>

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.000
<v 0>There was a dude who got knocked out. So then what he did was he started,</v>

37
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.770
he puked into a pitcher,

38
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.850
he puked into a pitcher and then he was drinking his own puke,

39
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:19.590
trying to make the other people puked.

40
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.770
So then somebody dared this guy who had to take a swig from it.

41
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.370
And he had like this hipster Viking level beard, and he

42
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.130
can't do it. I can't do it. This is like 10 years later,

43
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.490
he took this Viking level swig. He just,

44
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.120
so he gave himself like kind of like a facial with it.

45
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:46.590
And then he puked into the pitcher, I think. And I remember it was in his beard.

46
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.320
There's a point in that podcast, in that pocket.

47
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.880
And in that show where I almost puked.

48
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.350
<v 1>Yeah. Does the crazy thing about seeing so many people.</v>

49
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.590
<v 0>Bill's going to go bills. And I was like hanging on to the.</v>

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 1>Yeah, we didn't realize that at the time,</v>

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.450
but those are some of the greatest moments of our life.

52
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.590
<v 2>In, uh, in my family. We've got some Ashkenazi bad genes. We,</v>

53
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.440
we tend to die young. And my grandmother died.

54
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.080
My grandmother is actually only 15 years older than my dad.

55
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.440
And she died a few years ago, lost 10 years of her life. Horrible.

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.130
So we know what's going to happen in my family, probably to all of us with.

57
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.080
<v 1>Your grandmother had your father when she was 15 years old, right?</v>

58
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120
<v 2>Whoa. Yeah. Back in the early days of world war two,</v>

59
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.240
uh, she apparently was playing around with her boyfriend.

60
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.460
She claims to be a Virgin, but at that point,

61
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:39.880
but something got somewhere that shouldn't have. And, uh,

62
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.870
it was during high school. Right. So I was raised by my grandmother.

63
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:45.490
She was in her forties when I was a kid.

64
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.870
And she was the one that taught me to always stay young, keep your, you know,

65
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.960
adults ruin everything. That's probably why I work on aging.

66
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.700
<v 1>That's it? Adults ruin everything. Well, how,</v>

67
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:59.440
what was her advice like in terms of like, why,

68
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.020
how do you avoid what adults are doing wrong?

69
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.800
<v 2>Well, you know, she she'd, uh, grown up, uh,</v>

70
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.720
during the depression and then world war two,

71
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.860
and then the communists came into Hungary and raped a lot of people. Uh,

72
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.590
she had no, uh, um,

73
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.930
she had had no respect for humanity. So by the time I came along, first of all,

74
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.520
she put all of our energy into to me. And I'm I'm, I was a spot bright as a kid.

75
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.170
So that, that was wasn't helpful to me. Uh, I think now as an adult,

76
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.360
uh, but more importantly,

77
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:35.680
she wanted me to do the best I could with my life.

78
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.310
She said, David, do what you can to make this world a better place,

79
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.670
make sure that you leave this place better than you found it.

80
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.930
And that's what I'm trying to do.

81
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.130
<v 1>Wow. What a profound piece of advice for grandchild?</v>

82
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.090
<v 2>Uh, she, she was a rebel. She taught me forget the rules, right? Uh,</v>

83
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.270
kind of like you do, it's, uh, I'm going my own way and we'll see how this goes.

84
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.440
She, uh, so she went to Australia, she said, Europe, I'm outta here.

85
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:02.590
She went to Australia. The furthest place she could find from Europe,

86
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.790
never went back. She went on Bondai beach, uh, in Sydney,

87
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.850
in a bikini, uh, which was rebellious. And there is,

88
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.460
she got taken off the beach by, by the police.

89
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.140
<v 1>Which after where back then all the.</v>

90
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.790
<v 2>Full little British thing.</v>

91
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.340
<v 1>[Inaudible] would it, oh, down your knees?</v>

92
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.710
<v 2>I think. What did they look like? Maybe it was a full, uh, a one-piece, but you.</v>

93
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.673
<v 1>Want to show your belly?</v>

94
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.370
<v 2>That's what I think. But she was a rebel. She went to new Guinea, uh,</v>

95
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:28.450
by herself in the sixties.

96
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.670
<v 1>What year was this? Where she was wearing a bikini?</v>

97
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.960
<v 2>Uh, that would be 56.</v>

98
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.570
<v 1>Keeney in the fifties. Wow. Wow. Okay.</v>

99
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.030
Like those pinup girls, right. When you see them,

100
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:43.600
they always had one piece suits on like, yeah.

101
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.050
<v 2>So imagine new Guinea in the sixties, as a woman on her own,</v>

102
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.960
up in the Highlands, she claims to have eaten human flesh.

103
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:52.480
And so she spent most of the time drunk as well.

104
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.050
<v 1>Now you pay attention to like Boston dynamics and all these,</v>

105
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.390
all these robotic creations that they've made.

106
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.670
<v 3>Well, they seem to have a pensions for doing the really sinister looking bots.</v>

107
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.610
<v 1>Golf robots that are, you know,</v>

108
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.120
anything that looks autonomous has kind of sinister looking.

109
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.930
<v 3>I mean, you see the Japan. Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:15.260
I mean like the Japanese have these like big guides rounded,

111
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.810
so it's a different, they're trying to trick us. Boston dynamics is,

112
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:20.660
I guess they want the Pentagon to give them funding or something.

113
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.580
<v 1>Right. DARPA. Yeah. They look like they're developing terminators. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.010
But, but what I was thinking is if we do

115
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.990
eventually come to a time where those things are going to war for us,

116
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.490
instead of us, like if we get involved in robot wars,

117
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.490
our robots versus their robots,

118
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.540
and this becomes the next motivation for increased technological innovation to

119
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:51.680
try to deal with superior robots by the Soviet union or by China.

120
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.790
Like these,

121
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.140
these are more things that could be threats that could push people to some crazy

122
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.010
level of technological innovation. Yeah.

123
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.570
<v 3>It could. I mean,</v>

124
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:07.220
I think there are other drivers for technological innovation as well. Um,

125
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.960
that, that seems so plenty. Um, strong, um,

126
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.930
commercial drivers, let us say, um,

127
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.630
that we wouldn't have to rely on,

128
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.430
on war or the threat of war to kind of stay innovative. Um,

129
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.440
and I mean,

130
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.420
there hasn't been this effort to try to see if it would be possible to have

131
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:33.710
some kind of ban on lethal autonomous weapons. Um,

132
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.340
just as, I mean, there are, there are a few,

133
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.730
there are a few set technologies that we have, like there is,

134
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.360
has been a relatively successful ban on chemical and biological weapons,

135
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.390
um, which by and large being, you know, uh, honored and upheld,

136
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.760
um, there, there are kind of treaties on nuclear weapons,

137
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:56.930
which has limited proliferation. Yes, there are now maybe I dunno,

138
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.390
a dozen, I don't know the exact number,

139
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.340
but it's certainly a lot better than 50 or a hundred countries. Um,

140
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.230
and some other weapons as well, uh, blinding lasers, um,

141
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.800
landmines, cluster munitions. And so, so, so some people think, man,

142
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.370
maybe we could do something like this with, um, lethal autonomous weapons,

143
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.780
killer bots that do we, is that really what humanity needs most now?

144
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:23.990
Like another arms race to develop like killer bots.

145
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.920
It seems arguably the answer to that is not. Um,

146
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.330
but I've, I've, I've kind of, uh,

147
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.070
there's a lot of my friends are supportive.

148
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.690
I kind of stood a little bit on the sidelines on that particular campaign,

149
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.730
being a launcher. Um, exactly what it is that w I mean,

150
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:47.540
certainly I'd think it better if we refrained from having some arms race to

151
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:49.430
develop these than not. And I've had.

152
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.870
<v 4>For sightings myself quite vivid, the first one was in Martha's vineyard.</v>

153
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.480
I was four in the morning. Uh, I got up to take a leak on the balcony there.

154
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:59.820
And I looked up in the sky and about a hundred thousand feet up.

155
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:04.440
I saw two glowing disks flying an echelon formation. You saw this,

156
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.280
I saw this. I was in my thirties. Yeah.

157
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.420
And so I go, I look up and I see these things and they're moving, man.

158
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:16.350
They're going from horizon to horizon 20,000 miles an hour. And I,

159
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.020
I I've been in an F five. I've had it in my hands.

160
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.440
I've been in a [inaudible] I know helicopters. I know aviation,

161
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.350
I know meteoric bowlines I know what's not a meteor. And what is,

162
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:26.820
I know what's a helicopter and what is,

163
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.920
I know what's the moon and Venus two glowing, glowing round objects,

164
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.430
a hundred thousand feet, maybe 20,000 miles an hour. They do doing,

165
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.790
because they went across the sky, like just in a zigzag formation.

166
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:41.400
So if I screamed at my wife, my friends, they got up,

167
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:44.340
the three of us saw it and I said, you know,

168
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:47.100
and they all knew it was something unusual. That was my first sighting. Okay.

169
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.050
Now who knows? Okay. Meteoric bull ride.

170
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.660
There are many people that can dispute that. That wasn't real,

171
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:54.810
but I know what I saw. I know what my friends saw. I know what my wife saw.

172
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.090
Those things were moving. They were glowing fast.

173
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.790
There were flying in formation and they were doing, uh,

174
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.270
enough speed to get from basically the right side of my eyes,

175
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:07.680
to the left side of my eyes from really fast. The second one was, um,

176
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.350
I was, uh, I was in a, so that's, so that's four. I count those two as two.

177
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.470
And then the, the, the, the second one that I saw. So the one, two,

178
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.860
the third one I saw, I was, uh, I was in Montreal, Canada,

179
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.150
and I was on the 23rd floor of the queen Elizabeth hotel.

180
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.180
And this would have been when we were doing patrol in Canada,

181
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:29.220
the patrol tequila promotion. And that was,

182
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.930
would've been in the early two thousands. And, uh, and I looked, um,

183
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.170
up and, uh,

184
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.090
beyond the window there and I saw this one,

185
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.830
it just looked like an air mattress turned over on its, you know, with,

186
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.150
with the, with the bubbles on the bottom, it was huge. It was 150 feet, long,

187
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:53.070
50 feet, wide gray. It was a gray rainy day in Montreal,

188
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.480
broad daylight. And here was this thing at the 23rd story of the hotel.

189
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.140
And I'm looking at it and it moves slowly down St. Catherine street.

190
00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:02.940
And I'm thinking, where are the wires?

191
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:05.820
Where are the wires where it's gotta be a balloon. It's gotta be,

192
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.120
there's no Thanksgiving day parade here. What, what, what is that?

193
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.070
And my friends are with me. What is that?

194
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.630
And it come along and just parked outside the window. We looked at it,

195
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.790
big gray thing with these bulbs underneath,

196
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.270
and then it slowly turned and we saw the full length of it.

197
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.710
And then it went around the corner.

198
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:26.310
We ran out in the hall and we just watched a drift kind of sideways off over the

199
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.230
St. Lawrence river and disappear.
