1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.120
<v 0>Um, you know, you have, you know, you know, Northern lights at night, if you're,</v>

2
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.520
if you're locking, um, massive moose and, and caribou,

3
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:10.640
like watching caribou migrate and grizzly bears eating blueberries. And,

4
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:14.440
you know, I've been, I spent so much time with wolves up in these areas and,

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.680
and, and really engaging with the wolves and stuff. And just,

6
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.760
it's just always fed these experiences to me.

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:21.230
And that's what really started to mean.

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.910
That's what really mattered the most to me was being in these areas,

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.270
taking a deep breath, being super present,

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.190
being super aware and seeing all of these different things that were filling

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.270
my soul. Right.

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.030
True soul food while I was hunting a moose or while I was hunting a caribou and

13
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:42.940
then maybe being successful on a sort of caribou and skinning it

14
00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:45.740
out and, and feeling the weight on my back.

15
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.860
Cause I'm getting it back to camp and the Northern lights are overhead or the,

16
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.420
if they're not out, the stars are out and I'm hearing wolves hauling. And I,

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.820
you know, I, I, I, uh,

18
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.140
I lived with a pack of wolves one summer in Alaska when I was up there doing

19
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.300
research. And so like all of these, I lived with a pack of wolves.

20
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.610
&lt;affirmative&gt; &lt;affirmative&gt;, how'd you do that? Um, I was, uh, I,

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.210
I was doing research for the us fish and wildlife service and, uh,

22
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.210
I ran a research camp, a, a genetics camp for the,

23
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.250
from June through September, may through September,

24
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.130
whatever I did it five years in row. And one year, uh,

25
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.360
pack of wolves moved into my research camp. Whoa. And, um, oh,

26
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:26.520
it was whoa. I mean,

27
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.760
whoa &lt;laugh&gt; I went fly fishing one night and I was standing on the bank of a

28
00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:35.720
river casting and it was an eerie little river that I was on it pretty quiet,

29
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.000
but it had a good flow. And we were,

30
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.920
I was waiting for salmon to come up and I was fly fishing for Grailing. And, uh,

31
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.040
it just kind of had this eerie feeling.

32
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.990
I was by my myself and I just had this eerie feeling that I was being watched.

33
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.830
And, and I happened to look behind me and there's a big Alder thicket, right?

34
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:49.471
These, these,

35
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:53.110
these bushes that are probably 10 to 12 feet high have green leaves on 'em and

36
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:57.030
these twisted gnarly almost like a, you know, booraley type tree,

37
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.590
like gnarly branches. And I was, I was just staring in, in,

38
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.950
in the alders and there's grizzly bears where I was. So I was just trying,

39
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.260
I mind my, and I'm, you know,

40
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.260
I'm walking on Wolf and grizzly bear tracks as I'm fishing.

41
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.940
So I was just staring back in the ERs and, um, it was, it was like a movie.

42
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.540
So my, my eyes were starting to truncate down on the leaves.

43
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:18.260
And then all of a sudden it came to all this little opening.

44
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.380
I could see a Wolf's face staring at me through the alders and,

45
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.330
and she was probably 10 yards away, something like that. Whoa.

46
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.570
And so I saw her and when I looked at her,

47
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:33.530
she was just staring at me and I just looked back at her and I, and I just said,

48
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.610
Hey, you know, I just said, Hey. I said, Hey mom, what's going on?

49
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.010
And I just kept fishing.

50
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.330
Cause I wanted her to know that I knew and I turned my back on her and I kept

51
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.410
fishing. Well, lo and behold,

52
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.960
she comes out on the sandbar with me and she starts walking down behind me.

53
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.320
And it was funny cuz if I didn't make eye contact, she was totally chill.

54
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.560
But if I made eye contact, she would snarl at me.

55
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.880
She'd raise her lips up and give a little deep seated girl.

56
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.240
And so she was standing now she's probably three feet behind me. What? Yeah.

57
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.680
And so she's, she's right there. She's literally right there.

58
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.520
And so I'm just like, Hey mom, what's going on? Just cast my flyer on. And,

59
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.160
and like when I'm not looking at her, she's kind of trying to check me out.

60
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.480
She's doing the whole nose extension, getting a whiff. So she moves off.

61
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.630
She moves off down the three feet. She moves off, down that.

62
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.510
Do you have a gun on you? I did have a 12 gauge at that time.

63
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.030
I'd had a 12 gauge slug gun. Um, but I rarely took that thing with me. But um,

64
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.870
I got in trouble actually from one of my bosses.

65
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.150
Cause one of the other biologists told my boss, like never,

66
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.310
he never carries the gun and we're supposed to carry a gun everywhere we go.

67
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.950
So I'm just like, whatever. But um, so she left and um, would you worry.

68
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.460
<v 1>She was gonna attack you? No, not at how all did she get those? So close.</v>

69
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:43.030
That seems.

70
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.700
<v 0>Weird. I don't know. Yeah. She was just checking me out.</v>

71
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.540
She was just checking me out. That's that's that's,

72
00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:49.700
that's how I was reading into it. Anyway. So you think just by.

73
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.580
<v 1>The way you were talking to her that she realized that you weren't even</v>

74
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:56.340
interested in being a threat and she was confident that she could get the away.

75
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.290
<v 0>From you. That's a good question. Yeah. That's a good question. Eat. Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.450
<v 1>That's this that's 1, 2, 3.</v>

77
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.970
<v 0>Yeah, maybe even two and a half feet. Like she's.</v>

78
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.930
<v 1>Right behind, behind that. Like.</v>

79
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.930
<v 0>You could touch her. Oh, it gets much better. It gets much better.</v>

80
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.850
I ended up spending a whole summer with her and all the other, um,

81
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:15.050
animals in the, in the pack.

82
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.010
So the next day I hear her Hoel down the river,

83
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.280
so I'm just mess around. So I ho back to her, she hos back to me instantly.

84
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.480
I hol back to her all of a sudden, I see her.

85
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.520
She's now standing exactly where I was standing the night before.

86
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.360
This's all true story. She's sitting on her butt sitting upright.

87
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:35.800
Like you would see a German shepherd sitting staring at me.

88
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.830
So I give her just a little coy little, oh,

89
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.670
she lays down.

90
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.630
She maintains eye contact with me and then she's just sitting there staring at

91
00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:51.510
me and then she sits up again. And I hol again, just a, a little one.

92
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.910
She lays down again. She's just maintaining eye, eye contact.

93
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.790
Then she leaves that night. So the area that Tundra that I was on,

94
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.740
um, is great impacted by even human foot traffic.

95
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.220
So you have to be really careful where you step cuz you know,

96
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.820
your footprint will be there for a long time.

97
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.220
So we'd walk on these little planks that we made out of two by fours that would

98
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:14.820
sit up on logs that were, you know, that we' put placed in and put in place.

99
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:18.780
And I had tent rice slepted and I had a genetics tent where I did all my, uh,

100
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.420
stuff. And then I had a cook tent, things like that. And so,

101
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.930
but right in front of my tent,

102
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:25.410
I had this little platform where I would get dressed in the morning cuz I would,

103
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.090
I would literally live for five and a half months and a little two and a half

104
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:28.970
person pop tent.

105
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.410
And so I'd get out in the morning and get dressed on this little piece of wood

106
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:34.010
and then I'd walk to breakfast or whatever,

107
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.730
or to the river in the middle of the night,

108
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.810
the alpha mail was sitting on my little platform and he,

109
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:41.650
how old right outside my tent. So,

110
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.600
and I sat up and I grabbed my gun and I was just sitting there and he woke me up

111
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.200
from a dead sleep and I was just sitting there panting with my gun.

112
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.000
I was looking all around and I didn't know what it was.

113
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:53.520
And then I heard something and I kind of peeked out and I saw that it was this

114
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:58.080
big male. I was like, ah, okay. It's just not just a Wolf, but like,

115
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.760
you know, I'm, he's not gonna bother me at all.

116
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.800
So I hung my gun back up and I just,

117
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.960
or set my gun back down and I just laid back down.

118
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.360
But th those two instances just started each day. Um,

119
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.680
the next day I, I come out and I'm walking to the genetics tent and I see him,

120
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.910
he's 20 yards away and he's paralleling me on this plank and I go into the

121
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:22.630
cook tent and then I'm kind of like peeking out the little corners, you know,

122
00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:25.230
like I want to, I, cause I, I don't know what they're doing.

123
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.630
I don't wanna walk out and get attacked or, and I, I don't think that's,

124
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.630
they have no body language of hunting whatsoever. And,

125
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.700
and so what is their body language of curiosity? Like curiosity. Yeah. And,

126
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.460
um, I hate to, I hate to, um, anthropomorphies yeah, but it was just like,

127
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.580
it was just like that movie never cry Wolf.

128
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.540
That's exactly how the wolves were engaging movie. What was that movie? Uh,

129
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.100
just about a researcher, uh,

130
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.740
book by Farley Malet of a researcher that went up to, um,

131
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.140
the Canadian government had,

132
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.090
they were thinking that wolves were death estimating these caribou herds.

133
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.650
And so they sent this biologist up there to research the wolves,

134
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:04.890
to see how many caribou they were killing. And, um,

135
00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:07.690
basically what the bologists found out was that the wolves weren't killing any

136
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:09.130
caribou, zero caribou,

137
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:12.530
they were killing red back bowls and they were fishing and they were doing other

138
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.050
ways. They were eating small animals,

139
00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:17.210
which is basically a very large par what wolves do they eat?

140
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:20.720
Very small animal S and occasionally kill caribou, occasionally kill moose,

141
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:22.720
things like that in certain areas. They're, um,

142
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.640
they can be really hardcore predators in other areas that eat a lot of mice.

143
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:30.960
And so, um, but that's how these wolves were engaging with the,

144
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.880
the actor in this movie. And, you know, they were kind of inquisitive.

145
00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:37.000
They were coming around and, and so these, these wolves,

146
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.630
they were just always press and like even I would go hiking just to get some

147
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.350
exercise and literally three or four of them would go with me and they'd hang

148
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.750
back like 50, 60 yards behind me, but I I'd hike for like 10 miles. And they,

149
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.350
and they'd do the whole thing with me and return back to camp with me.

150
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:54.750
And then it started to really grow. Um,

151
00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:58.030
cause we have this research gear that's in the river so that we can count

152
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.860
specate and sampled a salmon as they swim through to go spawn.

153
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.900
But after the salmon spawn, they all die. Right.

154
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.780
And so they would spawn die and they'd come back and they'd wash up on my gear.

155
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.420
And so I'd have all these, that's why the wolves were there.

156
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.500
They wanted to eat the dead fish that were coming back down.

157
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.300
And so as I started toss fish off on the banks of the river,

158
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:20.890
usually I would just toss 'em back river, but I toss 'em on the banks,

159
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.330
the fresher fish. And, uh, the wolves started eating them.

160
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.850
And then our relationship just kept growing and growing and growing and growing.

161
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.010
And, and then up spending like three and a half months with them.

162
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.290
Did you think while you were doing this,

163
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.210
that this is probably how human beings and wolves yes.

164
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.440
Developed this relationship a hundred percent, a hundred percent a percent.

165
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.240
And I actually, I feel bad saying this and I hope I don't offend anybody,

166
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:47.400
but I was working with two Innuit guys, two Eskimo guys,

167
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:48.880
and they wanted to shoot all these wolves

168
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.760
and I kinda lied to 'em and I just said, man, like,

169
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.520
have you ever seen wolves behave like this? And they said, no. And I said, well,

170
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.880
you know, some of your guys' beliefs, you know,

171
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.240
fall that your ancestors move on into the animal kingdom. Right.

172
00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.400
And they're like, yeah. And I said, well,

173
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.400
is there a chance that some of these wolves could be some of your ancestors,

174
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.480
you know? And I know that's not true, at least I think I know that's not true,

175
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:12.480
but they're like, yeah. Yeah.

176
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.190
So I just was trying to convince these guys cause they wanna of blast these

177
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:15.410
things.

178
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.750
And so I just convinced him not to shoot the wolves and I feel like an singing

179
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.070
all lot. Why do you feel like an saying that? I don't know.

180
00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:23.030
I just didn't want them to shoot the wolves. So I just kind of,

181
00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:26.790
it's probably a good way to rationalize it. I, I steered them down a path of,

182
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.310
of where their minds may have gone anyway. Yeah. Yeah. And so, but I,

183
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.470
I spent time with those wolves and I've had, um, you know,

184
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:37.740
and the idea of management, like, uh, when we were in, in,

185
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.900
in the short that Jamie was just playing who we are that we played,

186
00:09:40.901 --> 00:09:42.140
you can see some wolves in there.

187
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.660
And a few years ago I got surrounded by a pack of wolves in the Arctic with the

188
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:48.860
crew and it filmed really beautifully. And it was,

189
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.860
and it was one of the most remarkable engagements I've ever had in the

190
00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:54.060
wilderness. Um, and they were definitely,

191
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.010
their body language was definitely looking at us as though,

192
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.890
are we food? Right? So this, that was one of 'em,

193
00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:05.370
but we had like six or seven wolves come in behind us.

194
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.050
So this Wolf would be in front of us two or three, others would be behind us,

195
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:12.130
but you can see, they're not attacking us. They're not even hunting us,

196
00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:15.810
but you can just see, like, they're wondering, you know, it's there,

197
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.440
is there a play here? Right? Right. Is there, is there a play here? And, and um,

198
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.440
and I, and I, and I mean, this, I'm not being a tough guy.

199
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:26.080
There wasn't an ounce that I didn't have a,

200
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.720
not a fiber of my body was afraid at any point. And there's probably six,

201
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:35.280
seven wolves around us within 10 yards all, and they're communicating,

202
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:36.280
they're doing this little like, eh,

203
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.430
so they're talking to each other and then they just moved off.

204
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.030
And it turns out that the, the moose that I was stalking,

205
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.550
I think they were stalking to. Cause there was a big bull that was bedted.

206
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.430
And if they weren't stalking him, um,

207
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.270
cause I think they would've had their hands full with him,

208
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.990
but if they weren't stalking him,

209
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:56.990
then they were just moving in that general direction in a, they were for sure.

210
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.460
Or hunting and I've just, I've always had a, you know,

211
00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:02.180
tremendous respect for them. And I've always spent,

212
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.900
I I've just they've I've always had time with them.

213
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.580
I've always had time with them. I've always been,

214
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.620
I've had Wolf tags in my pocket before, you know, this kind of falls under the,

215
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.180
the same idea of conservation. Like these wolves right here. Right.

216
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.130
I had a Wolf tag in my pocket, had my bow.

217
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.170
I could have arrowed any of these wolves, easily multiples of them probably. Um,

218
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.170
but I didn't want to kill a Wolf here because I, you know,

219
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.050
they know when another Wolf is gone. Right. The thepac knows. And so that,

220
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.650
that weighs on me a little bit. That's me. It's also why, right? Like why kill?

221
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.000
'em like, what is there? Are there too many of them? Well,

222
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.520
which is a real issue. See, that was the thing for me is like, I didn't have,

223
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.920
I didn't do my homework for this area. So I was just like,

224
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.640
I don't know if there's a lot of wolves. I don't know. There's little wolves.

225
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.840
I'm not gonna kill a Wolf. I have no interest in killing Wolf.

226
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.160
I get a Wolf tag with my stuff. Ranun was telling me that there's, uh, one.

227
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.960
<v 1>Of the explorers that traveled the west during Lewis and Clark days,</v>

228
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.400
his favorite meal was Wolf. Hmm. And that Wolf was, uh,

229
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.320
literally his favorite thing to eat.

230
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.200
<v 0>I've never eaten it. Yeah. I wouldve.</v>

231
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.400
<v 1>A real hard time. I just couldn't they're too much like dogs.</v>

232
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.343
They they're,

233
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.950
I think there's some sort of a genetic memory that we have of our relationship

234
00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:18.470
with wolves. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they've, I mean,

235
00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:21.790
they've become dogs and they've become our, you know,

236
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.350
our companions and they they've become a part of our community, you.

237
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.390
<v 0>Know? Yeah. It just wasn't um, you know, it wasn't for me.</v>

238
00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:31.950
And when the pilot picked me up, he asked me that I'd seen any wolves.

239
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:35.460
And I said, yeah, we saw a lot of wolve wolves. And he's like, oh, they're now,

240
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.660
you know, he's not, I'm not telling you he is running surveys here,

241
00:12:38.661 --> 00:12:40.060
but he's like, yeah, there's a lot of wolves here.

242
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:43.100
There's a lot of predation on, on moose here. So we're trying to,

243
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.420
we're trying to really cut the wolves down here, but, and I saw a lot of wolves,

244
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:50.780
but I also saw a ton of moose and I saw a ton of cows and I saw a, uh,

245
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.460
lots of calves and lots of big bulls.

246
00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:56.810
So everything seemed to be functioning in that area. And I also saw a ton of,

247
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.770
um, red backvols right. They look like mice with little short tails.

248
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.890
And I know where there's a lot of red backvols I know the wolves do extremely

249
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:05.724
well eating them.

250
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.850
And so you see these little tunnels mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

251
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.690
And the Tundra and stuff. And um,

252
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.280
I think wolves eat a lot smaller of prey than people think on average Ridge.

253
00:13:14.281 --> 00:13:18.840
Right. We see sensational things of small dogs or, or wolves.

254
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:19.880
And we filmed, I dtunno,

255
00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:24.040
if did you see the Dingo hunt that we filmed in Australia? No. Oh, oh my God.

256
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.480
You guys wanted a Dingo hunting. Nope. We were hunting Buffalo. And um,

257
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.201
while we were hunting,

258
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:34.000
Buffalo dingos just exploded from the Bush and the dingos were pack hunting.

259
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.550
The asiaic water buffalos. Whoa.

260
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.310
Nobody's ever seen it before nobody's ever filmed it.

261
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:43.910
Before we had the Dingo Institute call us immediately from Australia. We had,

262
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.910
um, how big's a Dingo small, tiny dude. So we filmed all this in Australia.

263
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.310
That's literally never been filmed before to our knowledge. Uh,

264
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.590
everyone that we talked to that is Dingo researchers.

265
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:54.950
They wanna know exactly where this was.

266
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.740
Cause he'd never seen his behavior and see this behavior right here.

267
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.940
That was him actually coming in to hunt us.

268
00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:04.220
But you can see the whole crew sat down. Everybody was totally committed.

269
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.460
They're trying to kill that calf right there. And still that calf is monstrous,

270
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:11.980
right? So there's four or five, six of 'em there. And then they chased.

271
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:15.770
They stampied the whole herd directly. Right. Us.

272
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:17.090
That's what you're seeing right here.

273
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.770
And that the herd actually comes to like 15 feet before they split around us.

274
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:24.330
We're all sitting on our butts and then the dingos actually turn their attention

275
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.130
to us. And they come in around us.

276
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.370
You can see us instantly looking at us as a, we a meal, but like wolves,

277
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.410
like grizzly bears, like black bears very quickly. They look at you and they go,

278
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:38.520
yeah, this is not gonna work out for me. Weird. Yeah.

279
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.640
They don't wanna die. You know what I mean? So like, yeah,

280
00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:42.680
nobody had ever seen this, but they.

281
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.720
<v 1>Don't wanna die. Why the are they going after water bottle? I don't know, dude.</v>

282
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:47.280
Those things are, Giant's.

283
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.000
<v 0>Terrible idea. But obviously they're, I don'tunno, if this group has.</v>

284
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
<v 1>Done this before, well, they must have right. They must have been successful on,</v>

285
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.520
on a calf. Yeah. You know,

286
00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.640
and the idea is that they're gonna chase 'em and wear 'em out and that one of

287
00:15:00.641 --> 00:15:02.880
the calves gonna be separated and they're gonna take it down. Yeah.

288
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.280
But they're like 35 pounds. That's so crazy. Yeah.

289
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.160
They're such a small animal and these calves,

290
00:15:08.161 --> 00:15:10.440
even the calves are probably like a hundred pounds. You right. You see how it,

291
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.870
um, bigger, uh, bigger. Yeah. Maybe even 200.

292
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.310
That guy looks Australian as the other guy. Yeah. He's barefoot and everything.

293
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.430
Hey Mike. Yeah. He's I know. Yeah. Look at my hat. &lt;laugh&gt; so yeah, it's.
