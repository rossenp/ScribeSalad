00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 0>Do you think that you could do Tropic thunder today? Would that be possible?</v>

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.940
<v 1>Or you could do it.</v>

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.700
<v 2>When Ben called and said, Hey, I'm doing this thing. And you know, and uh,</v>

4
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.120
I thought, yeah, I'll do that after Ironman. Then I started thinking, this is

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.950
wait a minute. And then I thought, well, hold on, dude, get real here.

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.540
I get to be black for a summer in my mind.

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.820
So there's something in it for me.

8
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.170
And also it was impossible to not have it be an offensive nightmare of a

9
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:43.970
movie. And 90% of my black friends were like, dude,

10
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:47.420
that was great. Again,

11
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.070
not in my defense,

12
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:53.960
but Tropic thunder was about how wrong

13
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.310
that is. Yes.

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.450
<v 0>And it might be the last time we'll ever see a studio,</v>

15
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:04.310
take a chance on a guy wearing blackface and the prolific use of the word

16
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.400
retard. Those are two things.

17
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.090
<v 2>Wait, but the funny thing too,</v>

18
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:12.680
was all the heat got deflected to Ben and simple Jack. Yeah.

19
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.210
That's what people were off about. And I go great.

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.400
<v 0>Did you have anybody that was telling you not to do it with their agents or</v>

21
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:24.650
anyone who was like, my mother was horrifying.

22
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.780
<v 2>Really? Babby I am tanning. I have had bad feeling.</v>

23
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.590
I was like, yeah, me too, mom.
