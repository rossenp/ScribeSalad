00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.780
<v 1>You. Like, if this was like on a spaceship, you would think of like that.</v>

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.230
Look at that. If that was on a spaceship etched into the side of the spaceship,

4
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:13.140
you'd be like, holy, it's a alien language. Look at me.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.820
I don't know what any of those things are.

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.830
I don't know what one of those numbers is.

7
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:21.030
I don't know what the those words are. Those letters. That's an alien language.

8
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.980
That's to me almost more alien than a lot of Asian languages that

9
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:27.180
looks crazy.

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.810
<v 2>Well, that's, that's a reason to kind of doubt that somebody is translating it,</v>

11
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:35.400
right? It's just like, oh, you looked at that jibberish and you saw,

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.533
well, Scott.

13
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.870
<v 1>You know, the whole thing with that is that these ancient, ancient,</v>

14
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:44.010
ancient languages, like all these stories came from these ancient languages.

15
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:48.390
Like, if you go way, way, way back ancient. So Mer like the epic of Gilgamesh,

16
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.000
there's all these Noah's Ark similarities. It's all,

17
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.880
there's a lot of stuff in all these ancient stories.

18
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.960
That's all probably points to some real that happened for sure.

19
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.711
But along the way,

20
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:02.190
just like what you're talking about with social justice warriors and how it,

21
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.050
they break, they behave like it's a religion.

22
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.180
There's like a natural compulsion for people to be on a group and have that

23
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:10.770
group have a very clear idea.

24
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.950
<v 2>Work their way up to atheism if they want it. Cause that's like almost a luxury,</v>

25
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:18.510
I think. Yeah. I think you're right. I don't know how to just, uh,

26
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.470
I'll tell you what I will say. The DMT shape. Uh,

27
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.150
I did get like more of a, uh, oh yeah. There's more than this.

28
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.110
<v 1>Something else there.</v>

29
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.150
<v 2>And, and it's crazy because you know, I read about that in high school.</v>

30
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.060
I read some more about that guy that, uh, is the big DMT.

31
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.860
<v 1>Guy. Terence McKenna. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.580
<v 2>Cause I think he projects a lot of his own horse into it, but yeah, that stuff.</v>

33
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.610
<v 1>Does. Or the mechanic.</v>

34
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.360
<v 2>Just let me tell you when I,</v>

35
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.200
I never felt a thing that felt so much like not making me hallucinate,

36
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.040
but like it was taking away a hallucination and that is such,

37
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.950
there's something so terrifying about that, but it also like, wow, that's great.

38
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.220
Like, and uh, it, you just,

39
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:02.400
you feel like there has to be just based on this. You would say,

40
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.750
even if it's just shaking your head, you're like,

41
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:04.584
why would that even be in my head?

42
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.071
<v 1>It's,</v>

43
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:09.810
it's entirely possible that whatever the consciousness is can pass from this

44
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:11.460
stage into another stage.

45
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.990
And the only reason why I would hesitate to say that's exactly what happens is

46
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:17.490
because there's no proof one way or another.

47
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.740
<v 2>It's all that pineal gland is not proven. They don't know that DMT comes in now.</v>

48
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.570
<v 1>No, no, they do. Yeah, they do. Now. Yeah. The Cottonwood research foundation,</v>

49
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.370
they did a series of tests with rats and they prove that live rats have a

50
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.170
DMT produced by the pineal gland.

51
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.390
Now it doesn't necessarily mean that humans do too,

52
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.150
but they're pretty sure that it doesn't know that your,

53
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.870
your lungs produce it and your liver produces it. That's a fact really? Yes.

54
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.850
So your body's producing DMT a hundred percent.

55
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.400
<v 2>Did you know that? Um, or did you like, uh,</v>

56
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.550
like those HP Lovecraft kind of horror stories? I love those.

57
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.280
And there's a movie made I want to, but it's all about his pineal gland.

58
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:56.070
He's taking something makes his pineal gland swell up. Which one is that? Well,

59
00:02:56.071 --> 00:03:01.060
movies. It stars the guy for me. Animator. It's not, it's not ReAnimator.

60
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 1>I've, I'm, I'm feeling it now. I kind.</v>

61
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.460
<v 2>Of remember what you're talking about.</v>

62
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.800
I'll tell you the creepy thing of DMP has a creep. I thought the creepy,

63
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.100
because I was totally worth doing, but the thing that's, you know,

64
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.290
whatever people say, they meet entities. Right.

65
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.480
But I don't know if that is meeting entity,

66
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.850
but I'll tell you the thing that just sticks with me that I'm like,

67
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.850
how in the is that possible? Is the shapes that you,

68
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.410
that I could say I was well aware that they were a bit more than three

69
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.840
dimensional shapes. And it's so crazy to look at that and perceive it.

70
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.570
And I'm like, how on earth could I perceive this shape?

71
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.720
And when I came and you can't Brent, come back with it. Like, you know what?

72
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:38.110
You know.

73
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.080
<v 1>You see it though in someone's art. Like have you ever seen Alex Grey's art?</v>

74
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.520
Yeah. No, you haven't seen it pull up, uh, Alex Gray.

75
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:47.350
He's a psychedelic artists. I mean,

76
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.820
all of his stuff is basically tryptamine based art [inaudible].

77
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.570
<v 2>Oh.</v>

78
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.550
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no. He's brilliant. His stuff's, his stuff's amazing.</v>

79
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.500
<v 2>For tool.</v>

80
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.550
<v 1>That's one of them. But yeah, he draws the covers for tool albums.</v>

81
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.110
There's a ton of 'em like that one, that one specific that is BMT. That's DMT.

82
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.460
That is DMT. That is hardcore, hardcore DMT. When you do DMT,

83
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:16.630
you see that and you see that in a way where it's so much more

84
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.300
spectacular than any, anything you ever see,

85
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.590
normal consciousness is your body. They're like, are you a body thing?

86
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.630
You're not thinking of your mind.

87
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.090
<v 2>You're you're saying.</v>

88
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.923
<v 1>You look around.</v>

89
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.030
<v 2>Dude. If you open your eyes, here's, what's crazy because,</v>

90
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.420
so if you close your eyes, it's like, they're open somewhere else.

91
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.530
And then you open your eyes, you see reality overlayed over this house.

92
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.650
<v 1>Influence the Egyptians, click on the one, your cursor's on.</v>

93
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.230
Tell me that didn't influence the Egyptians.

94
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.300
<v 2>This painting, or this, this, these.</v>

95
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.320
<v 1>Kind of trip to mean.</v>

96
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.540
<v 2>Images. DMT.</v>

97
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.410
<v 1>A hundred percent. Yeah,</v>

98
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:54.730
there was one of the things that John Anthony West did was he was going over

99
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.990
that's temple in man. The temple in man is one of the structures it's in, um,

100
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.650
in, uh, Egypt. And it,

101
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.860
it shows different parts of it are supposed to represent different quarters of

102
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.930
the body, like different shockers of the body.

103
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.270
And that there was some evidence that the eye of Horus is really the

104
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:18.130
pineal gland. And that's what that, that symbol is like, see if Google,

105
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.570
uh, pineal gland, eye of Horus.

106
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.010
They think that they're, they're so similar in the way they're shaped.

107
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.430
It's entirely possible that that's what, that's a very alternative thing.

108
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.800
But look how it looks, how the thing looks on the right,

109
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:36.640
the actual pineal gland and look at the eye on the left. Wow. Yeah.

110
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.670
See that wing off the side and the way it drops down,

111
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:42.550
right from the eyeball boy, that's similar.

112
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.650
It's entirely possible that they figured that out somewhere along the line,

113
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.540
that through yoga breathing methods or some sort of psychedelic drugs,

114
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.140
they found that they were achieving a hallucinogenic state and they were able to

115
00:05:56.141 --> 00:06:00.890
somehow, or another isolate where that state is being initiated.

116
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.220
And if it's being initiated and dodged, honestly, by your body,

117
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.060
like through psychedelic breathing, that's probably where it's being produced.

118
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.850
<v 2>Now, listen, I don't want to sound like an Amy Schumer defender,</v>

119
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:14.930
but that looked coincidentally to me parallel. Look,

120
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.850
I think certain patterns were close.

121
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.080
<v 1>Over and over again that, but that pattern is pretty close. You might be right.</v>

122
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.160
It might be coincidental.

123
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.040
But the fact that it drop a straight line drops down right before the,

124
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.400
I show it again. The straight line drops down right below the eye. And then the.

125
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.030
<v 2>Other thing was to the left Egypt.</v>

126
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.140
<v 1>They did, they did surgery on people in Egypt. See it.</v>

127
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.970
<v 2>Well, first of all, I thought Egypt thought the mind was in the heart.</v>

128
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.220
And that's why they pulled the useless brain out through the nose.

129
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.970
When they mummified you. Like you're telling me that their intent,

130
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.790
you know what I mean? Like how does the embalming techniques we have it.

131
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:50.090
That doesn't mean that it kept no, they didn't look.

132
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.660
<v 1>Well. I'm sure that they didn't know everything about the human body, the way.</v>

133
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.250
<v 2>They attach significance to something in the brain. If they don't think that.</v>

134
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.970
<v 1>I think through psychedelic drugs,</v>

135
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.370
I think when they were doing these heavy psychedelic drugs,

136
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:04.880
which by the way were absolutely being used by then, by tons of people.

137
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.640
<v 2>Beliefs, listen to the cause. Dude, this is the thing that really blew my mind.</v>

138
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.720
Cause I was looking, you don't want to even.

139
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.670
<v 1>Believe rumors. That's what's going on again. No.</v>

140
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.550
<v 2>I saw, I looked, do you ever look at somebody while you're on DMT?</v>

141
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.370
<v 1>I think smoke it. No, I've always kept my eyes closed. Okay.</v>

142
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.213
<v 2>Well,</v>

143
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.050
two times close my eyes and one time over my eyes and look at somebody and they

144
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:25.490
had six arms like a Hindu.

145
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.320
<v 1>It was just.</v>

146
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.060
<v 2>Saying, I might've been telling you this at the comedy.</v>

147
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.070
<v 1>Store told me at the great room.</v>

148
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.640
<v 2>What is it? Your time perception gets broken down and that's the craziness.</v>

149
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.070
And so then motion looks like sick.

150
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.653
<v 1>Like Shiva.</v>

151
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.690
<v 2>It looked like a Hindu thing. And I'm like, wow, I imagine beyond that stuff.</v>

152
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:42.890
And you see something, I mean,

153
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:46.010
it looked that looked to me so much like a vision from the intake,

154
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:47.510
those six RM kind of gods.

155
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.320
<v 1>Collect that kind of art, like Buddhas and like that. Like this kind of.</v>

156
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.900
Cause I saw this, I saw this image, this exact image. I mean,

157
00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:00.770
this has a third eye and everything. The sculptor made this for me.

158
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:04.190
I don't remember his name. Yeah. I wish I could remember right now, but I don't.

159
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.421
Um, but yeah,

160
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.770
sculptor made that for me based on this vision that I had a high on DMT.

161
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.230
I saw an infinite number of those really.

162
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.490
I saw one hovering here and then in every direction, out from him,

163
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:20.000
there was an infinite number of those and they were all hovering and vibrating

164
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:22.430
around me. So it's like fractal. Is it like fractal?

165
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:23.270
It's a hundred percent fact.

166
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.710
<v 2>Geometric. What do you think? What do you think having done it?</v>

167
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:32.060
Like what do you think? Like, uh, uh, what do you think now of the MTA after?

168
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.120
You know, I, I, I think I saw just a couple of things,

169
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:37.970
but I don't know how long ago they were of you talking about it with people,

170
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:42.170
but you ha what's your opinion of it now as like a, you know what you're seeing.

171
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.220
<v 1>It could be anything. I mean, it definitely could be some sort of, uh,</v>

172
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.260
insane hijacking of your sensory nervous system produces

173
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.740
this spectacular psychedelic effect. That's so profound,

174
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:57.240
the solution to Janie hallucinogenic effect.

175
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.510
That's so profound that it literally is like a transcendent experience and

176
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:02.130
changes your life. It's totally possible.

177
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.500
It's totally possible that it's just a chemical thing.

178
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.640
What's also POS also saw so possible is that life itself,

179
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.910
that whatever the life is, and especially whatever the intelligent life is,

180
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:15.750
is not understood what consciousness is, is not understood. And the,

181
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.720
this idea that things can only exist in this realm.

182
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.730
That's not proven also the fact that when those quantum physicists guys start

183
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:26.160
breaking down the nature of reality and they come up with,

184
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.140
I don't know how the they do this. I'm just talking out of my.

185
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.220
But they come up with the idea that there's 11 dimensions and that they

186
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:36.420
literally, I mean, and this is all changing and constantly evolving and moving.

187
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.770
And they're constantly adding to this.

188
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.150
It is entirely possible that there's a bunch of other that's around us all the

189
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:46.920
time. That's just not here and we don't have access to it. And when you do DMT,

190
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.870
womp, you go into that other place.

191
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.760
<v 2>It unsettling, dude. It's like, it's not like you're going, it's like the here.</v>

192
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.470
<v 1>That's why you as a skeptic, it's very important to hear from you like a guy,</v>

193
00:09:58.471 --> 00:09:59.304
like.

194
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.650
<v 2>Yeah, I'll tell you what I'll because I drew a diagram of it.</v>

195
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.630
This is what I felt. This is what it feels like.

196
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:07.200
If you ever do it like this little point, let's say this little point is you.

197
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.740
This is what I felt like. And these, these lines I drew, that's like space.

198
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.890
You're this little point that gets stabbed into space time and all this.

199
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.070
This is all the that makes you like it forms a point.

200
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.560
It's like closing your eyes and looking at all of,

201
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.150
all of the that's been cross section of your being like everything being focused

202
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:27.390
into making. If you could like, just reverse look at it. It.

203
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.290
<v 1>I just feel like it's lessons. I always feel like it's the lessons.</v>

204
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.230
I always feel like it's time to go to school, sit down, sit down.

205
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.480
Here's what's going on. The one of the last ones,

206
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:39.930
more profound ones was a bunch of gestures that were all giving me the finger.

207
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.510
They're all circuit around me. Like giving me the finger. Like.

208
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.520
<v 2>That was your Twitters.</v>

209
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.930
<v 1>No, you know what to teach you about Twitter. It's teaching. If you're tense,</v>

210
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.220
if you're tense negatively to this gesture,

211
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.620
giving you the finger, like, how do you feel of yourself?

212
00:10:55.621 --> 00:11:00.360
Are you in constant defensive mode? And then when I sort of relaxed myself,

213
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.930
they started wagging their finger back and forth. Like, yep. That's it.

214
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:07.560
That's it. That's cool. Very, very strange. The, the, the,

215
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.610
these things that you see, but you can't define are constantly changing.

216
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.310
So if you try to like say, oh, it looked like a gesture.

217
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.330
It probably did for a few seconds, for a few seconds, it looked like a gesture.

218
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:20.670
And then it imploded and became stars.

219
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.430
And then it sucked in and became geometric patterns.

220
00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:27.990
And it became neon colored worms that were making love to each other and a giant

221
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:32.160
infinite bundle of yarn. Like it becomes weirder and weirder all the time.

222
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.620
It's hard to remember when you're done. It's almost impossible.

223
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:36.000
Even me saying I'm kind of full.

224
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.833
<v 2>Of. It's.</v>

225
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.960
<v 1>Kind of full of because I don't totally remember what I saw.</v>

226
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.530
I remember what I remember to write down. I remember what I repeated.

227
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:48.330
So I'm like going back on like my repeated versions of what I

228
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:51.360
saw, but I just, I remember like flashes of the intense,

229
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.950
profound nature of the experience is there emotions.

230
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.570
<v 3>To it? Like you're talking about.</v>

231
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.430
<v 2>And when I came out of it,</v>

232
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:01.120
the first time I did on new year's the first time I did it, I w and I, and I,

233
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.430
I guess I was like weeping, but when I came out of it,

234
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.990
because you just suddenly are awake. And I, I had, like, I was so out of it,

235
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:11.590
it was like, not, I w I went from weeping, like, oh, Hey, what's up? Like,

236
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.980
and because I had been staring some crazy thing that would like,

237
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:17.320
look so beautiful to me, but, but it was like,

238
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.330
it was like coming out of a dream, I guess, almost.

239
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.870
<v 3>What's that mechanic quote that I think would I be scared of his unearned</v>

240
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:25.810
wisdom? I think we kind of said something like, be like,

241
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.110
be wary of honor and wisdom where I don't know if I can handle looking at

242
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:30.070
something that intense.

243
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.580
<v 2>I was really in a low feeling state when I did it and I didn't give a.</v>

244
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.870
So I wanted to do it.

245
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.550
<v 1>You, you pick up the slack, you know, that unearned wisdom thing.</v>

246
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:40.720
I think I know what he's saying.

247
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.700
And I think there's a real problem with people acting profound when they just

248
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:47.590
learned something an hour ago. I'm not.

249
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.990
<v 2>A showman. No, but there.</v>

250
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.370
<v 1>Is a thing that people enjoy doing. And it's like,</v>

251
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.700
like jizzing out their knowledge.

252
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.300
And a lot of that is honored knowledge.

253
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.290
Like there's a lot of people that don't really have a full on, including me.

254
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.630
<v 2>Walls are so full and not.</v>

255
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.220
<v 1>Having a full understanding of the topic at hand life. Just GEs it out.</v>

256
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.220
But you look for sure.

257
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:17.470
You learn a lot about yourself when you do those experiences.

258
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.550
I learned a lot about myself, learned a lot about how I interact with people.

259
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.170
I saw negative thoughts,

260
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.090
like expressed as like this dark green and black twisted

261
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.600
sort of pattern. And then when my thoughts went positive,

262
00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:35.320
it blossomed like the most beautiful flowers you can imagine. It was crazy.

263
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:39.670
It was literally a lesson in thinking toxically. And then,

264
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.510
and this is probably like 2008 ish somewhere around then.

265
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.610
That w that was this particular experience that literally changed who I am

266
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.250
literally changed. How I talked to people,

267
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.640
literally changed how I feel about people watching a negative thought,

268
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:58.120
being expressed as, as dark pattern. And then the positive thought, just,

269
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.600
I just let it go. Like, oh, I see, I see I'm doing it to myself then boom.

270
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.080
And then he can just relax and enjoy, like, this is so beautiful.

271
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:06.880
And because you're looking at something so beautiful,

272
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.520
that feeling of seeing beauty makes it more beautiful and just getting more and

273
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.800
like tears are rolling down my eyes and misses stunning, stunning experiences.

274
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.550
<v 2>How does it guide? It's easier to do that now besides that,</v>

275
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:19.590
but I know what you mean.

276
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.460
<v 1>I wish I could remember seeing it though.</v>

277
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.790
I remember it happened and I remember the dark green and black, but it's,

278
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:27.970
so I remember so little of what I actually saw,

279
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.290
it's a total recreation in my mind, which is a real problem with memory.

280
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.040
So real problem with regular memory, forget about something as spectacularly,

281
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:39.790
unique and odd as a psychedelic experience, but just regular memory. I mean,

282
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.550
I try to think of what I did yesterday. I know what I did.

283
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.670
<v 2>Do you ever get the information late? Like the last time I did it,</v>

284
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.570
this is what really blew me away is because my was saying I was going,

285
00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:52.750
I won't forget. And by the way, I forgot immediately. It's like a joke.

286
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.950
<v 1>You're supposed to talk into a microphone, like talk into a recorder,</v>

287
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.680
like right away when you get out and then try to decipher that little cell.

288
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.310
<v 2>Talk. I mean, usually I feel like I can't talk.</v>

289
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.450
<v 1>But as soon as you can know,</v>

290
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.640
which you do is just use the voice app on your phone.

291
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.810
And as soon as you can talk, hit record and just ramble, first of all,

292
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:14.600
you're going to go, oh my God, I'm a moron because it's going to sound.

293
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.580
If you're sober, it's going to sound so.

294
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.660
<v 2>Stupid is my face. Like I lost the inner journey and battle like, yeah,</v>

295
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.240
on the inside, on the outside, you're just puking and projectile

296
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.780
shivering like an idiot. That's a metaphor for Twitter.
