WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.040
<v 0>Just twisted this around.</v>

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.320
You said that she was correct and apologized &lt;laugh&gt; to all those yoga teachers

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.440
out there. their students.

4
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.840
<v 1>No, it's a violation. If you're a guru and anything,</v>

5
00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:13.720
that's a teacher and below you're using that. You're manipulating that person.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.320
<v 0>Okay. But wasn't that like a big part of like, uh,</v>

7
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.360
undergraduate students and professors back in the day.

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.950
&lt;affirmative&gt; they can't do that anymore. Yeah. That.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.310
<v 1>Was a big thing. No, in my high school,</v>

10
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.670
like the basketball teacher ended up marrying like his best, uh,

11
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.510
girl basketball player. Hey. And you know, happy ending. Yeah. Worked out. Oh.

12
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.750
<v 0>Well how old was she and him?</v>

13
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.230
<v 1>He was probably 30 something and she was 17. Whoa. When did they get married?</v>

14
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.980
Playing basketball. &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know. After they get,

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.780
they hook up after school. Uh, but during school, no,

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.420
apparently it was duringing and then they ended up, uh.

17
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.100
<v 0>Was it legal then? No, it was on no, no, no, no, no.</v>

18
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.580
In many states it probably was legal. I don't 17 in Jersey. Yes.

19
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.180
I guarantee it was what year?

20
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.170
<v 1>19 85, 86 guarantee. It was, you could 17 was legal. Yeah. I bet.</v>

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.090
<v 0>It was legal. Really? I bets, I bet 16 was legal, right?</v>

22
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.490
<v 1>Yeah. In the last states.</v>

23
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.490
It's not to say that there can't be a happy ending when somebody is the teacher

24
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.690
or the, or the guru.

25
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770
<v 0>Oh, I'm' on your side. I, I mean, it's definitely a violation,</v>

26
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.530
but it is a manipulation. Yeah. What's the age of consent in 1980,

27
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.970
no New Jersey. Age of 16 years old.

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.200
<v 1>16 &lt;Affirmative&gt; yep. Wow. I could have hit on this.</v>

29
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.600
<v 0>Crew. Okay. But hold on a second consent for sexual conduct, 16,</v>

30
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.600
this applies to both heterosexual and homosexual conduct as a general matter.

31
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.520
This means that a person who is 16 years old can generally consent to have sex

32
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:42.480
with any adult. And this is in 2018 that's today. That's today. So,

33
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990
so here's the thing. How crazy. So here, here's the thing, like, you know,

34
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:49.230
this Asia arentto thing, you know, this things going on right now. Yes. Yes.

35
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:53.710
So this 17 year old kid, right? When, uh, he had sex with her,

36
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:54.670
it was in California.

37
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.830
So he's saying it's sexual assault because she had sex with him.

38
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.940
And then she got Tony borte to pay this kid off

39
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.660
300 plus thousand dollars to shut his mouth.

40
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.540
And then it came out that she was a hypocrite because she seduced this kid and

41
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.941
him.

42
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:18.420
And she had played his mom in a movie 10 years prior when he was only seven,

43
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.060
which is really kind of crazy his pictures of her and the kid when the kid was

44
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.050
up when like a little kid. Oh geez.

45
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.010
And she stayed close to him and called him like her son.

46
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.650
And he would call her mom and stuff like that.

47
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.570
And then they got together and she lied about it and said she didn't him.

48
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.610
And then pictures came out of her, in bed with him.

49
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.010
And then her friends released text messages.

50
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.210
Was she she's a monster. Was.

51
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.920
<v 1>It, was it way? Was he of legal age when they had sex?</v>

52
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.160
<v 0>This is my point. He was 17 at the time.</v>

53
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.480
So it would've been totally legal if this happened in New Jersey,

54
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.960
but it happened in California,

55
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.400
but this is all going on while she was making a big deal of Harvey Weinstein,

56
00:02:55.401 --> 00:03:00.080
having sex with her when she was 22, like Jesus Christ. Like that was hypocris.

57
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.160
I know, you know, the whole thing's crazy. But my point is, first of all,

58
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.240
let's be honest about that situation. I mean, seventeens,

59
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.520
he's gonna be okay. The I'm just saying, even if it's illegal. Yeah.

60
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.710
It's just not the same four boys. It is not the same. No.

61
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:23.070
Should she have done it? Yeah, probably not. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

62
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.390
Probably not. Should she be locked up in a cage for 10 years from doing that?

63
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.990
No, she's a freak. All right. That lady's a freak.

64
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.350
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So she was, he was 17, but she's more.</v>

65
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.870
<v 0>Guilty of being a hypocrite than anything.</v>

66
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.620
<v 1>Did she stay in touch with him all those years from she was playing the mom.</v>

67
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.593
Yes.

68
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.780
<v 0>The real creepy pictures.</v>

69
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:44.980
Her in the movie with him-huh when he was like a little kid Uh-huh &lt;affirmative&gt;

70
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.720
were like, oh,

71
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.460
but it's not as creepy as Woody Allen when he had his daughter sitting on his

72
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.300
lap. And then 10 years later,

73
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.900
that same daughter is holding his hand as his girlfriend in a,

74
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.500
in the front row of a basketball game.

75
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.380
<v 1>Yeah. That's kind of weird. &lt;laugh&gt; I think that's.</v>

76
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.530
<v 0>A little weird way. Creepy beer. &lt;laugh&gt; that's way in, you know,</v>

77
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.530
that is so weird. I don't know if there's even a reason to make that comparison,

78
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.290
but, uh, my point is that kid would've no case at all.

79
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.130
If this was in New Jersey, right. It was in New Jersey,

80
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.530
which I don't think he should have a.

81
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.330
<v 1>Case. Does he, is he prosecuting like, or he, he.</v>

82
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.040
<v 0>Apparently threatened to go public with it and he wanted money and they gave him</v>

83
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:25.320
money. Anthony Bourdain did. Yeah. And.

84
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.160
<v 1>Gave him a lot, 300.</v>

85
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.000
<v 0>$380,000. Oh my God.</v>

86
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.040
<v 1>And even that, after he got paid, he comes.</v>

87
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.760
<v 0>Out. That is the most expensive Dick that lady will ever get &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

88
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.720
<v 1>Then he comes.</v>

89
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.440
<v 0>Out, he comes, it came out anyway. I don't know why it came out.</v>

90
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.110
I don't know who released it. Harvey Weinstein. Somebody, somebody released it.

91
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.983
I don't know what happened,

92
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.630
but what they're basically showing is that th this whole

93
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.150
thing, you know, of her attacking, being attacked by Harvey Weinstein,

94
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.670
it's complicated. Right? Maybe he did exactly what she said he did.

95
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.510
It's possible, but she clearly is deceptive.

96
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.140
Definitely lied about this kid. Yeah. See,

97
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.940
the problem is the age of consent being 17. If, if it was 18 or if it was,

98
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.500
you know, if he was 18 rather, or if it was like a New Jersey where at 16,

99
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.180
there's no case. And she just a young kid. And I'm just gonna be honest.

100
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.500
The only thing that's creepy is that they had this sort of,

101
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.330
of mom son thing going on, where they talked about each other as mom and son.

102
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.770
Yeah. That's weird. If she was just a hot 35 year old who had sex with a,

103
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.530
a handsome 17 year old boy, right?

104
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.010
<v 1>It's seventeens a that's a man.</v>

105
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.290
<v 0>It's not the same thing. It's not the same thing.</v>

106
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.690
If it was a 35 year old man and a 17 year old girl, she directed the movie too.

107
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:41.730
Does that change anything?

108
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.760
<v 1>I don't know. She directed the movie movie. The new one. Like, no, no.</v>

109
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.760
<v 0>The movie 10 years ago when he was a 17 year old or a seven year old brother.</v>

110
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.800
Mm. Yeah. I don't know, man. You know, my, my, she was 37 when she was seven,

111
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.600
17, sorry, 30. She was 37 when he was 17. Yeah, she did.

112
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.200
<v 1>She didn't make a move. When, when he was seven though.</v>

113
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.200
<v 0>No, she was waited till he was 17. She's a good person. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

114
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.400
<v 1>She's.</v>

115
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.600
<v 0>An, she, she got close to the wire. She's like,</v>

116
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.080
I can't hold on anymore enough.

117
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.080
<v 1>Already. It's will you move to New Jersey? I won't. Well, they just.</v>

118
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.310
<v 0>Get over here. Here's the issue I do. Don't I,</v>

119
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.950
I just don't think it's the same thing now.

120
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.950
I think the only thing she's really guilty of here is hypocrisy and deception.

121
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.430
I don't think she's guilty of a sex crime,

122
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.270
even though she technically is in my mind. I mean, maybe I'm am I a sexist?

123
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.030
I don't know if I am I'm sexist against men when I just think,

124
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.580
I think the guy's okay. I, I just don't, I don't buy that. He was so damaged,

125
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.980
but if he was not, cause he was that damaged from her, he would've been da,

126
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.580
he would've been damaged from a girl who was his age too. Who him.

127
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.780
And then didn't call him again. Right.

128
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.500
That's the thing that' mean that's just emotions. That's not a crime. You know.

129
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.020
<v 1>You hear, you hear this argument. It's like, well,</v>

130
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.260
a boy can be affected for sure. Everyone can be affected. Yeah. And when you're,

131
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.460
if you're not a crime, you know,

132
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.250
in some of these instances where the teacher sleeps with the kid and right.

133
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:04.050
And it's a boy and he is 14 and people are like, oh, come on. He,

134
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.770
he would love it. He's he's a four, not 14. You're still don't know who you are.

135
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:09.810
You're still mixed.

136
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.650
<v 0>Up. And again, we're back's to teacher, student dynamic. Yes. It's a different.</v>

137
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.530
<v 1>Situation. She's.</v>

138
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.250
<v 0>Manipulating you. Right? So the question is,</v>

139
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.840
is this dynamic equal to the teacher student?

140
00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:23.040
Because she was the director and she played his mother and they,

141
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.720
she clearly had some sort of a maternal love, uh,

142
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.160
like sort of relationship with him early on. And then it became sexual later.

143
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.040
But then she says he jumped her. She says the horny kid jumped me.

144
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:38.830
That's what she said, her texts to her friend when she's being a honest.

145
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.630
Oh really? Yeah. So maybe he did,

146
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:43.470
maybe he was in love and pining for her the whole time. Yeah.

147
00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:47.230
Maybe that's one of the reasons why he came out and wanted money in the first

148
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:47.431
place.

149
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:49.750
Cause he trying to get back at her because she didn't wanna have anything to do

150
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:54.150
with him anymore. And maybe they had a couple of drinks together and she,

151
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.310
you know, she just didn't know what to do when he started making moves on her.

152
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.820
Mm-hmm and so she because she's crazy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's possible too.

153
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.700
Yeah. I mean, what is a, is it a crime? I mean, what, what you're telling,

154
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:09.460
you're talking about a crime where if it was 200 days later, it's not a crime.

155
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.100
Like really, is he gonna learn a lot in 200 days? Well, the law is.

156
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.140
<v 1>The law. Joe, the law is the law. Mr. Drag, over there, you gotta pay.</v>

157
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.610
You gotta, you know, the law laws are on the books for a reason, Joe.

158
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.090
And then law says 17, doesn't say 16 and a half. It says 17 for a reason.

159
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.650
Mm.

160
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.530
<v 0>Johnny lawyer over here. &lt;laugh&gt; this.</v>

161
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.850
<v 1>Guy. Well, it really that's what it comes down to it. Yeah. It's like we,</v>

162
00:08:32.851 --> 00:08:35.970
because it's so gray and because there's so, so many things that could happen,

163
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.130
you really have to be come down to well, is there a lot? They.

164
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.400
<v 0>Should have to pull your pants out. How much Prebes you got?</v>

165
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.400
Let me see what you got. How bigs your Dick. &lt;laugh&gt; you're full grown.

166
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:47.680
What the out here. That's.

167
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.513
<v 1>Not fair. Oh, I.</v>

168
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.120
<v 0>Pretty lady banged. You. Iremember.</v>

169
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.240
<v 1>This. I had a friend of mine in who grew hair when he was like 12.</v>

170
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.480
He was the Hart little Italian kid. He had a mustache full beard at 13.

171
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.280
I'm sure his pubes were gigantic. Good. &lt;laugh&gt;.

172
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.080
<v 0>Legal. Asiagento go that guy. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

173
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.493
<v 1>He couldn't help it.</v>

174
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.080
He would get a haircut and would grow back by the time he got in the car &lt;laugh&gt;

175
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.680
he was just Italian.

176
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.950
<v 0>Yeah. Um, it's very complicated. You know, the thing about her too is, you know,</v>

177
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:23.510
she had a consensual sexual relationship with Harvey Weinstein after the alleged

178
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.990
incident where he ate her pusity and she didn't want him to.

179
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.110
<v 1>Well, that's like the Cosby thing. They keep coming back.</v>

180
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.350
There was a couple that came back and, and it's.

181
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.230
<v 0>Like, you don't, but wait a minute.</v>

182
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:35.380
Were they aware that he drugged them the first time?

183
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.220
<v 1>I don't know the details. Right? It sounded like it. Yeah.</v>

184
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:42.020
It sounded like they knew something was weird, but then they came back anyway.

185
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.780
But again, you.

186
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.500
<v 0>Don't exonerate someone from a rape just because after the rape you're.</v>

187
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.580
<v 1>Friendly with 'em. Right. Because you, you know, it's a big mental impact.</v>

188
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.420
You don't know what's going on with these. Well, not.

189
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.010
<v 0>Just that,</v>

190
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.810
it's some people they want to me mitigate the effects of being raped by turning

191
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.890
into something different.

192
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.090
So they like maybe would establish a consensual relationship with the person

193
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:03.924
after they raped them.

194
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.490
<v 1>To try and take their power back a little.</v>

195
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.090
<v 0>Well, not just that self, self to self relieve themselves of the,</v>

196
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.250
the feeling of being a victim.

197
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:12.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like may almost make it consensual. Yeah.

198
00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:15.970
There's like a weird psychological dynamic that you and I will never know,

199
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.320
understand as men. Yeah. We'll never understand it. No, cause it's not the same.

200
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.320
It's just not the same. No.

201
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.000
<v 1>It's not. So if she went back, you know, with Harvey and who, you know, like if.</v>

202
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.480
<v 0>A woman can't tell comes over your house, right. Okay. If you're a single guy,</v>

203
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:28.800
am.

204
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800
<v 1>I in a cabin? Is it.</v>

205
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.480
<v 0>A little cabin? Yeah. A little tiny 320 &lt;laugh&gt; it's you're in big bear.</v>

206
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:36.360
You I'm in big bear youre wearing flannels and you're cutting wood. Okay.

207
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.310
And a girl comes over and she sucks your Dick against your will.

208
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:44.150
Uh-huh you like, don't stop. I can't believe you're doing this. God. And,

209
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:48.790
and then once it's over, you're like, well, I don't wanna feel like I got raped.

210
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.510
I'm just gonna establish a, a relationship with this lady. Right.

211
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:54.830
People would be like, shut the up, Tom, Papa up. Get outta here. What.

212
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.663
<v 1>Was that? Michael Douglas?</v>

213
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.860
<v 0>The difference is because you're a guy, right?</v>

214
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:02.380
So you're not worried about your physical safety, right? This is the real issue.

215
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.460
<v 1>Physical safety. I can't get pregnant. Right.</v>

216
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.220
<v 0>I used to work out at this gay gym.</v>

217
00:11:06.221 --> 00:11:08.900
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I used to work out at a golds gym on Cole and I say gay

218
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.620
gym, cuz it was just like a lot of gay guys,

219
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.980
like really obvious over tan, you know,

220
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.770
gay guys with like super thin tank tops and giant muscles

221
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.010
and combat boots and real aggressive. Yeah. Leather, uh,

222
00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:28.370
like paper, boy hats on mother working out. I had a friend gay,

223
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.890
but my point is, go ahead while I was in there working out. Yeah.

224
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:32.530
These guys had hit on you. Right. And,

225
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:37.210
and you'd feel like guys were looking at you and hitting on you and it made you

226
00:11:37.211 --> 00:11:41.600
uncomfortable. Well, welcome to being a woman. Yeah. But not even really,

227
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:45.120
because I could those guys up. Right. So I wasn't worried,

228
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.920
like if a guy tries to go to the parking lot, I'd be like, Hey dude, we're go.

229
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.160
This is gonna get violent. Yeah. Don't try, stop trying to me. Right. You know,

230
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:54.720
like I can actually you up. Whereas if I'm a girl,

231
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.920
I have to worry that I'm fumbling for my keys and this guy's behind me in the

232
00:11:58.921 --> 00:12:01.720
parking lot. Yeah. And they wanna push me into the car and take my pants off.

233
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.480
This is a real concern for women. Yeah. That men don't have.

234
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.680
So our ideas of what it would be like to be in a non-consensual relationship

235
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.480
with a woman where she sucks your Dick against your will is just not comparable.

236
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.950
<v 1>It's a great point.</v>

237
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.030
I mean that's when that Michael Douglas movie came out and it was the same

238
00:12:17.031 --> 00:12:20.830
thing. It was the reverse. Sh she, I forget which movie it was. He,

239
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.870
she goes down on him and he's like, no, stop it. It's a work relationship.

240
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:28.550
And he's like, stop don't fatal attraction. No, it wasn't fatal attraction.

241
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.630
It wasn't behind the candle Abra. It was, uh,

242
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.180
it was another movie and it became like a thing. It became like a,

243
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:39.100
like a joke because disclosure as a disclosure,

244
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.660
because as a and who was the star? Demi Moore. Demi.

245
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.860
<v 0>Moore. That's hilarious.</v>

246
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.460
<v 1>Yeah. So she goes down on him and everyone.</v>

247
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:49.140
They were trying to make the case that it could happen to a man too.

248
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.260
And shut up. The culture was like, no, yes, thank.

249
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.930
<v 0>God. Here it is. Yeah. She's a predator. Yeah. She's a predator.</v>

250
00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.010
I't believe this. Shut the. And he's up like get off of who wrote that?

251
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.410
A fantastic sex thriller masterfully done. That's fake news.

252
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.850
&lt;laugh&gt; who wrote that? Well.

253
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.730
<v 1>Good for them putting it out there and giving it a try.</v>

254
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.170
<v 0>I like how they always have that like w CN TV,</v>

255
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.400
some you've never heard of WW O R TV. Get't the outta here.

256
00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:20.760
What is that? Like? They they' just now forget it for any quote whatsoever.

257
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.800
So they just take some wonky quote from the some Boisey news station. Right.

258
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:28.920
Some guy's drunk when he writes that he's barely paying attention, but now it's.

259
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.240
<v 1>Just someone with a blog. It's like Don's movie.</v>

260
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.510
Hu &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; he loved. I've got.
