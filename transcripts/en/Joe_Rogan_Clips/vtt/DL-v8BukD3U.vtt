00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 3>Yeah. So it's Vince had the original likeness and then, you know,</v>

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.800
after a couple of years, it, it had kind of taken over.

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:15.480
Like I lived that like everywhere I went, I was always dressed in black.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.290
You know, what people saw on TV. They pretty much saw in real life.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.010
So if you went.

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.880
<v 0>Out to dinner, I wouldn't.</v>

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.680
<v 1>Dress quite that, quite like that, but I would be an all black,</v>

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.390
uh, I didn't say much to people, um, because you had to stay in character.

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.320
I always stayed in character.

11
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:36.270
I always felt like I had always felt like that I needed to be

12
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.120
what they saw on TV, because if they saw me differently,

13
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.100
like if they saw this right. And then they see that on TV, it's like, ah.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.840
It's just acting. It's just this it's that. So I tried to make that guy real.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.670
And I did for a long time. Like I didn't do for years.

16
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:57.120
I didn't do interviews. I didn't do personal appearances.

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.570
You got very little of me other than what you saw on TV.

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.680
And that's what kept people captivated. Like, I mean, everybody like,

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.280
I know he's not dead, but yeah. But

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.240
he's up. He's something's wrong. There's something right. And it kept it,

21
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
you know, to, to stay. And I'm not patting myself on the back,

22
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.470
but to stay relevant for 30 years in this industry where there's so much

23
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:24.810
exposure, I mean, you have to,

24
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:29.070
I felt like that's the extreme that I had to go to, um, you know,

25
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.950
to, to make that guy continue to mean something. Does it feel almost.

26
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.540
<v 0>Weird for you to be doing like a.</v>

27
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.520
<v 1>Podcast is absolutely crazy. So it started, you know,</v>

28
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.840
I, I did, uh, I did, uh,

29
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:47.460
a docu-series kind of chronicling the last few years of my career.

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.180
It was actually me trying to come to grips with calling it a day. Really.

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.230
It was called, come.

32
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.030
<v 0>On, scoot in this way into the microphone.</v>

33
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.130
<v 1>So we ended up calling it, it had nothing to do with the Jordan deal,</v>

34
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.430
but it was called the last ride, which is one of my finishing moves.

35
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.840
So it kind of chronicled like the last few years of my career and,

36
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.660
and me kind of chasing the dragon for that,

37
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.400
that one match that I could hang my hat on and say, that's it,

38
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.840
that's it. You know? And it, and as you get older and the injuries and all that,

39
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.670
I don't, I don't, I mean, I, I, I figured that in,

40
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.180
but I still see in my head what I used to could do.

41
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.610
And that's what I was striving. I mean,

42
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:32.700
you've said you've seen it in the fight game all the time.

43
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.470
Guys are looking for that, you know,

44
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.790
they can't come to grips with the fact that their skills have diminished and

45
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.020
there's a changing of the guard. Yeah. And it it's kinda the same with,

46
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.200
with what I was doing. I was looking for that one match that I could say,

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.260
I still got it. And now I'm out.

48
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.500
<v 0>Was there a conversation about this with Vince,</v>

49
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:55.410
where you were trying to figure out when to close?

50
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.360
<v 1>Yeah. There, there was lots,</v>

51
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.730
there was lots of those conversations and there were people that I talked to

52
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.100
along the way, you know, through my career, I was like, look,

53
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.870
if I get to a point where my skills have diminished and I,

54
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:12.850
and I can't recognize it, I want you to tell me,

55
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.270
or at least bring the conversation up, you know?

56
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.560
And it got to the point where nobody wants to have that conversation. You know,

57
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.390
nobody wants to have that like, Hey dude, your day. Yeah, it's up.

58
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.590
It's a real problem. I put a big burden on, uh, on people and, you know,

59
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.690
they just couldn't do it. And now Vince,

60
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.950
who I have an unbelievable relationship with, but, uh,

61
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.960
but also that's a,

62
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.400
that's a huge intellectual property for events 30 years,

63
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.080
you know? So he didn't, you know, I could go out for another few years and,

64
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.860
you know, I could knock somebody on their or I could choke slam somebody,

65
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:54.430
but I can't do it personally. Right. I can't,

66
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:58.060
because I know there's so many guys that are coming up that are trying to get

67
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:02.080
that spot and, you know, I can't go out there and, and, and okay,

68
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:06.130
I got all this equity built up from all these years. I'm just gonna, you know,

69
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.050
I'm gonna, I'm just gonna live off of that.

70
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.250
<v 0>But when I was a kid, uh, in Boston, they had a,</v>

71
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.710
it was a local wrestling promotion,

72
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.560
but killer Kowalski killer Kowalski was on.

73
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.140
And I don't know how old he was at the time,

74
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.330
but he had to be way, way up in the, in the years. I mean,

75
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.360
he looked like he was in his fifties. Yeah. And, uh, you know,

76
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:33.280
I remember thinking like, even as a kid, like how long can a guy do this?

77
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.070
<v 1>Yeah. It, it varies.</v>

78
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.890
<v 0>Who's the longest. So you're the longest reigning guy.</v>

79
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.710
<v 1>I think there's guys, I think there's guys that are like flare lasted.</v>

80
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.240
<v 2>His level. Yeah. He's the longest by like a lotta he's,</v>

81
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.680
he's probably going to be humble about this right now.

82
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.580
But even then the COBOL skis and all that, the styles were different. Right.

83
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:59.170
It was more like the arm drags and like little tosses and claw, right? Yeah.

84
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.790
Yeah. And he's, I mean,

85
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:05.770
he's throwing people off of 16 foot cells and getting

86
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:09.670
thrown off of tightened, trons, like ramps and all this crazy physical stuff.

87
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.120
It's a whole different game. And he went 10, 15 years,

88
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.040
probably longer than most of his.

89
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.550
<v 1>Well, the fact that I stayed 30 years with one company,</v>

90
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.140
I think that's the one really big thing is once I started with vents,

91
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.470
I stayed with Vince where a lot of guys, you know, they would,

92
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.270
they would jump from one promotion to the other. And I stayed once I got there,

93
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:35.890
I was there and, you know, wow. It was a, it's been a hell of a ride.

94
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.520
<v 0>Yours is a crazy ride. So what was your last match?</v>

95
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.890
<v 1>My last match was in a, it was April the boneyard. It was April, April, 2012.</v>

96
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.753
<v 2>Right here.</v>

97
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.883
<v 0>It's a nice spike.</v>

98
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.940
<v 1>Yeah. That was a, that's a west coast chopper right there. Um,</v>

99
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.980
that's the bike actually belonged to a Garth Brooks security guy.

100
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.910
But, uh, this, this was, this was,

101
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.330
we got lucky because COVID had already shut everything down.

102
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.360
So everybody else, this is WrestleMania.

103
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.840
So everybody else is doing their matches in an empty warehouse.

104
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.990
And we got to go off and do this, uh,

105
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.900
kind of themed match.

106
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.400
They turned this whole area into like a cemetery and, uh,

107
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.460
got to a lot of theatrical stuff.

108
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.860
<v 0>So that must've felt like I can hang my hat on this one.</v>

109
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.600
You know that we started filming that at about eight o'clock at night and we

111
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:37.220
wrapped at about five in the morning. And like, at the end of it,

112
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:41.150
I was like, I can't hardly stand up. Yeah. Everything was just locked up.

113
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:44.180
And I was, you know, cause I went into it and you know,

114
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.690
I started training for mania and obviously I thought I was going to be in a

115
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:50.960
stadium in a ring. And uh,

116
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.550
so I had really got a good head start on my training and you know,

117
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:59.240
my weight was coming down. Everything was, was good and then COVID hit.

118
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.250
And then it was just like the gyms shut down. And then, you know,

119
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.870
then I got to F I had to get to Florida just to make sure you know,

120
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:10.940
that I was in Florida. Right. Yeah.

121
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.030
Cause you never knew when they were going to shut all the airlines down.

122
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.650
So the training, you know, my training kind of went to and uh,

123
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.330
but I was really happy with how this turned out and I knew at the end of it

124
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:26.510
physically at your day is done man. And I, you know,

125
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.510
as much as I want to do it here and I want to do it here,

126
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.660
it's just the body just, it can't deliver. So what do you do now?

127
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.500
<v 0>I mean, that's a long career. I mean, yeah.</v>

128
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.800
<v 1>It is. And I'm trying to figure that part out, uh,</v>

129
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.300
because I've dedicated my whole life to this, to this business. And you know,

130
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.500
there there'll be times, you know, I help out and maybe mentor some guys,

131
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.790
but you know, I haven't, I got to find out what I'm passionate about.
