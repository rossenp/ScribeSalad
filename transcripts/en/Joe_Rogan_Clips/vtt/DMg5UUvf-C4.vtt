00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 2>Now you've been, you use a lot of local ingredients,</v>

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.710
but you've also been doing this thing where you take people

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.030
hunting and show them how to butcher an animal and show them how to cook an

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.040
animal. When did you start doing that?

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.050
<v 1>That was in 2008. So shortly after we started doing,</v>

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
uh, classes on tree of domestic pork, um,

8
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.320
which was kind of my wheel house.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.610
I'd learned that in restaurant work I'd been a prep cook and a butcher in

10
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.470
restaurant and, uh, being new to hunting at that point.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.400
Um,

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.780
I had just started hunting a couple of years prior and was really excited about

13
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:45.420
it and saw the, uh,

14
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:49.350
opportunity to really kind of tie the two together. You know, I,

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.140
I knew how to butcher before I knew how to hunt. Um,

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.170
and so that I had a little bit of an advantage on the backend of it,

17
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:57.660
but still have, and still do have to this day,

18
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:59.310
a lot to learn about the front end of it.

19
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120
And I wanted to be able to share that with people, because I,

20
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:07.800
I think that haunting is a very key way to show people the importance of food.

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.170
Because if you can feel sad about taking the life of a

22
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:14.970
deer or a pig or a squirrel,

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.950
then you can also understand what a case of carrots that is, you know,

24
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:23.100
rotting at a grocery store because they haven't been sold or they're not,

25
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.840
they don't look good enough to sell anymore. That's also sad to me and,

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.820
and, you know, a lot of work went into that and, and,

27
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.760
and so much it's in measurable. And so being able to tie food, uh,

28
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.800
with the, with a source like that,

29
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.590
with hunting or fishing or whatever I think was really important.

30
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:44.400
So we started doing classes where we were taking people out and we would,

31
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.750
it's guided hunts, and then you learn how to butcher cook,

32
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.150
and then you eat game throughout the weekend too.

33
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.710
And we still do that to this day.

34
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.840
<v 0>And when you do this, how many times a year do you do.</v>

35
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.740
<v 1>This? Uh, you know, well, um, you know,</v>

36
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:00.960
in season it's its axis. So it's hot.

37
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.930
Our season typically runs if we,

38
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:07.680
if we have a couple dove hunts or something in there from mid September till,

39
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.890
uh, maybe April. Um, so just basically the,

40
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.620
the cooler and cool and cold months of, of the year. So about six,

41
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:17.940
seven months. And when you.

42
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.760
<v 0>Do it, would you do it on weekends? Like when, when do you, uh.</v>

43
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.300
<v 1>Yeah, they're, they're, they're typically weekend classes. Um,</v>

44
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:27.630
we used to do a lot of private events and now I've just gone to, we work with,

45
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.740
we work with one ranch. Um, we do a Friday through Sunday class and,

46
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.180
um, in all honesty though, our,

47
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:39.000
our whole season this year has fairly much been booked up by, uh,

48
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.390
people that came to previous classes. They come back,

49
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:44.460
we have a pretty high return rate on those.

50
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.850
We're about to release our schedule of those, but there's going to be very,

51
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.150
very little seats available to those. They fill out,

52
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.460
we do eight classes a year for four people.

53
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.610
<v 0>Yeah, you kind of would, if you're hunting too,</v>

54
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.290
you're going to need small groups. Right. You really can't.

55
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.570
<v 1>Yeah. It's and it's gotta be very intimate. You know,</v>

56
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.380
we want everybody to see everything and put their hands on it. So it's,

57
00:03:04.381 --> 00:03:06.970
it's really necessary. We have a team of guides. So everybody,

58
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:08.710
if you've never been hunting before you have a guide,

59
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.970
we walk you through the whole, um, the whole series of events,

60
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.060
like from siting in the gun to, uh, you know,

61
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.060
it's this constant barrage of like learning and was like,

62
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.220
this is how you put your heel down. You know,

63
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.320
this is the way the wind is blowing.

64
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.640
This is the way we're going to walk to do this. You know, this is, uh,

65
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:30.670
what time of day we expect deer to move. When we expect hogs to move,

66
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.280
why we're sitting right here, all kinds of, you know,

67
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.300
we're constantly feeding information. And then once that animal's taken,

68
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.930
we're feeding, you know, more information about how you scan.

69
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.460
This is how you got, this is how you use the liver. This is called fat,

70
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.170
and this is a shank. This is best for grind. This is best for slow cooking,

71
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.170
things like that. And then we teach them how to, how to butcher it,

72
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.730
break it down. Um,

73
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.100
and then we really want them to be able to do it on their own.

74
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.780
And the whole time we feed them game to kind of really keep it in context.

75
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.440
Cause a lot of times people have been told, you know, you can't eat that.

76
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.960
You know, you can't, you know, deer liver's no good or,

77
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.520
or Venice and tastes gamey to me, or I'm not gonna touch the hog topic yet. But,

78
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.070
um, you know, people are very, uh,

79
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.040
opinionated about hogs and, uh,

80
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.690
we try to just kind of dispel those myths and empower and educate people and

81
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.780
to be able to do it on their own and whether or not they go and do it in the

82
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:24.400
future. I don't really know,

83
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.170
but I do think that it gives them some very good connectivity.

84
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.411
I mean,

85
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.790
I know people that came on a trip 12 years ago that still talk about it to me,

86
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.800
I think it was important. And I mean, that's very,

87
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.940
that's really important to me and very meaningful that it's, it's a,

88
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.640
it's a formative experience, even if they never do it again, you know, but it,

89
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.500
it teaches them to really value a resource that time they killed a deer.

90
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.450
Cause it's really hard to like for me, uh, once you've killed that deer,

91
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:56.470
if you open up a bag of beef or something,

92
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.150
I can't help. But think like all those animals in a field,

93
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.770
you know, they all had lives. They all had deaths, everything, you know,

94
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:09.610
it's like, and I think it, it teaches you to just appreciate resources.

95
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:13.450
And once you start to appreciate that resource, uh,

96
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.530
maybe you'll start to appreciate all resources. You know, you.

97
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.610
<v 0>Appreciate the vegetables, everything else.</v>

98
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.350
<v 1>You might want to shake where your clothes are made or, or, or, uh,</v>

99
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.560
do we need a, a leaf blower, you know, things like that.
