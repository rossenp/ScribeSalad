00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, max Holloway. Oh.</v>

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.250
I don't know how I feel about this hair.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.110
That full haircut. I'm not sure.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.800
<v 1>COVID give me and look. Maybe there's no Bob is in Hawaii.</v>

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.240
He said he did all.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.470
<v 0>Of his training on zoom and, uh, Vulcan housekeepers. Call him.</v>

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.630
I call too. I don't believe it, but they, you know,

8
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.100
they had real strict lockdown.

9
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.660
<v 2>It does look different all the way.</v>

10
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.020
It looks like a Patrick Dempsey from those old timey movies.

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.040
<v 3>Trimmers, eyebrows. That's a Jeep reference, but that's a deep bruh,</v>

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.840
but he does look like Dr.

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.090
<v 4>Dreamy. I know him as.</v>

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.370
<v 2>The pizza guy from that one. Right?</v>

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.460
<v 3>Right. We all those ladies can't buy me. Love. Yes.</v>

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.250
<v 2>That was on HBO all the time. And that was the plot of all.</v>

17
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.750
<v 0>The best. Porn's a guy comes over to pizza. the lady when the husband's at work.</v>

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.500
Yep. There he.

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.120
<v 2>Is. Hey, new max Holloway, quarantine Holloway.</v>

20
00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:05.960
I met him once.

21
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.840
<v 0>At the comedy store. He's very nice. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.880
He actually told me not to let a heckler get to me. Oh,

23
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.990
don't let them get to you. Like, so.

24
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.000
<v 1>[Inaudible] captain date, rape captain Tam. Right?</v>

25
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.840
Warm up guy for news radio that you hated this bots.

26
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.300
And he would try to run jokes.

27
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.520
Patrick Dempsey,

28
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.660
literally don't even know what you're talking about.

29
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.460
<v 0>Patrick Dempsey was, he was a child star and then he became an adult star.</v>

30
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.520
<v 2>Are you still around? Did you end up getting in a succession yet on HBO? Yeah.</v>

31
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.220
Macaulay Culkin. His younger brother kills it.

32
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.510
Unbelievable show Joey. The, the show is a drama,

33
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.990
but it's done by these comedy guys that only know comedy.

34
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.310
So it's a super serious show. And then when the comedy hits you,

35
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.780
it hits you.

36
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:21.920
Like it hits you like Goodfellas or Tarantino or the

37
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:24.890
Sopranos when it gets you out of nowhere.

38
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.300
Cause they sneak it on you during serious happening. Oh, it's so funny.

39
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.580
The type of stuff that would make us my.

40
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.140
<v 0>Legs and Vulcan now ski, they're not showing the same show, but look at it.</v>

41
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:40.190
Look at his legs. Tree trunks. Yeah.

42
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:41.270
This guy is scary.

43
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.220
You know, he used to weigh 214 pounds. His accents all up.

44
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.420
I thought he said 240, but it's got till five. Hey dad. Hey,

45
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.230
he's got that thick Australian accent.

46
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 2>Interesting that this one straight to rematch.</v>

47
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.570
<v 0>Huh? If he wins, I'm putting it all that crocodile Dundee hat on.</v>

48
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.130
I'm going to keep it on standby.

49
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.770
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. If he wins, this is coming on.

50
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.140
No disrespect to max. I love max, but if he wins,

51
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.033
I got to wear that.

52
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.110
<v 2>Yep. You could put on if max wins or something or pineapple. Max wins.</v>

53
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:29.010
I'm taking my shirt off.

54
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.840
Max winds up. Pretend I'm on vacation.

55
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.430
What is any problem though? Eddie's cornering.

56
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.550
<v 0>Oh shoot. We should have told people. Yeah, Eddie's cornering. Uh,</v>

57
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.420
one of his fighters. I believe it's a grappling event. I'm not sure.

58
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.500
I forgot it is no fans. Yeah. It's a grappling event, right?

59
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.060
No fans. Is it a submission underground shale Sundance event?

60
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.670
Cause a lot of times he does those in the daytime.

61
00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:01.320
When they have a UFC on at night.

62
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.960
<v 1>I'm not sure I'll find out.</v>

63
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
I knew that he was cornering a fighter.

64
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.590
<v 0>Uh, submission on the shore. I don't know where that is.</v>

65
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.200
Submission on the shore. Huh? San Pedro.

66
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.910
So it's a, a jujitsu event. There's a lot of those now, man. They actually pay.

67
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.390
There's a, a lot of these submission events where you know,

68
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:28.170
guys can win a couple of grand for winning and they could do them a lot because

69
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:32.910
unlike a striking, you really can't have fights every weekend,

70
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.670
but you could grapple pretty much every weekend.

71
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.190
You can make a couple grand here, a couple grand there. And some guys like,

72
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.950
um, like Ryan Gordon,

73
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.360
they actually make real money doing that.

74
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.880
And he's probably made a million dollars grappling Gordon, Ryan, excuse me.

75
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.080
I said, Ryan Gordon, I switched his name around the, I blamed the weed.

76
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.850
But Gordon Ryan, um,

77
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.950
has been winning big grappling events for

78
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.680
three or four years. And he just bought a house,

79
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.820
bought like a million dollar house with grappling money, which is crazy.

80
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.150
<v 1>Here we go, baby. It good sponsors too. Yeah.</v>

81
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.370
To get good money from sponsors, man.

82
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.470
<v 0>Yeah. Well Eddie does, you know, those, uh, EBI guys are doing really well.</v>

83
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.570
They, they have such a big fan base now, you know, they're always,

84
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.400
they're always exciting. His rule systems,

85
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:34.200
the best rule system in the world because it's,

86
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:38.400
it cuts out all the bad about stalling and all

87
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.730
stalemates. Rather, not even stalling stalemates, you know,

88
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.170
guys cancel each other out.

89
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.290
It forced them into a position where the guys on your back ready, set, go.

90
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:51.090
Or guys got you in, um, you know, um, uh, uh, armbar position.

91
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.710
Ready? Set, go. When the guy got, has you in that spiderweb position.

92
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.990
<v 1>He's not doing it. This he's not doing what he could do it.</v>

93
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.270
It just has to be because of COVID.

94
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.240
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It's hard, man.</v>

95
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.220
It's tournaments that working. Yeah. You can have them working,

96
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.250
but you know, don't have the audience,

97
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:14.590
you don't get the money from the audience. I mean, think about it.

98
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:17.110
He was selling out the Orpheum, right? What is the RPM?

99
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:21.610
That's 2000 people at least. Right. Pay-per-view you think? So.

100
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.700
<v 3>Probably now that. Yeah. Especially [inaudible].</v>

101
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.150
<v 1>I'm really surprised that listen, man, like I said,</v>

102
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.180
there's no doorway, meaning you could put 200 people in.

103
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.280
You want, eventually they're going to shut you down.

104
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.350
Especially west.

105
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.550
Hollywood's going to be the last thing to open because of routes that

106
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.920
[inaudible], that had COVID and

107
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.920
 spread it into the community. That parade destroyed Hollywood it's well-known

108
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.753
 west Hollywood is the last place to open. Yeah.

109
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.710
<v 0>Interesting. Well that's where the store is.</v>

110
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.840
<v 1>Yeah. So that's it.</v>

111
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.660
I like what the store is doing the outside patio area either. Yeah.

112
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.000
Congratulations. It's cool. You gave it a shot on the money. Listen.

113
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:15.640
As long as you're outside, I'm in the car.

114
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.490
We had the weekend in long island outside in the parking lot,

115
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.090
really Remy's door with it in that parking lot. 80.

116
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.580
<v 3>People is better than nothing it's barely want to do.</v>

117
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.120
What do you want to do with, is there this weekend? I really go.

118
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.130
<v 1>Really bad long island last night. So I didn't talk to him.</v>

119
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.360
I was under a 10th.

120
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.860
<v 0>So this is what to think about is that a vulcanized ski in the first round did a</v>

121
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:43.030
lot of chopping at the legs and it took max a while before he adjusted.

122
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:46.510
And he started, uh, adjusting by switching southpaw,

123
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.810
but he got his leg chewed up early in the fight.

124
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.880
And it's going to be interesting to see what adjustments max has made and

125
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:58.270
what, what Vulcan ops he's going to do differently. Vulcan ops.

126
00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.500
He's just such a tank.

127
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.110
<v 2>I watched a great breakdown by dominant Cruz who explained that Vulcan off ski</v>

128
00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:09.220
also made a big he's circling to the right side now,

129
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.090
but he sets them up that way and then takes a big side step to the left.

130
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.010
And when then when Holloway tries to adjust,

131
00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:18.790
that's when Vulcan Opsys strikes is after he steps to the left.

132
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.940
It's interesting to see him do the opposite now. Well.

133
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.270
<v 0>He's been quarantined too. Um,</v>

134
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.130
in that he w he hasn't been able to go to city kickboxing in New Zealand,

135
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.960
cause he trains at city kickboxing in, uh, Australia, but he,

136
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:37.120
a lot of times would go to New Zealand for his camps.

137
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.890
And he hasn't been able to do that for this fight too.

138
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:41.920
And I don't know how much, if any of an effect that's gonna have.

139
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.760
So max has been being a little more slick so far in this first

140
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:56.700
round, keeping his distance and avoid those kicks. Pretty much.

141
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.630
You got hit with one, I believe but much different than in the first fight.

142
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.440
Real aware of it. Cause it seemed like that took a lot of, uh,

143
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.440
the movement away from him. But it was interesting.

144
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:10.470
He came in here after the fight, after he lost,

145
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.430
could not have been like more relaxed and happy and having a good time just

146
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:17.940
accepted. It didn't have any problems with it. Wasn't limping at all.

147
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.260
How soon after? About a couple of days. Wow. Yeah, he fought Saturday.

148
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.830
He was here on Monday. That's crazy. He looked great.

149
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.570
And he was like, I'm telling you, man, he's in great spirits.

150
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.640
He's a really good guy. Like in his head is really on straight.

151
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.140
He has a great saying. He goes, Hey, it is what it is. And you know,

152
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:41.130
he really means that.

153
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.130
And he's honest about like his style, like the benefits,

154
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:50.860
the pros and cons of style. Like he was talking about Aldo and he's like,

155
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.270
it's those guys with power man. He goes, that's why he gets so tired.

156
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.270
He's got so much power. He's. He's like, you know,

157
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.690
I don't have that kind of power, but you know, because of that,

158
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.070
he can go longer and harder.

159
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.860
Those guys with power, they try to use it all the time. And the guy like him,

160
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.430
he can knock people out and he does knock a lot of people out,

161
00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:15.550
but he knocks people out with volume and precision.

162
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.090
He just puts a pace on you and wears you out and beats you down.

163
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.590
Whereas although can stop guys with one shot. That's the difference.

164
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.720
He doesn't really stop too many guys at one shot,

165
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.790
walking off, see connected there.

166
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.890
I'm just interested to see what changes he can make

167
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.890
right now. It looks like he's getting kicked a lot less in the legs.

168
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.850
So he's moving away more as vulcanized. He tries to engage.

169
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.650
Just turn that front, kick up the middle,

170
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.350
keeping them,

171
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.770
keeping them backing up to keeping the pressure on him and keeping him up

172
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:05.420
against the cage. Oh, you got to hit with that one.

173
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.390
<v 5>Oh, I love.</v>

174
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.760
<v 6>That hallways. Like I staggered you, but he knows.</v>

175
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.290
<v 2>That. Yeah. He really knows it. Now he knows that I do it. Yeah.</v>

176
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.810
<v 0>Interesting. Very interesting. God.</v>

177
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.560
This is a good card. Huh? And then we still got to a spot. Oh.

178
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.821
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

179
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:33.280
That's always the best when a UFC cards so good that you sort of even forget.

180
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.030
<v 0>I did almost forget.</v>

181
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.930
I almost forgot the best one while I was so looking forward to this fight.

182
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:43.820
A whole good right-hand over the top. God.

183
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.970
<v 2>There's MSG ones are like that a lot where you're like, oh man.</v>

184
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:52.130
There's two more fights left. And I already.

185
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.250
<v 5>Yup. My mind's blown.</v>

186
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.960
<v 0>Max. His inside leg is already, uh, getting real red. See it? Oh yeah. So red.</v>

187
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:02.200
It is. He's been hit with a bunch of shots inside.

188
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.850
That part is so tender too. It's so hard to get hit there. Sucks.

189
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.650
<v 2>I'm sticking by that Patrick Dempsey thing. I know it's a weird reference,</v>

190
00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:16.350
but I keep looking at him. I just keep seeing it over. Yeah.

191
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.913
Oh,

192
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.210
oh max Holloway. Oh.

193
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.850
<v 7>I missed it. Dropped.</v>

194
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.240
<v 0>Him with a head kick. He staggered him man.</v>

195
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.030
Woo. Look at the stats.

196
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.580
31 significant strikes to 20. But that head kick was big.

197
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.160
He heard him with a right hand earlier in the fight.

198
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.660
Look at his is his left. His right cheek is swollen.

199
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.600
Let's see this boom.

200
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.793
<v 5>Oh.</v>

201
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.620
<v 0>Staggered. But look roaring back though. Came back with a big shot.</v>

202
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.510
Boom. He clipped him. You know, what's funny.

203
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.130
<v 1>About that guys.</v>

204
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:11.850
That when fighters have a good time in the ring,

205
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.090
there's so much more loose. They do so much better.

206
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.950
We learned that from Ferguson for a long time, not the last fight,

207
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.320
but if you're on state, Tony's always loose.

208
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.440
If you're on stage and you're loose, that's it. You won the war right now.

209
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.470
Really weird. The state of mind, it doesn't happen a lot for me.

210
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.160
It just happens those nights in the original room. When you just don't give a,

211
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.740
you know, you don't get like, I don't give a.

212
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.040
<v 2>The ones where you feel good, where you feel really good. And you're like,</v>

213
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:42.150
I'm going to kill it.

214
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.510
You're already sort of screwed going in with that mentality. Yeah.

215
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.340
<v 1>No, I view a loose you, I, you know what?</v>

216
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.770
I'm not even going to look at my notebook.

217
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.700
I'm just going down to the right there.

218
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.740
I'll look at it tonight and just have a good time when you're loose. Like that.

219
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.640
It's good. And these guys, like when he was goofing on him, after he hit him,

220
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.360
that's good. He doesn't take himself seriously.

221
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.230
<v 0>No. Well, he always toys with people who with their head.</v>

222
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.370
I mean a lot of what max does. Like he's having fun in there for sure.

223
00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:15.000
But he's also letting you know, I got you. I got you.

224
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:22.050
He does that all the time. So he drew first blood for sure. I mean,

225
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.333
uh,

226
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.470
vulcanized ski definitely got off set lazy chewing up that inside leg 200 row

227
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.050
then he's, he's definitely getting off some good inside.

228
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.080
Loki's hurting that leg. That leg some trouble. That legs in trouble.

229
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.720
<v 8>Oh, nasty combination.</v>

230
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.910
<v 0>Nasty combination by Holloway. God. That was nice.</v>

231
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.950
That was nice. He's piecing them up. But again, Vulcan,

232
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.450
ask you go into that inside kick over and over and over and max trying to return

233
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:55.820
the same kick, which means it probably sucks.

234
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.330
He hit him again and every combination he's hitting him with that inside low

235
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.870
kick that pays dividends, man.

236
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.250
Max got a block that

237
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:20.160
wow, look at roses. Oh. It's a plum. Ooh.

238
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.810
Still pretty though. Look at that.

239
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.510
<v 2>She is, I was one of the things that bother,</v>

240
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.750
especially bothered me with her knocking out yo on it too was like Jesus.

241
00:15:33.751 --> 00:15:36.390
And she's a beautiful girl. She's got that too.

242
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.290
It's like that bothered you. That's what's I mean, it's just funny.

243
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.760
Cause I always pictured the girl beating yo on being like a monster freaky

244
00:15:44.761 --> 00:15:49.620
monster. Yeah. Just a full beard, but that never happened.

245
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.493
Hmm.

246
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:08.070
Jamie, you bet this. Okay. Did you bet this one, Jamie? Nope. Nope.

247
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.890
<v 0>You didn't bet any of the fights? Nope. That's unusual.</v>

248
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.130
Nothing seemed like a good bet.

249
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:18.180
<v 9>I didn't have anything I wanted to do. Your, your sound is weird.</v>

250
00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:22.560
It's coming in one year. Now I had to switch to my channel second.

251
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.350
<v 2>So what do you think happens now on Drudge Zelie?</v>

252
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.860
<v 0>Uh, who knows, you know, w what's important is rose won. So for rose,</v>

253
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.860
she moves on and gets closer to a shot at the title.

254
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.880
Oh, nice. Needed a body by max. Woo.

255
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.560
I mean the Whaleys young you'll want to fight was so

256
00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:55.140
good. You really could make a,

257
00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.030
you could make an argument that they have to have a rematch was so good.

258
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.670
It was about as good as a fight has ever been. I agree.

259
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.500
You could make an argument that that's actually better than rose fighting and

260
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.300
Rose's face is so up.

261
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.720
Like it might take her a while before she's able to fight again.

262
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:17.100
He went inside and outside with that leg, but max isn't limping or anything.

263
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.890
It can't be good, but so far he's moving. Pretty good.

264
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:25.950
I, we try to go up top.

265
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.720
Oh good. Right-hand by max.

266
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.030
They're both really good guys too. This is one of those fights where,

267
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.150
you know,

268
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.910
it would be hard to root for somebody unless you're good friends with them.

269
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:54.923
Yeah.

270
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.820
Max has a very funny relationship with DC too. He's always calling DC out,

271
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.640
telling him he wants to fight him and just play it. I mean,

272
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.890
they're just friends. He went over the top of that head kick again.

273
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.100
This time just grazed his head.

274
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.690
<v 2>He sees a anomaly to me. How that guy's so good.</v>

275
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.070
So smart in the octagon and a commentator and

276
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.350
oh.

277
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.540
<v 8>You heard him? He heard him. Oh,</v>

278
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.563
he heard him

279
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.180
really smart in that too. He's very smart. He's really smart. Always.

280
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.790
<v 0>Thinking, always thinking he's telling somebody to shush.</v>

281
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.850
Who's he telling his shush? That's interesting.

282
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.030
I'm gonna have to go back and watch this at home.

283
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.440
I want to know what's going on.

284
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.760
I dunno what he's doing there. That I wonder what he was, uh, who is shushing.

285
00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.340
So he's pointing to someone on the corner,

286
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.530
maybe someone in a Vulcan Huskies corner.

287
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.480
So that's two rounds for Holloway, for sure.

288
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.360
The railway dropped him with the head kick the round where he dropped him in the

289
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.090
uppercut. Those are his and in the last fight of his.

290
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.620
<v 8>Bang. Wow. Bang. Oh boy.</v>

291
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.860
<v 0>Beautiful. And then the one that drops him knee to the body to look at that.</v>

292
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.750
Wow, here it is. Bang.

293
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.680
That's the third time he's made his knees buckle up. And then again,

294
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.700
it's whenever cut on the way.

295
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.300
<v 2>Up. And he gains heat as he goes on. Right?</v>

296
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.420
And the last bite. Yeah. Racks. Yeah. His.

297
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.540
<v 0>Endurance is phenomenal. Phenomenal. It's one of his best tracks,</v>

298
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.020
his intelligence, his endurance volume.

299
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.990
<v 2>That's what's wild to me about this main event is MOSFET out. Uh,</v>

300
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.250
[inaudible] endurance to be able to go five with Covington,

301
00:20:06.251 --> 00:20:09.460
who I thought had the best gas tank out of everyone. Well.

302
00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.360
<v 0>There was no wrestling.</v>

303
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.460
That's one of the reasons why they were able to go five like that.

304
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.120
You know, um, Colby is a nightmare for a lot of people.

305
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.380
The fact that loose Mon didn't just beat him, but stopped him. It says a lot,

306
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.180
but you know, oops, Mon is a, he's a dangerous person.

307
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:33.310
He's very strong. And you know, he has really up needs to like really up.

308
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.790
Like he talked about his knees being so bad that after some training,

309
00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:39.370
he had to walk on the grass cause he couldn't walk on the concrete because it

310
00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.710
hurt too much. Imagine that.

311
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.630
And then imagine he's fighting G max has hit him with a flying knee,

312
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.230
but he's, he's kind of just, uh,

313
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.300
resigned himself to the idea that when he retires,

314
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:56.740
he's going to have to get his knees replaced. So he's just fighting, just,

315
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.990
you know, dealing with it. You see them training.

316
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:02.860
He's always got knee braces on or knee sleeves on. He talks about it too.

317
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.600
Pretty openly. He had that, uh, they do this thing where they, they,

318
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.520
they de microfracture your knee, like to try to get your car,

319
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.610
which to grow back. And it actually did. It was wound up being worse for them.

320
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.040
It it up even more. And he's,

321
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.820
I've heard that from more than one person that's had that operation done.

322
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:25.360
I think it's probably fine for somebody who does like regular.

323
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.410
But if you want to go back to some hardcore wrestling and MMA training,

324
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:30.910
it's probably a terrible idea.

325
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.670
<v 2>John Wayne Park has had some crazy surgery. Huh? What is that?</v>

326
00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.370
<v 0>Had his hip replaced. Oh yeah.</v>

327
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.790
<v 7>He got a new socket.</v>

328
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:46.080
<v 0>It's really crazy. Sent me the pictures. Did you see the picture of his leg?</v>

329
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.190
Yeah. Giants.

330
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:52.020
<v 2>Car. Uh, the undertaker go through that on his documentary. He just retired.</v>

331
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.600
Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah.

332
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.170
<v 0>Yeah. John, I think they're calling it resurfacing.</v>

333
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.160
So it's not as much of a thing as the, uh,

334
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.930
the old way they used to do it or in some cases how they do it and he,

335
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.520
he will be able to fight again apparently, which is just nuts.

336
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.940
And he's also walking around now pretty much without a limp,

337
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.680
13 days after the operation,

338
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.160
it's really crazy the way they do it now.

339
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.320
And this is not even just for young guys,

340
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.030
my friend Graham Hancock got his hip replaced and six weeks later he came on the

341
00:22:30.031 --> 00:22:32.670
podcast and it was walking normal. And I was like, what?

342
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.610
Six weeks ago you got your hip replaced. I mean,

343
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.930
it's a different game. Yeah. That's why.

344
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.340
<v 1>My mom's knees. Cause he can't knee.</v>

345
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.390
<v 0>Replacements a different animal. Like what about the stuff you do for the knees,</v>

346
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.240
but like stem cells. Yeah. You can do that for sure.

347
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.540
He could do that for sure for now. Yeah. I don't think he has.

348
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:57.690
I definitely talked to him about it and I don't, I don't believe he has,

349
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.590
but a lot of guys have, um, TJ Dillashaw.

350
00:23:01.591 --> 00:23:05.790
I went down there a couple of times for shoulders and he talked pretty openly

351
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:09.780
about it. A bunch of guys gone down to Columbia as well.

352
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.100
Henry Cejudo on the show was talking about how he went down to Columbia to get

353
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:17.820
stem cells down there. Um, and uh, they fixed his shoulder.

354
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.080
He some real shoulder problems, dude,

355
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:26.160
when they could do in these other countries that they don't have the same

356
00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:28.380
regulations they have here in the United States, the United States.

357
00:23:28.381 --> 00:23:31.410
They can only do a certain amount with stem cells.

358
00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:33.960
And even that has been amazingly beneficial to me.

359
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.100
But if you go to Panama or you know.

360
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.090
<v 2>Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine what's yup.</v>

361
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.340
<v 5>A vaccine. Yup. How.</v>

362
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.730
<v 0>About lung cancer? Not a virus. How could they have a vaccine?</v>

363
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.600
<v 2>They made some weird thing. It's only available in Cuba.</v>

364
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.660
It's a lung cancer vaccine. What about Ricky?

365
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.310
<v 1>Ricardo smoking five cigars. They figured it out.</v>

366
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.320
They figured it out. And.

367
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.660
<v 2>Lung cancer doesn't with people. Either that.</v>

368
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.370
<v 1>Just spreads said in Cuba. She, my aunt tells me all the time. They just fix it.</v>

369
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.150
There's no pills afterwards. They just fix you.

370
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.110
<v 0>Okay. Here it is. C I M a VAX.</v>

371
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.930
EGF is a lung cancer treatments developed in Cuba.

372
00:24:16.931 --> 00:24:20.680
It's a type of immunotherapy that harnesses the body's immune system to fight

373
00:24:20.681 --> 00:24:25.000
lung cancer. Yup. Wow. In 2017, oh. Around it.

374
00:24:25.001 --> 00:24:27.700
Lung cancer vaccine. It's a vaccine.

375
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.260
<v 2>And by the way, people get it. And then they smoke and party afterwards, like</v>

376
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.320
rice smokes, smoked cigars cigarettes in the time of their lives.

377
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.360
Imagine getting a vaccine for everything.

378
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.740
<v 1>My buddy had wispy.</v>

379
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.800
<v 2>Kasowitz. I believe the medical term is cancer.</v>

380
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.360
<v 1>In the beginning, my friend called me. He goes, how's our buddy doing?</v>

381
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.050
Did he get rid of the cans? I go, all I know is he's Coke. Again.

382
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.790
<v 3>Coke. Again. I called him up one night. He's like, what do you want?</v>

383
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.290
What do you mean? What do I.

384
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.680
<v 2>Want? That should be how if you get that, that should be to soften the blow.</v>

385
00:25:05.681 --> 00:25:07.780
That's how the doctor should break the news to you.

386
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.370
I got bad news for you got an asphalt cancer. He got five treatments. That's it.

387
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:13.930
They caught.

388
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.310
<v 1>Him the stage one early. He was blood. Wow. He pitched blood two times.</v>

389
00:25:18.311 --> 00:25:23.140
He said he went, they caught it. Five treatments. Five Fridays in a row.

390
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:25.990
Yeah. Radiation.

391
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.130
<v 0>Let me ask you this. Why is Cuba so good at medical?</v>

392
00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.130
<v 1>It's tough. I don't know because Fidel was a Savage.</v>

393
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:38.380
We had this discussion when you were talking to me about your boy with his eye

394
00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:42.250
socket healed after the fight. Oh yo. Well, yeah. You know,

395
00:25:42.251 --> 00:25:43.900
they were doing in Cuba.

396
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.650
They were shooting pregnant women with gorilla biscuits.

397
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.690
You know, they were just doing weird. Yeah.

398
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.290
<v 2>Yes it is. Here we go.</v>

399
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.640
Is the fourth. Yes. Round four

400
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.800
championship rounds. 10 minutes left in this puppy.

401
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.430
<v 0>Nice back kick to the body. He's done that a couple of times.</v>

402
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.910
Vulcan Hofsky is yet to really hurt. Oh. Tagged him with that.

403
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.380
Jab popped him with that jab. That was a beautiful jab. Nice inside.

404
00:26:26.381 --> 00:26:28.630
Low kick again. Two in a row. Bang, bang.

405
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.870
<v 2>So quickly. Like it's nothing.</v>

406
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.970
<v 0>And then on the outside too, man, he's,</v>

407
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.810
he's getting back to what was very successful for him in the first fight.

408
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.860
But you got to think Holloway won at least two rounds.

409
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.640
I don't know about the third, but I would imagine he won those first two rounds.

410
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.820
Dropped him twice.

411
00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:00.110
So let's say Vulcan ASCII one. The third. Who knows?

412
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.130
Who knows what's going on here? Oh,

413
00:27:04.131 --> 00:27:08.930
this leg buckled from that low kick again. He chopped the same area, man.

414
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.990
It's bright red. It's up man.

415
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.173
Crazy

416
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.590
great herb Dean.

417
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.600
But Joey, but Jesus Christ. What? Nothing.

418
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.590
I'm too much.

419
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.480
<v 1>Into this. I don't want to talk.</v>

420
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.700
<v 2>This is brown. I can not believe how red Holloway's leg is.</v>

421
00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:00.020
It's it is catch up. No, no. Well he's kicked the.

422
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.620
<v 8>Oh, Nina punch.</v>

423
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.280
<v 0>Tagged with the right hand too. And another right hand. And he smiled at him.</v>

424
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.320
<v 2>That's wild. Two island guys, New Zealand and Hawaii.</v>

425
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.600
<v 0>New Zealand. It is an island I guess,</v>

426
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.230
but he's not from New Zealand is from Australia. Oh,

427
00:28:27.231 --> 00:28:29.150
he just lives in New Zealand. No, no.

428
00:28:29.151 --> 00:28:32.840
He does some of his training in New Zealand. Oh kickboxing.

429
00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.980
Which is the big gym where? Oh. He staggered him there. Oh,

430
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.390
shoot back. Kick to the body. That's where, uh, out of Sonya,

431
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:45.290
that's where he trains his city. Kickboxing in New Zealand. Uh,

432
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.110
Dan is also city kickboxing guy

433
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.270
and Vulcan Navasky does city kickboxing. But the one that's in Australia,

434
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.180
a lot of like real high level. Kickboxers in Australia, man.

435
00:29:02.181 --> 00:29:03.110
It's kind of amazing.

436
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.660
<v 2>Why do you think that that is because of soccer and rugby and stuff.</v>

437
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:09.350
They're just.

438
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.560
<v 0>Tough off people, man. They're men, they're manly men.</v>

439
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.240
You give them something like jujitsu or kickboxing. They Excel at that.

440
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.890
They're hard people over there, you know, it's a different breed.

441
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.610
That's why a crocodile Dundee worked as a movie. You know?

442
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.820
It's not like you're talking about guys from, I mean,

443
00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:30.230
I don't want to disparage any country,

444
00:29:30.231 --> 00:29:34.700
but pick a country where men are thought to be more

445
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:39.590
feminine, you know? Yeah. It's Australia. It's like,

446
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.540
nah, it's not a life. That's a knife. Like that makes sense.

447
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.270
It's coming from Australia. They're a bunch of savages over there.

448
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.770
You love it over there, right? Oh yeah. A fun place to do stand-up.

449
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.210
<v 2>To at least once a year ago,</v>

450
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.150
even the things that seem like they wouldn't be savages or Sabbath savages.

451
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.010
You ever hold a koala bear. I have not. Those things are,

452
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.020
there's a reason why they call them bears.

453
00:30:04.021 --> 00:30:08.100
I promise you that because those things are bears. Do they look all cute?

454
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.780
But the second you stop feeding it eucalyptus as soon as it's like where the

455
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.140
my like they get mad within seconds.

456
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:20.100
You get mad at you at anything. Is it that the only one thing,

457
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.350
how weird is that? So weird. The one goofy plant. They never stop eating it.

458
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.770
At least when they're around people. I figured it out real quick.

459
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.050
If it's basically like they're uh.

460
00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:35.040
<v 1>Uh, scope, drug and food.</v>

461
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.580
Is there drugs? It.

462
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.090
<v 2>Just feels like it's like a drug to them because they're just addicted.</v>

463
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.220
They start to get mad. Normally, if you don't,

464
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.540
if you stop feeding something for three seconds, it doesn't get that mad.

465
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.670
Cause it's been eating. I.

466
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.070
<v 0>Would just tag them with that right hand. Oh, head kick.</v>

467
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.290
<v 1>You know, when I look at that picture over there at Richard Pryor,</v>

468
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.480
I keep thinking about how I'm not in calmly shape and it makes me sad.

469
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.650
That's what I was thinking about it.

470
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.890
<v 10>Now that he can read me like a book. Yeah. I'm.</v>

471
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:12.000
<v 1>Sad as because I hope box not opens first,</v>

472
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.680
which is probably going to be this thing.

473
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.200
I got a couple of weeks up in Oxnard on Wednesday nights. Just to warm me up.

474
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.580
<v 0>When do you think that's happening?</v>

475
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.450
<v 1>I'm all the way booked till December Joey.</v>

476
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.900
<v 0>I have recently resigned myself to the idea that everything is canceled for a</v>

477
00:31:27.901 --> 00:31:32.010
solid year. That's my, my recent resignation on hope, man.

478
00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:35.700
I'd be very happy if they came up with some sort of a really effective treatment

479
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:40.290
and then they open everything up again. But here we are in July and um,

480
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.820
I've, you know, some big gigs booked in August and October and.

481
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.790
<v 10>I'm not confident. I'm not.</v>

482
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.600
<v 1>About even thinking about those types of gates.</v>

483
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:56.940
It breaks my heart telling me my anniversary Thursday and I can't be on

484
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.510
stage. Yeah. You know, 9 29 knees. Wow.

485
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.850
It didn't bother me for the first 90 days guys. It didn't really bother me.

486
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.830
It started bothering me a little bit like mid June. It started getting your.

487
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:14.640
<v 2>Last show was in mid-March which your last show was in Midland. That show is.</v>

488
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.720
<v 1>March 2nd. I read, I went to the store March 2nd. I could smell it in the, yet.</v>

489
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.400
<v 2>I was chasing that thing all the way down to the last second I was doing shows</v>

490
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.490
it got so bad at the end. The last show I did was at the haha.

491
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.220
Cause they were the last place open. I closed at 45 minutes though.

492
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.820
They're like you can do as long as you want, after a whole night of a show,

493
00:32:32.821 --> 00:32:34.080
that was only like eight people there.

494
00:32:34.081 --> 00:32:37.050
But I knew cause we found out right before that they had to close that night.

495
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.880
<v 0>They're going off here. It was fifth and round. They're going for broke.</v>

496
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.670
I think they think this is anybody's fight. Max hallways pushing it.

497
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.840
<v 8>Oh, oh.</v>

498
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.750
<v 0>Max hallway. Let him let him up there. Oh, I kicked to look at that.</v>

499
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.650
God max hallways busted him up.

500
00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.860
He's definitely been way more effective in this fight than the first fight.

501
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.203
Yeah.

502
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.550
Woo. Big jab. I Vulcan AUSkey he's so powerful, man. Let me just,

503
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.490
just as jabs, like a right hand.

504
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.250
He's got crazy endurance too for such a power striker.

505
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.760
<v 2>Man. They are beating each other up. No.</v>

506
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.810
<v 0>Big uppercut and a good right-hand behind it by Vulcan housekeeper,</v>

507
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.410
looking for the take down. Whew,

508
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:44.890
good left hook by Vulcan.

509
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.360
I wish you guys could come with me to one of these with no audience.

510
00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:58.030
That'd be fun. It's awesome. They won't let you in though. I tried.

511
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.730
One of my security guys was in Vegas during one of the fights and I,

512
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.750
I got him tested and everything. I'm like, he's good. Let him in. No,

513
00:34:07.751 --> 00:34:11.290
I can't do it. They won't do it. Vegas is particularly strict.

514
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.900
They wouldn't even let me go into the octagon to interview them.

515
00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:17.560
Even though everyone's been tested, they wouldn't let me interview the fighters.

516
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.960
Had they interview them remotely like they had,

517
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.690
I had to be there and they had to be, there was another room. I could see them.

518
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.520
They were like 50 yards away. It was real weird. Say.

519
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.690
<v 2>You're so connected to them.</v>

520
00:34:31.691 --> 00:34:35.310
Usually that that type of distance and energy break has to just.

521
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:39.070
<v 0>It's not as good. It's not as good for questions. You know,</v>

522
00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:43.870
you want to look at them and you want to be, you want to make them comfortable.

523
00:34:43.871 --> 00:34:48.370
You know this moment that you want them to know that you appreciate it.

524
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.170
You know that the fight was awesome.

525
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.900
Ooh, nice. Low kick right there by Vulcan Husky. Oh, left hook firewall.

526
00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:03.940
Can I ask you? Max has kind of busted up.

527
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.210
Oh right hand by max. That belt.

528
00:35:10.211 --> 00:35:13.930
So accurate. Yeah.

529
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.760
Wild fight. Volkan AUSkey looking for the take down and Ken.

530
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.140
Oh, he gets it. Look at that crazy.

531
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.510
<v 10>Quick. Look at that. He really is great. Oh, max is amazing.</v>

532
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.290
<v 0>That's a champion right there.</v>

533
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.090
<v 2>It's also a weird fight. Cause I haven't seen it. Holloway's son.</v>

534
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.180
And you realize like, oh yeah, he's probably not there. Oh he's there.

535
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.220
Oh you think so?

536
00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.100
<v 0>Yeah. I think so. I think he said mini bless was going to be in his corner. Oh,</v>

537
00:35:49.101 --> 00:35:52.130
that's cool. But I think he was just joking around about that. Like you said,

538
00:35:52.131 --> 00:35:55.220
he didn't really train with anybody trained on zoom.

539
00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.080
I can't believe that for a second. This is anybody's round man.

540
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.960
This round could be the fight right now. Vulcan.

541
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.090
Oskies looking for take down numeral dose.

542
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.600
Oh nice. Left. Last minute.

543
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.270
<v 8>Ooh. Who wins? This one who.</v>

544
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.090
<v 0>Wins this one? This is a anybody's fight.</v>

545
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:24.110
I think max has probably done more damage in those two big rounds where he

546
00:36:24.111 --> 00:36:27.290
dropped him, but Huskies getting his end as well.

547
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.780
And the Vulcan LC steals this round. Who knows, man.

548
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.880
<v 2>It's sort of like the opposite than the last fight.</v>

549
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.130
Cause Holloway won the first two and Vulcan Opscode has been picking it up

550
00:36:43.131 --> 00:36:43.964
ever since

551
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.490
12 seconds ago.

552
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:05.180
<v 0>Wow. Oh my God. That's big. That take downs big. Yep. One second ago.</v>

553
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:11.210
Wow. Who knows? That could have been, that could have been his round for that.

554
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.010
You got to take downs in that round. I mean that could have been.

555
00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.540
That could be the fight. I might have to be wearing a crocodile Dundee hat.

556
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.000
Very interesting. 1 61 max Holloway,

557
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.080
total strikes 1 52 significant strikes.

558
00:37:33.081 --> 00:37:35.780
So he bested him and total insignificance drugs.

559
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:40.490
1 48 to 1 44 for a Vulcan ASCII. You're right, Joey,

560
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:45.170
I got stretch when I'm on my.

561
00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:46.580
You.

562
00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.200
<v 10>Know, telling you that left foot.</v>

563
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.480
<v 1>Excuse me. Yeah. It's killing me. Joe Rogan killing.</v>

564
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.880
<v 3>Me. Yeah, no I understand. I can see it. I can see it is.</v>

565
00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.020
I'm not looking to make any dope. I'll tell you what.

566
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.470
Open up a club called the last supper. Comedy club have a seat.

567
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.640
12 people can't hear you.

568
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.670
<v 1>12 People. The last supper comedy club.</v>

569
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.500
I get the Chinese guy from the bartender to check the temperatures at the door.

570
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.480
I rent. There's a place across from subconscious jujitsu.

571
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:20.780
Brett's place is Felice. Put 12 seats in that.

572
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.970
So what is the other option I have is my uncle has a liquor license from

573
00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:30.290
1969. If you want to liquor license in LA,

574
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.290
that's the one you want. You can light rum bottle rockets and you. You could.

575
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.200
<v 3>Have live bands. You could have a gay bar.</v>

576
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.510
<v 8>He's 82.</v>

577
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.450
<v 1>When he's been torturing me lately. Why?</v>

578
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.430
Cause he goes out every Friday and Saturday that was bar and it's been

579
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:49.270
closed.

580
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:54.640
And the girl that was his mistress when he was married, he had a mistress.

581
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:58.900
And then he got the mistresses. His cousin knocked up. Oh, he's a beauty.

582
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:02.740
He's a beauty. I love my uncle. So now he got the mistress,

583
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:06.370
broke her hips and she's living with him. There's one thing about my uncle.

584
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.040
He don't like people around them. I don't know.

585
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:12.240
Like he got used to being single. Yeah. Hold on. Let's see what happens here.

586
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.923
40, 47 hallway.

587
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:24.683
Wow.

588
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.790
<v 4>Wow. Crocodile Dundee, dude. Wow.</v>

589
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.790
Yeah.

590
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.540
Yeah dude. Well deal the deal.
