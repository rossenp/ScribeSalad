00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I've been following your exploits on, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:08.760
social media and, uh, the yellow Caman. Yes, dude.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.160
That is a wild looking creature. Isn't it? It's unbelievable.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.240
It was thought to be extinct. Uh, yeah.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.160
<v 1>So this one's, it's a little confusing. It, um,</v>

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.870
it's a species that was last seen in when the last one died in a zoo in the

7
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.750
eighties. And because of the region that it occupies in Columbia,

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.830
which has always been controlled by far rebels,

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.350
nobody had been back down there to look for it and, uh,

10
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.110
myself and there's actually this amazing Columbian scientist named Sergio Rena.

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.350
We're both kind of going and, and prodding and trying to see if we could get in.

12
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:39.150
And, and we both found it within a month of each other. Oh, wow. Yeah.

13
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.820
<v 0>Now it's a, with a beautiful looking creature. Look at that thing, right?</v>

14
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.900
Such a wild green, yellow color. So wild looking. It's you.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.863
<v 1>Super unique.</v>

16
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.700
<v 0>Dude. I mean, just holding that thing by the neck. Yeah. We.</v>

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.540
<v 1>Just had a little wrestling match him and I, so &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

18
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.660
<v 0>You don't even have body control. Don't you wanna take mountain here?</v>

19
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.140
Maybe get a back Mount, get some hooks in &lt;laugh&gt;.

20
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.730
<v 1>No, he would, it was good. You know, reptiles. They tire out.</v>

21
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.730
So they're not like mammals. Um, once they expend all their energy,

22
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:10.970
that's kind of it. Um, but yeah, absolutely amazing. The.

23
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.610
<v 0>Are they similar to regular crocodile alligators and that they don't have to eat</v>

24
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:16.444
for like a year?

25
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.130
<v 1>Yeah, so Caymen, I mean,</v>

26
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.890
Caymen don't have the as slow of metabolism as certain other species,

27
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.760
but they are, they're a member of the alligator family,

28
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.160
so to speak and they can go very long times without food. What.

29
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.000
<v 0>A crazy animal, like looks like a monster. Yep. I mean, look at, look at it.</v>

30
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.040
The teeth on that thing, &lt;laugh&gt; swallows things basically hold just,

31
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.880
it spins to take chunks off of things. Swallows 'em whole,

32
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.070
it doesn't have to eat for a can go underwater for how long without holding

33
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:45.430
spread.

34
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.470
<v 1>Like 40, 45 minutes. Some of them. Yeah. Some.</v>

35
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.990
<v 0>Species. So you have no idea it's there, right? It's just waiting for you.</v>

36
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.470
And they're fairly small, right?

37
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.350
There's like a 90 pound animal when it's fully grown.

38
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.231
<v 1>Uh,</v>

39
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.830
well these ones it's so little is known about this particular species of Cayman

40
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.590
that it's hard to say. I would say yeah,

41
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.870
a hundred pounds is probably about right. There's.

42
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.780
<v 0>Uh, great photo. Jamie from the nature is metal. Um,</v>

43
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.340
Instagram page from yesterday. That page is.

44
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.300
<v 1>Nuts. I love that.</v>

45
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.540
<v 0>I love it too. I love that page. There's a great one of, uh,</v>

46
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.500
a Jaguar with a Cain in its mouth. That one look at the eyes on that. Yeah.

47
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:23.340
Like go expand. Look at that. &lt;laugh&gt; the thing of nightmares.

48
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.770
<v 1>Look at those bangs right in the throat, like just death grip.</v>

49
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.690
And you can see that that Caman is death rolling in that scene. Right.

50
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.410
It's trying to get away. It's rolling. And that JAG is just locked in the.

51
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.930
<v 0>Eyes on that thing. My God unbelievable.</v>

52
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.650
It's like nature has created like in those kind of eyes. That's the perfect,

53
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.400
that's the, the perfect vision of terror. Yeah. Like those eyes totally.

54
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.440
Like you locked into those eyes. Like there's no forgiveness,

55
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.320
there's no emotions.

56
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.440
There's just ferocity and aggression and death. It.

57
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.480
<v 1>Seems like nothing. But testosterone is behind that. You know? I mean,</v>

58
00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:02.520
testosterone is probably the wrong, wrong chemical,

59
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.080
but it just seems so focused and motivated. And like you say, it's just,

60
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.600
it looks.

61
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.440
<v 0>Like death. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.760
I'm sure there's some testosterone involved in that equation too,

63
00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:11.760
but there's a bunch of other cat.

64
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.280
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; in there. &lt;laugh&gt; but literally, and.</v>

65
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.760
<v 0>They have, apparently the,</v>

66
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.110
the thing in the caption was saying that it came in has one of the greatest

67
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.630
bites per pound.

68
00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:24.270
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of any of the big cats and they regularly eat these,

69
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.210
the JAG. Yeah.

70
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.270
Jaguar rather has one of the greatest bites and they regularly eats these, uh,

71
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.630
these Caymans. Yeah.

72
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.950
<v 1>No, they're amazing. And, and you know, back to the one that we found,</v>

73
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:36.710
it's so great because like I'm the hide and seek guy, right?

74
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:40.620
Like I look for them and now there's this S Sergio Rena down in Columbia,

75
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.900
who's gonna manage that species ongoing existence. So, oh, wow. It's.

76
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.420
<v 0>Really cool. So what is involved in that, like managing their existence?</v>

77
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.740
What is he, I.

78
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.700
<v 1>Mean, you know, it's wildlife management, so it's,</v>

79
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.620
it's getting proper population dynamics, trying to understand them,

80
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:56.300
genetically figure out what their food sources figure out how much hunting

81
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.940
pressure they can take or cannot take those kind of things.

82
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.090
And that's not my department, you know, I, I, I go in and look for them.

83
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.650
That's someone like Sergio who's in the field lives in Columbia can work with

84
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.930
the species. It's.

85
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.650
<v 0>Really cool.</v>

86
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.370
I remember there was a documentary about this guy who was a scientist who was

87
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.210
obsessed. He was a biologist and he was obsessed with, uh,

88
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:15.770
the giant sloth mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

89
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:19.130
And he was spending all of his time down the Amazon he'd been down there for

90
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.200
years. And, and the, the, the,

91
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:24.880
the documentary was following him at this stage where he was getting really

92
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:28.080
frustrated and not sure if he's wasting his career. Right.

93
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:31.280
Like there was this feeling like, this thing might not be real. Yeah. Like,

94
00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:35.040
cuz they would tell me, yeah, I saw it. It was over the hill and he is like, uh,

95
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.240
you sure you saw it. Right. And they, you know, they'd bring these people in,

96
00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:41.230
they would speak their native tongue and they'd have this discuss of this thing

97
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.150
that they saw. Yep. Two years ago, big like a bear.

98
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.950
<v 1>You know, walks on a time like mega Atherium. Yeah, yeah. They're uh,</v>

99
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.310
we discussed this briefly. Last time I saw you. I think it's funny.

100
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:53.750
We got straight back to the same, same wildlife stuff. Um, but yeah,

101
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.830
no it's who knows. Right? Who knows if it's still out there,

102
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:01.620
there's definitely ongoing reports so much so that I forget university,

103
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.740
but some university actually launched an, uh,

104
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.020
an expedition to try and find the Meum. So really recently, uh,

105
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.460
I'd have to look it up probably 10 years ago now. Yeah. Not that long ago, but,

106
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.393
but you know,

107
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.660
if an academic institution is putting resources behind an expedition like that,

108
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:20.820
there's a lot of faith and maybe even Intel that they're not releasing publicly

109
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.810
to say this animal still here. Wow.

110
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.570
<v 0>That would be crazy. Like how big was a giant sloth? Uh.</v>

111
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.210
<v 1>Well there's a couple varieties. Like the,</v>

112
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:30.170
there was a north American one that was enormous,

113
00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:34.730
like bigger than a grizzly bear. Wow. Um, yeah, but so from what I've been,

114
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:35.850
what I've heard, what I've read,

115
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:38.610
you're talking about something that stands 14 foot tall walking around the

116
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:39.650
Amazon's like, like this.

117
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.840
<v 0>14 Foot tall, like winter bigger the, in a Kodiak grizzly. That's.</v>

118
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.880
<v 1>What the reports say.</v>

119
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.600
<v 0>That's you gotta take everything with a grain of salt. Exactly. I mean.</v>

120
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.520
<v 1>You gotta take their existence with a grain of salt, like, but.</v>

121
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.080
<v 0>This page, whatever this page is a Bigfoot cousin,</v>

122
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.040
the is this page and look up there,

123
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.800
Megalodon sightings is the Megalodon shark still alive. Yeah.

124
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.240
<v 1>And straight away that's like discrediting you're right. You're like, okay.</v>

125
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.360
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; what is this website? You pull up there. It's.</v>

126
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.160
<v 2>A article from June about just lots of information about them.</v>

127
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.040
It's not even saying like it exists. It's just saying,

128
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.440
this is all the information we have about this, uh,

129
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.070
this map Andar sidings.

130
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.150
<v 0>People love finding undiscovered or mythical</v>

131
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.390
creatures that turn out to be like the, uh, Tasmanian tiger. Right?

132
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:31.190
Like that's a perfect example. Like people they love to try to find what is it?

133
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.870
Thine, thine. Yep. People love to try to find that thing.

134
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.950
Like the idea that it's out there it's like, what is it about?

135
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.820
Are people where it's so compelling to find a species that

136
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.140
we were, we thought didn't exist or we thought was extinct,

137
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.700
like whether it's Bigfoot or the Lochness monster or the thy scene,

138
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:50.660
which we know used to be real. Right. It's.

139
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.620
<v 1>I, I mean, what do you think? I think that people quite, you know,</v>

140
00:06:55.621 --> 00:06:59.330
they long for the unknown and there's this big question mark surrounding

141
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.650
cryptoids or surrounding extinct animals as to whether it's still out there.

142
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.490
And that's so much more inviting to the general,

143
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.570
to the general populace to get an answer to than knowing, oh, you know,

144
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.970
there's 700 of them left and we're trying to get 'em up to 1400 or whatever the

145
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.810
species dynamic is for some other animal, as opposed to being like,

146
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.720
there could be one out, out there. Where is it? And I personally,

147
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.960
I've been on two different expeditions looking for thine. Really? Yeah, yeah.

148
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:28.160
Yeah. I did one in Northern Australia up north of cans. And then one, I spent,

149
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.800
uh, a couple weeks in Tasmania with a amazing biologist, Nick Mooney, who, uh,

150
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.000
he's adamant that he's seen thine and he's a biologist, this isn't, you know,

151
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:41.110
someone who worked as a B that was out in the wilderness going. Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:44.990
I've seen thylacine and he was terrified to tell everybody. And that,

153
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.070
that tells me that it's more credible. Right? Oh,

154
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.630
if you're scared to tell people because of your reputation,

155
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.030
as opposed to like going out there going, I saw it, I saw it. I saw it. Right.

156
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.470
That becomes more credible than the people who are just waving their arms in the

157
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:58.670
air going. I told you it's here.

158
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.540
<v 0>Did he come out of the thine closet? Uh, like when you scared to tell people,</v>

159
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.460
when's he like, oh God, &lt;laugh&gt; I.

160
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.300
<v 1>Gotta go public with this. Um, I'm not sure if,</v>

161
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.140
if he told us first or if it was public, uh, right before then,

162
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.940
but not long ago. I mean maybe 10 years ago. Yeah's such.

163
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.100
<v 0>A cool looking animal too, because it was a Mar tiger, right? Yeah.</v>

164
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.730
Marsupial, predator, whatever.

165
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.450
<v 1>It's like a marsupial Wolf with tiger stripes. It's so bizarre.</v>

166
00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:28.530
And it had this amazing, um, jaw that would open like, like a snakes,

167
00:08:28.531 --> 00:08:33.250
like way wider than its head, should stripes on the back. Um, just such a cool.

168
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.570
<v 0>Animal. Yeah. And the last one died in a zoo. Right? The,</v>

169
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.050
the last one that we think yep.

170
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.040
<v 1>In Hobart, in Tasmania. Wow. But let me, let me lay this on you.</v>

171
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.760
So my next expedition, um, for that animal,

172
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:47.600
cause I I'm like all those other people that are kind of obsessed with it.

173
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.080
My next expedition for that animal is to pop one new Guinea. So this species,

174
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.440
yeah, that's right. &lt;laugh&gt; wow. This,

175
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.440
this species used to range all the way from paua new Guinea down through

176
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:00.680
mainland Australia and into Tasmania.

177
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.960
When people came over and settled that area, they brought with them dogs,

178
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.560
dingos and dingos,

179
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.320
outcompeted them in mainland Australia and possibly in paua new Guinea 4,000

180
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:12.000
years ago. But the,

181
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.790
the thine remained in Tasmania where they O dingos to outcompete them.

182
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.470
But in mainland Australia, you've got a diversity of habitats.

183
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.230
So there are places that thysen could still hide, but in paua new Guinea,

184
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:27.470
the terrain is so crazy that the idea is that in certain regions,

185
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.230
dingos could have never made it there.

186
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.150
So perhaps there's these isolated regions where thy very small thysen

187
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:37.660
populations continued for the as 4,000 years. Have they been sightings many,

188
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.700
but just the same kind of sightings as a giant slot. You know what I mean?

189
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.780
It's all hearsay. Oh, people are so full of.

190
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.420
<v 0>So yes, they's such a problem.</v>

191
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.540
If gonna be a guy like you actually looking for species.

192
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.380
<v 1>Yeah. You know, you gotta, you gotta Wade through so much, you know, it's just,</v>

193
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.730
and it's funny because one thing can discredit the entire story that maybe

194
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.770
it shouldn't because they're embellishing or,

195
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.250
or you can be on the hook for someone's story and be like,

196
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:05.170
I totally believe this guy. It's, it's all real.

197
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.810
And it could be complete BS and there it's just so hard to tell you just have to

198
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:10.490
go with instinct. Oh God.

199
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.050
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;. But it is incredibly compelling. I mean, if you really did get an,</v>

200
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.920
a absolute photograph it with thine and you, you knew it was real or,

201
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.320
or captured one. Yeah.

202
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.560
<v 1>I think, I think it would be the, you know, discovery of the century.</v>

203
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.520
And I think it would kind of shift the scales for people that are on the fence

204
00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:32.360
about, eh, why do I care about conservation?

205
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.080
Why do I care about wildlife management? You know,

206
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:37.150
those kind of things to be like, check this animal out. Something that,

207
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:41.750
you know, last saw when we put a bounty on its head and now it's back.

208
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:45.230
Like it's hung on by a thread. Like that's such a message of hope, you know,

209
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.630
let's save it, let's bring it back.
