00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How did you stumble upon the story of fentanyl?</v>

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.560
Because weren't you at one point in time, didn't you write about like rap music?

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.800
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 1>I have a book about NWA and Tupac, and I interviewed like ice cube.</v>

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.720
Dr. Dre, Snoop dog, all those people. Yeah.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.240
But I was the LA weekly music editor.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.630
And I started looking into this story about why people were always dying at RAs.

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.631
So like,

9
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:29.470
I don't know if you remember a few years back every time there was a RA,

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.750
there were like one person died. Yeah. Two people died. Yeah. Or more.

11
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.110
And they always said it was from ecstasy,

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.590
but I knew that ecstasy was really not that dangerous of a drug, you know, M DM,

13
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:44.380
a pure or M D M a very few people died from that. So I was like,

14
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.100
what is going on here? And I looked into it and turned out.

15
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.900
It was all adultated it wasn't realxity it wasn't real Molly.

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.740
It was adultated with all these new drugs.

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.420
And I kind of went down the rabbit hole and I found out that all these new drugs

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.020
were made in China.

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.250
They were all synthetic and there were like hundreds of them.

20
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.650
And then it turns out that the most, you know, the worst of them was fentanyl.

21
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.810
And that's how I got onto the topic.

22
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.250
<v 0>And fentanyl, most people think of fentanyl.</v>

23
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.930
They think of it as being a new thing, but it's not really a new thing. Right.

24
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.240
It was wasn't it, it was invented in the fifties or something. Yeah.

25
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.800
<v 1>Yeah. It was invented by a Belgian chemist. Um,</v>

26
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.040
he was trying to find something that worked better than morphine in hospitals,

27
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.120
but doesn't morphine.

28
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.953
<v 0>Work really good.</v>

29
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.400
<v 1>Well, it does, but for things like, um, yeah,</v>

30
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:40.520
traditionally people have got a lot of mileage outta morphine, but, um,

31
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.280
for things like open heart surgery,

32
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.870
he wanted something that came on really fast and it lasted a long time.

33
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.990
And so he manipulated the chemical structure of morphine came up with fentanyl.

34
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.550
It was a blockbuster drug, you know, and still is using hospitals all the time.

35
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.620
Um, it's used, you know, there's the fentanyl patch people with cancer pain.

36
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.540
And then when you get a, like a colonoscopy, they give you fentanyl before that.

37
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.861
And then, uh,

38
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:14.580
women who have epidurals during childbirth that I believe is usually fentanyl.

39
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300
So it's still an important hospital drug.

40
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.140
<v 0>And so how did it come to be that this drug from the 1950s sort of</v>

41
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.570
ream merges and it reemerged during the rape scene? Is that what it was? It was.

42
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.730
<v 1>Actually before that it first started killing people a little bit at the</v>

43
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:34.490
beginning of the eighties. And, uh, nobody knew what it was and.

44
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.010
<v 0>It was from China then as well. No.</v>

45
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.170
<v 1>The back then, um, it was these kind of mystery chemists.</v>

46
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.200
These guys who there was this one guy in particular called George Marquat

47
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.560
and he was like a,

48
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.600
a genius maniac who read all the chemical literature.

49
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.160
He learned about Fen. Fentanyle like, I should try to make this.

50
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.200
I bet it would be a hit with, um, recreational users.

51
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.680
And so he started making it, um,

52
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.880
and it stumped authorities because these people would die.

53
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.520
They would have track marks in their arms. Like it was heroin.

54
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.400
They would have syringes,

55
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.840
but they tested them afterwards and there's no heroin in their system.

56
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.240
And so they're like, what is this?

57
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.750
And the only way they finally found out that there was this, uh,

58
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.990
scientist testing, racing horses,

59
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.550
and apparently fentanyl was being used to dough horses,

60
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.390
what to like, um,

61
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.790
so they would withstand more pain and would go longer and faster and could

62
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:38.430
really train harder. Yeah. And so, so this guy made the connection. He's like,

63
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:40.980
oh, this is fentanyl. This is this new thing.

64
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.660
And he actually predicted what was gonna happen.

65
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.300
He's like we are in trouble now because not only is there fentanyl,

66
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.340
you can make a new, if you ban fentanyl, you can adjust the molecule,

67
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.100
make another type of fentanyl when they ban that can make another one add

68
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.340
infiniteitem basically. Wow.

69
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.290
<v 0>So the, the thing with horses would be that they would be in pain,</v>

70
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.370
so they wouldn't run as hard.

71
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.850
So they would force them to run harder by dulling the pain, I.

72
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.570
<v 1>Guess. So, yeah. I don't know all the details of it, but you know,</v>

73
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.730
it's performance enhancing basically.

74
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.970
<v 0>And it seem kind of counterintuitive.</v>

75
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.370
You would think that like an opiate would like make them sleepy. Right. Well.

76
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.360
<v 1>I don't know all the detail. Maybe.</v>

77
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.920
<v 0>It just has a different effect on horses. Not sure.</v>

78
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.080
So then the internet comes along and through the internet,

79
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.080
people started scouring the medical literature and scientific

80
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:37.520
literature and chemical literature, and then they find fentanyl. Exactly.

81
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.590
<v 1>Yeah. Because back in the old days, um, you, you know,</v>

82
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.150
scientists would publish a paper.

83
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.550
They're trying to find a new drug that they can patent say the drug isn't a

84
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.750
hit, no one wants to buy it.

85
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.150
It goes on some dusty university shelf never is heard from again,

86
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.230
but in the internet age, all of these papers start going online.

87
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.820
And so these rogue chem that I referenced in the title of my book,

88
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.500
they start finding particular scientists who work on the type

89
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:09.700
of drugs they're interested in.

90
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.900
And then they start going through all of their papers and they pick out drugs

91
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.660
that, uh, they think would work recreationally.

92
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.260
And so when fentanyl first came out, it was totally legal people.

93
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:24.250
You could walk around with a giant bag of it. They couldn't do anything.

94
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.330
And so it said in motion,

95
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.290
this sort of cat and mouse game between law enforcement and drug chemists,

96
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:36.170
which really still persists to this day, although mostly in China now, have you.

97
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.130
<v 0>Ever experienced any opiates personally? I've.</v>

98
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.970
<v 1>Taken, yeah.</v>

99
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.800
Like Tramadol in like Tylenol three and stuff like that. Tylenol.

100
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800
<v 0>Three is opiates in it.</v>

101
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.600
<v 1>I think it's coding. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, which is a low level opioid.</v>

102
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.480
And I don't know to me, it, it always gets me stoned,

103
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:55.240
but it never seems to like, deal with the problem. I don't really like opioids,

104
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.720
you know what I mean? It like, I can't sleep and it's just not my.

105
00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.800
<v 0>Thing. It's not your thing. Yeah.</v>

106
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.640
I had the old nyel had codeine didn't it did it. Didn't it did.

107
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:08.240
We we've been over this haven't we didn't. We try to figure this out. I,

108
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.080
I remember I took nyel in the nineties. In the late nineties, I was sick.

109
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.240
It was like the last time I ever took it. And, uh, it was wonderful.

110
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.670
I was lying bed going. This is amazing. I don't even give a. If I'm tired.

111
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.390
<v 1>I'm sick. A lot of people say that.</v>

112
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.830
<v 0>I justs taken into the bed. I was like, ah,</v>

113
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.950
and another time I had a morphine drip,

114
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.910
I had knee surgery and they gave me a little morphine, drip and anything,

115
00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:33.230
every time I wanted, I could just hit this button Uh-huh and get a little more,

116
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.590
I was just hammering that button just line in bed.

117
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.740
<v 1>Well, that's like the irony of, of the opioids.</v>

118
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.460
It can produce the greatest pleasure. Yeah. And the greatest pain,

119
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.180
you know, I think Sam Quinonas said that like, um,

120
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.820
how can one molecule be,

121
00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.700
give you the greatest pleasure imaginable and the worst pain imaginable?

122
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.330
<v 0>Yeah. Lenny, Bruce had some crazy quote about it, something about that.</v>

123
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:03.090
It was like getting hugged by God. I forget what the quote was, but, um,

124
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.970
I, I I've never had experience with heroin. Um,

125
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.890
but I knew I've known people that were addicts quite a few and

126
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.050
a couple of 'em that died.

127
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.650
And one of 'em that I knew there was this guy who was a pool hustler back of my

128
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:21.560
pool playing days in New York. And, uh, his nickname was Waterdog.

129
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:24.800
I forget his real name. I think it was bill, but no, that was Buffalo.

130
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.880
Bill's his other nickname. I don't remember his real name, but anyway,

131
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:31.760
this guy was, uh, an elite pool player, big time gambler. But the thing was,

132
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.760
he had to do heroin first. So like,

133
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.960
they would play games for like $10,000, these huge games.

134
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.990
And all these guys would come from the tri-state area.

135
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.670
They would come around to watch these matches and bed on the side. And, uh,

136
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.790
water dog would go to the bathroom and everybody knew what was going on.

137
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.790
He would go and shoot up and then he would come and he would sit on a chair like

138
00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.700
this, just sit there for like half an hour to sit there.

139
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.460
Wow. And then, and then when it was over, when the half hour was over,

140
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.300
he was just like, okay. And then he would go and play.

141
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:11.780
He was in his own and he couldn't miss. And he was playing this guy,

142
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.620
um, this, this dude that I knew named George, who was also a big time gambler.

143
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.370
And he was just screaming and yelling that this, when he is on this stuff,

144
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:23.730
he can't miss Uh-huh. He can't, he had no nerves, like nothing bothered him.

145
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:26.330
You could scream in his face. He would look at you like an alien.

146
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.130
Like it didn't didn't bother him at all. Like, like an insect would look at you.

147
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.290
And he had this incredible ability to play,

148
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.690
like at the very best while he was up on heroin.

149
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.880
And I remember thinking what a bizarre drug, I mean,

150
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:46.640
think about all the amazing artists that's claimed. Yeah. I.

151
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.040
<v 1>Think about jazz and all the.</v>

152
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.760
<v 0>Improv. Yes. Yeah. Lenny Bruce. So many people. I mean,</v>

153
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.600
you go down the line, all these different folks. I mean that, uh,

154
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.840
mugha that I have out there of Hendrix. Yeah.

155
00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:01.000
Those heroin got called heroin in Toronto.

156
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.520
<v 1>I mean, yeah. I mean, people like, people prefer heroin to fentanyl.</v>

157
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.880
Like I've heard it described as more soulful people say. Mm.

158
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.200
But the thing is you can't even get heroin in most parts of Amer like pure

159
00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:16.030
heroin name anymore. It's all cut with fentanyl.

160
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.670
<v 0>Well, you gotta go straight to Afghanistan, right?</v>

161
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.710
<v 1>Um, that's probably, uh, probably Mexico.</v>

162
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.350
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Now it,</v>

163
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.030
can you grow poppies? Like, can that be grown in the, uh, yeah.

164
00:09:31.031 --> 00:09:31.230
I've.

165
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.750
<v 1>Heard that. Like, if you just walk around on the street,</v>

166
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.900
like nice native neighborhoods, you'll see P poppies all the time.

167
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:39.100
You just don't even know you're looking at 'em and that's.

168
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.620
<v 0>Actually heroin. Like you could get heroin from those poppies.</v>

169
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.540
<v 1>Yeah. It's like, if they grow NA you know, organically,</v>

170
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.100
and you're not doing it on purpose, it's no big deal.

171
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.340
But if you start cultivating it, that's when it becomes you just got a place.

172
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.100
Stupid.

173
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.380
<v 0>I don't know. They're beautiful. Look how pretty. Yeah. Do you,</v>

174
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.570
so have San Pedro cactus on your lawn, sir? Oh, those are pretty too, right?

175
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.730
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. You, um, yeah. I mean those CACTES,</v>

176
00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:08.650
I can't imagine there are a lot of trained police who know what to look for.

177
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.730
I feel like if you're gonna grow some Mecal, you know,

178
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.610
asculine cacti or whatever, you're, that's the move you're.

179
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.760
<v 0>Probably gonna be all right. Just mix it up with right. Cactus.</v>

180
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:18.480
Pretend you're a cactus enthusiast. Yeah.

181
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.200
&lt;laugh&gt; just have it all over your lawn. Some succulent. Yeah.

182
00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:23.000
I'm just really in a cactus man. They're pretty. Yeah.

183
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.960
And that of water 'em I go out of town a lot. Yeah, exactly. &lt;laugh&gt;

184
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.840
so when you know, what, what scares me is, you know, I mean,

185
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.960
I just know people that party,

186
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.870
I know people that take pills and it seems like

187
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.550
fentanyl is things are getting cut with fentanyl a lot. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

188
00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:45.710
it's not, it's not a,

189
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.670
an uncommon thing for all sorts of different drugs.

190
00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:51.950
Like how many different drugs are cut with fentanyl street drugs? Oh.

191
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.630
<v 1>Man. It is like an awful time to be a young person on the party scene. Um,</v>

192
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.940
you know, like when I was coming up and probably when you were coming up,

193
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.500
they'd said the dare program and all that say no, just say, no,

194
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.500
they made it sound like every drug could kill you. Right. Right. Right. Now,

195
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:12.260
unfortunately that's like almost reality that basically

196
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.260
any pill or any powder,

197
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.970
if you didn't get your pill from CVS, you know,

198
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:21.930
your pain pill or from a pharmacy that's legit, it could be cut with fentanyl.

199
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.730
And that's how, uh, prince died.

200
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.970
That's how Tom petty and the rapper Mac Miller all died is that they were

201
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.130
thought they were taking legitimate pain pills. Is that really what.

202
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.810
<v 0>Happened? That is really what happened. Yeah. So prince,</v>

203
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:38.010
so prince got his from the, the black market. Yeah. Well.

204
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.480
<v 1>The guy who supplied prince has been,</v>

205
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.560
he refuses to really say exactly where he got it, but he's still alive. The,

206
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.640
the guy who got him for prince. Yeah. Where is he? I don't know.

207
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.360
I think in Minneapolis or something.

208
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.303
<v 0>They should find that.</v>

209
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.640
<v 1>Guy. Well, the doctor is also, um,</v>

210
00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.920
like settled or something. I think the doctor might have been involved somehow.

211
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.280
It's a mystery where he got these pills, but you know,

212
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:07.880
prince was like doing the splits on stage at age, you know, 58 or whatever.

213
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.800
And he was definitely a guy who walked around with a lot of pain.

214
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.830
He was Jehovah's witness. He was not a recreational drug user,

215
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.670
as we think about it, you know, he was,

216
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.870
he wanted pain and I'm sure for years his handler or whatever,

217
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:24.830
was buying him off the dark net mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or whatever. And,

218
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.110
and they were fine for years, but,

219
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.670
but then a drug dealer trying to save some money, increase profits,

220
00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:34.900
cut it with fentanyl and &lt;affirmative&gt; whew. That's, that's how he died.

221
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:36.740
And I heard Tom petty actually, um,

222
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.140
S suffered an injury or hurt himself at one of his concerts.

223
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.940
And he just literally walked outside and asked like the first

224
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:52.420
sketchy guy he saw if he had any pain pills. And that's what killed him.

225
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.423
Jesus Christ.

226
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.730
<v 2>Oh God.</v>
