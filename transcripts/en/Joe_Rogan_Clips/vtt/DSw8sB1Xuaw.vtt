1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>They have a racism bias training and they have these people sit down</v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.760
and they talk to you about like, this is what you do. You know,

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.240
if a person of color walks in this way, like, you know, it's, everybody's like,

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.570
Chad, I don't want to be racist, but it's, I don't think it works, man.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.463
And I don't think it's,

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.360
it's not the way that racism sucks and the way to

7
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.970
stop racism is be a good person. Yeah.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.590
Like the more good people we have, they'll inspire more good people.

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.430
We will all realize that racism is stupid and we should treat people as

10
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:36.990
individuals. Always, whether it's by gender, by sexual preferences,

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.990
origin of your, your ancestors. I don't care. I mean,

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
I care in terms of like sexual preference. I care in terms of like,

13
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.410
whether I think you're attractive or not. I care in terms of like,

14
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.680
whether I decide, you know, the, to, you know,

15
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:57.240
like there's some people that want to hang out with really loud people.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.660
There's some people that want to hang out with people that are like more demure

17
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.240
or some people that are more introspect. Everybody likes different.

18
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.680
You're allowed to like different,

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.690
but you're not allowed to discriminate against someone and keep them from

20
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.150
occupation or keep them from place to live.

21
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:15.930
And if we all thought that way and just treated people on the merit of their own

22
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.440
individual personality and character, we'd have a way better world.

23
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.430
I think we could all agree to that.

24
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:24.540
As soon as you get in these groups of all white people or all Asians are all

25
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:29.310
like come on, man, that's too small. That's such a gross generalization.

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.870
It's too small of a common denominators to weird the, what, what you are like,

27
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:37.620
how much of what you are, is where the you're from and, you can't control it.

28
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.290
How much melanin you have in your skin. That's ridiculous.

29
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
What you are is all the things you've you've experienced and all the life

30
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:48.420
you've lived and all the lessons you've learned where you are at this moment.

31
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.550
You know? And if I like you at 30,

32
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.370
I might not have liked to you when you were 18. You might've been annoying,

33
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.440
but I meet you when you're 30. And I'm like, Hey, you're cool. You know? And,

34
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:59.010
and everything's great. Yeah. And that should be okay too.

35
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.300
It's not like we have to distinguish between people just being,

36
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.940
not interested in talking to any one individual and what

37
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:10.400
is wrong with,

38
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:15.000
with gross generalizations and then tribal ideas of like

39
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.730
sticking to only people of European ethnicity.

40
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:22.680
And these are the good folks of European descent. Like you're crazy.

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.790
Civilization's been down that road stupid. You can't do that again.

42
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.840
And you can't do it for Asians either. You can't do it for black people.

43
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.040
You can't do it for anything.

44
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:35.670
You can't say everybody's great in this group because it's nonsense.

45
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.430
It's so simplistic. It's not just simplistic. It's dangerous.

46
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.620
And it also makes people scared to say anything about it. Like,

47
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:42.930
I don't want you thinking that I hate the thing I like about.

48
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.150
<v 1>The thing I like about not censoring hate speech is if you let hate for</v>

49
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.320
people say they're hateful things, you know where the dangerous people are.

50
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.100
So if you're censoring, like you can't use this where you can't say this,

51
00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:00.460
you can't say that you don't know who the weirdos are. That hate black people.

52
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.870
They hate gay people that hate the trans cause everyone's acting exactly the

53
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:06.220
same. Like everything's cool.

54
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.420
And then when they're with their friends or whoever, the people that,

55
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.830
that think like them, then they're, Buting all their hate and. And.

56
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.100
<v 0>Well, whenever people can express themselves freely,</v>

57
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.140
there's going to be some sort of suppression.

58
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.240
And if there's some sort of suppression,

59
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.670
there is a resentment of that suppression.

60
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.600
And then there's just like this anxiety and this tension, you know, it's like,

61
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.273
when,

62
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.480
what it's essentially what we're saying is when you think about people in

63
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.970
business meetings, how they're forced to communicate,

64
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.970
how they're forced to dress, how they're forced to communicate,

65
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.280
they'd go into this very professional building.

66
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.550
All the women are dressed professional. All the men address professional,

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.970
they all get together in these conference tables. And everyone is agreeing,

68
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:53.800
even though these are sexual beings who may be like cocaine,

69
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.060
you know, and they they've been, you know, they

70
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.350
they've, they've been to music festivals and they've maybe been to burning man,

71
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.840
but they're contained, they're contained in this room.

72
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.530
And they're talking about statistics that talk about probabilities.

73
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.980
And then someone brings up diversity. Yes. Diversity, all very important.

74
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.810
And everyone is behaving in this super weird world

75
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.710
where you can't, you can't move outside the box. Even remotely. If you,

76
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.810
if you move outside the box, even a little, if you say,

77
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.080
you know about the guy from Netflix,

78
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.570
he got fired because he used the N word in a descriptive. He was,

79
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.310
he was talking about Tom Segura,

80
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:37.300
special where Tom Seger was talking about changes in language.

81
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.210
He he's talking about, uh, some words you can't say anymore. And he says like,

82
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:44.290
you can't say retarded. He says this just because he said that,

83
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.360
just because he said that people were getting angry at him and protesting and

84
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:52.870
groups were trying to boycott Netflix. I remember him, right?

85
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.610
So this guy, I don't remember his name, but he was, uh,

86
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:01.900
one of the big wigs at Netflix. And he said, he was like,

87
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.680
it's like saying the word to an African-American person.

88
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.420
That's what it's like to say.

89
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.840
We're targeted to a family where someone has someone who's down since.

90
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.580
So he was defending, he was talking about how offensive that word is to people.

91
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.560
So it was like, this is the issue that we're dealing with.

92
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.900
So you're just talking about it in a very matter of fact, way.

93
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.630
They report him for saying the word and he gets fired.

94
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.120
And apparently he did this twice. This is what I read in the same context. Yes.

95
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:34.060
The same exact context. So he's repeating this thought, it's,

96
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.930
he's basically having, um, where they're doing an intellectual exercise. Like,

97
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:39.550
is this, is it the same to you?

98
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.740
And he's saying it around African-American people,

99
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.560
but in saying it around African-American people,

100
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:49.540
just the fact that he said the word uttered it like abracadabra,

101
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.670
just saying it was enough for him to lose his very high profile job at Netflix

102
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:57.710
was apparently well-liked. And it really do you think, do.

103
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.700
<v 1>You think we're becoming like this because our lives are too easy. Th that,</v>

104
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:06.560
like, if we had to struggle to get food and protect our families,

105
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.920
we wouldn't be worried about this word or that word or.

106
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.160
<v 0>Feelings a hundred percent. Yeah. I think we're, we're,</v>

107
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.430
we're seeking out altercations when we,

108
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.220
cause I think we're programmed for a certain amount of, uh,

109
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.590
interaction with people that's unpleasant we're sir,

110
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.320
we're programmed for a certain amount of competition,

111
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.020
whether it's verbal or physical, we're programmed for it.

112
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.330
I think it's what got us to 2018 in terms of the crazy

113
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:34.910
history of the human species. Is it marched across the world?

114
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.370
Just imagine leaving Africa, what do you got animal skins on your feet?

115
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.460
And you're walking out like what, who are the? Were those people?

116
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.610
And what kind of people did they encounter? That's our ancestors, you know,

117
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:50.000
our ancestors had just been dealing with forever. And when there's no,

118
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.840
like there's some over there. There's 78 different gender pronouns.

119
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.770
And the reason why you don't think so is because you're a cis-gendered white

120
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.200
privilege piece of. All white people are racist.

121
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.480
And then you start tweeting up a storm. Those,

122
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.340
if you go to those people's pages, one of the things that I've,

123
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.340
I'll find a person who says like preposterous.

124
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.060
And if I'm not blocked by them from some gigantic auto blocker,

125
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.010
which sometimes they do these block, everybody.

126
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.210
But if someone I'm not blocked by them, I will bookmark them.

127
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.910
So instead of like following them so they know I'm following them,

128
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.220
I would just bookmark them. So I'll just go back.

129
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.140
So I have a file on my computer called crazy,

130
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.630
and I will go to this crazy page and I'll see them go through these

131
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:32.810
manic depressive states and freak out about the world.

132
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:34.970
And then every now and then something will get tossed in there about

133
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:37.290
relationships. You know, I mean.

134
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.590
<v 1>Because I know, I know it is, it is harder for a, someone of color,</v>

135
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.530
like a black or Arab or you know,

136
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.060
Asian around some people around some people, but saying white privilege.

137
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.630
Like there are a lot of white homeless men.

138
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.940
And whenever I see a white homeless dude,

139
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:58.400
I always want to give them money and go wipe white privilege.

140
00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.810
<v 0>I do. There's no doubt.</v>

141
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:03.080
There's an advantage in this current climate and world to being white.

142
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.260
The problem is the white people are not guilty of doing anything just because

143
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:09.590
they're privileged. Right? So instead of calling it white privilege,

144
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.650
what we need to concentrate on is the people that are racist.

145
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.950
That's the only real problem. The only problem is racist people.

146
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.860
And even though why people get discriminated against less,

147
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.020
the problem was saying things like black people can't be racist because racism

148
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:28.850
is a power thing. And by people of power over black people, that's, it's,

149
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.230
it's a intellectual force. They know it is when they're saying it.

150
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.250
And it's just one thing that they just repeat and you're supposed to accept it.

151
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:38.960
And it's a part of what we were talking about earlier,

152
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:42.230
where there's a game that's going on. And the game is,

153
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.690
I want you to say the 78 different gender pronouns.

154
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.780
I want you to say that I want you to do that. I want you to refer to me as that.

155
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:51.530
I want you to refer to me as this. I want you to do what I want you to do.

156
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.330
I want you to stop using certain language.

157
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:56.760
I want you to start saying certain things. Cause that means I win. Yeah. That's.

158
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 2>Counterproductive because you're not teaching anyone how stupid it is to just</v>

159
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:04.320
discriminate based on race. All you're doing is blocking out that being honest.

160
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.450
<v 0>I think that that isn't doesn't even work. Anyway.</v>

161
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.580
I think what really works is leading by example.

162
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.810
I think that's the only thing that works.

163
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.570
What I think we learned from is we learned from people better than us.

164
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.320
You see someone who is amazing and she's super smart and she's really kind to

165
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.600
people who are, God it. I got to be more like her. Yeah.

166
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.580
I think that's where we're missing that aspect of it. The, the, the chastising.

167
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.180
See, this is the problem with what goes on with the left in particular,

168
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.280
the brutal mean, uh, assault on people,

169
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:35.310
these Twitter gangs and S Facebook gangs.

170
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:39.690
They target someone and attack them. You are not changing anything.

171
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:43.410
And in fact, you are going to get people who see this horrible,

172
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.350
and they're going to go those people. I'm going that way.

173
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.440
And they go the other way and you recruit people to be on the right.

174
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.980
And this is literally how Donald Trump became president. One of the,

175
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.510
one of the major factors was people were noticing a trend and the trend was

176
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.400
towards these crybaby preposterous liberals that call it,

177
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.610
everything is racist. Everything is sexist. Everything is homophobic,

178
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.120
everything.

179
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.560
And everything falls into this blanket of transgression where there's no

180
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:14.310
innocent and everyone's guilty. And then when they find they run out of targets,

181
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:17.280
they go after each other for not being progressive enough to start calling each

182
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:19.800
other out. They find jealousy in the movement.

183
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.030
<v 1>Something that really makes me happy that when I see people that have been</v>

184
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.810
calling people out for years, and then they get called out, I'm like, it five.

185
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.790
<v 0>Well, you know, I've seen it happen. You know, I've seen it.</v>

186
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.160
I've seen it happen with, with people I've seen,

187
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.690
I've seen them become w Jamie Kilstein is a friend of mine.

188
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.960
And Jamie Kilstein was at one point in his life.

189
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.030
This really progressive activist guy who was like everything.

190
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:52.230
He said, had to be like super male feminist and super trans positive.

191
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:55.230
And I mean, he was like trying so hard to be accepted,

192
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.680
but he's super honest about it too. He's done a podcast about it and, you know,

193
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:02.190
he'd call people out and he'd be really mean and really vicious.

194
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.230
And then he realized he was getting all this anxiety from it.

195
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:08.340
He had to check his Twitter all day. He'd be walking the streets, couldn't stop,

196
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:10.350
like checking his Twitter, see what the replies were.

197
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:14.850
And he was realizing he was caught in this weird hate spiral. You know,

198
00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:16.230
even though he was proporting,

199
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.500
he was acting on the premise that he was a good person.

200
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:21.270
He was going to call out all these bad people,

201
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.360
but he was like addicted to this weirdness. And then it turned on him.

202
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.530
It turned on him. Like some girls accused him of being creepy.

203
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.060
And it was like super minor, like trying to go on dates with people, like, just,

204
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.570
but that was enough that all you need is like one in that world.

205
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.800
Every in that world,

206
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.440
everyone is so hyper progressive and looking for any sort of deviation from the

207
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:46.830
pattern they can attack. And they just decided that this guy,

208
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:51.420
even though he had been like this model ally for, for a male, you know,

209
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:55.800
as a male feminist and for people of, um, of color and gave him,

210
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.320
stood for everything that they wanted him to. He's a piece of garbage.

211
00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.290
<v 1>Cause he's.</v>

212
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.690
<v 0>He's, he's heterosexual. Yeah.</v>
