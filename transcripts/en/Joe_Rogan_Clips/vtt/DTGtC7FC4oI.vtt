00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But again, that goes back to like,</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.400
you have an excuse all the time to do the wrong thing.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.550
You have an excuse all the time to go back to the familiar.

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.750
You have an excuse all the time.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.040
Why just say the whole world is against you and be right. But, so what now,

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:20.040
what now? What are you going to do about it? How happy do you want to be?

7
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.360
Your life will rise to the level you settle for and just to keep pushing.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.190
<v 1>What did you do? How did you get out of it? Like, how did you,</v>

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.480
what was the first job that you got?

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.540
<v 0>When I was homeless? I started cause I grew up singing. I was like,</v>

11
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:40.620
maybe I could get a gig somewhere and start singing. Cause I made money singing,

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.380
you know, like for my whole life, since I was little, like a hundred bucks,

13
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.550
200 bucks, but whatever. So I'd go around a coffee shops in the area,

14
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.150
but San Diego started to be a hotbed for signing activity. You know, grunge.

15
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.890
There was a kind of a grunge scene in San Diego.

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.230
And so I'd go in there and they, they charged you to sing there. I was like,

17
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:02.970
this is not ideal. Like they wanted me to pay them $200. I was like, yeah.

18
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:04.110
I was like, this is the exact.

19
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.140
<v 1>Yeah. And it was the idea that you would sell tickets.</v>

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.290
<v 0>They thought it was no, they thought it was like a signing.</v>

21
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.570
You would get signed. You know what I mean?

22
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.940
Because it became like so many record labels I guess,

23
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:19.410
were coming down at the time. I remember this one lady, like my friend,

24
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:22.260
let me sit in on his gig. So I go sing with him.

25
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.060
I'm starting to write my own songs. Oh,

26
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.890
I forgot to tell you how I started writing songs back at school,

27
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:30.510
but I'll tell you later. So, so he started writing songs, um,

28
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.050
and singing my own stuff. I get on my friend's gig. He's packed the place out.

29
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.710
I don't clearly, but he has it a crowded. There's like a door charge.

30
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.510
So I go to settle out while he's taking his gear down and this woman coffee shop

31
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.180
owner was like, you guys don't get the door money. And I was like,

32
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.350
what are you talking about? Like he brought all these people in. She's like, no,

33
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.660
she goes, you get the tip jar. And I was like, oh, I was like, you know what,

34
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.490
then why don't we get all your coffee and food money?

35
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.520
You could just give us that instead. She was like,

36
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.360
you don't get the food beverage money, you get the tip jar. And I was so upset.

37
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.390
I needed the money so badly. Like I didn't have food. You know, like I was,

38
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.420
I was really wanting some money from that gig.

39
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.310
And I remember I put my little finger in her face and I was like,

40
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.660
I am cursing you. Whoa, you, I know it so heavy.

41
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.260
I was like, you are stealing from the people that are giving you a living.

42
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.810
You're stealing from this guy. And I was like, you are,

43
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.730
you will go out of business. I was like,

44
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.350
nobody can stay in business doing this to humans. I was so upset at her. And I.

45
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.370
<v 1>Did he have a understanding with her or was he just raw.</v>

46
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.890
<v 0>There? He just didn't care. I was so blown away. I was like,</v>

47
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.600
he's just wanting to be easy going and didn't want to make her mad and wanted to

48
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:45.360
get another gig there. And I was just so upset.

49
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.920
And so I found this place. I liked this little, when I was living in my car,

50
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.070
there was a little tree that was flowering tree. And I like to park next to it.

51
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:54.060
So like that was my home.

52
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.150
And I noticed there was this coffee shop right there that was going out of

53
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:58.860
business and it was really off the beaten.

54
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.470
And so I went in there and I talked to the lady who owned it.

55
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.870
Her name was Nancy. And I was like,

56
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.440
do you think you could stay open for two more months? And she's like, why?

57
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.400
I'm like, if I bring people in, can I keep the door money?

58
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.080
You can keep all the coffee and food and like, we'll try and make it together.

59
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.700
And she said, yes.

60
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.980
And so I started going down on like the beach front in San Diego and I'd sing

61
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.993
like street sing.

62
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.260
And I'd tell people I'm singing at the interchange coffee shop on Thursday night

63
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:30.100
at six o'clock.

64
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.690
And two people came like it was two surfers that thought I was hot. I think.

65
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.270
And I did a five-hour show because bar singing, you do five-hour shows.

66
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.890
And I just thought I had to do a five-hour show.

67
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:43.720
So I started writing a ton of material.

68
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.720
Plus I was using writing not to steal and I was a prolific thief.

69
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.490
So I bet to become a prolific writer.

70
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.050
And so I did this five-hour show to these two guys.

71
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.840
I'm bleeding my heart out because I was so lonely.

72
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.990
And I realized I never tell the truth. Like nobody knows the truth.

73
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.270
I'm scared to death. I'm not a great person I'm stealing and I'm lonely.

74
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:06.520
And I was like, maybe if I tell the truth, I won't feel so lonely.

75
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.550
So I made a promise that I would write really honest songs.

76
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.050
So these poor two servers were subjected to five hours of like

77
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.070
bleeding out my vocal chords.

78
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.070
It was amazing. I made $10 and uh,

79
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.760
the next night and I would go sing all throughout town street corner, I'd say,

80
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.400
Hey, Thursday night. They knew where to see me. And it just grew,

81
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:34.510
it went from two people to four people, to eight people, to 40,

82
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.010
to 80 to capacity to people standing outside watching me seeing through the

83
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:43.300
window. And I got discovered, wow. Yeah, it was nuts.

84
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.553
Wow.

85
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.320
<v 1>That's a great story.</v>

86
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.180
What was that like? What was it,

87
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.230
what was the feeling like when it was at capacity and you recognize that these

88
00:04:56.231 --> 00:05:00.100
people were, that something was changing in your life.

89
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.380
These people are coming out to see you perform.

90
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.660
<v 0>The coolest thing and why I'm smiling is because I was changing. I,</v>

91
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:11.230
it moves me to tears right now. Even before the people came,

92
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:14.200
I felt a momentum shifting, you know, I just felt

93
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.210
I was getting better. I was getting healthier. I was getting happier.

94
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:23.440
My panic attacks. Like I found out how not to have them. Like,

95
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:26.710
it just made me feel good. And then when these people came,

96
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.780
I just bore my soul and I just didn't pull a punch. And they,

97
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.900
they liked me. And I know that sounds superficial,

98
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.930
but it wasn't because it was so authentically me,

99
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.990
I wasn't pretending to be better or more talented.

100
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.240
It was so raw and people would cry and I would

101
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.470
cry. And it was just such a real connection. Like for the first time in my life,

102
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.880
I had a real meaningful human connection and it wasn't

103
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.130
scary. It felt good.

104
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.310
And they would give me books to read and they would give me food.

105
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.770
And I didn't think it would lead to a record deal.

106
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.780
It just felt like being fed for the first time in your life, you know,

107
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.880
not hiding and not being fake and just being really authentic.

108
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.760
So it felt really good. And then when more people came,

109
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:15.910
it just took on a momentum that was like, holy.

110
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.750
<v 1>How much time is passed from the two people,</v>

111
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.610
two people standing outside.

112
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.620
<v 0>You know, I don't know, but six months maybe ish,</v>

113
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.700
something like that.

114
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.070
<v 1>It's a lot of change in six.</v>

115
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.190
<v 0>Months. Yeah. Maybe a little more eight months,</v>

116
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.900
but couldn't have been more than that.

117
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.520
Cause I don't think I was homeless more than a year.

118
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.860
<v 1>That changed how to feel crazy.</v>

119
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.260
<v 0>It was wild. It was cool. And you know, from like being on stage,</v>

120
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.170
but like I wouldn't make a set list and I would just feel the audience.

121
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:49.040
And like I talked,

122
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.610
I did a lot of tell those stories and like kind of like stand up.

123
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:57.530
I would just tell like just stories and jokes and just shoot with people in the

124
00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.900
audience. And they were just, these really live electric,

125
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.980
like kind of wild shows and make them dead quiet.

126
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.460
And I would just take little breaks so people could use the bathroom. And,

127
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.330
and when people started standing outside and they couldn't hear,

128
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.880
but they were just watching me through the window and the look on their face,

129
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.650
like to this day, like gives me chills.

130
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.520
Like they looked at me with like a certain look and it was like, holy,

131
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.950
like this is different. And they would stand out in the rain.

132
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.940
Like we put little speakers out there so they could hear,

133
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:28.070
and people would stand in the rain and just listen to me,

134
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:30.470
singing through the window with little speakers. And it was just like,

135
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.580
it was very humbling, like very, very humbling. Wow. Yeah.

136
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.090
<v 1>So then what happens? How do you get discovered?</v>

137
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.060
<v 0>There was a radio DJ programmer, excuse me.</v>

138
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.300
He ran 91 X, which is a really big radio station in the country.

139
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.100
They might have been number two in the country at the time,

140
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.650
heavy alternative station. Uh,

141
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.620
somebody told him about this girl singing in a coffee shop and that he should

142
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:58.460
come. And he came in. I could recognize new faces when they come in.

143
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.650
Cause it was this wasn't a big place, by the way. I mean,

144
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:02.630
this might've been 70 people that could fit inside.

145
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:04.280
That's a tiny cost developed a.

146
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.070
<v 1>Crowd. Like you were accustomed to seeing familiar.</v>

147
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.941
<v 0>Faces. Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:12.380
It was a loyal diehard diehard fan base.

149
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:16.310
Like tiny don't get me wrong, but I knew them. You know what I mean? It was,

150
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:19.490
it was like a little family in a way. And so this guy came in,

151
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.080
he had a goatee Swannell shirt on,

152
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.020
he looked kind of hard and he was sitting in the back and I remember singing the

153
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:27.020
song a thousand miles away. And he was just weeping like quietly, but it just,

154
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:30.860
tears were streaming down his face and he came up to me afterwards. He's like,

155
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:32.920
Hey, I'm at the radio station. And like, why don't you come in?

156
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.450
Like sing a song one night or something? And I was like, okay.

157
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.950
So I go in there still living in, um, oh, I got another car.

158
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.360
So I had a car to live in.

159
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.740
I'd saved up enough door money to buy a car cheap Carla couple hundred old car.

160
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.000
Um, so I get down at the radio station and I sing a song for him and we talk a

161
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:53.810
little bit and um, I guess he went ahead,

162
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:56.430
him and this guy named Lou Niles, put it, uh,

163
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.270
on the radio and it got requested by fans.

164
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.370
That's back when you could still request songs and they'd listen to it.

165
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.350
And it got somehow into the top 20, you know,

166
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.670
of this station, which is a big deal. Like top 20 on that station was like,

167
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.340
you know, labels pay a lot of money to promote their artists,

168
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.960
to try and get them into the top 20.

169
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.640
And this was like an acoustic guitar demo in the middle of like all this

170
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:24.390
grunge music. And so record labels, really how the,

171
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.480
what is the song that's showing up on this playlist?

172
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.390
And they would call him and he's like, it's this chick down at this coffee shop.

173
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.680
And so all of a sudden there'd be like these limousines pulling up and they

174
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:37.020
would give sweet little Nancy, you know, it was just,

175
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:39.660
she was having a banging business now, which felt so good.

176
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.970
And they would be like, she picked Juul.

177
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:44.190
Sony records is here tonight and I'd be like, all right.

178
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:48.270
I was so passe about the whole thing. It was very funny. Um,

179
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.530
and then they'd take me out to tacos and talk to me about record deals.

180
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.040
And then there was a bidding war. It was, every label came down,

181
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.120
every label they've flown from New York. They bring in bigger executives,

182
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:02.550
then they'd fly in. They'd come again. They'd you know,

183
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.230
all these limousines showing up.

184
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.180
And I was starting to got flown around to talk to different record labels.

185
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.410
And I thought I should take, I don't know.

186
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.210
I am. I'm kind of bad with time that way. I don't know, a couple months. So.

187
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.810
<v 1>And you, you don't have a manager, you don't have anybody speaking for you.</v>

188
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.710
<v 0>No, but I went to the library and I found this book.</v>

189
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.400
<v 1>How to manage yourself. Bye for dummies.</v>

190
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.220
<v 0>It was Don passing Haim, I think,</v>

191
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.410
called everything you need to know about the music business.

192
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.821
And that sounded good.

193
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.690
So I read it and I just learned about mechanicals and royalties and backends and

194
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:48.150
advances did your homework.

195
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.080
I did my homework and there ended up being a huge bidding war over me. Um,

196
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:55.980
all the labels just started like competing by this time I kind of found like a

197
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:58.590
defacto manager. Um,

198
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.160
I maybe got a lawyer here at some point, you know,

199
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.870
and this might now have taken more time,

200
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.390
but I realized because of reading that book, that and advances alone,

201
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:10.980
you don't get to keep the money.

202
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.550
You pay it back through record sales.

203
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.710
And so I did the math to see how many records that have to sell,

204
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:23.010
to pay back a million dollars. And it was a lot of records.

205
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.420
And so it was like having a bounty on my head as an artist. Um,

206
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.050
I almost didn't sign my record deal because I had just figured out how to be

207
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:35.100
happy. Like genuinely. I was really starting to figure it out.

208
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:38.250
And I knew it like inside myself, I was doing so much better.

209
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.350
And God forbid you take somebody with my emotional background

210
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.390
and they ever get famous.

211
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:49.170
I'm the recipe for every movie you've seen about every musician. Like,

212
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.620
and again, I didn't want to be a statistic and I fought.

213
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.540
So for my happiness up to this point that I was like,

214
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.550
I don't think I could trust myself to have a record deal and figure out

215
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:04.360
how to do that career without self imploding. So I almost didn't sign it.

216
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.280
I remember being on the beach one day and I was like, I wanted to do it,

217
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:10.840
but I was terrified of doing it.

218
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.980
So I made myself a promise that my number one job would still be to figure out

219
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.460
how to be happy. And my number two job would be to be a musician.

220
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.220
And then under the musician category that I wanted to be an artist

221
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:25.480
more than I wanted to be famous.

222
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.680
And so knowing those was like having my north star and I felt like I could

223
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:32.140
navigate and make decisions based on those things.

224
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.490
And so I went ahead and signed the record deal. I turned down the advance,

225
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.690
I turned down a million dollar bonus as homeless kid.

226
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.670
<v 1>Oh my God, it's so crazy.</v>

227
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.270
<v 0>And I took the biggest do that.</v>

228
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:52.660
<v 1>That's I would have taken that money for sure. A hundred percent out of the,</v>

229
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.540
like, I'll figure it out in the future, taking this money,

230
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.210
I'm getting a fat apartment, overlooking the water.

231
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:00.940
<v 0>It was not.</v>

232
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.620
<v 1>What I did as a homeless kid. You pass on a million bucks. He did.</v>

233
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.900
<v 0>But I took the biggest back-end anybody had ever been awarded.</v>

234
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.620
And so if I sold records, I was going to make a ton.

235
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.030
So because like under the artist category,

236
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:21.610
I wanted to be an artist more than I wanted to be famous.

237
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.810
It meant I had to put myself in an environment and in a position to win as a

238
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:29.350
singer songwriter and as a folk singer, no less at the height of grunge,

239
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.380
the odds of that working I knew were really slim.

240
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.500
And I felt like the bidding war over me was just much more of like a Dick

241
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:37.090
contest between all the labels.

242
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.400
I didn't think it necessarily had to do with my talent.

243
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.160
I thought I was talented, but I thought the odds were still really,

244
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:43.030
really against me.

245
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.250
And I had to put myself in a position to be able to

246
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.600
weather the fact that my first album may not be successful.

247
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.570
But if you have a million dollar signing bonus,

248
00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:59.080
you have to have your first let record be successful or else you'll get dropped

249
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.730
because you cost so much to the label.

250
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.260
And so I was just doing it to put myself in a position to make my art first and

251
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.690
to not leverage my art unduly. You know,

252
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:10.450
it's like saying you have to grow a pair, but you don't even have a tree yet.

253
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.620
Like I had to grow a tree, like the pair was a long way away.

254
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.570
And so I just tried to look at it kind of agriculturally or in a natural system

255
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:23.920
of like I have to grow. I have to plant a seed. I have to like grow a tree,

256
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:24.640
you know.
