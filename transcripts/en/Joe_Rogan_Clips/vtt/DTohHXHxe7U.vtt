00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Also on the podcast,</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.830
just like you got, just to talk to you on almost meet them,

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:10.500
talk to them in person and realize that there's, you know,

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.060
there's people in this world that can make the impossible happen.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.200
You interviewed him as well. Yeah. Twice. Yeah. Tell me what, what was.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.410
<v 1>That experience like for you?</v>

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.730
<v 0>So, uh, you know,</v>

8
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.230
it was quite incredible in the sense that he is a legit engineer and

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.710
designer, which is like a pleasure for me. I've talked to a few CEOs,

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.170
talk to Eric Schmidt, just the CEOs.

11
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.070
And they're a little bit more business oriented. Elon is really,

12
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.660
really focused on the fundament,

13
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.370
like the first principles to like the physics level of the problems of being

14
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:48.570
solved, whether that's space X, with the fundamentals of rock,

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.270
reasonable rockets and, and, uh, you know,

16
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.740
going into deep space and colonizing Mars, whether that's in neural link. Sure.

17
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.100
The getting to the core of the fundamentals of what it's like to have a computer

18
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.210
communicate with the human brain and with Tesla on the battery side,

19
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.320
sort of saying he,

20
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:08.640
he threw away a lot of the conventional thinking about what's required to build

21
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.050
first of all, uh, an appealing car electric car,

22
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:15.000
but also one that's has a long range.

23
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.560
That's something I don't know as much about. But then on the AI side, just,

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.370
I mean, he boldly said from scratch,

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.270
we can build a system ourselves in a matter of months. Now,

26
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.770
a couple of years that's able to drive autonomously and most people would laugh

27
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:35.910
at that idea that most robotics has said no, from the DARPA challenges,

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.660
most of them, the hardest problem is he said, no, no, no, no. We're going to,

29
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.530
we're not only going to throw away LIDAR, which is laser based sensor.

30
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.180
We're going to say camera's only,

31
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.810
and we're going to use deep learning machine learning,

32
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.790
which is learning based system.

33
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.380
So it's a system that learns from scratch and we're going to teach it to drive

34
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.390
from eight cameras and so on.

35
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.890
So just talking to somebody like that was that not

36
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.350
the fact that he thinks like that.

37
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.240
I think it's just fun to talk to people like that. I don't meet them off.

38
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.580
And let's say, I don't know,

39
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.510
I'll stop this of thinking that this task is impossible. Let's say,

40
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:18.120
why is it impossible? Is it really impossible? Well,

41
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.810
you find out when you start to think about most problems from first principles

42
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.350
is that it's not actually impossible. And then you have to think, okay,

43
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.640
so how do we make it happen?

44
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.830
How do we create an infrastructure that allows you to learn from huge

45
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:32.670
amounts of data?

46
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.140
So one of the most revolutionary things that Tesla's doing and hopefully other

47
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:40.260
car companies will be doing is the over the air software updates.

48
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.220
Just like the update. The, you got the fact that just like on your phone,

49
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:48.360
you can get updates over time means you can have a learning system,

50
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.620
a machine learning based system that can learn and then deploy the thing and

51
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:56.970
learned over time and do that weekly. That sounds like maybe trivial,

52
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.870
but it's nobody else is doing it. And it's completely revolutionary. So cars,

53
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.640
once you buy them, they don't learn most cars. Tesla learns that.

54
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.510
That's a huge thing. I forget about us autopilot, all this stuff.

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.580
Just the fact that you could update the software.

56
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.500
I think there's a revolutionary idea.

57
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.830
And then they're also doing everything else from scratch.

58
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.280
This is the first principles type of thinking the hardware.

59
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.360
So the hardware in your car, I don't know when you got the Tesla,

60
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.570
but it should be hardware version too,

61
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.830
but that hardware performs what's called inference.

62
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.780
So it's already trained.

63
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.680
It's already learned its thing and it's just taking in the raw sensory input and

64
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.060
making decisions. Okay. They built that hardware themselves from scratch again,

65
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.923
ballsy move.

66
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.270
Now they're building what they're calling again. He's such a troll,

67
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.290
but they're calling dojo is the name of the,

68
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.820
the specialized hardware for training the neural net.

69
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.300
So training the models, what training is, is the learning side of it.

70
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.040
So they're building their own like supercomputer at Google has a TPU to improve

71
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.180
the training tape. You was a Stanford tensor processing unit.

72
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.470
It's a same thing as the more general and video has graphics processing unit.

73
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.220
GPU's that all the nerves, all the people like me have been using on, um,

74
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.670
for machine learning to train your own networks, uh,

75
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.470
it's what most also gamers use to play video games, right? But they have,

76
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.470
they have this nice quality that you can train huge neural networks on them.

77
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.050
Okay. TPU is, uh,

78
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.520
is a specialized hardware for training neural networks.

79
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.850
GPU is allow you to play video games and train your own networks.

80
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.660
TPU is clean some stuff up to make it more efficient, energy efficient,

81
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:46.840
more efficient for the kinds of computation y'all know, works need.

82
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.950
Google has them, a bunch of other companies have them, you know,

83
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.460
most co most car companies would be like, okay,

84
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:59.320
let me partner with somebody else to you from Google to use their TPS or use

85
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.200
NVIDIA's GPU's Tesla is building it from scratch.

86
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.520
So that kind of from scratch thinking is, is incredible.

87
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.080
And, um,

88
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.840
the other two things I really listen well that I like about Musk is,

89
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.650
uh, the hard work we live in a culture like so many people,

90
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.420
like I often don't sleep. I do crazy in terms of just focus,

91
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:27.190
stay up nights sometimes. And I'll often people recommend to me that, you know,

92
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:30.310
balance is really important. And taking a break is important.

93
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.990
Know that you re re rejuvenate yourself, you returned to with fresh ideas.

94
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:37.090
All those things are true. Sleep is important.

95
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.330
You had dead people on the podcast tell you how important sleep is,

96
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.040
but what most people don't don't advise me

97
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.440
is hard. Work is more important.

98
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:51.370
Passion is more important than all of those things like that should come first

99
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.420
and then sleep empowers it rest and powers that rejuvenation powers,

100
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.580
especially in engineering disciplines, hard work is everything.

101
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.970
And he's sort of unapologetically about that.

102
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.840
It's not like a come come to us, come work with us.

103
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.520
It'll be a friendly environment with free snacks. It's like,

104
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.860
you're going to work the hardest you've ever worked on whether you

105
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.310
agree with him or not on the most important problems of your life. Okay.

106
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.600
I like that kind of thinking, because it emphasizes the hard work.

107
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.000
The, the other part it was in terms of meeting them in person.

108
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.430
I don't know if you got the interact with that off,

109
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.440
because when he was on Mike with you, he was very, um, he was very kind of.

110
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.420
<v 2>It's hard to bring it out of him in person before that he was very jovial and</v>

111
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:46.280
friendly and huggy. He's great. And then once he got on the microphone,

112
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.010
I was like, oh, this is heavy lifting. Bring this out of him.

113
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.480
So then we started drinking, drinking, and then, oh yeah, it helps a lot.

114
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.650
And then once the drinking, you know, then, then I got to see who he is.

115
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.140
<v 0>Yeah. That shouldn't have, I should've done that. But yeah, no,</v>

116
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:06.740
I mean, the, the thing that's really interesting is he is gone.

117
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:09.110
If you look at his biography, like the kind of, uh,

118
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.190
stress he's been under in terms of, he's been at the brink of losing his,

119
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.230
his companies several times and he, you know,

120
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.010
he lost a child and he's just, he's a,

121
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.410
that's the other thing inspired me as, um,

122
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.210
is that he can be a good dad while running so many companies.

123
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.900
Because like I often wonder about, you know, the kind of hours I pull on,

124
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:36.170
what I'm doing. Can I have a family? Can I really give them?

125
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.740
Cause I'd love to be a father and can I have a family? Can I be a good part?

126
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:40.400
Like, can I.

127
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.200
<v 2>Very, very, very, very difficult.</v>

128
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.060
If you're working 18 hours a day to give your kids the time that they need, but.

129
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.830
<v 0>It's possible not 18 hours. There's always, I believe in there's in life day,</v>

130
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.510
months, maybe years that you have to do the 18 hours a day, but not always.

131
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.230
Yeah.

132
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.600
<v 2>Right. Do the sprint sprints. Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.820
And then establish everything and then sit back.

134
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:05.300
But the problem with a lot of guys like him is first of all,

135
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:09.170
it's very difficult to find a replacement for the way he thinks. Right.

136
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.650
So if he's, if he's a CEO of these companies and he's the one,

137
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:14.960
who's the mastermind behind all these things,

138
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:19.580
and then he wants to step back finding a commensurate replacement

139
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.110
is insanely difficult because most people who would be a

140
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:27.110
potential replacement are already off doing their own.

141
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.130
<v 0>And there's not many people like him. That's an interesting,</v>

142
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.300
that's a actually the disappointing thing to me is that he's a,

143
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.150
his kind of thinking is a, is a Verity. I'm not,

144
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.920
I'm not sure why that is exactly.

145
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.910
<v 2>Well he's, I would joke around about it, but it,</v>

146
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.860
I think there's a,

147
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.270
there's a spectrum of evolution and his mind is

148
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.080
clearly way more advanced than my mind. There's,

149
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:57.630
there's something going on in his mind, in terms of his, uh,

150
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.630
attraction to engineering issues,

151
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.810
solutions to global problems,

152
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.230
solutions to traffic problems, pollution problems, all the,

153
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.810
all the things that he's the internet. And he's trying to put,

154
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.000
he's trying to give the world internet. I mean,

155
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.310
he's got all these things going simultaneously.

156
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.570
And one of the things that I got out of,

157
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.670
and when I was talking to him was that he almost has a hard

158
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:25.290
time containing these ideas that are just pouring out of his

159
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.120
head, like a raging river.

160
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:31.590
Like he's trying to capture handfuls of water and is raging river of

161
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.050
ideas. That's going through his head, you know?

162
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.930
And when he described his childhood that he thought that everybody was like

163
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:41.520
that. And then as he got older, he thought he was insane. Yeah.

164
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.620
<v 0>And I've, I can relate to that. I've I've, I'm trying to learn how to talk,</v>

165
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:49.200
but I have trouble talking because, uh,

166
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.570
it's like a million ideas running in my head. Again,

167
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:53.310
anything you say I'll immediately start,

168
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.810
there's these like weird tangent that go off and I want to start thinking about

169
00:09:57.811 --> 00:09:58.200
them.

170
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.180
<v 2>That's true with a lot of people in your line of work.</v>

171
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.820
<v 0>And I think so. I think that's kind of puzzle solving.</v>

172
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:04.020
Like that's where the comfort is.

173
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.850
I'm just surprised that a CEO is able to continue being that kind of puzzle

174
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:09.660
solver.

175
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.670
<v 2>You see that tweet that he made about his plans.</v>

176
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.560
Like you put a tweet up and I think it was 2006.

177
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.130
And then it's, he's essentially done all those things.

178
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.030
<v 0>He's done all those things. Now, the thing is most people,</v>

179
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.960
so a lot of people love you on Musk, but there's a,

180
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:31.260
quite a large community of people that don't love him so much.

181
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.310
<v 2>Well, that's always the case. Not at all. I don't with anybody. Great.</v>

182
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.480
<v 0>I don't, I don't know.</v>

183
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.540
<v 2>If that's always the case. When is it not the case? Who does,</v>

184
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.380
who accomplishes as many things as that guy does where everybody loves him?

185
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.420
<v 0>It's a difficult, I mean, I'm not a historian.</v>

186
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.880
And I could say it's a Steve jobs.

187
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.280
<v 2>Terrible example. So many people hated that guy. So many people hated that guy.</v>

188
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.490
I have personal friends that are involved in technology that wouldn't use apple

189
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:01.620
products because he's such a. It sure.

190
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.820
They didn't want to have anything to do with them.

191
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:04.410
They knew people that were engineers under him.

192
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:06.210
They said it was horrible and mean,

193
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:10.260
and it just required so much would scream at people and insult them.

194
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:14.280
And you know, it had these ideas in his head that he needed to get done.

195
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.200
And if you couldn't work the hours that you needed to do what he

196
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:23.010
wanted to accomplish, you know, he would treat you like. Yup.

197
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.750
<v 0>You're right. I, I just wish the world was better. I think. Cause I,</v>

198
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.540
it like with all people like that, like with Steve jobs and with Elon Musk,

199
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.670
when he dies, people will always you'll remember the greatness. Right?

200
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.800
Yeah. So that's, that's how it seems to work.

201
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.140
It's just sad that you can't celebrate that currently.

202
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:43.770
But I do think there's one particular aspect of his personality that I also

203
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:48.270
share that people off really bad, which is like you said,

204
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.630
um, he had a plan, but he's laid down that plan.

205
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.770
He keeps promising things and he keeps being like a year or two or three

206
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:58.990
late. And that really,

207
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.670
I don't know if it actually angers people or if people that already don't like,

208
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:06.070
you use that as a thing to say why they don't like you,

209
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:10.690
but it's certainly a thing that people say a lot. Yeah. And,

210
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.140
but I think that's an essential element of doing extremely difficult things is

211
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:19.120
over promising and trying to over-deliver that's the whole point is to

212
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.950
say, to make all the engineers around you believe that is doable in a year.

213
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.970
That's essential to do it in two years. So like that,

214
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:32.080
that kind of end truly believing it is, uh, it seems to be essential.

215
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.740
<v 2>Didn't he have people pay full price for that Roadster.</v>

216
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.790
Like you got on a list. Yes.

217
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.550
So you paid a quarter of a million dollars for a car that's essentially

218
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.570
vaporware. Yeah.

219
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.730
<v 0>But the thing, so I don't know,</v>

220
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.520
there's a little bunch of financial people that get like mad at that kind of

221
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.480
idea. Like there's investors, you know, it's like, it's,

222
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.030
I think it's the most shorted stock in history.

223
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.340
<v 2>But he keeps kicking. I don't, this confuses the out of people.</v>

224
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.830
<v 0>To me it's the stock market is the most boring thing ever. And people it's,</v>

225
00:13:04.831 --> 00:13:08.530
it's a, it's a gambling. Yes. And so you trying to say,

226
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:12.340
you're an expert in investing in the stock market. I blocked,

227
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:15.730
I removed those people from my life because there don't say anything,

228
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.500
any interesting ideas. Uh, I said it, but, uh, uh, the,

229
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:24.730
you know, when you're doing legitimate investment, yes. Uh, that's,

230
00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:26.800
that's a really important service to society.

231
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.950
But if you're commenting on the fundamentals of engineering problems,

232
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:34.870
that real engineers are trying to solve, that's not interesting to me the,

233
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.460
so it, that kind of stuff upsets, I think financial folks,

234
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.710
but the beautiful thing is when you have people buy vaporware and

235
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:48.790
you bring that vaporware to reality, that's the amazing thing. Yeah.

236
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.260
<v 2>He will definitely bring that Roadster to reality. If he doesn't die,</v>

237
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.300
that Roadster will happen. If he dies bail out now, same with it.

238
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.150
<v 0>Same with that insane cyber truck.</v>

239
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.160
<v 2>Cyber Chuck is awesome. I it's so ridiculous.</v>

240
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.950
<v 0>If he lives long enough, you better believe there's humans being put on Mars,</v>

241
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.590
whether it's him or he gets everybody else.

242
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:12.761
<v 2>See that one.</v>

243
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:17.470
I'm skeptical of just the type of people that are going to want to go.

244
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:18.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
