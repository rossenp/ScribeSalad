00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.123
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 1>And it's like, when you're trying to get social,</v>

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.160
like what happened to me with the, with, uh, defending that,

4
00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:08.640
that kid situation where it's like, well.

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.840
<v 0>Explain that because most people don't know what you're talking about.</v>

6
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.200
Like most people don't know the circumstances. So.

7
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.840
<v 1>So, uh, there was this, this guy on, uh, who has a, a three year.</v>

8
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:21.670
He had a three year old boy that he claimed his trans ended and,

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.390
uh, identified as a girl and, uh, started, you know,

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.110
putting dresses on the kid and, uh, treating him like a girl. And, uh,

11
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.550
I was planning on giving him hormone therapy, so they don't go through puberty.

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.710
And this dude has like power in Hollywood, you know? And, and, um,

13
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.390
and I just called him out and I, I got swarmed and I just didn't stop.

14
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.950
Cause I'm like, I'll die on this hill.

15
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.860
<v 0>Yeah. That's a hill to die on.</v>

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.580
When you're deciding that a three year old is done developing and understands

17
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:47.940
their identity. I, it drives me crazy.

18
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.940
What you we're talking to is akin to like a seance where you find out that you

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.860
are a Roman emperor from 1700,

20
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.820
that three year old barely understands how to express himself. The,

21
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.420
the idea that a three year old can get,

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.410
give you a complex definition of their sexual and gender

23
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.250
identity at three,

24
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.450
and that this isn't so that you should go in and chemically influence that kids

25
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:13.730
being.

26
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.490
<v 1>Sterile make 'em a unich. Yes. And it's like, and it,</v>

27
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.490
and it's a project it's insane. And it's a projection of the father's ego.

28
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.320
It's not even like, is it, uh, yeah. Yeah. The virtue say, oh, it's,

29
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:27.560
it's just a coincidence that it's a San Francisco like NPR guy that like

30
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.880
everyone in Hollywood has his back for some reason. Even it's a child.

31
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.920
It's like, uh it's it's.

32
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.840
<v 0>What was the circumstances? Explain what, what?</v>

33
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.840
<v 1>So this dude, uh, John Hodgeman, who I thought I was cool with, uh,</v>

34
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:43.510
I met him doing a morning radio show and he was like, when Brooks said, uh,

35
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.710
PC ruining comedy or something,

36
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.510
all these com comedians were like going against Mel Brooks. And I'm like,

37
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.190
wait a minute. Are we the bad guys?

38
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.710
<v 0>Now what comedians though?</v>

39
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.870
<v 1>Uh, Paul F Tomkin was talking really? Yeah. And I was like, dude,</v>

40
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.950
you're like the bad guy from footlo now, you know? &lt;laugh&gt;. And, uh,

41
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.620
and so I'm just being open about this cuz my, and,

42
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.580
and am I it's like, there's, there's a few things I'll stand behind free speech.

43
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:13.980
Don't the kids, you know, don't hurt the kids don't hurt the kids. Yeah. Like,

44
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.060
yeah. Just, just be good to the kids. You know? It it's like, because.

45
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.500
<v 0>That's you it's, I mean, it's you mean that's what every,</v>

46
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.330
every child is you all of us. I know, like,

47
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.650
especially when you're a little tiny person, you,

48
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.650
you have this insane responsibility as a big person when you're dealing with a

49
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.610
little tiny person. And.

50
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.090
<v 1>Now that I have a tiny person, that's what it made me more of a, uh, a,</v>

51
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.130
a man and an adult. Like, I, I, I just felt so much more responsibility, a good.

52
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.810
<v 0>You a hundred percent. Cause I learn on the job too. You, you learn on the job.</v>

53
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:46.000
Like you realize along the way, like, oh,

54
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.560
I'm like literally dealing with a blank slate. And I can't even process this,

55
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.000
that my bizarre,

56
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.040
ridiculous life of telling jokes. And in your case,

57
00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:01.960
playing songs with pianos and ridiculous that you say on Twitter. Yeah.

58
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.680
This somehow or another qualifies you to raise a human being.

59
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.710
It's so intense.

60
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.680
<v 1>It's so intense. And also it's like, I, uh, I I've always thought I was, uh,</v>

61
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.880
a good guy, but not like I ever thought I was like,

62
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.200
deserving of anything special, you know? But then once you see a kid,

63
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.270
he he's pure still, man, you know, I'm like, I've done some,

64
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.270
you know? So that's why I think just as myself younger,

65
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.390
I wouldn't have been quite as like into,

66
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.910
I've always stuck up for the underdog and people being abused and.

67
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.590
But now I'm like, I,

68
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.950
I have to be better for like the next generation. Cause I see,

69
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.860
&lt;affirmative&gt; see him look at me like humans can be good. Yeah. He's like dad,

70
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.300
dad, dad, dad, you know? And I'm like, yeah, holy dad. Dad's a good guy.

71
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.660
Yeah. You know? And I'm like, I never really knew if I was a.

72
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.660
<v 0>Good guy. Right. And this is a good experience between you and him. He's,</v>

73
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.420
he's enjoying it immensely. Oh, that' dude, I that's.

74
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.220
<v 1>Giant, you know, ands that's giant. And it's just like, he watches me,</v>

75
00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:01.130
watches me, hit my foot with acts. And I was like, don't do what that.

76
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.650
<v 0>Judge does. Do you ever think about the fact that,</v>

77
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.130
and this is a conflict that I've discussed ad nauseause with some of my friends

78
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:12.530
that every one of my friends that I know came from a up place. Right?

79
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:17.090
Like all the people that I'm friends with were a SCO or Joey Diaz or anybody red

80
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:21.320
band or Duncan, although their childhood chaos. Right.

81
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.800
Ahafi like everybody's childhood was a mess, you know? Yeah. I think it's a,

82
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.080
I think.

83
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.040
<v 1>It's a to make a good comic. That's still a good dude. I think it's a,</v>

84
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.680
it's a combo of like, love like your grandfather and chaos. Yeah.

85
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:36.960
Where it's almost you chaos or else we're just killers. &lt;laugh&gt; right.

86
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.520
<v 0>Well, that's the problem, right.</v>

87
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.470
I think that God comedy and murder are so closely related.

88
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.350
<v 1>I know. And we're just on the good side. That's so we call it.</v>

89
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.270
<v 0>Killing. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean, that is literally why we call.</v>

90
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.110
<v 1>It killing. Cause my mom listened to our last podcast and she was like,</v>

91
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.070
I love that you're friends with Joe. Like you guys both have like,

92
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:55.990
you're kind of up at good guys. &lt;laugh&gt; and uh,

93
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.950
where it's like you experience these like, uh, traumatic events and, and you,

94
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.140
you experienced damage, you know, know, and then you,

95
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:05.300
you have paths in life and you're like, I'm gonna seek the good in this,

96
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.620
but we're still, you know, low Paul's control comedians, but still, you know,

97
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.860
we're not just killers.

98
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.420
<v 0>Well, we're, we're actually nice people, but we're,</v>

99
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.460
we're realizing we're nice people in the middle of a, a,

100
00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:19.980
like a life with a tremendous amount of momentum of chaos behind chaos.

101
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.890
And then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, whoa, hit the breaks. Yeah.

102
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.890
<v 1>Okay. Yeah. Like belly the B, man. You know, it's like,</v>

103
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.690
I might as well have had a Viking for the last 10 years where you're just Viking

104
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:32.610
it up and it's like, yeah. And then you see the,

105
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.650
the order you need the chaos in order, you know, and you see the order with,

106
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.130
with a child and then you see these people trying to exploit children.

107
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.880
And I was just awake, you know, I'm just like, you know what, you.

108
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.440
I'm like I'll I'll I don't.

109
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.960
And then people in LA that I thought were my friends, not good friends,

110
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.560
not like comics, but like middle management. That's what the evil is. Well.

111
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.240
<v 0>You know what it is, man. It's like the supporting transgender rights,</v>

112
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.880
eclipses all the logic involved and the subtle nuances of human behavior and

113
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:06.520
sexuality. And the idea that a three year old could have any right.

114
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.880
Any notion of like what it's gonna be like to be eight or what it's gonna be

115
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:15.640
like to be 16 or whether or not hormonal changes is going or going to affect the

116
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.950
way it expresses himself. So,

117
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.270
and also you are looking at this kid and you're deciding that this kid,

118
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.710
because there are three is going to be transgender and you want to turn them

119
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:27.030
into a girl. What if this kid decides he's a gay man in five years,

120
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.190
they kill themselves. Right? What, well,

121
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:33.870
what if they decide that they're bisexual in 20 years? You know, can't,

122
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.030
if you kill, if you care about that child,

123
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.460
you don't to interfere that with that process,

124
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.180
because I'm not the same thing that I was when I was three.

125
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.300
And you're not either, no,

126
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.740
no one is so to inject hormones and chemicals and even surgery

127
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.860
that we really have a very limited understanding about how much this interaction

128
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.860
between the scalppel and a baby body. How much of the impact that has you,

129
00:06:55.861 --> 00:06:59.650
you you're giving someone the green light is they were talking about like making

130
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:01.090
this kid a unich well.

131
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.050
<v 1>Yeah, they won't go through puberty. And so then.</v>

132
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.570
<v 0>It's like, what are they saying though? What are they saying?</v>

133
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:06.210
They were gonna do well, it's called hormone blockers.

134
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.210
<v 1>And I kept asking him directly I'm like, say yes or no.</v>

135
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:11.170
Are you gonna give him hormone blockers? Cuz it's fine.

136
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:14.290
If he wants to wear a dress, have some fun play time. Fine.

137
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.570
But you're gonna tell him he's a girl, but.

138
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.280
<v 0>Here's the thing. He's not even play time. It's like,</v>

139
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:22.360
what if the kid like feels better when he wears a dress fine.

140
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.120
Like we're all DEC we've all decided that pants and a shirt is the way to go.

141
00:07:27.121 --> 00:07:29.160
And if you don't wear pants in a shirt, I know you're a homo.

142
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.840
&lt;laugh&gt; like if you were sitting there wearing a big girl skirt

143
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.600
and, and why did I, what do I give a? Exactly.

144
00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:40.110
If you were wearing a kilt and I'm like, I, I love Scotland, right?

145
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.550
I wouldn't care. But if you, if.

146
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.510
<v 1>You and my brother used to on him at each other, well, sorry,</v>

147
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.350
I should' have said that loud. I have a little impulse control.

148
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.310
<v 0>That's not the worst thing in the world have in impulse control. Dave,</v>

149
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:52.950
dougstan on fi last week. A couple of days ago on a podcast. That's awesome.

150
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.830
Yeah. happens. I don't mean to cut you off. You were.

151
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.950
<v 1>Talking about the, the Scottish.</v>

152
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.670
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, who gives a if you dress?</v>

153
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:02.820
Like what I give a is if you step in and you in any way

154
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.100
interfere with the physical, sexual,

155
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.980
biological development of a child,

156
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:12.300
because you think it's the right way thing to do progressively that you think

157
00:08:12.301 --> 00:08:13.460
it's the right way, right.

158
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:16.900
Thing to do the right way to approach a three year old.

159
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.410
Like you are the problem you're oh my God, not, there's not, this is,

160
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:23.330
we're not talking about one. Plus one equals two.

161
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.130
We're talking about a super complex, very nuanced issue.

162
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.810
And if this child decides when it's X amount, years old, whatever, we decide 30,

163
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.850
whatever the we decide to take the decision to, to, to get gender reassignment.

164
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.320
That's a hundred percent cool with me. Of course have no problem at,

165
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.440
but that's a person who understands who they are as a fully developed

166
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.560
organism, not a baby three. That's a.

167
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.680
<v 1>Baby dude. And, and part of me it's like this. Like I see myself in the,</v>

168
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.720
in the kid where I'm like, of course I played classical piano and uh, knitted.

169
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.400
Like I used to like knit cloth. I used to weave, I, I went to.

170
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.360
<v 0>What? Your full, the, the thing we, your, your piano teacher. Yeah.</v>

171
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.280
<v 1>Yeah. Like my P uh, like my dad is like a, my parents are, uh, married.</v>

172
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.041
They have great marriage,

173
00:09:09.041 --> 00:09:11.840
but it's like almost like a reverse gender marriage in a way where my dad's like

174
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:15.230
a flamboyanthopper singer professor and my mom, like six,

175
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.030
one love sports wear sweatpants. You know,

176
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.670
like my first bit was I was the only guy in the straight closet, you know,

177
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.510
&lt;laugh&gt; I used to be like, my dad would be like, let's go see rent again, son.

178
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:28.670
And I'm like, I wanna play catch with mom. You know, that's hilarious. And so I,

179
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.030
I played piano, so I was a kid. I, uh, what about your piano teacher? Yeah,

180
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:36.260
when I was 11, my piano teacher became a dude and, and the bit I,

181
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.900
I tried to work on, but people don't believe like some of the best.

182
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.860
<v 0>By the way. That's a long time ago. How.</v>

183
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.380
<v 1>Old are you now? Oh, I'm 37. So I was 91. That was the OG. Whoa.</v>

184
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.740
<v 0>That's that's OG surgery.</v>

185
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.700
<v 1>Oh, that's and do my pianoes right now is like, Owen's totally trans friendly,</v>

186
00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:52.540
like we're friends,

187
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.410
but I don't think he realizes what's it become &lt;affirmative&gt; you know,

188
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.410
cuz it's like, now it's like, oh,

189
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.010
you don't believe in making a three year old a unich you're full of.

190
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.450
<v 0>Hey. Yeah, this is,</v>

191
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.690
this is not wise because if you just look at it in,

192
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.290
not in terms of like how a child should identify,

193
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.090
but in terms of like the biological process of a developing human being,

194
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.600
it's very, very touch and go. We don't really understand out what it is.

195
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.360
This is what you should try to do with a kid.

196
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.480
You should try to give them nutrients.

197
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:24.360
You should try to give them love and try to give them safety and try to give

198
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:27.000
them challenges. Totally. Then like give them things to get over. But,

199
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.920
but the idea that you are gonna decide by your conversation with someone who

200
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:33.600
just started talking 12 months ago.

201
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.920
<v 1>They're still themselves. They don't know how to talk yet.</v>

202
00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:37.310
They should it in their pants.

203
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.270
<v 0>But they literally don't know how to talk yet.</v>

204
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.510
<v 1>I know. It's like, I identify it's like, how the does.</v>

205
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.310
<v 0>That work? Do you wanna be.</v>

206
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.030
<v 1>A girl? OK. Okay. Like my son just dances. Like he's always dancing and.</v>

207
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.230
He loves the piano. He does what dad dad does. And it's like this.

208
00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:54.870
Kid's probably trying to impress his dad and his dad's this. It is like, oh,

209
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:58.140
being trans as brave dad. Right? And then they're gonna make,

210
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.420
they're gonna make moves where the kid can't go back.

211
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.620
<v 0>Can't go back. Let your life is over. You.</v>

212
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:07.340
You literally turn their life down a dark path because

213
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.460
here's the thing. And this is super unpopular to say, but the bottom line,

214
00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:16.540
whether you decide to become a transgender person, whether you decide to,

215
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.370
you know, to suppress those ideas,

216
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.930
it is at this current stage of our understanding of medical science,

217
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.530
impossible to actually turn you into a woman. Of course.

218
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:27.610
<v 1>X, X, X.</v>

219
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.530
<v 0>Y. Right. So what we're gonna do is have some reasonable factsinially</v>

220
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.490
and it's gonna be more reasonable in different people. And some people,

221
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:39.080
they have a slender frame, you know,

222
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:42.560
some people have built like davidtuua and it's just like, whoa, let's grow.

223
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.440
Okay. I gotta go. You know, like, you know who davidtuua was big time,

224
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:48.600
heavyweight boxer from the, the nineties. And.

225
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.800
<v 1>You've touched on a body dyssmorphia with like, uh,</v>

226
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:52.520
weightlifters where it's like, you know,

227
00:11:52.521 --> 00:11:55.280
there's certain people that just aren't comfortable in their own skin and wanna

228
00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.520
alter it, like with like,

229
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
whether it's bigger boobs or cutting their Wiener off or some. And,

230
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.600
and as a very big personal Liberty guy, I'm all about you doing that.

231
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.200
But you don't make that decision for the kids.

232
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.600
<v 0>You don't make the decision for anyone that's under and the age of</v>

233
00:12:08.601 --> 00:12:11.040
comprehension. And here's the thing, like what is that age?

234
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.070
Because they say a frontal lobe doesn't really fully develop until you're 25.

235
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.790
Yeah. Ask Geico. Yeah. Yeah. They won't. They won'ture, you, they won't.

236
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.990
<v 1>Yeah. They won'ture you as a male,</v>

237
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.670
the insurance is up until you're 25 cuz you're not developed.

238
00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:24.790
But what about a girl? Uh, I think it's a little earlier.

239
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.910
I think girls develop a little earlier. I know.

240
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.110
<v 0>I know I'm. I'm calling some sort of red pill organization.</v>

241
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.420
<v 1>And so long story short, I make these, uh, problematic statements and then my,</v>

242
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.420
uh, agent drops me.

243
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.340
<v 0>And uh, yeah. How did your agent drop you for saying a three year old?</v>

244
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.780
Shouldn't be given chemicals that kill his Dick and balls.

245
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.580
<v 1>Cause I was rocking the boat, man. It's the. But.</v>

246
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.620
<v 0>But imagine if you just put it that way. So what you are is pro giving kids,</v>

247
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.340
Dick killing chemicals. Is that what you are? Just let me know. Right? It's.

248
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.810
<v 1>Kinda when it's like words are violence,</v>

249
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.530
you hold up your fist and you go word or violence like that.

250
00:12:57.531 --> 00:13:00.570
It immediately cuts for the. But for some reason it's not these days,

251
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.330
words are violence. I mean, that's a big thing now. And it's like, uh,

252
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:08.610
this college Yukon dropped me. I, I like a good gig. And they said, uh,

253
00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:12.570
because your views, uh, uh, we can't, you can't work here. And.

254
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.560
<v 0>Then did they specifically talk it views?</v>

255
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.640
<v 1>Yeah. I even tweeted the email cause I was sick of this, man, which views?</v>

256
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.240
The trans kids. It's only trans kids. That's my whole thing. But it's.

257
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.403
<v 0>Trans babies.</v>

258
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.320
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; dude. It's Todd. They're toddlers. They're like three, three dude.</v>

259
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.240
It's and, and I I'll die in the hill, man. I even asked my brother. I like, uh,

260
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.240
my buddy's brother die. My buddy, Mike, uh, Mike boo, uh, Mike from, uh,

261
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.270
sore and scale. Like dude, I literally was like, I'm I'm unemployed.

262
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.710
And he had me like read, uh, uh that's when you know your friends are man,

263
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:46.790
he's like, yo, will you read this? You can be like a da in this murder podcast.

264
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.030
I was like, great. He's like, I'll throw you some cash. I thought I was out.

265
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.710
I'm like, brother, can I do some more tree work? He's like 20 hour.

266
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:56.700
You got boots. I'm like, dude was prepared, man.

267
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.900
<v 0>But think about that, that you,</v>

268
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.020
as a guy who I've known for a long time has been a successful professional

269
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.100
comedian are really always that close to being pushed aside and

270
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.100
not given work anymore over something. That's totally logical.

271
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.100
<v 1>Dude. I just gotten a development deal, like true TV and.</v>

272
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.770
It's not even like I was doing bad. Did they did.

273
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.770
<v 0>True TV? Keep the development deal. Did they been, did I even have reps.</v>

274
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.603
<v 1>Anymore.</v>

275
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.490
<v 0>But do you talk to true TV? Like, Hey it's Owen. No, they're.</v>

276
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.450
<v 1>Cool. People. I, I just ha I've just been so like.</v>

277
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.490
<v 0>So the reps all abandoned you by saying that you don't think three year olds.</v>

278
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.400
Well, yeah. And.

279
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.610
<v 1>Trannie yeah. And also I guess I, I was saying it, uh, problem.</v>

280
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.800
It was like problematic. You know, I was, uh, I was, I was too many, too much.

281
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.760
I was just, I was poking people that aren't allowed to be poked that this,

282
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.520
these powerful middle managers, you know, what were you doing?

283
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.520
Just saying you're wrong, dude.

284
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.590
<v 2>I.</v>
