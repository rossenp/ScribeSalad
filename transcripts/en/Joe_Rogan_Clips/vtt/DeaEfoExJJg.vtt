WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.321
<v 0>I mean, dude.</v>

2
00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:04.320
Do you remember when we used to think that nobody could beat Tyson? Yeah.

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.680
Remember dude, when we were little, when we were young,

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.640
um, we thought, I, I think it was like, when did he lose 86?

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.680
Did he lose in like 1986 to bust Douglas? Yeah. What year was that? 90, 89,

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.030
90 Google that, um, he moved,

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.630
he did it while it was,

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.550
I was definitely doing comedy at the time and I definitely saw it with my

9
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.350
friend Ron after the fact February 11th, 1990, 1990.

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.190
So from that point on,

11
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.790
we knew he could lose &lt;laugh&gt; before that every Tyson fight, like man,

12
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:44.420
I'm I gotta bother watching. Why do people won't even wanna fight that guy?

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.860
They're just getting killed? What were the odds of him winning like 40 to 42?

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.460
I think 42 to one somebody got paid. Somebody got paid some crazy number.

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.660
I think it was 42. I think it was one of the highest underdogs ever that won.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.460
Yeah. 42 42. And he won by knockout. Buster Douglas was fed.

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.410
Fantastic back then, man. He him up. Huh? Well dude,

18
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.850
Buster Douglas is a crazy example of a guy who always had a tremendous amount of

19
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:14.770
talent. He was always regarded as like people that were in the know in boxing

20
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.323
I'd, you know,

21
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.050
heard them talk about him and they would always talk about how smooth he was in

22
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.970
training. And when he's at his best,

23
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.520
he's a literally like a world championship fighter,

24
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.920
but he never totally put it together in far as far as his discipline and

25
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.860
training camp.

26
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.680
But then his mom died and he decided he was gonna Mike Tyson up for his mother.

27
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.360
And he trained really, really hard.

28
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.520
So it was a perfect storm of Mike Tyson being king in the world. You know,

29
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.230
he's just everybody up. Doesn't even feel like he has to train anymore.

30
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.790
He's just, just being, he's just being the world heavyweight champion.

31
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.270
That's what, that's what they're like.

32
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.910
The reason why they become that guy in the first place is cuz they have this

33
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:58.470
ability to indulge and excess and go crazy.

34
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.870
He's buying tigers and Lamborghini and. And along the way,

35
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.340
Buster Douglas for that fight trained like a demon and still, almost lost,

36
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.500
still, almost lost.

37
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.500
That's how good Tyson was when Tyson was in his prime as a knockout artist,

38
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
he was so lethal that even though Buster Douglas and him fought and Buster

39
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.500
Douglas eventually wound up knocking him out.

40
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.730
He knocked him out after Mike Tyson knocked Buster Douglas and had him hurt.

41
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.010
And Don king after the fight, even protested and said that the,

42
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.050
the count was more than 10. And that when Buster Douglas was down,

43
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.690
the referee gave him extra couple seconds to recover that he shouldn't have had.

44
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.290
I remember that was like a, a big protest after the fight. But even then,

45
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610
I mean, we, even with training,

46
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.720
you know B not taking this guy seriously at all,

47
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.560
even then Mike Tyson still knocked Buster Douglas down and almost knocked him

48
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.360
out with one punch. What roundm did he knock him out? Buster Douglas?

49
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.200
Not the longest, not the longest Tyson fight he ever had. Right? I,

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.320
no he's had decisions. He had decisions. Yeah.

51
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.480
I think he had a decision against bone crusher Smith.

52
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.480
<v 1>Video here has both, both knockdowns, uh, simultaneous.</v>

53
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.320
So you can see like the different 10 counts, I guess. Okay.

54
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.480
<v 0>Let's see it. Boom. He cl he clipped him in an uppercut, right?</v>

55
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.110
<v 1>There's 3, 4, 8. He's he's only on three on the left.</v>

56
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.870
He's like I'm five or six on the right. Oh, that's so.

57
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.830
<v 0>Different. &lt;laugh&gt; oh, that's so different.</v>

58
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.830
He was counting me rub number out there. Yeah. Yeah. Oh man.

59
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.990
And it was the end of the round. Yeah, it was the very end of the round.

60
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.790
So Buster got a break. So look that that's that's just how go, go,

61
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:40.540
go to the very beginning again, please. Five, six seconds.

62
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.420
Go to the very beginning again so I can see the punch here.

63
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:46.060
It's sit right there. Yeah. Boom. Look at that. Uppercut.

64
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.820
That's a beautiful uppercut Tyson. Nailed him with

65
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.840
2,

66
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.220
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 9, 10. You're out. You're.

67
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.090
<v 1>Out bust. Yeah. He is only on eight on Buster there. No, he's.</v>

68
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.050
<v 0>Out. He's out. Like do that again. &lt;laugh&gt; that seems like he's out, right?</v>

69
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.370
Doesn't it? Yeah. Let's try it again. Ready? Boom. He goes down

70
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.110
1,

71
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.960
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. He's out. Someone distracted him on number eight.

72
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.720
Yeah. Does that stop the count? Is that how that works? It was a longer,

73
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.120
it was a longer pause. Is that how works a split second.

74
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.000
When he turns around and go away, watch the.

75
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.600
<v 1>6, 7, 8 on Mike Tyson here.</v>

76
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.000
There's 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8.

77
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.950
<v 0>Just like nine real 10. Yeah. That guy's way quicker. Is that the same guy?</v>

78
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.190
Yeah, the same rapper. Oh, that's ridiculous. Dude. You suck at counting.

79
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.110
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; he was counting in Spanish with the other one.

80
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.630
That's a crazy hard job, man. You're in the middle of the moment, you know,

81
00:04:56.631 --> 00:05:00.190
there's all this hype going on. Didn't pay the least the out. Yeah.

82
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.900
But it's the same guy because, uh, it's the same fight. So how,

83
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.220
how does the same guy count real slow for busted Douglas and

84
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.060
way faster for Mike Tyson?

85
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.340
<v 1>The description of the video says this clearly demonstrates that he gave him</v>

86
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.220
both the exact same amount of time. Oh really? That's not what I thought.

87
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.490
<v 0>We saw. Let's try that again. Let's try that again. Let's count for Tyson.</v>

88
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.930
We'll count for Tyson first. Ready? Tyson goes down. Boom.

89
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.610
What a combination bust. Douglasson two three' clock.

90
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:35.650
4, 4, 5, 6. She's gonna 12 seconds.

91
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.060
8,

92
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.700
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

93
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.440
<v 1>He got knocked on a ride around 50 on the, on the clock. On the screen.</v>

94
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.800
You can see it. And.

95
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.840
<v 0>How many seconds was it? Uh.</v>

96
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.400
<v 1>He picked him up at 38 is when he knocked him.</v>

97
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.680
Was actually in there 51 okays like 13 seconds.

98
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.560
<v 0>Yeah. Or</v>

99
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.440
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

100
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.400
They're both out. Yeah. They're both out. They called it either way.

101
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:11.720
You wanted the, the, the counting's definitely slower on Buster Douglas,

102
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.240
but they're definitely both out. But either way,

103
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.350
if you said then I bet butts, but instead of, you know, four,

104
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.990
if you've sped the count up by a second,

105
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.070
you don't thinkbuster or Douglas could have gotten up quicker.

106
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.390
I bet he could have. I mean, he was waiting for the guy to hit eight.

107
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.790
So he stands up. Right. Which what you do, you,

108
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.550
you take as much time as you can, especially after you got legitimately hurt,

109
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:37.300
like that. You're supposed to do that. So the, the question, like,

110
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:38.540
would he have been able to,

111
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.540
if the guy had counted a little quicker and you know,

112
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.780
eight came where seven was or six was, would he have been able to?

113
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.740
I think he probably would've.

114
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.020
The question is would a Tyson have been able to get to him with one punch before

115
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:53.620
the bell that might have knocked him out? Yeah. You know? Okay. Fight. You.

116
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:55.980
Get him back up again. And it's three extra seconds.

117
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.130
It Tyson storms forward connects with a punch Tyson Hass,

118
00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:02.810
two head shots with a faceal dude. Crazy shots. There's this guy right here.

119
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:05.850
Watch. Watch the white glove. Is he? The official counter is the afraid. The,

120
00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:09.690
the official count. This guy. That's the finger bro. He's countingous his,

121
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.930
nickname's the finger really? Well. He counts way faster. Watch him.

122
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:16.810
Let's watch the finger. What? 2, 3, 4.

123
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.440
And that's the last him,

124
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.200
but 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10. Oh yeah.

125
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.040
By the fingers. Count that dude's out. They're both out cold.

126
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.920
I'm going with the finger forever. Captain white glove. Michael Jackson.

127
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.400
They' counting Michael Jackson. That's what it is. We go with Mike magician.

128
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.310
Yeah, man. That's uh, that was a insane fight though,

129
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:42.990
because you couldn't believe Mike Tyson could lose. Even when I watched it,

130
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.150
I remember I heard about it first and then I watched it and I still remember

131
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:48.990
thinking, I can't believe what I'm watching.

132
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.350
He's gonna get up and he's gonna knock this dude out for sure.

133
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.550
Shouldn't believe he lost. It was like, it's over then.

134
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.030
You couldn't believe that he could lose. Well,

135
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:57.790
that's people don't understand today.

136
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:02.740
There's never been one that was as dominant for as like a scary

137
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.260
moment in like boxing history than Mike Tyson.

138
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.340
Because even though you knew Roy Jones was gonna up whoever he fought. Yeah.

139
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.820
The way he was gonna off, he even knocked him out with one punch it.

140
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:18.780
Wasn't gonna be this horrific storming by a destroyer.

141
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.610
Just common out. After your soul, Roy Jones would box your face off,

142
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.330
hit you with lead lead, left hooks and straight right hands.

143
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.730
That are way faster than anything you can duck. He would people up,

144
00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:33.170
but he would people up with a certain style and movement and speed.

145
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.770
Whereas Tyson would just destroy,

146
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.890
like hitting you like mugging you at the same time, man. It's like all anger.

147
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.520
So fast. The hood in you. And he was solid, like sledgehammer,

148
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.880
220 pounds, but moved like 160 pound guy. Like you couldn't believe it.

149
00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:48.714
At the time,

150
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.520
there had never been a heavyweight like him before there was heavyweights that

151
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.400
that moved amazing. Like Ali,

152
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.640
Ali had the most amazing footwork of anybody just smooth and flowing and change

153
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.920
what the game was, was in front of people. This, the ropey dope.

154
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.240
There's a crazy video of Ali that, uh, someone had on their, uh,

155
00:09:07.241 --> 00:09:08.080
Instagram page.

156
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.840
One of those boxing pages where he's fighting someone and the guy throws

157
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.440
2, 3, 4 punches of the,

158
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.430
and Ollie's got his hands down and just barely moving his head away with each

159
00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:22.350
punch, just like, you can't hit me. He just had a, there was a,

160
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.790
a magic about what he was doing that you were like,

161
00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:29.190
how is a heavyweight moving like that? Tyson jab too.

162
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:32.430
Tyson was a totally different kind of strategy, you know? And there,

163
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.980
those strategies will be argued to the end of time, like what would've happened.

164
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.660
If Mike Tyson had a thought, Muhammad Ali bolt in their primes,

165
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.820
what would've happened, man? What would've happened? It would've been crazy.

166
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:44.763
I'll tell you that.

167
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.700
If we had Mike Tyson and his very best before went completely crazy.

168
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.780
And he started giving out rolls Royces to cops and walking around with his tiger

169
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:57.610
at his underwear before all that stuff before biting yearsought. Yeah.

170
00:09:57.611 --> 00:10:01.570
Before for sure. Before biters, the biters thing was when you know,

171
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.090
a Vander was, you know, when a Vander beat him in that first fight,

172
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.290
no one could believe it. No one could believe it.

173
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.170
Even though Tyson had lost tobuster Douglas,

174
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.730
everybody assumed that Tyson lost because he hadn't been training and he really

175
00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:15.530
hadn't been, been focused.

176
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:19.360
And then when he went to jail and came outta jail and he looked jacked,

177
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.200
remember? Yeah. He looked way more jacked. He had a ridiculous six pack.

178
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:26.160
You remember that tattoo on his face son? No,

179
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:29.120
he got the tattoo on his face afterwards, right? Yeah. After jail,

180
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.680
I think he got the tattoo on his face in jail. Right? I don't think so.

181
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.030
I think he had mal tattooed on his arm.

182
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.430
What does this say here? Mike Tyson opens up. Oh,

183
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:45.830
that was when he got arrested by that Joe though. Joe ourio guy.

184
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:47.710
He had to do time in that Arizona.

185
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.750
He was living in Arizona for a while and he had to do that, Joe ourpy.

186
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.870
When they make you wear pink, you get pink handcuffs on. And

187
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.180
dude Mike Tyson though, when he was in his prime,

188
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.900
like that was when he just got outta jail.

189
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.140
That was the Mike Tyson fresh outta jail, like just jacked.

190
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.500
That was 95 first fight after release. That was against, uh,

191
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.980
some unfortunate white fella that looks like he would be, uh, what was his name?

192
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.170
Peanut mcnely yes. Peter mcnely. Oh, tough guy.

193
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.930
Just wasn't the video of him talking to hype up. The fight is hilarious.

194
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.090
If you go watch it now. No, he's hilarious. He was like, uh,

195
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.250
a guy who would be carrying the money bag. &lt;laugh&gt;

196
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.410
he'd be a guy that you would say bring him to Peter and Peter would break your

197
00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:39.000
face. Hey, you owe money. But boom. &lt;laugh&gt;

198
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.800
he was uh, a Irish guy. I remember him. Give me some volume. Jim gray,

199
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:47.400
looking young. And Dappper for just a moment. Before you go out into the ring,

200
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:51.320
your thoughts. Look at young Joey, Mike Tyson. Look at him. This is for

201
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.240

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:32.870
