WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>Him. Yeah. Unbelievable. And you remember when we did the Andre thing, right?</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.680
I mean, Andre's supposed to be afraid of the snake. Oh yeah. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.120
And he faints and fakes a heart attack and he's, you know,

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.000
laying there and poor Bobby, he and vomit, he,

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.680
and over there checking him pound on his chest.

6
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.280
Cause he's supposed to act like he's had a heart attack and somebody goes,

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.550
give him mouth to mouth Bobby. Bobby's like, are you kidding me?

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.430
That giant, that giant breath that you had, man from drinking giant breath.

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.310
I, I brother I love the giant to death, man. I mean,

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.670
when I first got into wrestling, I was refereeing like in 1974.

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.030
So, and they came to me and they said, look,

12
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:43.380
you're not refereeing tomorrow night. We want you to drive Andre around.

13
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.900
Why? So you were referee before you were a pro wrestler, right? Wow.

14
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:50.660
Which is actually the best way to start. Could you get a feel of it?

15
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.060
You get a feel of it. You,

16
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.060
you learn how to feel people and you learn how to judge people.

17
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.180
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you learn how to read people, you know, in the, in,

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.930
in the crowd you can read 'em. But um, so I got the, uh,

19
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:05.610
take care of laundry thing. They gimme a van. So laundry will sit in the back,

20
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.370
got him a beanbag chair. Just take him to the building. He'll do his thing.

21
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.890
Give him a ride back to the hotel. Cool. 70 miles. No problem. 80 miles.

22
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.450
Whenever. So we get through with the show and he's like beer.

23
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.000
Okay. He talks, he walks, you know, so I stop and get him beer. I'm like,

24
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.480
I'm gonna get a six pack. My self there, Andre. And he goes two cases.

25
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.400
It's an 85 mile trip, man. Um, yeah, two cases. I'm like,

26
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.480
two cases. I guess he wants some for his room. Right?

27
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.480
So we get back in the family. We start driving. I don't know about you guys,

28
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:43.190
man. Back. Even when I drink,

29
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.390
until I get into that first third or fourth hour, I got a.

30
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.390
Like every time I have a beer, I got a. I don't really buy beer. I just rent it.

31
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.630
You know, I rent it. Then I go get rid of it. But so after you know,

32
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:59.670
30 miles I pull Andre, sorry, I got a. You know, I get out the,

33
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.020
get back in the van. You don't no north thing mirror. Okay. Take it easy.

34
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.980
I hear, I hear the pop tops. Keep pop, pop, pop. He's with me.

35
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.100
He's with me. We get going closer. I gotta again.

36
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.260
Finally get there gets out. I'll get your beer. He goes,

37
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.300
finished what? He drank 48 beers.

38
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.210
Yeah. Right. You know, off, off you. Big goof. You know? And he leaves.

39
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.130
I get in there. I get in there. First thing I do. I'm checking with my hand,

40
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:35.490
make sure I'm putting my hand in. Cuz I figure this never got out to.

41
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.730
He drank two cases of beer and did not have to.

42
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.480
I don't care if you out drink me, but it. How can you do that?

43
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.960
I mean, I felt so inadequate. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. You know,

44
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.280
this guy drank 48 beers and didn't 48 beers and 80 miles. Yeah.

45
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:58.000
That's insane. That was nothing. Probably his hand would cover that beer up.

46
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.480
How big his hands were just an amazing athlete and an amazing man.

47
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.600
And to be in the ring with him was he was unbelievable when.

48
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.800
<v 1>Hawk, Hogan hoisted him up in the air.</v>

49
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.120
What's the do that photo of him with a regular size can of beer. That is insane.

50
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.040
<v 0>Doesn't even look real.</v>

51
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.910
<v 1>Doesn't look real. It's.</v>

52
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.950
<v 2>A 12 ounce. Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.510
<v 1>Yeah. That's a 12 ounce beer and it just vanishes inside his head.</v>

54
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.350
See if you can find that video of when Hulk Hogan picks him up over his head,

55
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.830
slams him. Yeah. That, that was insane. How much did he weigh?

56
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.070
5 5550 pounds now 550 pounds.

57
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.900
Just hoisting over your head with a bar with an Olympic bar. Impressive. Yeah.

58
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.660
But to do it with dead weight with a man. Well.

59
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.620
<v 0>The thing about it is it wouldn't happen unless Andre warn you to, right? Oh,</v>

60
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:50.660
of course. Because he's gonna boost himself. Of course. Yeah. I mean,

61
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.940
I remember him being in the ring one night and he says, slam me. I'm like, yeah,

62
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:54.420
you're.

63
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.180
<v 1>Kidding me. But this is insane. See like, look at this, this is insane.</v>

64
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.930
<v 0>But if you look where Andre's hands are, you see,</v>

65
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.290
he helps that he helps him pull him still.

66
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.690
He had me pick him up and slam him one night and he's like, slam me. I'm like,

67
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.250
no way. I thought he's kid. No. Yes sir.

68
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.690
And I went under and all of a sudden he's here and I'm like, holy. I've.

69
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.410
<v 2>Got him. Would he? He would use that athletic energy for that.</v>

70
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.130
<v 0>Then my legs just started to buckle.</v>

71
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.280
<v 2>Yeah. You gotta drop him fast Hogan. He.</v>

72
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.120
<v 0>Drinking with 300 pounds there. Least. Right. Look how big he look. How big.</v>

73
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.000
<v 1>Jacked. But Hogan was jacked. Oh yeah.</v>

74
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.360
You know I met him later in life, but I'd met him earlier too.

75
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.800
I ran into him on the street once and I couldn't believe how big he was. Oh.

76
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.400
And the second time I saw him, he was shorter. Cause he had so many,

77
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.150
a surgeries that his discs had been infused and he's still a giant human being,

78
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.190
but he wasn't as big. He's not.

79
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.150
<v 0>Six, eight no more. Yeah. He's about six, four hyper. Isn't that.</v>

80
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.070
<v 2>Crazy Piper told me when I was friends with Piper.</v>

81
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.390
He told me that when Hogan did that slam on Andre,

82
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:58.390
just like he could feel it just going all the way up. Is that true?

83
00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.830
Imagine I can only imagine.

84
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.380
<v 0>I line Andre one night and you know,</v>

85
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:05.940
I came in and doing him hard cause Andre wanted you to hit him heart. Right.

86
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.141
Which I used to say,

87
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.740
that's the most frustrating thing in the world right there and watch that.

88
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:13.860
And I'm like, you're trying to kill a and he don't even know it. Yeah.

89
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.180
So here I am hitting him as hard as I could. And he didn't know that.

90
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.220
So when he'd reach out and just know,

91
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.890
I mean he used to hit me and I'd be falling. Right. That's a lot of energy,

92
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.783
me falling.

93
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.250
He'd reach out and grab me by my hair and just zinc pulled me right at my feet

94
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.410
and just ripped a see, look here, I here.

95
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.170
<v 2>You two are, look at that. That, look.</v>

96
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.210
<v 0>At that now. Way two 60 there.</v>

97
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.290
<v 2>Wow. God, that's so crazy. That's you?</v>

98
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.240
<v 1>Yeah, that it's so crazy. Look how big he was.</v>

99
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.900
He was so.

100
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.300
<v 0>He did,</v>

101
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.560
he did a horrible thing to me one night in the room that he knocked me down and

102
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.280
I'm on my back and he stands on my hair. Oh.

103
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.600
And then reached out and grabbed my arms and pulled mm.

104
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.800
And just ripped my hair out. Wow.

105
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.920
Did you guys plan out like that or did he just improvise that in,

106
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.200
just went out there. We went out there and played. He liked me and I,

107
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.440
I liked him. Uh, Andre test you. And if you don't man up to him, he'll eat. You.

108
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.040
You.

109
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.230
<v 2>Could imagine. Did you get to see the documentary that they made on him? On HBO?</v>

110
00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:20.630
Talking about Savage? Uh, no. Andre. Yeah. No, no.

111
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.643
<v 0>No. I didn't see it.</v>

112
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.590
<v 2>It's really great. You'd really love it. Oh no, I don't want to. Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.630
She just hurt too much.

114
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.693
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.350
<v 2>It made me, it made me cry. So yeah.</v>

116
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.550
<v 0>It, it makes me cry and know what that man went through. What did he go through?</v>

117
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.030
What? Just people pointing and laughing right.

118
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.300
<v 2>In pain. Constant. His pain was unbelievable.</v>

119
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.540
<v 0>Yeah. Because of wrestling. No, because, because of the growth growth,</v>

120
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.660
continuing continu to grow continu, to grow, you know,

121
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.460
let's think about what a daily a day is. Well, a bed don't fit too well. Right.

122
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.300
Let's talk about hotels and bathrooms. Oh yeah. Where's he going to shut? Right?

123
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.210
Where does he it in the bathtub? No. Yeah.

124
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.810
That's only place could. Yeah. There's no toilet gonna take his.

125
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.610
Didn't he's gotta squish it in there. He just got it. No,

126
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.810
he just turned the shower on man. And let it dissolve it. Jesus.

127
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.370
<v 2>How'd you, how would you like to do hot yoga in that bathroom?</v>

128
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.610
With that shower to spring down?

129
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.040
<v 0>He took the in the bathtub. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.160
<v 2>Airplanes, cars. His home. Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.160
<v 0>Well he had his home with a giant house.</v>

132
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.720
So did he have his house set up for him? Yeah.

133
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.760
<v 2>Wow. It's another thing where Piper told me a great story, uh, about, you know,</v>

134
00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:37.400
how everybody would always, he would just get so harassed out in public. Yeah.

135
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.430
And they were out to drinking one night after shows and they were in on in some

136
00:07:41.431 --> 00:07:45.390
college town, like we'll say Madison, Wisconsin, or something like that. And uh,

137
00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:48.990
they're having some drinks at a bar and Piper was like these kids,

138
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:50.830
these frat boys, you know, they,

139
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:53.910
they noticed that a few tables away and someone, they,

140
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.790
an empty beer can hits Andre in the back of the head. It hits the ground,

141
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.020
you know, Andre, he looks around, oh,

142
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.180
and they're hanging out a couple minutes later,

143
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.620
another empty beer can hits Andre. He grows a little bit harder.

144
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.540
And then a third beer can comes and uh, and Andre stands up.

145
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:12.940
He hits him in his head. Andre stands up, you know,

146
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:15.780
it takes him a while to get out of the booth or whatever, wherever they're at.

147
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.250
And he and these guys get up and they start running and they, uh,

148
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.690
Andre chases them. But when he gets out of the bar,

149
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.930
they are in their car about to pull away.

150
00:08:24.931 --> 00:08:26.930
And Andre literally goes under the car.

151
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:30.010
That's out front of the bar and flips it over. There's a cop,

152
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.010
a half a block away who pulls up

153
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.130
and arrests them for, with Andre, the giant,

154
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.720
after he flips their car with them in, yeah, you don't.

155
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.200
<v 0>With a giant, those guys mess with me. I remember do beer cat.</v>

156
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.520
We were wrestling in, uh, Montreal. It was his birthday. Wow. That man,

157
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.600
he could do a back flip standing on the top rope and do a flip really and land

158
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:57.320
on his feet when he first started. But uh,

159
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.000
I'm wrestling him and we had this little thing we'd do where he'd get me in the

160
00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:04.480
corner and just still let, waiting to me, you know, which was pretty easy to,

161
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:05.973
to register.

162
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.200
And then I would slide down and then he would grab each side of the rope and do

163
00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:13.200
the drop. Of course he's got these ropes.

164
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.070
Well that night he went and to do it and his hand slipped.

165
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.430
So all of a sudden his lands right here and just, you know,

166
00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:24.390
I heard vertebras and I'm like, can I breathe?

167
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.270
I just wanna know if I can breathe. Cause I couldn't at the moment I like

168
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.670
screaming. And I turned over on my side thinking, oh my God,

169
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.980
how bad is. Cause I figure, I figured my sternum was broke, whatever. Yeah.

170
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.180
And he said, so me and I'm laying there. Oh my God. Oh my God.

171
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:44.060
Trying to catch my breath, trying to let everything come back in.

172
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:45.660
Cause I seen the lights coming at first,

173
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.180
so I was gonna pass out and then I hear Andre laughing

174
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.450
and I hear the referee say and why are you laughing?

175
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.890
He was hard forging. And I'm like, what?

176
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.730
And I could feel my shoulder just vibrate. Like,

177
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.970
and he's faring, you know how long a giant can fart? How long?

178
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.730
About 40 seconds. &lt;laugh&gt; he's like, wow.

179
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.810
But it was a steady flow.

180
00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:19.480
It wasn't 48 years where the parts man,

181
00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:22.360
he got up. I had like a wine stain on my shoulder. You know? It was a

182
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.640
that. Yeah. Amazing, amazing guy, man. But I used to think to myself,

183
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.120
the fans really don't like me cuz they're putting me out there and the fans are

184
00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:38.390
cheering me on to charge into that big giant. You want me to get killed?

185
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:42.430
Don't you? Yeah. Your fans are vicious. Why are y'all doing this to me?

186
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.590
&lt;laugh&gt; don't cheer me. Tell me I'm a stupid.

187
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.470
And to get outta the ring for the giant eats you that.
