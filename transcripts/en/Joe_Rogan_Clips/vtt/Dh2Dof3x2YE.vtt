1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>Yeah, I see. I saw him do a lot of sets back then, too.</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.420
Back when he was doing hanging with Mr. Cooper, he'd drop in and do that.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.740
I haven't seen him in a long time.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.410
<v 1>I think he's on tour with a cat right here.</v>

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.920
<v 0>He's got a sleeper Bronco. I think he still has it.</v>

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.870
We had this like 1980s, black Bronco,

7
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:23.400
but he had it all done up like OJ Bronco. It was like a OJ Bronco, but he had a,

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.250
he had like a engine upgrade in it. Suspension, upgrade tires, wheels,

9
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.490
the whole deal. Nice. It was like an urban assault vehicle,

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.830
like a powerful Bronco that like,

11
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.140
it just looked like an older Bronco that somebody just has on the road.

12
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.090
But meanwhile, this thing is like tuned up.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.370
<v 1>Nice. Yeah. The classics man. Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.000
<v 0>And he would drive around that thing. He had a gang of cars. I love cars.</v>

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990
Really nice. Funny guy. I gotta get.

16
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.470
<v 1>I gotta, I gotta get some old schools. I wanna, uh, I want a Trans-Am.</v>

17
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:52.370
That's what I was. Ooh,

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.300
I want the smokey and the bandit trans and that's what I want. What is this?

19
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.400
<v 0>Oh, that's right. It died. He got hit by a tree. That's right.</v>

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.530
Did it catch on fire? No, man. That's the Bronco.

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.160
Yeah. The storm last year took

22
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.230
mark Curry's Bronco. He loved that thing, man. That was it.

23
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.980
It was a total sleeper. The car was a sleeper. Okay.

24
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.070
That's smart dudes like him, man. They get sleepers.

25
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:24.500
They like to drive around in a no notice car.

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.990
<v 2>Yeah. So you move around. You got to move around like that too.</v>

27
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.460
Don't bring too much attention. Yeah.

28
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:31.070
You got to move around and go wherever you want to go. When you want to go,

29
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.933
you know.

30
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.440
<v 0>No nonsense Bronco. I need an old school. What kind?</v>

31
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.750
<v 1>I liked the, I liked the pickup trucks, the old Chevy thirties or fifties,</v>

32
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.010
like fifties, the Chevy with the, uh, with the, like the bubble. Oh yeah. Uh,

33
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.870
tire covers what it was that called.

34
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.070
<v 0>But I know what you're talking about. There's one that a lot of people redo.</v>

35
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.570
There's a very specific, uh, Chevy pickup truck right there. That's no,

36
00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:01.310
I need that. Look at that. I need one of those 1950 Chevy pickup.

37
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.330
Wow. It's crazy. What they can do to those too. I mean,

38
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:09.290
who would have ever saw it? If you looked at one of those in the flesh in 1950,

39
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:14.210
that someone would have something like that in 2018, that looks like 50.

40
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.650
<v 1>Cars. It cost $6,000 in 1950. It even cost that much.</v>

41
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.480
<v 0>Let's guess how much did the pickup truck cost? In 1950,</v>

42
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:26.810
I say $1,500. I'm gonna say 3,500.

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.030
How much did the pickup cost? In? 1950. Here we go.

44
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:33.230
Drum roll, please.

45
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.690
Nothing popped up off the top.

46
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.850
<v 3>That might be giving me pricing for now, too. So I'm trying to, oh.</v>

47
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.180
<v 0>How did you write, how much did a pickup truck? Cause.</v>

48
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.720
<v 1>There's people price of in.</v>

49
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.960
<v 0>Retail price in 1950.</v>

50
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.033
<v 4>Maybe that's it.</v>

51
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.050
<v 0>People listening to this, uh, bored out of their mind right now.</v>

52
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.860
But do you really care? Why do you care? What a pickup truck cost 1950.

53
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.320
Are they watching live? Some people, Hey, what's up people.

54
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.260
<v 4>There's a slight delay. Nice. Oh, for curses. There's the internet.</v>

55
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.450
I think it's too late.

56
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.880
<v 0>We already it up. How much did it cost? 1243. 1200. Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.350
12 43, 12 43, $1,243.

58
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.360
That's crazy insane. I touched it current value. 30,000. Nice or so.

59
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.610
Yeah, I got to get one. That's what you want?

60
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.650
Why a pickup truck and not a muscle car? Uh.

61
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.250
<v 1>No I wouldn't. I want that. I want that spooky to made at first. Oh</v>

62
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.801
yeah, of course.

63
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.580
I want to Lincoln continental with the suicide doors on one of those need that.

64
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.600
Wow. Gotta have that.

65
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.600
<v 0>The smoke in the band. Are you going to have the Firebird on the front? Yeah,</v>

66
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.610
absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. The same.

67
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.590
<v 1>One. I want to, uh, I want the, the, uh, Fordham Mustang that Eleanor.</v>

68
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.390
Yes. Yes.

69
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.130
<v 0>The gun 60 seconds. That, that that's one of the best looking cars of all time.</v>

70
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.960
Probably the, yeah, probably.

71
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.150
<v 1>The 66 Corvette. Beautiful car.</v>

72
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.320
<v 0>Those are great, beautiful car. I have a 65 convertible. Do you really love so,</v>

73
00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:13.290
you know yeah. They're great cars, a full piece of machinery. It's crazy.

74
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.290
Look right there. Look back. The top comes off. Like you just.

75
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.510
<v 5>Right there. Wow. That's one of the most.</v>

76
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.710
<v 0>Lyrical cause ever made. Is that a 67? Jamie? That sort of says, yeah.</v>

77
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.290
<v 5>That is incredible.</v>

78
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.780
Is it called Eleanor before that movie or that come from something like that?

79
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:28.680
I think it came from the movie.

80
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.220
<v 0>Right? Yeah. No, I think it means something. I think Eleanor,</v>

81
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.420
when you say it backwards, like whatever the, uh,

82
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.500
acronym is, the, uh, well find it. It's the,

83
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.360
I think that's what they did. I think they took some kind of tuner thing.

84
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.410
Some someone's name and used it backwards. It's like Roanoke.

85
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.883
Is that it?

86
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.390
I remember very vaguely the story of how they came up with the name Eleanor

87
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.350
anyway. See if you can find it.

88
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.930
<v 1>Yeah, definitely need that. Yeah, that right there. It's a dope car. Super dope.</v>

89
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.330
<v 0>Maybe I'm thinking the opposite.</v>

90
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.190
Maybe what I'm thinking of is someone made a car. That's like Eleanor,

91
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:18.420
but they spelled it backwards. I think that might be it. It just.

92
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.570
<v 3>Says Eleanor is the only Ford one mock one in history to receive a car,</v>

93
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:22.404
title credit.

94
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.880
<v 0>Take the word Eleanor and spell it backwards and Google that.</v>

95
00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:30.810
I think there's a car that they're making where they spell Eleanor backwards.

96
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:31.920
I think this is where I'm getting the.

97
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.120
<v 2>Hyundai ruler eight,</v>

98
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.560
the new Hyundai rolly lake Eleanor.

99
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.630
<v 3>2005. Ron mustard. Oh see, there it is. Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.030
<v 4>That's what it is. That's where I up.</v>

101
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.910
<v 0>Yeah. So there's a Mustang that they were,</v>

102
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.280
there were spelling Eleanor backwards to make a dope Mustang. Oh.

103
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.050
<v 1>Okay. Okay. Not bad.</v>

104
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.220
<v 0>Yeah. Not bad for a modern car. Right. You're fun. That's nice.</v>

105
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.160
Those are like modern muscle cars.

106
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.290
<v 6>Look at that. That's nice. Ooh.</v>

107
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.320
<v 0>Those cars like that year, like, uh,</v>

108
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.590
into the 2000 fifteens and sixteens, when they kept the, they,

109
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.590
they got rid of the live rear axle somewhere around.

110
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.300
I want to say like pretty recently, like 2012 or something like that. When,

111
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:20.031
when was the, the,

112
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.880
the latest Mustang released the latest model Mustang before

113
00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:27.880
that they used to have a solid rear axle like a muscle car. Right?

114
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.450
So it can handle terrible, but it's, but it was fun to go.

115
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.790
But you would stomp on the gas and thing would go sideways.

116
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:35.110
It would burn out everywhere.

117
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.910
It was really like having a modern muscle car with like anti-lock brakes and a

118
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:44.800
stick shift. And you buy it from the factory with 550 horsepower ridiculous car.

119
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.950
Then they got it all the way up to 700. And the last models,

120
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.680
the last models of the GT 500 were 700.

121
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.790
<v 1>Horsepower front wheel, rear wheel drive. Wow. Wow. 700 horsepower.</v>

122
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.460
<v 0>Crazier axle. That's insane. Yeah. Big, crazy rear axle bounce it all over.</v>

123
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:05.070
Every, every pothole you hit the cargo silo. I need that.

124
00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:08.260
I think that Illinois, but apparently that's like great though.

125
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.740
Those old schooly muscle cars for gripping the ground.

126
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.520
There's something about having everything all in one fat Keelan,

127
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.710
orphaned the bags, right? Those two black stripes on the asphalt,

128
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.350
as it goes sideways. I love.

129
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.020
<v 1>It. I love it. What'd you say you have a 60, 65 Corvette.</v>

130
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.980
<v 4>Yeah. That's nice. I love it. It's an old rumble. I believe.</v>

131
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.250
<v 3>From what I just read that that car was only made made for,</v>

132
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.540
or maybe even used in that original movie and the guy that made it HB,

133
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.200
Toby Holynski wrote starred and directed that movie.

134
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.630
<v 0>So it's his car. So,</v>

135
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.700
but I think they made several versions because I saw a video of them selling one

136
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.980
of them. They were selling one of them online. Yeah.

137
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.770
But there's a company called classic.

138
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.450
Recreation's they make those now they'll they'll make you a so you can get a

139
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:01.330
frame. Yeah, no, they do the whole thing from the beginning out.

140
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.560
And they make you like a brand new version of a 1967 Mustang.

141
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:09.910
But with modern engine modern suspension, something like that. Cool.

142
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.350
Expansive as.

143
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.690
<v 1>I could have imagined, I could imagine.</v>

144
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.150
<v 0>If you're some rich dude who just, you know, you look at as one,</v>

145
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.610
this is the thing about this, like flossing, right?

146
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.400
Like if you have a Lamborghini, you like, look at this guys, doors, go up,

147
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.200
you know, there's something about that. Right?

148
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:29.590
The Lamborghini was made for philosophy Ferrari, same thing you pull up.

149
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.310
[inaudible] like, look at this making it. Woo. Yup.

150
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.790
But if you pull up in one of those things, that's,

151
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.070
that's a different kind of enjoyment.

152
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.050
That's like you're driving around in an art piece. Exactly. You know, that's,

153
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:43.330
that's.

154
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.010
<v 1>A, that's a attention. Grab a storyteller. That's it?</v>

155
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.580
That's like people are just going to stop.

156
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.810
<v 0>You. Yeah. It's like an a plus in terms of like the impact it has on,</v>

157
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.490
on guys, particularly, but girls care about that as much like.

158
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.340
<v 1>A muscle car. I think chicks will dig that one.</v>

159
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.390
I think that one that one's so dig the long ball, man. That's a long time.

160
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.790
That's the long ball that is that's out of the past.

161
00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:11.450
Like what is that like? Hey, come take her out. Pull up, pull.

162
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.460
<v 0>That photo up again. That's silver one.</v>

163
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.010
The 1967 silver one that you just had up.

164
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.703
<v 4>Look at this again.</v>

165
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.700
<v 2>She's looking at you. Come on. You pull that up in front of the club. Yeah.</v>

166
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.350
Jesus Christ. That's pretty.

167
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.600
<v 3>Much the one from the movie sold for an auction.</v>

168
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.490
Let me guess the one from the $700,000. 4 million.

169
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.880
1 million. Wow. Yeah. Wow. The main one.

170
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.350
<v 0>From John wick or from Algon and 60 seconds in John wick.</v>

171
00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:42.080
That's what it was. It wasn't the Eleanor one. I'm remembering wrong.

172
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.720
It was the, they were selling one of the Mustangs to the movie. John wick.

173
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.290
He had a 69.

174
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.630
<v 1>He had a, it wasn't a Helena, but he had a nice one.</v>

175
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.250
<v 0>Right? He had a 69 that got stolen, got killed his dog and stole the car.</v>

176
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.630
And then he got a 70 Chevelle Chevelle. That's another everybody.

177
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.670
That's 70 ships. That's 70 Chevelles. Wow.

178
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.430
<v 1>That's a good one. That's it? Oh, and Paula, I gotta get an Impala too.</v>

179
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.293
I need it.

180
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 0>You know, what's even more classic than a, oh, look at that. God man.</v>

181
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.180
That's a 69. I think that's a mock one. Is that what it is? Yeah. Ooh.

182
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.330
Look at that. Oh, it makes me faint. Just fruity.

183
00:10:20.331 --> 00:10:23.330
I can weaken the legs when I see a car like that, I'm like, oh my goodness.

184
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.100
Look at that thing. That is a mirror.

185
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:30.350
<v 1>It's like two pieces to that thing. It's like the front. Yeah.</v>

186
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.220
<v 0>They do not drive that. Good. They do not. Cause that looks pretty stock.</v>

187
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.740
They do not handle very well. Nope. Terrible. It's another kind of car. Yeah.

188
00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:42.350
If you had like a modern Honda accord, you'll blow that thing off the road.

189
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.760
Like for real you've written that's God work of art though.

190
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:52.370
You take the Honda accord. I'll take that. That look how pretty that is.

191
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.730
That might be one of the best looking cars of all time.

192
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.220
<v 1>No, that Eleanor is yeah.</v>

193
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.460
<v 0>Top three. Go to that one in the upper right hand corner. Young Jamie,</v>

194
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.980
look at that thing. Geez.

195
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.850
1969 Mach one pal.

196
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.290
<v 7>Mirka dude. Hendricks was alive that his car was.</v>

197
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.120
<v 1>Out. That is a sexy vehicle right there.</v>

198
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.760
<v 0>Hendrix died in 69. Right? You could,</v>

199
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.320
you could have been on your way to a Hendrix concert in that car in 1969,

200
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.050
you would be the man. Can you imagine you pick up your girl, go to the concert.

201
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.950
Net people, you know, people were just different then. Nice. Yeah.

202
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.020
Hendricks probably would pull up the concert of that. Right?

203
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.680
That'd be a car Hendrickson drive. Kevin's a guitar in the passenger seat. Yeah.

204
00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:38.390
I found out there was a house that was for sale.

205
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:42.950
That Hendrix almost bought LA in Topanga canyon. I was like, you.

206
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.420
<v 7>Don't, it's almost.</v>

207
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.410
<v 2>Counted. It's almost count. He's just walked through it. Like, nah,</v>

208
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.130
not this one.

209
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.980
<v 0>Apparently on his way to buying it when he died. What.</v>

210
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.780
<v 2>Is that thing? Yes.</v>

211
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.720
<v 0>T top son. That's Jimmy Hendricks Corvette. Holy.</v>

212
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.120
See if you find the other pictures of that thing.

213
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.930
<v 1>That's that's the sexy cause she looked like a shock.</v>

214
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.990
<v 0>God, Jimi Hendrix had a baby.</v>

215
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.970
That's just a different one. But yeah, those are crazy. Looking,

216
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.710
go to that other one. That was just on that.

217
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.770
<v 4>This is it right here. That's.</v>

218
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.400
<v 0>So there's only a couple of pictures of the car from the top two Corvettes.</v>

219
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.930
He had two Corvettes or those? Both his back-to-back. Is that what?

220
00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:26.460
We're looking at? Two different ones. It's the same.

221
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.270
<v 4>Car. Oh yeah. Jimmy Hendrix.</v>

222
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.760
<v 0>Knew how to live old school, man. Dinosaur. Beautiful,</v>

223
00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:40.470
beautiful car. Yeah. What do you drive Tony? I have, Ooh,

224
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.460
I like it. I like it. I got a Cadillac. Which one you got? I got.

225
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.140
<v 1>The STS. It's mine is old now.</v>

226
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.660
I was actually going to buy a new car like the next couple of months.

227
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.700
I don't know what I want. You have a crazy.

228
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.630
<v 0>New sedan coming out. Which one?</v>

229
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.600
Some something V some big four doors, super powered. Ultra comfy.

230
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.140
I've been waiting.

231
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.840
<v 1>For. Have you seen the El Mirage? Can you pull up the Cadillac? El Mirage.</v>

232
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.490
L E L M I R a J. I've been waiting four years for this car.

233
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.490
And every time I go to the auto show, they're like, yeah, it's coming next year.

234
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.980
So I wait, wait, wait. That sounds like a superhero.

235
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.250
<v 4>In a Robert Rodriguez movie. The El Mirage.</v>

236
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.490
<v 1>Look at this. Ooh. Four years Cadillac. I've been waiting for this car.</v>

237
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.820
Whoa. Every auto show. Yeah. Next year.

238
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.790
<v 0>That is slick. That's a two door. Yes. Holy.</v>

239
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.160
I've been waiting patiently for this car. You know, when we were kids,

240
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.650
we thought about what cars would look like in the future.

241
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.330
That's what they would look like in the future.

242
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.480
Look at the front end of that thing. Like the headlights. Those are crazy.

243
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:43.650
Look at that, man. That has such a futuristic,

244
00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:46.440
like pause there for that picture and make that a little bit bigger.

245
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.020
That has such a futuristic.

246
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.060
<v 1>Shape to look at the leather on the inside.</v>

247
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.960
<v 0>And look at that grill. Look how that grill integrates. We're like,</v>

248
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.020
this is how girls go with shoes. Like, oh my God,

249
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.470
do you see how strappy they are? And you say to your girl, like, I don't get it.

250
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.390
This is it right here. You're not going to get it.

251
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.800
This it's so strappy for years, I've been waiting for this car.

252
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.890
Why are you such Cadillac, dude?

253
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.840
<v 1>Uh, my father drove a Cadillac tribute to my dad. I like that last call.</v>

254
00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:18.780
My pops had before he passed away was a burgundy Cadillac.

255
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.010
And he eyes from remember he loved it so much and I didn't know,

256
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.110
grow growing up in New York. I didn't need a car. Right. When I moved to LA,

257
00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:27.060
I was like, oh, I got to get a call to get around. And I'm like,

258
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:29.790
what am I going to get tribute to dad Cadillac.

259
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.310
<v 4>I love it. That's a good move.</v>

260
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.580
<v 0>Yeah. They make some old school cars too.</v>

261
00:14:35.581 --> 00:14:39.030
That you could actually get fixed up and drive around some seventies.

262
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.490
<v 2>We're going to get up. I'm going to get an oldie and put it,</v>

263
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.610
put it in the hands of a caretaker and let them just fix it up. Get.

264
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.490
<v 0>You one of them. Definitely gonna do that. Two door Eldorados.</v>

265
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.850
<v 5>Ooh, nice. What color? What color?</v>

266
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.860
<v 1>Ah, I don't know. Maybe like a money green. Ooh.</v>

267
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.840
<v 0>Ooh. Like I'm like the Bishop. Did he have a migraine more.</v>

268
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.570
<v 1>Than scratch that? We'll then scratch that. We'll go burgundy</v>

269
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.220
because I don't want anybody to mistake me for the. Right?

270
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.990
I don't want no girl running up at my car at a in and out burger.

271
00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:12.370
Like I got your money. Daddy.

272
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.600
<v 0>The burgundy. I like burgundy liquid, like a little bit of metallic flake to it.</v>

273
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.110
Nice.

274
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.580
<v 1>Oh yeah. That would be nice.</v>

275
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.660
<v 4>Yes. Fresh Chrome.</v>

276
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.390
<v 0>Riding those things, man. I mean,</v>

277
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.270
you got to respect the fact that it takes a long time to stop those.

278
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.493
Convertible.

279
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.820
<v 7>Eldorado. That [inaudible].</v>

280
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.600
<v 8>Look at this. We're looking at a 76 convertible Eldorado.</v>

281
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.240
<v 0>Oh, oh my God. What a shape? Look at that.</v>

282
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.170
What a shape that was back when they didn't know what the aerodynamics was.

283
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.060
What.

284
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.160
<v 1>Did oh, that's what we talking about right there. Look at that thing.</v>

285
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.023
Look at that.

286
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.950
<v 0>What year is that? Jamie? 67. Yeah. God that's nice.</v>

287
00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:57.340
People just drove these enormous boats. Look at the size of the trunk.

288
00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:59.643
It's crazy.

289
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.590
<v 1>That trunk can fit like a smart card. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

290
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.760
<v 0>You could easily sleep in that trunk. No problem. That's nice.</v>

291
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.360
They just went through a period of time where they were making these giant

292
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:14.650
boats, like the suicide door. Continental. You talked about that all the time.

293
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.460
Yeah. All the time. Classic. Gotta.

294
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.340
<v 1>Love that. Yeah. That's another one. The best calls probably ever.</v>

295
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:21.910
<v 0>Made.</v>

296
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.430
No it's another best car ever made that I would never want to park anywhere.

297
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.380
1968 charger. I saw in 1968 charger all done up. Dukes of hazard.

298
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.390
It's similar is that it was that year 68, 69. One of those years,

299
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.120
either one of those years is bad-ass. But those cars,

300
00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:40.330
they were just like sharks, like big, long boats.

301
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.250
They weren't like in any way, like, look at that.

302
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.250
That's not in any way practical in terms of its shape. Like it's gotta be that.

303
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.970
Wind's got to go into that grill in a weird way and probably slows it down.

304
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:55.660
It's like having a little mini parachute in the front of your hood. Obviously.

305
00:16:55.661 --> 00:17:00.070
I don't know about aerodynamic dynamics. Well,

306
00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:03.190
I think when you go back to that original picture, man,

307
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:06.700
that original one was beautiful. Look that's thing.

308
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.850
That's what I'm talking about. Like that car just represents a different world.

309
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.360
<v 1>That's how fast and furious, right? Yeah. He had.</v>

310
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.130
<v 0>Right or similar something similar similar years.</v>

311
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.940
There's something about a 1970. It got weird.

312
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.580
Cause then they put the bumper all around the front,

313
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.960
like a big oval who see you ever see that? No. Yeah.

314
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.710
This car pull up 1970 charger. 1970. Got weird.

315
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.740
Like somebody got crafty. Look at the front bumper.

316
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.810
<v 5>Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. What.</v>

317
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.600
<v 0>Did you just do? Hey, Hey, come here. That's like put it back. Yeah.</v>

318
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.250
What did you do? Put it back. You had something black.

319
00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:45.310
One go to the black one right above it. Where are the headlights? Oh,

320
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.560
they roll up. They roll up like a 69 Camaro. You ever see a 60 community?

321
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.680
Yeah. It flips it. Yeah. Those things flip.

322
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.280
That was like the rage back then man. People love roll-up headlights.

323
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.470
That's a good picture of Jamie.

324
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:00.900
But the other one's better because you could see the uh, no,

325
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.110
the black one right next to it. Cause you could see the other, yeah.

326
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:06.000
That weren't there because you could see the grill,

327
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.720
like make that a little bigger, like look how goofy that is.

328
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.940
Look how goofy that grill is the bumper and the, the griller,

329
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:16.170
like there it's I got an up bumper and a down bumper. Like what are you doing?

330
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.440
Why'd you do that? Don't don't do that. You had it. Perfect. You.

331
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.820
Some guy was like, you know, Alex, those people were on Coke.

332
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.320
It was the seventies. They were like, you know what. Double bumped it.

333
00:18:27.321 --> 00:18:30.210
Let's do it. Double bumper bumper up top bumper. The bottom. It's my thing, bro.

334
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.730
You're going to push that through to the GM. Uh, Hey,

335
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:36.000
did you bring up my idea about the double bumper bumper on top, on the bottom?

336
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:37.290
I'm telling you, man, it's a move.

337
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.380
It's one that I look at that just doesn't look as good.

338
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.520
It still looks bad though. It's still the original picture was the one. Yeah.

339
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.910
Now go to a 19 69, 19 69 is a sweet spot.

340
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.220
That's when they nailed it and then they it up.

341
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.070
They should've made the 1969 charger. Oh yes.

342
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.640
See it wasn't that it was weeks hazard. Look at that one.

343
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.600
That black one up on the upper left-hand corner right there. Upper left. Yeah.

344
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.650
Right there. Look at that. Oh my goodness. What a shape?

345
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.360
Those people just had a different way of looking at automobiles.

346
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.010
They weren't confined by.

347
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.130
<v 1>What's the spot? Uh, big Bob's big boy in Burbank.</v>

348
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.360
<v 0>When they have the cause I never stopped him. I've been to similar things.</v>

349
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.240
I've been to the LA auto show too. It's pretty interesting.

350
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.750
But I guess those cars and coffees and things, he ever done. One of those? No,

351
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.270
I heard those are pretty bad people.

352
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.300
I pull up with weird cars and Lana was always showing up at some Burbank people.

353
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.750
They have all over the place. They have them in Irvine and all,

354
00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:38.600
all over the place. People got to check it out. I do the auto show every year.

355
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.700
<v 1>And I asked about the El Mirage and they're like, yeah, next year.</v>

356
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.270
<v 0>You are just obsessed with Cadillacs. Got to get it. That's interesting.</v>

357
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.480
Got to get it. So no matter how big you get Cadillac, I'll have.

358
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.080
<v 1>Other cars, but it's going to be a caddy. That's your main daily driver.</v>

359
00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:55.160
Probably that Roger's got it. I like.

360
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.760
<v 0>It, man. I like, it's a different, it's a different kind of luxury car,</v>

361
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.860
you know? And they're really doing it right now too. Yep.

362
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.580
You know what I was doing it right. The new Lincoln navigator. See that thing.

363
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.410
<v 1>Gigantic. The thing that's crazy big man. Like it.</v>

364
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.580
<v 0>Yeah. I've written them before. They're they're amazing. I got to test drive.</v>

365
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.970
I haven't driven one, but I've written as a passenger in one. I was like,

366
00:20:16.971 --> 00:20:19.040
this thing is bad. Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.780
<v 1>I liked the new, uh, Wells Fargo, but the new BMW, seven foof.</v>

368
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.150
It's like a couch going down the street. You just.

369
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.280
<v 0>Some insane amount of money. $160,000. It's the most, this is one version of it.</v>

370
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.440
It's the most expensive BMW they've ever made.

371
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.480
And it's supposed to be the most technologically advanced.

372
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.710
<v 1>Nice. And I liked the new, uh, the porch, the four-door uh, Panamera.</v>

373
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.030
Nice. Yes. I get a lot.

374
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.940
<v 0>Yeah. That's the difference between living here and living in New York,</v>

375
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.220
living in New York. So many people don't have cars. You really don't even.

376
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.210
<v 1>Like if you have a car in New York is a luxury it's then you start,</v>

377
00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:58.830
do you have to find parking and you go this car, man, my brother, my brother,

378
00:20:58.831 --> 00:21:00.690
Kenny had a car for like a summer. It was like,

379
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.320
I gotta get up and move it every morning. And when I go into the city,

380
00:21:04.321 --> 00:21:07.380
I gotta find five park. And he's like, this man. Yeah.

381
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.840
<v 0>And when you drive down the street and you see ones with boots on them,</v>

382
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.400
people don't, they don't realize, well, you.

383
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.730
<v 1>See the tickets just piled up because they'll put a ticket on top of a ticket.</v>

384
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.760
Yep. In LA. Sometimes people will say, Hey, if you already have a ticket,

385
00:21:17.761 --> 00:21:20.370
they won't put another one. I don't know. In New York, they don't,

386
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.930
they'll put a ticket on top of a ticket.

387
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.820
So he was just like a summer at a site. What did he have? He had a, uh.

388
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.620
<v 0>Yeah, it's a different kind of living,</v>

389
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.900
living with no car living in the city under.

390
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.610
<v 1>Bird had a fourth in there. But like, it was like a older one now 2004,</v>

391
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:36.210
those were.

392
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.150
<v 5>Weird. I was like, this car too.</v>

393
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.480
<v 0>Many tickets. You know, what's weird Thunderbird. Didn't really totally work.</v>

394
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.380
But the challenge worked perfect. Yeah. The new challenges people like,

395
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.560
oh Jesus, yeah, you nailed it. You got it. Right. The Thunderbird people like,

396
00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:51.780
what are we doing here? Is this an old car? It's a new car.

397
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.670
<v 2>We don't know who are we?</v>

398
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.270
<v 0>They stop making that. Right? Yup. They don't make that anymore. Yeah.</v>

399
00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.140
Charges was great.

400
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.540
I don't think Ford makes anything other than Mustangs and trucks.

401
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.430
I think they gave up on every single car they made.

402
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.860
<v 1>Bringing the Bronco back. I know that. Yeah. Bringing the Bronco.</v>

403
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.990
<v 0>Back. But I think that was a move they made. We just say Jamie,</v>

404
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.630
they have a focus or they stop making them. I think they do.

405
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.300
<v 1>Recently. Not counting the Ford focus man. Real cars. I think.</v>

406
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.750
<v 0>Recently they said, they're going to cancel every car except the Mustang.</v>

407
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.850
And they're just going to make trucks. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Somebody went crazy.

408
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.300
Well, I think they'd probably make that Ford GT two in limited numbers.

409
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.380
But yeah,

410
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.970
I think the saline is that that's a different company that takes a Mustang and

411
00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:35.340
then they put an aftermarket kit on it. Oh yeah. Yeah.

412
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.960
That's a Steve Saleens company. They do Corvettes and a bunch of other too.

413
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.710
They do a bunch of different it's like Hennessy give her that Hennessy Hennessy

414
00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:48.330
performance. I've heard of Hennessy performance, but what are we talking about?

415
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:53.970
Or like Shelby, they take these cars and they'll, you know, like say like the,

416
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.600
do it to a Eldorado or not an Eldorado way. Um,

417
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.550
they'll do it to a escalate. They'll do it to a Corvettes Mustangs.

418
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.430
They'll take a regular car and put a thousand horsepower in it. Oh wow. Okay.

419
00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:08.940
And sell it. So it's but it's not, I mean, it's not just a Corvette,

420
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.400
it's a Hennessy Corvette now. It's like, you know,

421
00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:15.630
like a saline Mustang is like, it's like a Shelby Mustang kind of similar,

422
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.830
but Shelby, they sell from the Ford dealerships. Some Ford dealerships sell St.

423
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.770
Liens. Some of them do that. You can buy them.

424
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.520
<v 1>Meant drunk when I'm drunk. And my performance on Hennessy,</v>

425
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.200
I hit a C performance.

426
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.120
<v 0>Or to stop making all passenger cars except the Mustang Explorer</v>

427
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.780
like that. Yeah. So they're just doing trucks. Yeah. And the Bronco,

428
00:23:36.781 --> 00:23:40.020
but that's a dope one car. That's weird. That's the bullet car.

429
00:23:40.021 --> 00:23:42.810
That's the tribute to the Steve McQueen movie. That's what that green car is.

430
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.520
Look at that thing. That is gorgeous. Great movie by the way.

431
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.640
Yeah, it is a great movie. They nailed it though. See Ford nailed it.

432
00:23:50.641 --> 00:23:51.391
With these Mustangs.

433
00:23:51.391 --> 00:23:54.960
They figured out a perfect way to make a shape that makes you think about old

434
00:23:54.961 --> 00:23:56.370
cars, but it looks like a new car.
