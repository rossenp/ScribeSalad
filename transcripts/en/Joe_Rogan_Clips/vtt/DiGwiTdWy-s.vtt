WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>We should probably point out that this is not universal,</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.640
that everybody's diet is gonna affect them differently.

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.800
For some people are fine with carbohydrates.

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.880
There's a lot of people out there that you,

5
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:14.160
a high carbohydrate diet and they have zero issues with it whatsoever. And it's,

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.160
that's one of the weirder things about people, you know,

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.560
it's that we are so variable depending upon your ancestry, you know,

8
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.950
what part of the world they, they evolved. Yeah.

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.990
<v 1>Yeah. It's, it's fascinating to me. Cause I mean,</v>

10
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.830
I'll look at folks doing complete opposite of who I am and they're,

11
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:29.550
they're doing just fine. Yeah. Um, and it's, you know,

12
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.710
then I'll look at some folks too that are doing the opposite of me and they're

13
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:34.530
doing just fine for a while.

14
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.710
And then they ultimately start noticing the same kind of things I did and then

15
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.140
they can clean it up. Uh, so it is kind of, yeah, I think at the end of the day,

16
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.940
you just gotta be kind of honest with yourself and you know,

17
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:48.500
some people I think are really, really robust &lt;laugh&gt; and they can,

18
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.740
they can hit their body with that high octane fuel carbohydrate,

19
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.140
like day in and day out at a high level. And it doesn't seem to bother 'em much,

20
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.820
but you know, other people like think just, it, it can kind of,

21
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:02.410
it's like playing with rocket fuel a little bit where, you know,

22
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:05.450
a little bit can be great and too much of it can kind of burn you up a little

23
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:06.050
bit. So.

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.530
<v 0>You're saying that you started off at like 50 grams of carbohydrates a day,</v>

25
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.730
the real strict cosis diet. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what did,

26
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:13.490
what did you eventually move to?

27
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.570
<v 1>Um, it, so the way I call it is I periodize it. So like,</v>

28
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:22.520
when I look at my year you're you can pick out a week where I'm kind of training

29
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.360
and then pick out a week where I'm kind of in like a recovery phase or off

30
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:28.880
season, and it looks like two completely different lifestyles.

31
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.120
So my first thought after kind of like working through the whole ketogenic

32
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.920
approach, um, cause I should add to like, um,

33
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.120
once I got like feeling good about that,

34
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.680
I started adding back speed workouts and things like that.

35
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:44.270
And I definitely noticed that I was missing kind of that last year.

36
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.110
Like it was a lot more difficult to go out and really throttle down.

37
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.910
Like I could run all day at a slow pace,

38
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.190
but if I decided to go out on the track and do like 400 meter repeats at like a

39
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:58.510
really fast, like a really fast pace, um, it was really hard to kind of,

40
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.750
to be able to do that. That's.

41
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.660
<v 0>A common complaint. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. Rob Wolf, you know, Rob Wolf.</v>

42
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.380
Yep. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Rob Wolf had a similar issue.

43
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.700
He's gotten like very heavily into jujitsu and he was telling me that he just

44
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.060
can't stick to that 50 grams of carbohydrates a day. Yeah. And still have the,

45
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.860
the energy to go hard. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

46
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.020
<v 1>Does, do you know, does Rob Wolf work out more than one time a day? I.</v>

47
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.340
<v 0>Do not know. Um, he looks very fit though. I I'm, I'm not sure what his, uh,</v>

48
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.410
what a schedule is, but I know he works out very hard and if he's doing jujitsu,

49
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:31.290
there's really, it's very difficult to jujitsu any other way than hard. Sure.

50
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.970
<v 1>Yeah. You know, cause one thing I've always been curious about too,</v>

51
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.130
and you know, like I'm not, I'm not trying to come, come on here and say like,

52
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.290
everyone should switch to doing what I do. I mean,

53
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:43.850
I think you should follow your own, your own se your own personal self.

54
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.200
And to be honest with yourself, you feel great. Do what you're doing.

55
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:48.000
If you don't then probably look to change something.

56
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.400
But like one thing I'm always looking at now or suspecting is that like,

57
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:57.240
it's more about the recovery between efforts than it is about the intensity

58
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.800
of the effort or the duration of the effort in terms of how much carbs you need

59
00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:06.400
to bring back or wanna bring back. Cuz I've also had circumstances where like,

60
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.360
I'll do like a big workout or a race or something like that.

61
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:11.320
And then I'll go really easy for like a week.

62
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.440
And during that week I'll go like super strict keto. Um, cause I'm recovering,

63
00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:19.750
I'm not doing anything intense. I'm not doing anything too long. Um, so that's,

64
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.910
that's the point in my training where I kind of say, all right,

65
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.110
let's get rid of the start, the fast acting fuel sources.

66
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.110
I don't need 'em right now and reset that whole fat adaptation thing. Um,

67
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.470
so you.

68
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.390
<v 0>Feel like you, the fast acting fuel sources like carbohydrates,</v>

69
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.990
you only really need them when you're pushing hard, right.

70
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:35.110
When you're really running.

71
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.230
<v 1>Fast. Yeah. And I actually think it's,</v>

72
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.660
it's when you're doubling down on those on a regular basis.

73
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.020
So like if you're working out really hard for like 45 minutes to an hour a day,

74
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.380
I think you can probably get away with almost a ketogenic or like a really low

75
00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:52.340
carbohydrate approach because you're giving yourself like 23 plus hours between

76
00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:56.420
sessions for your body to kind of restock LICO in stores from other areas like,

77
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.780
you know, from fat and proteins and things like that.

78
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.610
I think when you start getting into a system where you're like myself,

79
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.170
I'm doing two days a lot and then sometimes one of those is a speed session.

80
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.010
That's when I feel like I need to bring some of the carbohydrate back.

81
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.850
And I think it's probably just to get some of the glycogen at a little faster

82
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.230
rate,

83
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.570
cuz that is gonna replenish your glycogen stores faster as a carbohydrate than

84
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.490
like a fat or, or a protein probably would.

85
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.440
<v 0>So how many grams of carbohydrates a day would you have on a daily like that?</v>

86
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.913
Um.

87
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.240
<v 1>When I'm in like peak training,</v>

88
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:26.240
which is about 20 hours a week of running strength,

89
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.640
training and mobility type stuff, you know,

90
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:33.520
I'll probably let myself get up to like 15 to

91
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.320
25% of my intake from carbohydrate. Um.

92
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.600
<v 0>What do you think that is in grams? Uh.</v>

93
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.630
<v 1>It probably did. It depends a lot on like what I actually do. Um,</v>

94
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:46.030
cause I don't count calories very often. I,

95
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.230
I used to just to kind of like see what was going on and then I kind of got

96
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:51.750
intuitive with it. Uh, gram wise, you know,

97
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:54.670
it's probably anywhere from like two to 300 maybe.

98
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.510
And then when I'm in those phases of training,

99
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.820
it's really intense in terms of like just, uh, or I shouldn't say intense,

100
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:06.220
it's just really tedious in the amount of time and energy required for it. Now,

101
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:06.340
are.

102
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.300
<v 0>You blood monitoring at that time? Are you checking your millimolar levels?</v>

103
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.220
<v 1>Uh, I am sometimes like when I'm like,</v>

104
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:16.700
when I get curious about that type of stuff or I've done it in the past,

105
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.420
I've actually what I did originally is I got the,

106
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.130
the blood keto own monitor and I also got one of those Keans uh,

107
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.730
like it it's like this little USB thing and then you blow into it and yeah.

108
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.210
Is that accurate? Um, I think there's, I think there's varied results.

109
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.130
I think they've gotten a lot better with it. Um,

110
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.250
but what I did is I actually measured my blood key tone and then I would use

111
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:43.600
that and I tried to find kind of like if mine was matching what that thing would

112
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.200
say mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So I kind of had an I,

113
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.880
I got it to where I kind of had an idea where certain ranges on that thing would

114
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.680
kind of indicate whether I was in ketosis or not. Um,

115
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.720
so like I very much is coming outta keto during peak training.

116
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.840
Like when I would, especially when I would get up to two,

117
00:05:57.841 --> 00:06:01.280
300 grams of carbohydrate, I would come outta ketosis. Uh,

118
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.200
and I'd probably go back into ketosis throughout that, that phase. Um.

119
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.000
<v 0>When you say go back in and come out, uh, like,</v>

120
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.680
and what kind of time period are you talking about? Uh.

121
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.173
<v 1>It,</v>

122
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.870
the time period was more indicative about what I kind of ate during it to like,

123
00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:21.670
if I did, if, if, if I did or I shouldn't say what I like,

124
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.790
how I kind of structured those two to 300 grams of carbohydrate,

125
00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:27.030
like if I did like a big bolus of it in one meal,

126
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.030
I'd get back into ketosis a little quicker because then I wouldn't come back to

127
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:32.030
the carbohydrates again.

128
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.510
<v 0>For a while. So would you vary in inside the day?</v>

129
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.820
<v 1>Yeah, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah, like I would it like if I, and,</v>

130
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.300
and here's where it got kind of interesting, I guess is I do a lot of my,

131
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.620
the heaviest bulk of my training in the morning.

132
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.300
So I typically wake up and have some like coffee with like coconut milk or heavy

133
00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:51.780
whipping cream or something like that. And then, uh, you know, go for my run.

134
00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:53.220
So then when I get back from a run, you know,

135
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:57.460
it might be two hours sometimes even three. And, uh, you know, at that point I,

136
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.450
I just slept for eight to 10 hours then, you know,

137
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.490
by the time I got down with my run, you know, I hadn't,

138
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.450
I had probably hadn't I had essentially done like a small intermittent fast for

139
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:10.850
the most part. Um, so like even when I had the higher amounts of carbohydrates,

140
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.890
I'd find myself going back into the keto at the end of something like that

141
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:17.450
sometimes. Um, but really it was, to me,

142
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.680
it wasn't necessarily a question of whether I was in ketosis or not,

143
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.400
cuz that really wasn't important to me. Um,

144
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.000
like performance is important perform. Exactly. Yeah.

145
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.280
And what I wanted out of this approach was, um,

146
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.640
I wanted to be able to rely on my body body to burn high levels of fat

147
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.960
when I needed it to,

148
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.230
but I also wanted to be Metabo flexible enough where if I needed to hit the gas

149
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:43.670
pedal, I could do that as well. Um,

150
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.990
and I think that's where people get a little, uh, uh,

151
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.230
confused or up in arms or something because there's not a whole lot of studies

152
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:54.190
that kind of look at that specifically, like, can you do that?

153
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:55.030
Or can you not do that?

154
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.830
Some people think it's kind of an all or nothing thing where you either get

155
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:02.140
really fat adapted or you get really carb dependent and then everything else is

156
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:04.900
kind of like, you know, this gray area that you can't really get into,

157
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.340
but that's not my experience. You know, my experience has been that like,

158
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.900
I can get like here, here's my kind of litmus test.

159
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.220
If I can go for like a four hour or even five hour run with no fuel,

160
00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:20.930
other than water and electrolytes, then I'm fat adapted enough.

161
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.930
I don't need to get more fat adapted than that because I can't eat during a race

162
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.370
and everyone else is going to be so like,

163
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.530
I don't really need to get more fat adapted that from a performance standpoint.

164
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.570
Um, so when I get to that point, then it's like, how many,

165
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.690
how many carbohydrates can I bring back to kinda give me that extra nudge or

166
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:38.610
that extra fuel substrate? Um.

167
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.720
<v 0>Have you ever tried mixing exogenous keytones with carbohydrates? Um,</v>

168
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.680
not Greenfield was talking about that and he said it's like doing steroids.

169
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.160
He said it was incredible. Yeah. There's again, he's.

170
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.080
<v 1>He's a maniac. He's a maniac. Yeah. There's uh, who else was it? Was it Dominic?</v>

171
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.480
Dino was playing around with that stuff quite a bit too.

172
00:08:56.481 --> 00:08:59.920
Or he might have helped, uh, he might have helped, uh, with the,

173
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.560
the creation of some of that stuff. I know there was, uh,

174
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.600
I'd have to look back in my emails and stuff, but I, I actually had, uh,

175
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:09.960
there was a guy who was doing a real clinical version of the exogenous keytones

176
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.470
and, um, he had sent me one a while back to kind of do a little test for him.

177
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:21.230
And, uh, it, it was like just this little canister of exogenous key tone.

178
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.310
And he wanted me to kind of check my keytones when I woke up in the morning.

179
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.470
Take that test it 15 minutes later. And then test again after my run.

180
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.270
Is that like a key.

181
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.103
<v 0>Tone, Esther?</v>

182
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.030
<v 1>Yeah, I think so like super.</v>

183
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.870
<v 0>Potent stuff taste like Godzilla's Dick. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

184
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.020
Matt brown brought some of that in it's like, woo.

185
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.820
<v 1>Yeah. Did you test your keytones when you took it or no, I didn't. I didn't.</v>

186
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.020
<v 0>Have a monitor on me, but it tasted terrible, but I felt great. Yeah.</v>

187
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.820
After it was over and you have to take it with, uh, glucose.

188
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.060
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. See, I think that's, maybe that's where I messed up, but, uh, um,</v>

189
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.620
besides that, like my keytones level shot up, I woke up that morning.

190
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.330
I think I was at like 0.0 Millis or something like that.

191
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.890
I took that exogenous Keone. Um, and 15 minutes later I test,

192
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.090
I was at 3.7 Millis.
