00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 1>Experience. Your Instagram is hilarious by the way, Instagram it's very,</v>

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.120
excuse me. I don't have, Twitter' have Instagram, your Twitter. Okay.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.720
I get them confused. Sometimes your Twitter feed is really good. It's,

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.800
it's both insightful, but also very funny.

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.800
<v 0>Yeah. I try to play both sides, but the problem is like, you know, I think,</v>

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.510
I think today they're is a bit of a, um, if you're,

8
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:26.190
if you're a girl and you're, you're kind of funny, there,

9
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:28.590
there's a bit of a sense that like, people are really taking that seriously.

10
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.910
So I've been told to tone down on, on jokes. Who's telling you that. Well,

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.510
I'm also, you know, I run, I run a major nonprofit organization and,

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.430
and you wanna, tellbody.

13
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.070
<v 1>What it is or keep it on the low. Uh.</v>

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.220
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; no, it's a, it's, it's a really well, it's kind of right up your alley,</v>

15
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.060
you know, it's, it's a organization that,

16
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:50.740
that really tries to promote pluralistic thinking, um, and, and, you know,

17
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:55.500
basically exporting ideas to part of the world that it's often censored

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.740
and, and you have narratives that are just not, um, you know,

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.730
not exposed to people are not to the middle east. So, you know,

20
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:05.250
we, we thought, you know, we spent like what,

21
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.970
$8 trillion on the war in terror and what was the results, right. Like we, we,

22
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:13.530
we marched in and said, okay, we're gonna bring freedom and democracy to people.

23
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.970
But if there were no cultural institutions to kind of nudge people

24
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.280
to, to understand why they should value freedom and D see,

25
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.720
is it really a surprise that it failed to take root there? So that's what,

26
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.080
you know, we basically, we call, uh,

27
00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:33.200
the organizations call ideas beyond borders, and it's kind of self explanatory.

28
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.160
You know, we basically take, um, acquire the rights to books, um,

29
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:43.070
that are not available there, translate them into Arabic, um,

30
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.950
for free. And then we just like load it up on the library site.

31
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.950
Anyone can basically access that and download it. Um, and we do Wikipedia too.

32
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:55.790
So like 10% of all Wikipedia is in Arabic of English Wikipedia.

33
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.590
Mm. And, uh, so we basically try to, you know, like for example,

34
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:04.380
George Orwell doesn't exist in Arabic. Right. So like, if you look it up,

35
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.820
would you even understand what the word or will it means, right.

36
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.780
<v 1>Yeah. So how did you get involved in this?</v>

37
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.420
<v 0>Um, my co-founder is, uh, Iraqi refugee and he grew up on desedam and, uh,</v>

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.980
it's it's, I, I met him when I was in grad school

39
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.450
and I was really compelled by what he was talking about, you know, just like,

40
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.890
uh, somebody who grew up in Singapore too.

41
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:32.650
We don't really have freedom of speech. Right. So, um,

42
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.010
the issue was that like, for me, I, I just felt like growing up.

43
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.570
Um, I was not, I was kind of like, all right, you know what my issue is that,

44
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:47.800
like, there was no, uh, freedom of, of thought freedom of speech in Singapore,

45
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.320
the government just kind of controls everything.

46
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.520
I just think it's part of the human spirit. You know,

47
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.200
that if you say you can't have something, yes. We'll just,

48
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.720
there's an old Arabic proverb that, which is prohibited is always wanted. Yeah.

49
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.800
And, and whatever you, you kind of like, you just drive it underground if you,

50
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.240
if you try to ban it. So it's the whole spirit of,

51
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.760
of punk rock of like F to the system. And that just lies in almost, you know,

52
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.440
every human heart. We actually see that with, um, our books, for example, um,

53
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.440
you know,

54
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.550
a lot of books are actually like you transmitted on these telegram groups in

55
00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:24.590
Arabic. Mm. Um, looks like that Sam Harris w rights, um, you know,

56
00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:27.510
Richard Dawkins, um, these kinds of, uh,

57
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.910
ideas that are really super censored in, in, in the middle east. So you,

58
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.390
you know, that's kind of the, the, the gap that we're trying to plug right now,

59
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.180
it's that, um, since books are not available in that language. Mm it's.

60
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.020
I think there's this crazy statistic,

61
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.700
more books are translated between English and Spanish in one year than English

62
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:51.500
and Arabic in a thousand years. Wow. It's kind of crazy.

63
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.540
<v 1>That is kind of crazy. So the exposure to those ideas. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.210
Right. And the only other option is get these people to learn English,

65
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.210
which is a far more difficult task. Of.

66
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.210
<v 0>Course, of course. And, and, you know, your, your average part in living in say,</v>

67
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:08.370
Syrian refugee camp, isn't going to learn that quickly. Right.

68
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.930
You gotta meet people where they are. Right. So I think the statistic,

69
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:15.650
when we first started, 10% of English, Wikipedia was actually in Arabic,

70
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.090
which means that every time, like, for example, let's say, you're like, oh,

71
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.720
Jamie, go Google this it. And, and, and you expect an answer. It's just,

72
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:28.280
it's just at the tip of a fingertips. It's so it's so baked into modern life.

73
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:30.040
Now we don't even like, think twice about it.

74
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.160
But imagine if like you live in, I don't know,

75
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:37.520
say Saudi Arabia and like, okay, let's just Google it 10 out,

76
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.470
out of every 10 times, one time, there's no answer because,

77
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.430
uh, the page doesn't exist or, you know, it just, the word, uh,

78
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:47.790
feminism doesn't exist in Arabic.

79
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.590
So you can't look it up or secularism doesn't exist. It's kind of it's.

80
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.110
How do you expect people to, to, to kind of break out of their,

81
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:59.990
of their mindset of, of their indoctrination. Mm. You know, and it's, it's not,

82
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.380
we're, we're not saying like, this is a top down thing.

83
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:05.620
Like you have to read this it's that I just wanna live in a world where being

84
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.580
ignorant is a choice for everyonehmm. Cause, cuz it's a choice for us. Like,

85
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:12.220
let's say like, you know, right now you're like dumb and just,

86
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.940
just like basically you spend your nights watching the bachelor or like,

87
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:20.300
you know, whatever it is. It's like, I know some people I do too.

88
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.650
I do too. But uh, I know I'm judging, but I know, oh, it's.

89
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.530
<v 1>Listen. It's they also are into interesting things.</v>

90
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.890
But I know some people do consume mindless nonsense, my friend cam,

91
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.930
but exclusive bachelorette. He does, I'm calling you out cam you's shaing him.

92
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.770
Yeah. You know, you know, you watch that.

93
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.970
<v 0>Which one? The female one bachelorette. He watch both of them. Oh God,</v>

94
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.240
&lt;laugh&gt; I only know that's still going on because I'm at the checkout line and

95
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.360
the supermarket I'm like.

96
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.720
<v 1>Why is that there? Like,</v>

97
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.440
it's so strange that people are even interested in that. I know. I know it's a,

98
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:55.320
it's a weird thing. Very weird thing. Um, yes,

99
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.080
that ignorance would be a choice would be nice if right. Yeah. So,

100
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.840
so what you're saying is that these part, parts of the world,

101
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.480
one of the problems of getting them to shift their perception of the world is

102
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:10.680
that they're not exposed to all the great works.

103
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.320
They're not exposed to the different ideas, different ideas and different,

104
00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:15.154
different debates.

105
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.070
<v 0>And they have a monoculture. So monoculture because of, you know, society is,</v>

106
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.030
they have religions, they have ways of life that are just so deeply entrenched.

107
00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:27.670
Right. Um, and then you also have a really, really heavy censorship,

108
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:30.550
both from your authoritarian government and also from your religion.

109
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.150
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, you know, the, the first word, for example,

110
00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:36.950
the first word in the Quran is actually read really, but the,

111
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.180
they really mean just read this one thing. Mm. And, uh, you know, just the,

112
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.940
the sort of like habits of a free mind are not really cultivated. Um,

113
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.180
and also when you're taught, I mean, growing up,

114
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.340
not to question things and in part I understand because, um,

115
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.700
I think when you grow up in an Asian household with like, you know,

116
00:06:55.701 --> 00:07:00.050
tiger parents there's sense of like, you don't question my authority, you know?

117
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.570
So it, it permeates culture from a very, very young age. And imagine like,

118
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.130
if you kind of grow up in that environment,

119
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.410
you're going to internalize all those things. And that's why it, it kind of,

120
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.370
you know, it, it follows you over time. So when you were in school,

121
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:18.800
you're taught no questions. This just, yeah. It's not what I hear, where it is.

122
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.720
Like, there's no such thing as a stupid question, Chad, there are in Asia,

123
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.200
like there's there stupid.

124
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.273
<v 1>Questions over here too.</v>

125
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.200
<v 0>But you're told, you're at least told that.</v>

126
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.520
<v 1>We're giving Chad a break mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Yeah. But I, I,</v>

127
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.480
I understand what you're saying,

128
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.000
and that must be really interesting for you to go from this one fairly

129
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.950
restrictive environment to a fairly old open environment. Correct. And did,

130
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.950
did that shift that happened in you and being exposed to all these different

131
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:45.271
ideas,

132
00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:50.190
did that spark this desire to help other people sort of expand their,

133
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.110
their, their ideas and what they're exposed to? Yeah, because.

134
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.310
<v 0>Well, I felt like a fish outta water.</v>

135
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:56.750
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; growing up in Singapore. I was always the person that like,

136
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.230
the teachers had to call, like, you know,

137
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.580
your daughters at asking too many questions, she's disrupting the class. What.

138
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.413
<v 1>Kind of questions?</v>

139
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.820
<v 0>I don't know. I went to Sunday school too. I was like,</v>

140
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.020
I was that kid who was just like, uh, you know, excuse me, but why,

141
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.700
why do the dinosaurs, uh, why isn't the Bible that the dinosaurs and, and,

142
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:16.580
and human beings walked, you know, basically like days apart when,

143
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.460
like we know from science that, you know, it was male,

144
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.690
millions of years and fossils. And did they get mad at you? Of course,

145
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.490
of course. Yeah. No. They were like, just keep her out of,

146
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.330
we just rather her not come to Sunday school. Really? Yeah, yeah.

147
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.130
<v 1>No, no answers. There was no one that tried to like sort it through and say,</v>

148
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:38.050
listen, must be that God was, uh, testing people.

149
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.010
And, uh, this is why.

150
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.520
<v 0>That's what my mom would say really. But in class, I it's just, you know,</v>

151
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.280
it's how there's no, uh, there's no culture of dialectics of,

152
00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:50.240
of having dialogue mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

153
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:53.320
and refining your positions it's that it comes from authority, right.

154
00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:57.040
This is a very confusion culture. So it's like, well, I am your teacher.

155
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.200
So it is the way it is. Right. And okay, that's one level of it.

156
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.800
And if you say, grow up in the middle east, asking a question could be death,

157
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.880
right. If you, if you even remotely like say and Saudi Arabia,

158
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.640
especially remotely reveal that you might be having atheistic thoughts,

159
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.440
that's death. So it's like, we're talking a,

160
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.710
about different scales and degrees of censorship and consequences for that. And,

161
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.510
uh, I think when I met my co-founder faceal, you know, I was like, okay, I,

162
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.150
I guess I have, I, I had issues with the country I grew up in,

163
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.870
but for him it was,

164
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.310
he ended up almost being killed by Al Qaeda for just like starting a blog,

165
00:09:31.311 --> 00:09:34.630
talking about, you know, the importance of secularism and, and, uh,

166
00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:38.700
counter violent extremism. Really. Yeah. That's how he came here as a refugee.

167
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.900
So I'm like, oh. Maybe they.

168
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.020
<v 1>Are, you know, how did he almost get killed by Alqaeda?</v>

169
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:49.100
<v 0>Uh, well, cuz uh, when, when the us invadta Baghdad, I mean,</v>

170
00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:52.420
he was living in, in Baghdad at the time. Um, and uh,

171
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.170
Al Qaeda took over his neighborhood once there was a void, I almost aousted.

172
00:09:56.171 --> 00:10:00.530
Right. And, uh, he was kind of like, you know,

173
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.610
roaming around and like telling kind of telling the youth army certain things

174
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:08.050
like, okay, you know, like this is where Alqaeda is. Uh, this is a cell. My,

175
00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:11.250
my friend here has been like radicalized Mmhmm and uh,

176
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.850
Al kinda knew they put him on a, on a hit list, you know,

177
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:19.240
because he was not sympathetic to their cause. And uh,

178
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.120
so he ended up on a death list. His brother was killed,

179
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.120
just horrible story. Bridget actually recently interviewed him on,

180
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.200
on harm podcast. And, and I get the sense that like, oh,

181
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.680
like the consequence of saying what you think there is like,

182
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.470
at least in my case was just like, Hey,

183
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:41.310
maybe I might go to jail right in Singapore. But,

184
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:42.670
but in Iraq it was death.

185
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.270
<v 1>And I think it's hard for people in America to really grasp what</v>

186
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:49.510
that environment must be like,

187
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.430
because we're so accustomed to this idea of freedom of speech

188
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.060
and it's SOS ingrained too. Yes. It's so ingrained. Yeah.

189
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.180
Rebels are appreciated and tolerated here, you know, they're rewarded. Exactly.

190
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.690
Yeah.

191
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.180
<v 0>It's the whole Maverick thing. I think, you know,</v>

192
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.740
as long as America still can celebrate Mavericks and tolerate,

193
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.740
not just tolerate them, but actually celebrate them. Yeah. We're,

194
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.300
we're gonna be fine. Right. Yeah. And hopefully.

195
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.650
<v 1>Hopefully the thing is that if it exists the way it exists in other parts of the</v>

196
00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:23.210
world, it can exist like that here.

197
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.290
Like the worst cases of human behavior. When you see,

198
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.070
you know,

199
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.890
any form of dictatorship or control or propaganda or control

200
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.210
by the state or by industry,

201
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.760
that's stuff that you see in other countries is human beings in 2020. Right?

202
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.680
I mean, our, we would like to think that our constitution,

203
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.560
bill of rights and all of our ideals and what this country was founded on is

204
00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:52.520
gonna keep it from deteriorating like that. And most likely it will.

205
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.200
But the reality is those people in Iraq are human beings in

206
00:11:57.201 --> 00:11:58.040
2020.

207
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.320
And they're living in a completely different way than we're living right now at

208
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:05.920
the same, on the same timeline, right. Because things did not go well there.

209
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.920
And they're stuck in this horrible situation where they are controlled

210
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.790
by these religious finance addicts and they are stuck and there's not a lot

211
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.590
that they can do other than escape.
