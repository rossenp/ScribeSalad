00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.200
<v 0>You're talking about Trump,</v>

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.800
you're talking about the Trump before he found Jesus &lt;laugh&gt;

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.960
and he's like, I don't have a past. And he is like, I am born again.

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.160
I do not have a past. Do you?

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.800
And he was going on about this whole thing about this concept of Trump is now,

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.920
uh, an agent of God, but.

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.440
<v 1>I, I don't necessarily even think it's Chris.</v>

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
I think that religion can be infinitely malleable to the purposes of the moment.

9
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:29.110
Right? Sure. He wouldn't have said that about Obama or whoever. Right. Right.

10
00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:33.790
You know, you pick and choose when you apply your, um, criteria. Like I,

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.950
I did this once as an exercise for myself.

12
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.750
There's certain phrases in the Bible or certain passages in the Bible,

13
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.140
which are sort of unapologetically left wing and socialist. Right.

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.500
Just like there are others that are unapologetically,

15
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:50.180
right wing and authoritarian. It's a big book full of different things. Right.

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.460
So I wondered like how, what do they tell themselves? You know,

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.780
what do the people who don't fall on that side of the spectrum tell themselves

18
00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:58.740
about these passages in the Bible. So there's one famous,

19
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:03.410
very famous passage about how it is easy year for, uh, um,

20
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.370
a camel to pass through the I,

21
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.290
of a needle than for a ment to enter the kingdom of heaven. Right. Right.

22
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.930
Clearly I think that anyone who reads this says this is an anti rich person

23
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.330
&lt;laugh&gt; statement. So I like, I, you can Google it, like,

24
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:21.330
so what do people say about this? So my favorite explanation was that sure.

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.600
It's impossible for camels to pass through the eyes of, of a needle,

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.520
except if Jesus helps them.

27
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.840
<v 0>Or if you grind the camel down to a very, that's not what they.</v>

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.720
<v 1>Dust and they interpret particle the time. Jesus said that only through Jesus,</v>

29
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.400
do we get into heaven? That's really the only lesson they get from. Oh.

30
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.320
<v 0>Oh, okay. So that's nothing to do with rich people.</v>

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.390
All I have to do is find Jesus. And if you're rich, you're good. Well, this.

32
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.710
<v 1>Is why on your own. You're. I, this is why I can't, even though I'm an atheist,</v>

33
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.350
I'm, I'm, I'm very happy to explain why I don't think that God exists,

34
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.350
but I don't blame religion most of the time for people's bad actions.

35
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.550
Cuz I think that religion is just sort of a catalyst,

36
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.430
lets people find excuses for their bad actions.

37
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.620
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but it's usually bad actions.

38
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.540
The desire to do bad actions that comes first. Most of the.

39
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900
<v 0>Time. Do you ever look at religion as a potential,</v>

40
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.740
almost evolutionary software program.

41
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.260
That's allowed people to sort of adopt morality

42
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.900
and impose certain standards of behavior that are conducive to civilization.

43
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.090
<v 1>So people talk about that. And again, I'm not an expert there I,</v>

44
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.290
a little skeptical because it sounds like too much of a pat story to tell after

45
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.011
the fact, right.

46
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:34.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think that we are a little bit quick to attribute ideas

47
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.850
and cultural concepts to evolution. Um, but certainly, you know,

48
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.930
religion was not like just science done badly back in the day, right?

49
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.400
Like what religion was was something much more expansive inter inter

50
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.160
leafed with your, um, life overall.

51
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.480
So it was not just how the world was created and, and whether God exists.

52
00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:00.040
It was how to be a good person, how to live in your community, things like that.

53
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.800
And you know, disentangling,

54
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.080
these things is one of the reasons why religion is still hanging around, right?

55
00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:10.840
Like even after the kind of underpinnings of the religion,

56
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.720
in terms of understanding how the world works have been removed by science,

57
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.640
the other functions are still there. And I I'm a big, you know, critic of,

58
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.550
of my fellow naturalists who have not put enough effort into replacing the

59
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.270
other functions of religion now that the, uh, the,

60
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.750
the claims about the world are no longer viable.

61
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.430
<v 0>Mm that's a great way to present it. Yeah. And it's,</v>

62
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.470
it's really a problem when there's so many versions.

63
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.180
<v 1>Yeah. So I mean, one of the many,</v>

64
00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:45.860
many reasons why I think that it's not really credible to be religious

65
00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:50.780
intellectually is because if in the classic traditional,

66
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:54.540
Western religious sense where there's a God and he cares about us, right?

67
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.580
So there's all sorts of questions about where we define the boundary of

68
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.090
religion, whether Buddhism is a religion or something like, like that,

69
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.570
but in the usual sense that we, that we grew up with in, uh, this country, um,

70
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.810
surely if that were true, God,

71
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.970
would've done a much better job of explaining himself to us. Right. Right.

72
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.610
Why would God give us his message through a bunch of people in a tiny country

73
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.650
who didn't write, you know,

74
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.480
like the new Testament wasn't and written down until decades after the event,

75
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.600
none of the people who wrote it down were eyewitnesses.

76
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.480
Why is it only shared there? I mean, God, it's, God is God, right?

77
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.360
Like he could easily have showed up to everybody in the world, talk to them,

78
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.240
explain how things were going and let them make their own choices. Yeah.

79
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.320
That would've been a much more efficient way of getting the message out.

80
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.600
And so it's just not really sensible to think.

81
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.470
So if God didn't exist,

82
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.430
then what you would imagine is that in different countries,

83
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.070
in different parts of the world, in different periods in history,

84
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.990
people would tell their own stories and they'd all be a little bit different and

85
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:53.830
they'd be adapted to their local circumstances and they'd be utterly

86
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.830
incompatible with each other. And that's exactly what you find. Do you.

87
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.500
<v 0>Speculate as to what the origins of the concept of God are</v>

88
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.940
since so many different groups of people all over the world have a very similar

89
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.540
idea, at least that there's some omnipotent superpower that's

90
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:13.420
controlling the destiny of everything.

91
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.180
<v 1>Yeah. So number one,</v>

92
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.940
I think that the idea of omnipotence was actually somewhat late coming onto the

93
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.420
scene, right? Like if you dig into, uh,

94
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.770
what was happening before 2000 years ago, um, you know,

95
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:29.610
the Hebrew God was not omnipotent at the beginning, right? I mean,

96
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.490
the Hebrews came out of a polytheistic society where there were lots of

97
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:37.530
different gods around and you can trace how their God evolved over time.

98
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.840
And first, you know, became their God, right? Like this was one odd that,

99
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.480
that the Hebrews were, uh, you know, uh,

100
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:48.920
worshiping and the Egyptians and the Babylonians would worship other gods.

101
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.880
Then they started saying, well, our God is better than all the other ones.

102
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.480
And then they started saying, well, the other ones don't even exist. Right.

103
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:58.040
And it was an evolution over time. And omnipotence came late.

104
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.440
Like you would talk about God's quarreling. If you were a polytheistic, a pagan,

105
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.881
uh,

106
00:06:02.881 --> 00:06:06.480
culture it's actually makes more like a lot of the world makes more sense if you

107
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:09.160
believe there's a whole bunch of gods out there who disagree with each other,

108
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.520
right. Suddenly lots of aspects of reality, you know, come into focus. Uh,

109
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.230
but the idea there's supernatural, very powerful, uh,

110
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.590
influences in the world. I mean, that's just an obvious idea.

111
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.510
I think like we're human beings. We tend to,

112
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.790
as our first guess in understanding the world, treat the world as,

113
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.110
you know, humanists, like we're, we're, we're anthropomorphic, right?

114
00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:34.710
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like if something exists there must have been designed.

115
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:37.300
There must be a reason there must be a purpose. Uh, uh,

116
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.660
things work in a certain way cuz someone made them that way and that we don't

117
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.140
see that person hanging around. So it must be, you know,

118
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.660
up there in the sky or something like that.

119
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:48.980
I don't think it's that hard to imagine that all sorts of different cultures

120
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.720
would evolve.

121
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.140
<v 0>Do you think it's also a function of us growing up with mentors and father</v>

122
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.460
figures and leaders and chief ins and there's always someone who is the,

123
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.370
the big, the big Cohuna. So this is the sky daddy. Yeah.

124
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.410
The sky daddy overlooks the big picture.

125
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.590
<v 1>I think there's that.</v>

126
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.850
And also the idea of your ancestors and ancestor worship or veneration. Right.

127
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:14.650
Which is also very, almost universal, you know, in, in primitive cultures. Um,

128
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.970
like you don't wanna admit you died. Right. That's, that's a sad thing to,

129
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.240
to sit through. So I don't know.

130
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.400
I'm sure there are real experts who know a lot about the actual origins of these

131
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.234
things. But,

132
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.080
but my point is just that I don't take the commonalities between

133
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:32.680
different sets of religious beliefs as evidence for anything other than,

134
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.120
as a very human thing to invent.

135
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.400
<v 0>People, search for meaning. And they take meaning, uh,</v>

136
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.950
from what,

137
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.390
whatever religion or ideology that they subscribe to.

138
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.350
And they use it as sort of a,

139
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.780
a reason why they're living. It gives them hope. It gives them,

140
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.780
gives them something.

141
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.300
<v 1>Yeah. It's a very common theme among, um,</v>

142
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.650
religious thinker that if it weren't for the existence of God or, or whatever,

143
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.050
there'd be no reason to live.

144
00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:07.210
There'd be no reason to be a good person and so forth. Yeah. And you know,

145
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.610
I think it's, uh,

146
00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:12.170
it goes back to the motivation we have as having bodies versus being in a

147
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.210
computer. Like there's plenty of reasons to do different things. Like in,

148
00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:20.200
in the big picture. My last book, I talk a lot about, um, you know,

149
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:25.000
we, we it's okay to admit that we, as human beings have desires that we,

150
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.560
there are things we care about that we want to be true.

151
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.440
And you can talk about why that's true from evolution,

152
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.320
from biology and whatever, but it doesn't matter why. In some sense,

153
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.040
we have goals. We are not completely aimless. Like we wanna survive.

154
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.750
We wanna flourish. We wanna be friends with people. We have families,

155
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.990
whatever it is we wanna do all that we put together in terms of morality and

156
00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:47.710
ethics and meaning,

157
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.950
and purpose comes out of thinking hard and carefully,

158
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.070
hopefully about, uh,

159
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.310
how to systematize and grow those existing desires that we have into a

160
