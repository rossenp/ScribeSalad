00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Tell me about the hearing aids.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.570
Cause you took them out when you got in and put the headphones on. And this,

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.270
this is from listening to music too loud. No,

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.950
that you'd think you'd think you'd think. No. Uh, I've uh, genetic,

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.380
uh, problem that I didn't know about until three years ago.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.450
And, um, so it's not, and I went to an audiologist. Here's what happened.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.340
I started noticing, uh, Tina and I had been together for a couple of years.

8
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.760
I started noticing, I was saying, excuse me, what? I just,

9
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:33.900
I wouldn't hear stuff.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
Or she would say something that I couldn't remember hearing. And, um,

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.270
and I brought it up to her and I said, how do you,

12
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.970
what do you think I ask you to repeat something a lot. She says, uh,

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.940
doesn't really bother me. And then it says, but the TV is very loud.

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.670
So really the TV is very loud. I said, oh, I don't even realize that.

15
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:58.470
So I went to an audiologist and lo and behold, um, my grandmother, um,

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.430
uh, on my dad's side was completely deaf almost from her teens.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.470
So I have some of this, uh, but it's been okay. Only as you get older,

18
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:09.480
everything, the levels, you know, to see like here,

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.170
here's a level where you can hear everything and I was already kind of there.

20
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:16.800
So now it's just due to age, everything goes down a bit.

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.670
And so I'm missing one K and one kilohertz I'm missing different,

22
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.080
different tones. Um, and so I went to an audiologist and said, well,

23
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.580
it's very mild, but yeah,

24
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:29.670
this can make you repeat stuff and it will get worse over time.

25
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.180
And what actually happens to a lot of men in particular is that they become very

26
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:34.290
isolated from the world.

27
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.570
They don't even realize that they have a hearing problem.

28
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.530
And now the difference between having them in and taking them out is massive.

29
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.430
Um, just, you know, I can hear how much less it is.

30
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.920
Another clue was that I have a, uh, for my, all my podcast, radio work I've,

31
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.370
you know, headphone, but I put an extra amplifier on. You can see,

32
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.810
you could still hear it today.

33
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.320
Sometimes I'm talking and it'll leak just a little bit.

34
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.710
Cause they have it so loud. Now that's not going to damage my ears.

35
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:05.340
But the problem with anything you put in your ears, you don't,

36
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:09.300
you can't hear the sound anymore. And I like that our processing,

37
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:13.440
our IQ is very important to me. So I can hear that without the hearing aids,

38
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:15.540
but not with the hearing aids. Oh, that's interesting.

39
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.060
So the hearing aids give you a different kind of sound well,

40
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:21.360
so today's hearing aid is not your, your grandpa's, you know,

41
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:25.080
geriatric brown goopy looking piece of that makes you look like a,

42
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:30.000
just a total moron. How dare you? You did the face. I did the face.

43
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.830
Hey, it's disability here. I get, I get a victim card. Okay. You can get a,

44
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:39.780
probably a plate boundaries. Boundaries. Okay. So these are the,

45
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.580
um, wide X evoke. These have 35 channels of compressor, limiter,

46
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.850
multiple settings. Um, it's an in ear.

47
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.090
So it goes right into my ear. Um,

48
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.760
I still have a little bleed through from the outside world,

49
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:57.750
but B so usually an audiologist sticks this thing in your ears and makes you do

50
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.940
all the tests and they'll sit there and they'll sit across from you and they're

51
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:05.080
going to program it so that you can then hear normal sound,

52
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.080
which is very, it's a very, you have to be a trained professional.

53
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:13.000
It's very hard to, um, fix someone who has never heard what is proper. Oh,

54
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:17.230
wow. Okay. Um, now I'm a little different and I'm also way into sound.

55
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.960
And so it's a whole racket. These things are three and a half thousand dollars.

56
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.400
It's, it's a huge racket.

57
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.120
And the way they do it is the manufacturer you can't buy from the directly or

58
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.150
from retail. You can only buy it through an audiologist.

59
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.170
So they're already getting half the money from, you know, the 1500 at least.

60
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.110
And you have to have, uh, uh, you know, appointments.

61
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:36.490
There's all this money that goes on top.

62
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.850
And then you come back after a couple months and they tweak it and you come back

63
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:44.500
again. So I said, look, see who I am.

64
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:48.460
I've told you what I do. Give me the software. She said, oh no, no.

65
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.520
I was going to give it to you. I just wanted to do one session with,

66
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.650
you said you have to have this. So I have, I have,

67
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.560
pre-programmed like six different programs so I can do one just for

68
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.940
music. I can do one for television, uh, one for social situations.

69
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.250
And I have one that I, so I did it all myself, all these 1535, uh,

70
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.170
different channels of compressor limiter.

71
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.950
So when I'm walking around, what I hear on my ears is like a radio show.

72
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.580
Like the sound like when I'm talking right now, I hear my own voice.

73
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.530
It all resonates because I've jacked all that up. So I've made my own, um,

74
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.980
sound reality of sound. But I also have one,

75
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:32.500
I can set it to a setting in the mall.

76
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:37.450
I can hear a conversation from 50 feet away. Whoa. It was my, my space,

77
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.800
my eavesdropping setting.

78
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.610
Now the only thing that does that doesn't work is you can't have headphones

79
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.310
cause that, that doesn't work. Having the,

80
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.130
the hearing aids in with the headphones, the sound,

81
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.630
because you're blasting into the microphone. It really doesn't work. That's.

82
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.500
<v 1>Crazy though, that you could hear people having a conversation 50 feet away.</v>

83
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.510
Can you focus in on people or?

84
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.520
<v 0>Yeah, I turned my wow. There's I mean, there's a lot. You can, you can focus.</v>

85
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:07.330
You can have it automatic. So the problem is the way I've set it up.

86
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.220
You can drop a pen there. If I don't see it, I might hear it over there. Now.

87
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.280
That's always going to be a problem. They have, they have a,

88
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.570
an algorithm that will try to guess where the sound is from and tell your ears

89
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:23.860
that, um, so basically I'm not the guy you want in the battlefield.

90
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.580
<v 1>Like telling you the shots. Oh.</v>

91
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.380
<v 0>My God. I just can't hear it. Wow. Um, but just for,</v>

92
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.680
uh, yeah, so it just doesn't work with headphones. That's why I take them out.

93
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.930
<v 1>It's amazing though. The sound incredibly potent like, oh yeah.</v>

94
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.020
You remember? I mean, you know what real sound sounds.

95
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.270
Does everything sound real to you or.

96
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.120
<v 0>Well, what you automatically do? Um, uh, because I was able to do it. I,</v>

97
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.780
from having a con I have different settings for different situations.

98
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.560
So if I'm at home, it's relatively quiet or we have some music on or, you know,

99
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.000
TV or whatever. Um, now I have the Tina frequency, which is, you know,

100
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.050
kind of like one kilohertz and that's where I hear her better. And so that's,

101
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.080
uh, jacked up a little bit, but then if I hear you talk,

102
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.710
I can hear it'll be a little, I can hear. It's not exactly you.

103
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.280
It's a little too tinny, maybe so, but that's just me. I mean,

104
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.610
that's not everyone's experience of course, but to me it's,

105
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.900
the disability has become incredible joy because I,

106
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:29.270
I have like virtual reality on my head all the time.

107
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.710
<v 1>Saying that you could probably with someone's voice, like a Snapchat filter.</v>

108
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.023
Well.

109
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.830
<v 0>It's really advanced. I mean, you can, um, connect to an iPhone so you can,</v>

110
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.480
you can stream wirelessly. Um, uh, you can do, like,

111
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.280
if you're driving with directions with the maps and you can just be talking in

112
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.160
your ear, all of a sudden, like you the light turn, right? No one else hears it.

113
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.140
There's no wires, no nothing. I got, you know,

114
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.300
you wouldn't even know I had them in, unless you look.

115
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.150
<v 1>Yeah, we're becoming cyborgs. Oh.</v>

116
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.500
<v 0>No. That's although I'm against it. That is a part of the, the,</v>

117
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.850
the road to transhumanism.

118
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.241
<v 1>Right.</v>

119
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:08.300
But how can you say you're against it where you you're enjoying this thing?

120
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.360
<v 0>This to me is more, it's not a replacement. It's an enhancement. Yeah.</v>

121
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.380
<v 1>You know, and that's how they're going to get us.</v>

122
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.440
When the first guy gets his legs removed for,

123
00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:22.460
for artificial carbon fiber legs, you could feel,

124
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:24.740
but that can run 60 miles an hour.

125
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:28.520
When the first guy gets his legs removed in favor of new legs.

126
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.830
That's when we're going to go. Holy.

127
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.370
<v 0>Whenever I tell my radio buddies about my hearing aids, they're always like, oh,</v>

128
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.420
that's cool. I want that too.

129
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.170
<v 1>Like, I want that, don't get me wrong. I'm just looking at the bleak landscape.</v>

130
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.800
<v 0>By the way, be aware. I just, I want to say something because there's a lot of,</v>

131
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.760
um, they're not called hearing aids. They're called hearing amplifiers.

132
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.750
They have some fuzzy, legal language that are coming on the market. You know,

133
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.730
that you put all the way in your ear.

134
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:59.780
The rechargeable has got a whole bunch of them. They're much, much cheaper. Um,

135
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.590
from an audio standpoint, I've done it for 40 years.

136
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.190
That's not the way you want to go. If you seriously want to know how to,

137
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.090
if you want to hear properly again. So see an audiologist is what I'm saying.

138
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.430
And there's lots of different, you know, it doesn't,

139
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.060
it's not all three and a half thousand dollars. It's more expensive, but don't,

140
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.540
I just recommend that that's self testing is not a good idea.

141
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.530
<v 1>One of the best pool players in the world is a guy named Shane van boning.</v>

142
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.670
And Shane is a deaf, he was born deaf. And when he plays,

143
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.010
he shuts his hearing aids off and he just,

144
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.360
it's a world of silence and he's just playing in complete total silence.

145
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.810
And when he does that, when he shuts his hearing aid off,

146
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.030
he feels like he's got super concentration.

147
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.860
Like it doesn't matter what else is going on.

148
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.100
All he's doing is just focusing on the balls and there's no,

149
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.720
that that sense doesn't exist so he can he's hyper-focused on other things.

150
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.860
And I noticed that sometimes when I would walk with noise canceling headsets.

151
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.810
<v 0>It'll do similar. I'll smell.</v>

152
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.643
<v 1>Things more.</v>

153
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:58.951
<v 0>Well.</v>

154
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.670
That's kind of well known is that different parts of your body compensate for

155
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.253
somethings.

156
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.980
<v 1>More tuned in the more tuned in like, look, glitz, pay attention here.</v>

157
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.600
The years are offline.

158
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.420
A mountain lion could be running behind you and you're listening to the all

159
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.254
things considered.

160
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.210
<v 0>But that's think about it.</v>

161
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:17.670
If you can't hear the mountain line frequencies anymore.

162
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.090
And today's mountain lion is, you know, car engines, all kinds of stuff,

163
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.410
you can't hear it. It's dangerous and you don't know it. You just slip into it.

164
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.910
I had no idea until, you know, we haven't new relationship, you know?

165
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.420
So we've been living together for a couple of years and luckily, you know,

166
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.590
we're completely open and honest, like, Hey, this is this up. Yeah.

167
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:38.220
It's pretty cool.

168
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.550
<v 1>Cool. That, that exists though. I mean, that's an elegant solution.</v>

169
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.480
And for someone like you,

170
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.210
it's actually gives you a chance to tinker with and I'm sure I'm sure you really

171
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.900
enjoy that aspect of it. Yeah. You love that. I really do.

172
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.870
I can tell a small, it's a small thing,

173
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:55.080
but it talks about the apps in your phone and you're so excited about that.
