00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.870
Of called up by the Donald Trump of gangster over and over again. And I,

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:09.540
and I say that because there's a gangster inside of me.

4
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.190
I got to reconquer concrete every day.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.480
So I know gangsters when I see you and gangsters,

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.800
not a subjective expression,

7
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.270
it's an objective condition of you grabbing a woman's parts. That's gangster,

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.560
you stealing somebody's oil, another country that's gangster you lines.

9
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:30.150
And these people have said that the America's garbage quit line that's gangster.

10
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.410
They got a critique of America.

11
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:34.500
You did two in American carnage and your integration, you said,

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.960
or you're talking about the full sisters in Congress,

13
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.970
then we'll all evil Jews know Dan said evil

14
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:45.030
Jews. They said evil doings of Israel.

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.600
Every nation state has dumped some evil things, right?

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.390
If there's a Palestinian state, which I hope there is,

17
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.160
they're going to do some evil things. Every nation state has to be accountable.

18
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.370
You is UPO, bill Guatemala, Israel, China,

19
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.400
and so forth and so on.

20
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.700
And every nation state has been associated with certain forms of barbarism.

21
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.840
We know that, but there's some good things, some wonderful things about Israel,

22
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:13.110
some wonderful things about Palestinians and formation, creating a state.

23
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.810
That's wonderful things about America. I mean, a lot of people say,

24
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.480
even brother Trump wall, they hate America.

25
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.420
Now they love American comics.

26
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.610
They love American music. You asked sister Talia,

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.520
you asked us the priestly. Y'all love a reefer.

28
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.300
I've read the Franklin means the world to me. What about Mary J?

29
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.770
Mary J means the world.

30
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:38.670
Mary J and Aretha are as American as Donald Trump.

31
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.500
Even more in some ways,

32
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.240
because they've been here longer that people have been there.

33
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.960
10 generation Donald Trump's grandfather just arrived.

34
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.850
His mother straight from Scotland, precious Maryanne, 1930. She arrived.

35
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:54.510
Right? And so in that sense, you say, wait, wait a well, quit lie.

36
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.810
And let's just be honest and candid, just like the comics.

37
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.630
Let's just be honest and candid and recognize.

38
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.490
Cause what is the definition of comedy? It is first drama,

39
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.440
which is conflict emotionally felt and re critically

40
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:14.310
reflected upon. But it's that conflict that's rooted in,

41
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:17.880
in congruency things don't fit.

42
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.270
So there's the possibility of hypocrisy, right?

43
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.440
And we know hypocrisy is attribute of vice to virtue.

44
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.610
So that just standards and you fall short. So you can laugh at it.

45
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.500
Now when it's really deep, comedy is talking about the human condition.

46
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.320
See, that's a deeper thing. Now see,

47
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:42.180
that's where you get checked off and Shakespeare and joys and the blues

48
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.820
because deep comedy is the recognition of limits than

49
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:52.110
in congruency at the highest levels of the mind, heart and soul.

50
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.550
That's the different thing. So I mean, you can start with comedy with, uh,

51
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.880
you know, the clown who was, who was walking around,

52
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.880
slipping on bananas or the sophisticated professor who doesn't realize

53
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.000
that he got a banana hanging out the back of his pocket.

54
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.220
When he's lecturing with the students, everybody laughing,

55
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.310
he don't know what's going on. Well, that's bodily based comedy,

56
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.200
farts and bananas and so forth. And it's it's important. Yes,

57
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.180
but high comedy is the highest levels of human.

58
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:24.820
Dignity, love,

59
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.680
thought music, mathematics, metaphysics,

60
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.000
and then recognize all of those are in congruence.

61
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.940
They're broken, they're fractured,

62
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.430
there's dramatic conflict of incongruity at the highest

63
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.710
levels of who we are as a species.

64
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.100
Now that's deep stuff that is deep stuff. Oh Lord, Lord.

65
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.160
And one of the most fundamental questions in Western civilization is how come

66
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.990
Socrates never cries and Jesus never laughs.

67
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.303
Ooh.

68
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.170
And that's the question Thomas Moore was wrestling with in the tower of London

69
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.350
before he was executed in his dialogues or tribulation,

70
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.460
Socrates never shed the tear. What does that mean?

71
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.470
The founder of philosophy in the modern west has a love of

72
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:17.981
wisdom,

73
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:22.090
but he never loves people because it's impossible to love human beings and not

74
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.530
shed tears. Wow. You go to your momma's funeral and you're not shedding tears.

75
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:30.430
And you're committed to the Socratic ideal of self-mastery and self control.

76
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.800
You need to get off the crack pipe, get off show heart,

77
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.660
the depths of your love for her through being outside of your self-mastery,

78
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.570
the tears will flow. You said, and it could stay all the way.

79
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:44.404
It's like your daughter,

80
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.230
this precious thing that you got when we walk in for your daughter,

81
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.430
when she graduates you and your wife is going to have tears of joy.

82
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.480
That at the moment for self mastery, that's not the moment to be so critic.

83
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.800
And so when Socrates's dying, his wife walks into Zen tippy and she's crying.

84
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.130
He's to get her, I'll get away, get him. I can't stand to use that as a problem.

85
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.340
Yeah. That's the problem. See, I come from Blackfoot, we start with tears,

86
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.310
all the mess we had to come to terms with, you know what I mean,

87
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.930
cries and so forth.

88
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.450
The Hebrew scripture begins with the Christ will press people to write,

89
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.250
but then Jesus never laughs. Ooh, I see. That's a deep one. That is a deep one.

90
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.700
That's GK Chesterton. Chesterton said,

91
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.770
Jesus turns over the tables of the money changes.

92
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:31.660
He does not conceal his rage. Crucial.

93
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.180
Jesus does weep.

94
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.110
That's one of the most profound verses in the Christian Bible, right?

95
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.460
Jesus wept. Unlike Socrates, why did Jesus weep?

96
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.780
He wept for Jerusalem. He wept for Lazarus. He left wept for his friends,

97
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.060
but Jesus hides and conceals his mirth. That's what Chesterson says.

98
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.720
Is there any laughter in the Bible? Well, Isaac means laughter.

99
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.060
When you think of joke of an oldest,

100
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.110
Sarah given birthed to a young person in an older age and so forth,

101
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.170
but it's hard to catch Jesus laughing.

102
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.950
None of the synoptic gospels have Jesus laughing.

103
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.390
Some people thought they discerned a grin somewhere because he turned wine into

104
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.550
water. He probably had a little rant on it.

105
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.770
Exactly, exactly. But uh, uh,

106
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.660
but you can never get the full scale and variety of the human

107
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:29.780
condition in any one tradition.

108
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.330
<v 1>I think one of the beauties of what you're saying here,</v>

109
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.660
one of the beautiful things about what you're saying here is the complexity of

110
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:40.310
human beings. And when you're dealing with the situation between these girls,

111
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.360
that call themselves a squad and Donald Trump and you deal with these very

112
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:49.280
simplistic things like these chance of send her back or lock her up

113
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.520
or they hate America. Or you know, this,

114
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.290
this is simplifying things is,

115
00:06:55.291 --> 00:07:00.290
is so attractive to some people and so attractive during political discourse.

116
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:01.940
Right? Do during these, these times,

117
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.340
when you're trying to rally up a campaign and get, get,

118
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.660
get the audience behind you, this is when these simplistic things resonate.

119
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.860
But as a human being, we know that things like I don't, I don't,

120
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.460
I don't subscribe to this idea that human beings are good or

121
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:21.940
bad. I think there's yeah. There's,

122
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.190
I'm sure like the way Donald Trump loves his family.

123
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:27.890
I'm sure there's love in that guy. I'm sure there are.

124
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.020
<v 0>Oh, I mean he's had some, you know,</v>

125
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:34.910
relations to his mother and his brothers and sisters that were not ones of sheer

126
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:38.240
manipulation of domination is no doubt as a human being.

127
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:42.740
And it's important to keep track of his humanity. Uh, but at the same time,

128
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:45.890
what happens is the dominant patterns of behavior.

129
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.380
This is what worries me about brother Trump's best lead.

130
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:53.030
The fact that he's head of the American empire and handed the government.

131
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:57.950
You see that when you have dominant patterns of behavior that are completely on

132
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.440
accountable, see for so long,

133
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:05.300
he's been able to get away with things with no accountability at all.

134
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.490
Yes. That's what makes him a kind of a Peter pan like figure.

135
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.320
<v 1>Until he became president.</v>

136
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.620
<v 0>She grew up powerful, but he hadn't grown up. But even as president,</v>

137
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:19.850
he hasn't grown up. People had thought that he would grow into the office.

138
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.490
Now he just hasn't grown up. You know, he's still.

139
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.200
<v 1>Uniquely tried to manipulate the office position to change, to be what he is.</v>

140
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.590
That's right. And I think people love that. There's certain people that,

141
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.160
that resonates with them. They think that's so attractive. They love.

142
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.440
<v 0>Well, they, I think they love it cause it's expense that,</v>

143
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.870
I mean, the first thing that Trump was able to do was to expose the

144
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.190
prepackage commodities that we call politicians,

145
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.290
that he came across as somebody who was just himself. Yes.

146
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.980
You see just gangster. Daddy is, and he'd just tell the truth.

147
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.020
Oh, I was a close friend of Hillary's.

148
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:04.050
I was been at the same weddings and so forth because that's how the elite

149
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.530
circulate in American empire.

150
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.410
But then when they discovered lo and behold,

151
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:14.280
he's now he's posing himself as some kind of oppositional figure.

152
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:19.050
And yet he tied the big money tied the big military when he gets in,

153
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:24.000
he brings in the old school militarist people he's

154
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.480
deal dropping bombs on the nine countries that had been dropped in bounds for

155
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.550
the last number of years.

156
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.440
Tax cuts sound exactly the same that Mitch McConnell and others

157
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:38.850
wanted. We thought we had something different here. You see,

158
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.000
and it has to do with the well when Mr. Larger story,

159
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.880
we have to be honest about this, that, um,

160
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.610
see we live in both a very fragile and

161
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.280
precious experiment in democracy.

162
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.890
And we live in an empire that is experiencing profound

163
00:09:58.891 --> 00:09:59.820
decline,

164
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.620
decay and deterioration simultaneous.

165
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.910
So he confronted very beginning and understates was really in some ways,

166
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.710
much more tied to gold and resources and

167
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:14.544
land.

168
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.470
And so this really crucial democratic experiment is

169
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:24.360
predicated on the monstrous crime against indigenous peoples that we've never

170
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:25.230
come to terms with.

171
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.940
So you get a lot of Neo liberal chatter about America's original Slint

172
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.800
slavery. That's a lie.

173
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.230
The original sin was we had to decide whether we were going to co-exist with

174
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:39.660
indigenous peoples or dominate them.

175
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.510
And the decision was for the most part genocidal effect in terms of

176
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:50.190
domination. So it's a settler colonial society, a colony of Britain.

177
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.503
You see,

178
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.160
then we enslaved the Africans who become the basis of our economy.

179
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.560
And the vast majority of profits made were actually tied to

180
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.071
slavery.

181
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:05.070
That's why so many of the president's first presidents in America was slave

182
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:05.581
holders.

183
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:10.050
And the chief justice of the Supreme court was slave holders and so forth.

184
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.280
That that doesn't mean that certain democratic practices were not being enacted,

185
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.550
but it was inactive for white brothers would property,

186
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.200
the white brothers who had no property, they couldn't vote at all. The women,

187
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:24.690
of course couldn't vote until 1920.

188
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.220
And so he had domestic households in which they had to find some sense of

189
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.054
fulfillment.

190
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.990
That's what history of patriarchy and misogyny in part are connected.

191
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.190
And then tremendous efforts come to expanding it,

192
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.590
expanding it. And this is why even when brother Trump talks about socialism.

193
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.640
So he doesn't realize the pledge of allegiance was written by

194
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.600
Francis Bellamy, who was a socialist,

195
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.660
the song American, the beautiful, which was one of the most beautiful songs.

196
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.420
Ray, Charles, sing that song and take you to a different place. I mean,

197
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.550
he's seeing things that we can't see and you know, he's blind.

198
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.590
You know what I mean, America,

199
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.950
the beautiful and Elizabeth Lee Bates socialists,

200
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.870
professor Wellesley, who was our greatest poet, Walt Whitman,

201
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.570
Pete ties of socialism, who was our greatest philosopher, John Dewey,

202
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.900
democratic socialist, his whole life,

203
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.400
Helen Keller deaf mute blind graduate of

204
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.060
Radcliffe, socialists, Ryan whole neighbor,

205
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:31.240
the greatest Christian thinker to 20th century,

206
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.890
democratic socialist moral man at Memorial society. Martin Luther king Jr.

207
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.031
Democratic.

208
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:41.860
So Ella baker Democrat democratic socialism is as American as

209
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:42.910
apple pie,

210
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.320
but with the communists and the communist

211
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.610
threat and the Soviet union and all of its

212
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:53.560
repression and regiment,

213
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.570
tation and violation of liberties and killing of the cool and so forth in the

214
00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:02.590
American mind, socialism becomes associated with communism.

215
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.330
So you saw brother Lindsey the other day, right? He looked like a cartoon,

216
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:09.880
his version of, of, of Joseph McCarthy.

217
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.340
They're all coming as they're all communists.

218
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.030
And you see what happens is in a Neo fascist discourse.

219
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.320
It's true anywhere around the world.

220
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.750
If you can define a community as pure and then characterize

221
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.340
those on the outside who were threatened as impure and didn't view

222
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:32.080
yourself as those coming to the rescue to preserve the purity,

223
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.590
it can be based on race. It can be based on religion.

224
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.370
It can be based on politics preserved at purity.

225
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.560
We saw it in the fifties with the hysteria,

226
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.690
the comments are what Smith act they're deported or they're taken to jail.

227
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.740
Make the first,

228
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.660
the first city Councilman from Harlem Benjamin Davis went to jail because he was

229
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:55.480
a communist. You see, because they were the impure.

230
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:01.360
Now communism needs to be radically called into question in

231
00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:06.130
terms of its dominating forms like the Soviet union and China on the mile and so

232
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:08.440
forth and so on. But at the same time,

233
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:11.620
when you look at Karl Marx and his critique of capitalism,

234
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.310
this is prior to let it prior to styling, he says,

235
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:19.960
capitalism is tied to this obsession with profit that puts

236
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:21.580
profit before people.

237
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.170
And it will generate oligopolies in which there will be grotesque levels of

238
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:27.490
wealth inequality.

239
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.140
And the only way that porn working people will be able to gain access to any

240
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:34.660
resources to do organizing and mobilizing.

241
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.010
Now you can accept that marks is insight without being a Marxist. Pete,

242
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.720
just telling the truth. Do you think.

243
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.770
<v 1>That socialism just hasn't been implemented correctly? Is that what you think?</v>

244
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.791
Because like th the,

245
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:50.320
the argument has always been show me a socialist economy or socialist government

246
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:52.430
that ever worked. Right. Right.

247
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.840
But there's so many people that find the idea of socialism attractive

248
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.790
because it,

249
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.750
it combines this idea of a community with a nation and that we're all

250
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:03.501
tied together.

251
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:08.120
And we ha we obviously have some socialist aspects to our civilization in terms

252
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:09.680
of like utilities and.

253
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.400
<v 0>The military outsource the military.</v>

254
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.650
<v 1>Firefighters. [inaudible].</v>

255
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.130
<v 0>There has to be some kind of governmental control, right.</v>
