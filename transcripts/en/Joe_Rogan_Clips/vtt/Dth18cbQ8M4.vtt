00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.400
<v 1>Logan, Paul went eight rounds with the greatest box that Hass ever lived, dude.</v>

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.120
<v 0>I mean like you, you, there was no cuz there's like, you know,</v>

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.960
many people and I think Logan Paul was aware of this.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.360
We're looking forward to the satisfaction of watching Logan,

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.760
Paul being knocked out by a great box. So there was a sense of like,

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.590
we are going the hand of justice in the world.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.790
You can't just decide you're gonna fight the greatest boxer that ever lived and

9
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.430
come out of that unscathed. You're dead.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.070
We were watching it the way we like people used to watch gladiator things where

11
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:37.070
they would like, you know, put the short face, bear out and like,

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.470
let the gladiator fight it. You know, know what's gonna happen.

13
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.860
The bear's gonna eat gladiator.

14
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.820
<v 1>But, but not in this case, in, in this case, it didn't happen. But here's my,</v>

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.580
you know, it's I wrote an Instagram post about it today because I was,

16
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.660
I was genuinely all day. I was thinking before we got, before I got here,

17
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:58.220
when I was at the gym, I was working out and I was thinking, I was like,

18
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:02.490
there's something about that. That's really intriguing to me. What is it? Yeah.

19
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.290
And I tried to figure out what it was like,

20
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:09.130
what about the novelty of the moment? Like we were you me, Tom Segura,

21
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.770
Tony Hinch. Cliff. Yeah. Ron white and Curtis, Curtis Nelson.

22
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.290
We're all sitting in my house. Yeah. We couldn't wait.

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.770
The thing is about to happen. We're all like, I can't believe this is happening.

24
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.480
I can't believe this is happening.

25
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.880
We're looking at them across the ring from each other. Jake,

26
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.640
Paul's like three feet taller than I'm like, this is bananas. This is so wild.

27
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.280
And he survived and

28
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.280
flew made with a a hundred million dollars. He'd made,

29
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.480
he made like a hundred million fighting. A guy who had never won a professional,

30
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.463
a boxing that holy.

31
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.270
<v 0>The annoying thing. It's amazing.</v>

32
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.110
The announcers weren't acknowledging what was happening, which was like,

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.053
what the?

34
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990
<v 1>This, the problem is they had too many people talking. They had a lot of people.</v>

35
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.030
<v 0>Talking. There was ma.</v>

36
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.270
<v 1>Yeah. How do you say their names? De Samara de Samara. Um,</v>

37
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.580
who's the other guy? Malo, uh, Mauro ran. I already said.

38
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.820
And there was one other gentleman, the guy who got in the ring and interviewed,

39
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.180
uh, Floyd. And uh, I turned it off. I didn't see. Anyway,

40
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:14.420
there was 1, 2, 3, 4 guys talking,

41
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.100
which is a lot of people talking it's it's hard to do.

42
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.740
It's it's but it would've been nice to, to have options.

43
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.410
This is what you said. If there optional stream,

44
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.170
we could listen to like Teddy Atlas. Yeah. Like a boxing expert. So,

45
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.810
because those guys were being funny and they were having a good time and

46
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.370
everything like that, which is great. And that,

47
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.770
I think that like comes from trailer, you know, trailer,

48
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.130
like you have Snoop dog around. Oh yeah, no.

49
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.690
<v 0>No, I get it. I understand what the reason was behind it. But sitting next,</v>

50
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.360
I'm not like I don't watch boxing lot. So it's cool to be sitting next to you.

51
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:47.640
And you're like, oh look, he's like trying to drain him or look, oh look. Yeah.

52
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.840
He up. Because in the very beginning he expended too much energy.

53
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.960
These are things I don't, I don't even know. Yeah. So that's all just,

54
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:56.280
it just added a dimension to it. That was.

55
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.000
<v 1>Interesting. Well, I was trying to break it down technically I'm like,</v>

56
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.760
there's some interesting things that are happen here. Like first of all,

57
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.640
Floyd is consistently putting pressure on him and moving and putting pressure on

58
00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:09.680
him and moving, putting pressure on him. And after the third and fourth round,

59
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.120
everything comes out a little slower. So he has to be more measured.

60
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.910
So what Floyd is doing like is consistently engaging with him and then pull out

61
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.230
and consistently engaging and making him swing a mess and swing a mess.

62
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.030
It's brilliant for people that got mad at it. I get it.

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.470
It's not Manny Pao versus Floyd Mayweather five years ago.

64
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.510
But what it is is one of the best boxers of all time making a hundred million

65
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.180
fighting a guy who's three feet taller than him and 35 pounds heavier than who

66
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.820
can't win. Yeah. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing, dude.

67
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:47.860
That fight was amazing. And there's a lot of amazing things. First of all,

68
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.803
Floyd's amazing.

69
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.740
The fact that Floyd has the balls at 44 years old to decide, oh,

70
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.940
I'm just gonna go ahead and fight some dudes,

71
00:03:55.941 --> 00:04:00.290
35 pounds heavier than me and 26 years old. It's crazy.

72
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.650
It's crazy. And then the fact that he could put it on a guy like Logan Paul,

73
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.290
and here's another one. The fact that Logan Paul went all eight rounds.

74
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.770
That's astounding. You have no idea how tired you would be.

75
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:17.770
If you were boxing with the greatest boxer that's ever lived. I mean,

76
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.200
maybe he's not the greatest because that subjective, but in my opinion,

77
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.240
he's the greatest. The reason why he's the greatest,

78
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.880
in my opinion is he's only been hit hard and hurt like three times his whole

79
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.190
career.

80
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.000
There's no one that can say that the art boxing has always been hit and not

81
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.640
get hit. And in my mind, no one's ever done that better than Floyd Mayweather.

82
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.150
Yeah. Now here he is a, in his forties,

83
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.030
he's made hundreds of millions of dollars fighting people who have really no

84
00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:51.470
chance of beating him. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah. That's crazy, man. That's amazing,

85
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.070
dude. They're the controversy of the day. Uh, people get knocked out.

86
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.790
They got knocked on you being held up right out of here. People are so silly,

87
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:00.870
dude. What if don't understand?

88
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.980
They don't understand about getting hit in the head. These are the same.

89
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.860
Dumies he's just hanging on, man. He's just, he went for an over hook.

90
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.540
You guys have no idea. This position right here,

91
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.380
high elbow going in for an over hook. If he was wrestling,

92
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:16.500
he would go back the other way and throw him on his back.

93
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.860
This is a normal thing for a wrestler. Logan was a wrestler. In fact,

94
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.810
in ready for this. See how he's got that high over hook on the left hand side.

95
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:25.930
Watch how this happens again.

96
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.170
This is what happens when a bunch of people comment on fights that don't know.

97
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.010
You see that high over hook that watch watch one more time. So they, they,

98
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.770
he hits him and now look at Logan's right arm. Watch what happens or excuse me,

99
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:43.360
left arm. See what happens. He's in control. He's holding onto him, right?

100
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:46.680
Right, right. He's not, he's a wrestler. He's not going limp. My friend,

101
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.720
guy Saco who runs defense soap. He that's his company.

102
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.640
He owns that company that I rave about all the time.

103
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.920
He told me today that Logan, Paul was one of his wrestlers in the 1990s.

104
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.360
And he said he was really good. He says really talented kid.

105
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.400
There's a video of him wrestling with Paul Costa, who is a UFC who is,

106
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.840
is rather, excuse me. A UFC middleweight. Contender. Yeah.

107
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:13.800
Like a beast of a guy. Yeah. And Logan's scrambles on this guy. And like,

108
00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:17.950
he looks really good. Like he can wrestle. So when you see that,

109
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.590
when he's not knocked out, you knuckle heads, you stop talking about fighting.

110
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.230
He's holding on. Yeah.

111
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.990
And he's protecting himself and he's controlling Floyd and he is pushing his
