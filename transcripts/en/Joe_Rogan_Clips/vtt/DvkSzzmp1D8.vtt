1
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>Right. Like, like you, you have, you have a government, let's say, you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.560
if you want to be a florist by a lot of these states, they have licenses.

3
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.860
You have to get a license to, to, to sell flowers. Why,

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.090
why can't I just buy flowers from whoever I want? I mean,

5
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:19.770
what's the worst thing that can happen to me.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.470
I buy flowers from a guy that doesn't know what he's doing.

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.230
I get a lousy arrangement. And so I don't go back.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.040
He does the government have to protect me from getting a bad floral arrangement.

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800
Well, look, the free market sorted out. If a guy's no good.

10
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.770
He won't have any customers, but we make it a lot harder.

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:37.320
There's all kinds of regulations and rules and permits.

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.590
Just let people go into business. You know, I mean,

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.220
poor people can start businesses if we didn't make it so expensive and so hard.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.860
And if they can furnish Loris in the marketplace,

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.700
if they can find customers then great. If they're no good at what they do,

16
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.050
they're not going to have any customers.

17
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.280
<v 1>Do you feel like this applies to everything?</v>

18
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.670
This applies to all businesses all the time?

19
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.960
<v 0>I mean, pretty much. I mean, we don't need government, you know,</v>

20
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.160
having these certifications, I mean the private sector is certainly capable.

21
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.300
<v 1>At this point. We look,</v>

22
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.530
is it consideration social media and holding people accountable,

23
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.500
like holding businesses, accountable for their actions.

24
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:20.240
And like it's a different world in terms of like the ability to like

25
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.820
alert consumers as to what's good. And what's bad.

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.490
It's a different world when it comes to that kind of thing. But.

27
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.570
<v 0>People, especially now with the internet, I mean, if a business isn't any good,</v>

28
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:32.240
I mean, it's going to get a bad reputation online. I mean,

29
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:35.930
you're going to have consumer reports that go out and rate look,

30
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.540
look at what happens. Like look at the banks, right?

31
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.930
The banks are completely regulated by the government, right?

32
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:46.310
Everybody who opens up a bank account knows that the government is

33
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:47.630
guaranteeing their deposit.

34
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.640
That wasn't always the case that the deposit insurance didn't start until the

35
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:57.020
1930s because of the bank failures in the great depression, which were minimal.

36
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.960
I mean, fewer than 2% of the banks actually failed.

37
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.610
There wasn't that much in the way.

38
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.580
And we had a lot of banks way more banks than we have now.

39
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.210
Now we just have these massive banks before the government got involved.

40
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.040
We had a very, very competitive market.

41
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.370
We have lots of little banks out there taking deposits,

42
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:17.750
making loans to entrepreneurs, to start businesses and employ people, not,

43
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.160
you know, funding wall street, but once you.

44
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.900
<v 1>The savings and loans collapse, for sure you do right.</v>

45
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.950
<v 0>Yeah, but that was, but those banks had government guarantees,</v>

46
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.950
but that was the problem. That was the problem of the government,

47
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.160
right before the government guaranteed banks,

48
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.200
before you would put your money in a bank, you would do a little research,

49
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.450
just like you do research. Now, before you buy a car, you,

50
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:46.010
you try to figure out which is the best bang for my money,

51
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.150
which bank is the safest, which bank, you know, isn't it having problems.

52
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.780
And you would, you would consult, you know, periodicals or, you know,

53
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:55.820
reviews online, not online,

54
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.890
but you would find out where the banks were good and you would put your money in

55
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.724
that bank.

56
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.260
And now the banks would have to compete on reputation on

57
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.880
honesty. I'm not being aggressive. And they knew that if they,

58
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:12.220
if they made bad loans and they went bank and something happened,

59
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.860
nobody would bail them out. The government wouldn't bail them out.

60
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.360
Their depositors would lose money.

61
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.310
So we had a very sound banking system back then today

62
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.660
it's very unsound.

63
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.290
The banks are doing all sorts of reckless things with their deposits because no

64
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.490
one gives it down. Nobody cares what the bank does with their money.

65
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.540
Once they get deposited because the government guarantees the deposit,

66
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.890
one bank is just as good as another.

67
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:39.130
I'm just going to put whatever bank is closest to me, you know?

68
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.220
And so the government has polluted the entire system.

69
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.790
They've taken away all the checks and balances of a free market.

70
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.040
And now we have a banking system that is completely, you know, uh, reckless, uh,

71
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.180
it's all these banks that we bailed out in oh eight are going to fail again.

72
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:59.050
And they're going to need even bigger bailouts. We have, we have a very fragile,

73
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.510
uh, system, and now they say, well,

74
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:05.620
we can't let one of these banks fail because it's so big. Why is it so big?

75
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.190
Because the government insured their deposits and allowed them to get this big

76
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.760
and allowed them to have access to all this cheap money from the federal

77
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:16.900
reserve. I mean, we, we would have a vibrant, competitive banking system.

78
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.460
If the government got out of the way, we don't need the government to do that.

79
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.190
The banks are,

80
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.990
are much more reckless and much more corrupt now because of government.

81
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.220
Then when we had free market forces, reigning them in, I.

82
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.190
<v 1>Had two more people saying what you're saying, why is.</v>

83
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.310
<v 2>This a controvert far? I mean, I'm not the only.</v>

84
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.350
<v 0>Free market guy out there. As I said,</v>

85
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:41.610
if you have a Jorgensen to libertarian candidate, she'll say some of this stuff.

86
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.420
No. And you know,

87
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.140
I'm sure we could actually have a woman president if we vote for her.

88
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.860
<v 1>Sure. I could find it. If I went looking for it, Peter, what I'm saying is why,</v>

89
00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:52.410
why is this not, you know, there's,

90
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.760
there's various discussions about how we should do things economically moving

91
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:59.250
forward, right? You hear it from a bunch of different experts.

92
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:04.020
I don't hear your perspective. Your perspective is very ruthless and honest.

93
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.090
And some people would say,

94
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.720
maybe you're not considering the people that really don't even have an

95
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:13.890
opportunity to get into this system and compete. There'll be held down.

96
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.330
There'll be put into this. I'm not.

97
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.210
<v 0>I'm not being ruthless. So, no, I haven't been honest,</v>

98
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:22.740
but I think I'm being fair and compassionate because I understand the damage

99
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:25.620
that is being done. I understand. And the name of these programs,

100
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.910
but the reason that you don't see more people like me in positions of power in

101
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:34.080
government is it's because it's hard for people like me to get a power position

102
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:37.440
in government, because we're not beholden to a special interest.

103
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.520
You have so many special interests that are feeding off the public trough,

104
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.030
right? There's so much corporate welfare in this country right now,

105
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:46.350
which is not capitalism.

106
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.370
And so they're not going to fund candidates that want to take away their

107
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.360
corporate welfare.

108
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.870
They want to fund candidates that are going to protect the status quo.

109
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.940
And the same thing with people. Look,

110
00:05:56.941 --> 00:06:01.430
the has crippled so many people that they think they need a government crutch.

111
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.671
You know,

112
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:06.350
that's an old Harry Brown quote that he ran for a libertarian president.

113
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.470
He said, the government is great at crippling you.

114
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.280
And then handing you a crutch and saying, you see, without me, you could walk.

115
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.330
So, so many people have been crippled and they think they need that government

116
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:19.580
crutch. I don't want them to be crippled.

117
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:24.380
I want them to walk on their own right. To be free. You know, I wish,

118
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.890
you know, we, you know, we, we had the 4th of July just recently and you know,

119
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:32.600
we celebrate America and, you know, I talked, I on my old podcast, you know,

120
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.520
about what it means to be an American and people just don't appreciate what

121
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.330
truly America was all about. Right? It's about freedom.

122
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.210
It's about Liberty and individual opportunity.

123
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.830
It's about being left alone from government and being able to achieve all that

124
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:51.380
you can achieve without anybody standing in your way,

125
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.420
without anybody erecting a roadblock. And we created government in America,

126
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.700
government didn't create us. We, you know,

127
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.370
we didn't have a king that gave us some privileges.

128
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.560
We started off as free people.

129
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.730
And we see it as some of our sovereignty to a government to secure and protect

130
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:11.900
our rights. And that's it. And that's what made Americans, rugged individuals,

131
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.700
right? With OU who were not beholden or begging from government, right? They,

132
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.830
they, they, they took care of themselves and they took care of their neighbors.

133
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:22.580
If their neighbor neighbor really needed help, it wasn't about thief.

134
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.550
It wasn't about trying to get free stuff from the government. I mean,

135
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:27.530
look at all these kids now, what do they want?

136
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.150
Free this free healthcare free education, you know, all kinds of free stuff,

137
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.500
right? Free, you know, free housing, uh, free guaranteed jobs.

138
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.340
That's not what America was about. My, all of my grandparents, right?

139
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.990
All four of my grandparents came to this country, bro, barely spoke any English.

140
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.120
Right? Some of them were teenagers.

141
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.250
They came with nothing from poor countries and they came to America.

142
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.050
They had no welfare, no food stamps, no minimum wage. They didn't,

143
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.880
they didn't want anything from the government.

144
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.700
They came to America because they could be free of government.

145
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.350
They left the big governments that existed in Europe to have American freedom,

146
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.030
right. Because that's what it meant to be an American. And it was unique.

147
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.860
And we created the wealthiest society in the history of the world

148
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.280
because of the freedom that was uniquely American. Right.

149
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.870
So that's what we need to restore. That's our birthright right. Is, is, is,

150
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.990
is to be free, not to try to get the government,

151
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:31.000
to steal stuff from our neighbors because we think we're entitled to it. Okay.
