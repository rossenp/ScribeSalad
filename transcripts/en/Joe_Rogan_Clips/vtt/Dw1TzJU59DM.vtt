00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.820
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The reason why I ask if you ever seen, uh, images of,</v>

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.990
uh, indigenous people in the Amazon that walk around barefoot and their feet,

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.310
literally start to look like hands. They splay out in a very bizarre way.

4
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.560
<v 1>I haven't seen those particular pictures,</v>

5
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.100
but I do know that people that walk around on shod, you know, so in other words,

6
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:25.690
without shoes tend to develop these toes that are more divergent, not,

7
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:28.370
not opposable like a primate,

8
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:32.750
but for whatever reason about being on shot, it just gives you,

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.310
you know, you look at the toe and it's like, it's, it's like visibly separated.

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.930
Yes. Picture of it right now on the screen we're sharing. And it's.

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.820
<v 0>A very strange where it's,</v>

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.140
it's almost like they're gripping the ground with their toes and the toes are

13
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:50.280
very thick and strong because they're,

14
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.330
they're constantly walking around barefoot and they,

15
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:57.230
they use their toes and the toe muscles in a way that we don't use them anymore

16
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.960
because we were essentially were in casts with our.

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.990
<v 1>Shoes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, what's really interesting about me,</v>

18
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.350
me look at like modern adaptation adaptations of modern humans, you know,

19
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.110
and all these different pockets of the world, or, you know, particular,

20
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:13.670
when you look into all these ancient species, which are even weirder,

21
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.270
is that you realize there's, there's nothing about our form.

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.350
That's like an end destination. There's nothing about our form. That is like,

23
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.470
we know we have arrived at this was, you know, we're primates,

24
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.760
we're going the whole time. It's um, you know,

25
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.370
if you want to talk about who are the weird ones, it's,

26
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:33.650
it's not all these other things. It's like the modern humans are weird.

27
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:36.890
We've got these big heads, we've got this funny way of walking. We're bald,

28
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.420
you know, and we've married so much. Yeah. And we, we, we,

29
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.690
we very, and, and then, um, you know, there's,

30
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.630
there's all these kinds of myths about why, I mean, God,

31
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.850
there's so many myths in the field of, of human origins,

32
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.160
but one of them is you've probably heard about like, uh,

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.150
the divine proportions or like golden ratio that humans were constructed,

34
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:58.000
you know, according to the,

35
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.120
into these ratios and like the so-called golden ratio. I mean, it's just,

36
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.070
this is just storytelling, you know, I mean,

37
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.980
there's nothing about our proportions or proportions are just a function of

38
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.840
adaptation. They're a function of, of evolutionary biology. And, you know,

39
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.220
when certain chemicals are released and developmental process that governs how

40
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:20.390
long your limbs grow or your digits or whatever. Um,

41
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.030
but there's, you know,

42
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.110
we are just all variations of primate.

43
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.400
We're just, we're just one of them. And so, um, yeah, so,

44
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:35.630
so sometimes you see, uh,

45
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.350
literature or people positing that, you know,

46
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.120
somehow there was something like an N w we've reached some sort of end state,

47
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:47.180
or, and I'll tell you, and we're not reaching that state.

48
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.170
We're just a variation of, you know, creatures that have

49
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.520
an adapt, you know, it's just these common elements and adapt them, you know,

50
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:57.980
for different, for, you know,

51
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.670
for different and modern.

52
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 0>Humans though. We do very,</v>

53
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.690
size-wise much more than ancient apes that we find though, correct.

54
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.690
Like we don't find, like for instance, like we, you know,

55
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.930
mountain from the game of Thrones that enormous, giant human being,

56
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.123
that's a human being.

57
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.740
<v 1>I, I don't, I, I should confess I'm. I am, uh, um, uh,</v>

58
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.780
sort of illiterate when it comes to, uh, pop culture.

59
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.070
My kids would know, I need to turn to them. You know, I'm kind of like,

60
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.180
he's literally.

61
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.830
<v 0>One of the world's strongest man,</v>

62
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.450
and he's like seven feet plus tall 300 plus pounds enormous.

63
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.400
But my point was that like that he exists as a human being.

64
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:45.870
Also Chris rock is a human being and he's a very thin,

65
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:49.830
very small man, like, but there are both human beings.

66
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.900
We don't find that when you're looking at things like Neanderthal

67
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.440
or where you're looking at AI, you find much more uniformity, is that correct?

68
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.620
<v 1>No, not necessarily, actually, actually in some cases, there's,</v>

69
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.280
there's a lot of variation and I'll give you one good example.

70
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:07.200
So Lucy, you know,

71
00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:10.410
there's this famous fossil Lucy was,

72
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.360
the species is called Australopithecus,

73
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.510
afarensis named apparatus after the fr you know,

74
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:19.320
this part of the world that I was describing the fr depression. Um,

75
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.180
she was discovered in 1974, she's very petite, uh, probably a female. Uh,

76
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.720
and I forget how tall she is, but it's like three foot something and.

77
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.640
<v 0>Already, already as a female to correct.</v>

78
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.740
<v 1>Our art is a FEMA are Ortiz, taller RTS, uh, you know,</v>

79
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.890
I head taller than, than Lucy. But anyway, so with Lucy, you know,

80
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:43.860
w when her skeleton was found, you know, this was, um, uh, you know,

81
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.250
the only skeleton of that species, they had a lot of other pieces of things,

82
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:48.360
but no skeletons, but there,

83
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.310
there was this assumption that that species was small and, uh,

84
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.660
or at least the female, and now, uh,

85
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.800
thanks to some other work that's done in Ethiopia at a place called origins and

86
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.050
LA. Um, a few years ago,

87
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.820
a team announced discovery of another skeleton of Lucy species. It's a male,

88
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.360
it's a lot bigger than Lucy. They call it kinda numer,

89
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.390
which is a fr word for big guy. Uh,

90
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.340
but it's the same species as Lucy, but it's a big guy, you know,

91
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:21.450
substantially taller.

92
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:26.370
So it's sort of falsifies this idea that all Lucy's species was

93
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.390
petite. So interesting. And why is that? Is that because it's a,

94
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.900
there's a so-called sexual dimorphism of males are bigger than females,

95
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:38.250
or is it just a different population or is that just, you know,

96
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.450
just a difference in, in, uh, you know,

97
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:44.850
the normal range within a population, you know, like, you know,

98
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.020
short people and tall people, you know, in our, you know, in any population, I,

99
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:52.140
I don't know what the answer is to the tour,

100
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.130
and they're both attributed to the same species. So anyway,

101
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.400
just to give you example of a,

102
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.680
a paleo species where there is actually a substantial variation, how much.

103
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.370
<v 0>Do you know this? Is it between Lucy and this other one?</v>

104
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.670
<v 1>Um, I it's, I don't know, actually,</v>

105
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.680
I wish I had looked this up before we talked,

106
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.990
because I I'd love to give you a number, but it, it,

107
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.760
the big guy is substantially taller and bigger than Lucy, but,

108
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.800
but the skeletons, uh, they, they have,

109
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.830
you know,

110
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.530
the anatomy is similar enough so that they are attributed to the same species.

111
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.500
And there are similar age, like kind of pneumo.

112
00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:37.360
I think it was like 3.6 million years old. And Lucy's, I think 3.2.

113
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.480
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

114
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.600
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

115
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:49.030
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

116
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.750
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

117
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.740
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

118
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.570
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
