1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. What year is your nine 11? It's an 87.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.560
<v 1>That's a good year. That's we're built. We're doing a safari build.</v>

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.000
<v 0>What does that mean? Oh,</v>

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.320
so you're making it like one of those off-road rally cars.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 1>A rally rally car. Yeah, it's called, uh, the keen project.</v>

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.880
My friend Lee keen is a reporsche racing driver and he built one for himself

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.030
and it is the most glorious thing I've ever driven. Oh,

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.230
and it's everything that you love about a nine 11 applies to this,

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.510
um, on loose surface. There it is. That's your car. That's not my car.

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.910
My car is going to look like that.

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
Although it will be a different color and have a roof rack and it'll be,

12
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:41.300
it'll be slightly, slightly different. That thing's crazy.

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.620
That actually is a Richard Tutle build from England.

14
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.900
He's if you look up' car keen, keen sari, K E E N.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.300
And you'll see it closer to mine.

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.460
<v 0>Tutle's the guy that made, uh, that crazy green card.</v>

17
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.980
<v 1>Oh, that's my, this is my video of driving Lee's car. Um,</v>

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.930
and, uh, it is, see, look, I was fatter there.

19
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.850
Um, so it's just, wow. Drifty woods overte and,

20
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.010
and, you know, the, that,

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.410
that rear engine kind of snap back thing that everyone's all afraid of in nine

22
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.370
11, the pendulum thing. Yeah. Well,

23
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:23.320
you get that when you slide and then it catches and comes on a loose

24
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:27.120
surface. There's no catch. Oh, so you slide it,

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.480
but you don't have the scary snapback,

26
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.000
it just drifts and comes back and drift, you know, there's Lee,

27
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:34.920
he's building the thing. So.

28
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.600
<v 0>It's probably really good to have a rear engine bias. It is look at the.</v>

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.480
<v 1>Real, it is the most controllable delight for,</v>

30
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.310
and you've got four inches of extra suspension travel. So LA wow. Speed bumps,

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.390
ruts. Think about this in Los Angeles, right? So you gonna drive.

32
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.070
<v 0>This rally car around LA? Yeah, yeah, yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

33
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.030
<v 1>It's not a race car. It's a street car. Wow. It's a street car. Yeah. And then,</v>

34
00:01:59.031 --> 00:01:59.790
you know, that.

35
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.670
<v 0>Looks like so much fun driving that in a dirt. Oh my God. We.</v>

36
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.740
<v 1>Have so desert here. No one cares. That's you go some Mirage there's trails.</v>

37
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.460
Like there's no speed limits. Nobody gives a. I.

38
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.941
<v 0>Gotta be honest.</v>

39
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:14.060
There's two videos that made me get really interested in older Porsches.

40
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.220
One of 'em was the Chris Harris build with the thetu and another one was you

41
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.780
driving that project? Nasty car. Mm.

42
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.820
<v 1>Joey Sealey. He's the local as well.</v>

43
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.730
<v 0>Yeah, that car, I was like, oh, that's it? Yep. That's it just like,</v>

44
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.730
get it down to the raw dog.

45
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.610
<v 1>Yeah. He took everything outta that car.</v>

46
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.490
And richardtuddle who did Chris's car in England is like the rally, you know,

47
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.330
master. Um, he's like a there's there's a project nasty. Yeah. Um,

48
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.010
and there's Joey who built it and he.

49
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.690
<v 0>Also, I love the little things he did,</v>

50
00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:48.080
like make the exhaust come through the rear bumper and those funky wheels on it.

51
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:49.960
And the fact there's no carpeting at all.

52
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.600
Like everything inside was stripped away.

53
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.920
<v 1>His Instagram is emotion engineering and that car has been through a few changes</v>

54
00:02:57.921 --> 00:02:59.720
since this video was made. It looks a little different.

55
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.800
<v 0>Now. Yeah. He changed the wheels, right. Different.</v>

56
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.880
<v 1>Wheels, uh, different, like there's a bunch of different stuff,</v>

57
00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:09.200
but it's amazing. And that guy, um, he used to be a part of this business,

58
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.680
BBI auto sport. He left to go start his own business emotion engineering.

59
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:15.120
And he is a master of chassy.

60
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.320
<v 0>Setup. Yeah. I believe it. Yeah. That's a very, very impress.</v>

61
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.030
It's a very interesting video.

62
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.710
And that's not like the highest horsepower vehicle, right? No.

63
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.670
<v 1>It was really light though. It was, I think it was.</v>

64
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.590
<v 0>How many horsepower did it have if I.</v>

65
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.270
<v 1>Remember maybe 3 75, 3 80. I mean, it was, it was fast.</v>

66
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.790
It was not a slouch at all, but, you know,

67
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.150
have you seen what singer is doing now with this air cooled engine? Yeah.

68
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.310
<v 0>Yeah. It's crazy. Well,</v>

69
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:42.460
you sent me that whole thing of the price difference between, uh, a,

70
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.900
a nine 11 engine air cooled engine. That's got 200 horsepower versus one.

71
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.820
That's got 500 horsepower. Yeah. And you're like, wow.

72
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.660
<v 1>Yeah. The exponential curve of Porsche horsepower costs is.</v>

73
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.340
<v 0>Really scary stuff. The highest extend was $250,000. Yeah. So it.</v>

74
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.450
<v 1>Was like, okay, if you to, to buy an engine, right. Just an engine on a stand.</v>

75
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.530
You want that engine. This is Porsche air cooled. So a Porsche engine for a,

76
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.090
a Porsche that is earlier than 95, 19 95, um,

77
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.930
300 horsepower is gonna run you about 40 grand.

78
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.290
And that's a ton of money for not a lot of horsepower.

79
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.840
400 horsepower will run you about a hundred grand.

80
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.880
I mean a hundred thousand. Wow. That's an engine on a stand, nothing else.

81
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:31.840
Right? You want 500 horsepower outta that motor it's $250,000 just.

82
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.760
<v 0>For the engine, just for the engine. Why is that?</v>

83
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.960
Cause that sounds so crazy in comparison to other cars, because.

84
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.110
<v 1>A lot of techniques that you would use to make horsepower in a other cars,</v>

85
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.510
you cannot apply to a Porsche engine. Oh,

86
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.470
you're limited on displacement size.

87
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.670
So it's not like you could shove like a nine liter V8 in there.

88
00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:54.550
Like a 4.2 is about as big displacement

89
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.830
as you can get in that case.

90
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.030
And that's with like a stroker crank and board out.

91
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.700
So you're increasing both the length, the pistons move and the,

92
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.300
the size of the hole, um, to get to the 500 horsepower mark,

93
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.380
you have to run some highly experimental cylinder heads &lt;laugh&gt; and

94
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.460
singer to do that. I don't know if Chris has been on the show recently,

95
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.500
but he's working with singer to develop. Um, there's a company called Williams.

96
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.770
That is a formula one team.

97
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.290
They are developing the cylinder heads for singer.

98
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.490
<v 0>So Chris Harris is a part of this role. He's doing.</v>

99
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.330
<v 1>Development, driving for them. Oh, that's great. Which is a.</v>

100
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.410
<v 0>Good decision, right? Oh, that's amazing decision. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.210
Plus the videos will be.

102
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.970
<v 1>Epic. Right? So most of, uh, they're doing a four valve air. Cool.</v>

103
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.840
Old head, which as far as I know, has never been done before all your,

104
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.480
your engine, my engine, all the art are two valve engines and,

105
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.440
and they're doing a four valve engine. So, um, it's.

106
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.240
<v 0>Gonna cost a million and a half dollars. Well, the engine is 250.</v>

107
00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.640
<v 1>Grand. This is why. Yes.</v>

108
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.560
<v 0>Yeah. It's so crazy.</v>

109
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.600
<v 1>Yeah. Custom cars are a million dollars now. Isn't that nuts. I mean,</v>

110
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.520
you really want, if you really want something next level, it,

111
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.960
it can easily be a million nuts.

112
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.120
<v 0>Jamie pull up that new singer. Nine 11.</v>

113
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.990
<v 1>Yeah. Singer nine 11, the William Williams engine. It's.</v>

114
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.430
<v 0>Green. Yeah. But it's got a lot of that. Um, what is,</v>

115
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.830
who's the Japanese gentleman who takes those Porsche and R WB. Yeah. Yeah.

116
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.710
It's got a lot of that to it. Well.

117
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.950
<v 1>Our so R WB is really interesting. Cause in Japan,</v>

118
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.430
there's the singer on don't you think.

119
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.310
<v 0>That's a God gorgeous car. Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:36.750
But don't you think it's an odd choice to artificially, um, different stop,

121
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:40.460
please keep it. Oh, what kinda sexy that is to artificially differentiate.

122
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.460
Like the way he's got the fender flares. He's just, he's making like,

123
00:06:44.461 --> 00:06:47.780
he had to glue 'em on. Oh, but the whole car's carbon fiber. Yeah.

124
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.900
So if the whole car's carbon fiber, why did, why did they fake?

125
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.420
Like they had like extensions of the way. I don't.

126
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.253
<v 1>Wanna disappoint you,</v>

127
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.770
but that is a rendering and not a picture of an actual car. Wow.

128
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.530
As far as I know, the actual car does not exist. That's so good.

129
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.970
And I think if I had to guess they put those over fender lines on

130
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:11.570
the rendering. So you would specifically notice that they have widened it. Oh,

131
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:12.410
that's. That could be,

132
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.410
if I had to guess the final car may not actually have a sea.

133
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.200
<v 0>There. You know what, man? I'm I'm not mad if it does. It looks amazing. Jamie,</v>

134
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.080
can you make that bigger again? But that looks so real.

135
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.080
That's crazy that that's not a photograph. Does that look like a.

136
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.920
<v 1>Render to you? Jamie? I'm almost certain. That's not a real car right here.</v>

137
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:32.120
Looks a little. I'm almost certain. It's not a real car.

138
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.880
<v 0>The tire tire looks a little tire. Looks.</v>

139
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.120
<v 1>Fake, could be wrong. There could, there could be someone screaming at their,</v>

140
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.310
whatever right now saying I'm wrong, but.

141
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.270
<v 0>I'm'm pretty sure reflections in the windows. They're good at this. You.</v>

142
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.990
<v 1>Play crazy in the last three years. They're good at this dude.</v>

143
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.110
&lt;laugh&gt; well play a.

144
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.950
<v 0>Video game. I absolutely believe it. I'm not arguing against it.</v>

145
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.590
I'm just saying it's so good. Yeah. But anyway, if they make a car like that,

146
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:55.750
holy. That's a gorgeous.

147
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.790
<v 1>Car. Oh yeah. And they will, and it'll look like that, but it may not have,</v>

148
00:07:58.791 --> 00:07:59.624
those seems.

149
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.420
<v 0>It's pretty similar to what their car looks like. It it', but wider.</v>

150
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:05.500
It's not much different. Other than the, the wider I saw one of those,

151
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.020
it might have been the best looking car I've ever seen in my life.

152
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.980
It was a silver,

153
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.660
like a metallic silver mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like a bright silver singer. Yeah.

154
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.860
And, uh, it was online. Understated saw glorious. God.

155
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.730
See if you find that bright SI uh, silver singer, have.

156
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:26.130
<v 1>You seen one in person before or close? Never dude. Your mind would be blown.</v>

157
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.610
They have at a minimum,

158
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.730
minimum 45 or $50,000 of leather in one of those cars and the

159
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:34.150
interior,

160
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.730
the leather work in the interior of those cars is unbelievable beyond anything

161
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.960
from any manufacturer today. Really? Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.080
<v 0>&lt;Affirmative&gt; uh, yeah, that's it. That's.</v>

163
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.680
<v 1>A sexy right there. God.</v>

164
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.720
<v 0>That's a good looking car.</v>

165
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.600
<v 1>Yep. That's very, very nice. What is it.</v>

166
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.480
<v 0>About certain shapes? Right's shapes? What.</v>

167
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.640
<v 1>Singer does is they distill, you know,</v>

168
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.760
the best of each generation of car into one car. Yeah.

169
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.640
And so you're looking at a highly idealized, nine 11,

170
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.760
but you can't exactly picture what came from where and why. Yeah.

171
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.600
<v 0>It's gangter and those folkss those wheels for whatever reason,</v>

172
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.400
they just work mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

173
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:16.990
especially that green are mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; those go back to that green card.

174
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.430
<v 1>Jamie, they made 'em all they made. 'em real big on the green car. Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:22.750
But the design works so well. There's the Williams engine. God.

176
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.590
<v 0>Yeah. That looks good. Yeah. But like that's perfect. So.</v>

177
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.830
<v 1>Scroll down, Jamie, the, the Williams look at this. So, so you see,</v>

178
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.870
look at the air intakes. That's where your rear windows would be.

179
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.860
So there no rear windows,

180
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.660
there are only those air intakes that go directly into the engine.

181
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.380
<v 0>Cool. That furnace off.</v>

182
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.780
<v 1>That's no, not cooling. That's the actual air intake that get the,</v>

183
00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:46.820
into the combustion chamber. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

184
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.420
The cooling it's air cooled.

185
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.900
So you see that silver kind of nipple on the right side.

186
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.660
There Uh-huh that's the center of the fan.

187
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.850
It gets cool in from the back there now.

188
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.090
<v 0>Like this is basically the same size as a regular inline six or flat.</v>

189
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.210
<v 1>Straight flat six. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

190
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:04.930
Roughly the engine itself is roughly the same size. Yeah.

191
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.850
<v 0>So what they've done is just engineer it to the max. Oh.</v>

192
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.651
<v 1>Yeah. Well they have the,</v>

193
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:14.610
they have what our theory are the most advanced cylinder heads ever put onto an

194
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:15.530
air. Cool. Nine 11. That.

195
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:16.400
<v 0>Looks credible.</v>

196
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.280
&lt;laugh&gt; and they're gonna stick that in a car that was originally what? 93?

197
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.080
Something like.

198
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.120
<v 1>That. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. 91 to 94. God.</v>

199
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.800
<v 0>Isn't it funny though,</v>

200
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:31.600
that there's something unbelievably appealing about those air cooled

201
00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:36.440
cars that is willing to have these rich people pay a million dollars or

202
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.870
least the current singer's a half million dollars for this car.

203
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.910
Just because you feel it more. Yeah. When you drive it,

204
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:43.310
it's just gotta feel to it that.

205
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.750
<v 1>There's a certain kind of mechanical brilliance to it. That's really,</v>

206
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.150
really you can't it's incomparable. Really? It's very unique. Yeah.

207
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.510
<v 0>Well there's something about those old cars,</v>

208
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:58.020
particularly the ones that don't have power steering. Huh? You just, you,

209
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.980
you get a thrill out of 'em.

210
00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:02.380
There's a weird thrill even when you're not even driving fast.

211
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.460
<v 1>Well, especially with a Porsche, when you,</v>

212
00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:08.580
when you have no power steering combined with front engine car, it sucks.

213
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.260
No power steering. When the engines in the back is okay.

214
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.580
Cuz the front of the car is pretty, is pretty light.

215
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.450
So you don't need too much muscle, but the nine 11 steering is just super,

216
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.373
super direct.

217
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.090
<v 0>Yeah. It's super direct. And it's just, I don't know, man. It just,</v>

218
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.170
it just feels like a different thing you're doing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

219
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:29.130
you know, I, I had a buddy that had a, uh, Volkswagen bug growing up.

220
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.650
Didn't have a lot of power in it, but those Volkswagen bugs, those things.

221
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.250
Like when you drive them around,

222
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:39.840
they give you a little smile on your face because you're driving like this

223
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.240
little tiny thing that feels completely connected with the road. Yeah.

224
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:47.160
It's not very capable, but it's like,

225
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:49.440
you're smiling when you drive one of those, it's like you.

226
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.760
<v 1>Seen a little ride. The ultimate Volkswagen is they're taking in Germany.</v>

227
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.600
They take the, uh, the buses, the micro buses and they, and they chop 'em down.

228
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.520
So they're, you know,

229
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:02.440
compressed and they put full Porsche floor pan drive, train &lt;laugh&gt;.

230
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.200
And so remember that 9 96 turbo you had the allwheel drive.

231
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.040
So they'll put that whole floor pan on a micro bus and they'll go to like

232
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.510
track days and beat on race cars. &lt;laugh&gt; it's crazy.
