00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.080
<v 1>Experience. Um,</v>

3
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.720
this has been one of the most frustrating things that I've seen and experienced

4
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:11.640
throughout my over six years in Congress. That really started, um,

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.960
when I first went up after I got elected, uh,

6
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:18.360
where after every election happens and new members of Congress, they go and, uh,

7
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.280
they have, what's called new member orientation.

8
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.870
They give you these books and here's the maps, and here's where your office is.

9
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750
And you know, all the, all the administrative and logistical stuff,

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.430
but very quickly, I would say within the first few days, um, you know,

11
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:36.110
where we first come in together as Democrats and Republicans immediately, okay,

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.390
Democrats go this way, Republicans go this way immediately separated.

13
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.860
And what we're told right off the bat is, look, this is about,

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.340
uh, getting wins for our political party.

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.380
And if you work with a Republican, then that's gonna hurt the party.

16
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.540
Especially if you work with a Republican that the democratic party's trying to

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.700
take out, forget the substance of the idea, forget the substance of the bill.

18
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.450
A and this happens on the opposite side as well. Republicans with Democrats,

19
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:06.810
both, both political parties are diff are, are, um,

20
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.450
guilty of this where they're really putting the interest of the political party

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.010
ahead of the people who just voted for us to go and serve

22
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.810
them. And not just the Democrats who voted for me, but yes, the,

23
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.400
the independents and the Republicans, both who voted for me or who did didn't,

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.720
but who, uh, I serve as part of my constituency. And,

25
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.360
uh, you just, you, you continue. I've continued to see this where, you know,

26
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:34.880
you'll have a bill that because it's a Democrat, bill,

27
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.360
Republicans will vote against it.

28
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:40.720
Substance aside or Republican bill Democrats will vote against it just because

29
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:44.350
it's a Republican bill, but then Hey, if, if they come in and you know,

30
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.630
a month or a year later, introduce the same bill or a similar bill,

31
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.110
but now because it's a democratic bill, okay, everybody, Hey, let's go,

32
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.350
let's go and support this legislation. You can, you can imagine

33
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.030
why there is so much gridlock in Washington, why nothing really gets done.

34
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.260
And ultimately how this divisiveness and this hyper partisanship is

35
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.340
hurting the ability for the needs of the American people to be served.

36
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.140
<v 0>When you talk about people like yourself that are completely funded by the</v>

37
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:16.974
public mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

38
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.500
and you have this very logical and objective way of

39
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.820
discussing this gridlock,

40
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.490
do you think that the future is in young people like yourself getting

41
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.610
involved in politics, that they, they're not connected to this old world for 35,

42
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.690
45 years, this world, it sounds like this is just what you do. Yeah. I mean,

43
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.770
I watched house of cards. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I get kind of,

44
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.170
I get it sort of what that, that seems like chaos.

45
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.120
And it seems like there's no way to fix that.

46
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.440
It's almost like these people have to stop being politicians. Yeah.

47
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.400
They have to be voted out or die off.

48
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.841
<v 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:56.600
I think it it's evident where we see those who are very entrenched in this, um,

50
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.120
this broken system feel very threatened by the rise

51
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.960
of people, powered campaigns, individual contributions,

52
00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:10.840
coming in and supplanting the big money that they get from, um,

53
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.760
you know, the packs and packs and lobbyists and, and,

54
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.840
and there's fear there because they see, um,

55
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.790
their whole world being disrupted by people like me or others who

56
00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:25.590
are coming in and saying, no, we're not buying into any of that.

57
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.790
And we're coming in to actually fulfill the mission that we've been charged with

58
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.550
by those who voted for us to serve the people, all the people of this country.

59
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 0>And would you say that, would you, this is my position.</v>

60
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.860
I think that Trump plays a part of that because I think he was the first guy to

61
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:44.060
camp that come to come in,

62
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.460
basically self-funded or being funded through his own means.

63
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.780
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and not listening to the rest of the Republican party

64
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:52.614
saying, Hey,

65
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.060
I'm gonna take over mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I'm gonna do this my way.

66
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.060
And then knowing that he could do that.

67
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.250
And knowing that there were so many Republicans against him and knowing that

68
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.850
there's so many Democrats against him as well, but yet he's still the president.

69
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.770
Yep. And people are like, Jesus, this is a fragile system. This system is,

70
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.690
it's what they've done to acquire power is still very vulnerable.

71
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:15.530
Even though they have this deeply entrenched system of weird little

72
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:20.200
relationships that it's not good enough. Yeah. That if the people do rise up up,

73
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:23.000
and they decide, Hey, we wanna put Tulsa in his president,

74
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.160
you you're gonna have a different situation.

75
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.280
A lot of you clowns gonna be outta work. Absolutely.

76
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.520
<v 1>I mean, and that's really that, that's the message that we're carrying to,</v>

77
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.000
to living rooms and town halls and communities across the country is, uh,

78
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.320
Washington continues to underestimate the power of the people and it it's

79
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.230
supposed to work for you. And that's the thing is, you know,

80
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.870
our founding fathers had this vision for our country,

81
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.070
that our government would be of the people by the people and for the people.

82
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.351
And instead,

83
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:55.030
what we have is a government of the rich and powerful buy and for the rich and

84
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.950
powerful, or of the special interest in corporations by,

85
00:04:57.951 --> 00:05:01.620
and for the special interest in corporations. And, you know, know we,

86
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.260
the people get left behind.

87
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.140
<v 0>And they continue to talk to us like they're in control. Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.220
They're one of us and they're supposed to be public employees.

89
00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:13.140
They're supposed to be servants. That's right. Of the public. Yeah.

90
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.700
They don't talk like that. No.

91
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.900
They talk like people who are in a position of power and influence. Yeah.

92
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.740
And it's not healthy. It's not a healthy perspective.

93
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.600
<v 1>It, it,</v>

94
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.850
it's evidence of that huge disconnect between the bubble that is Washington and

95
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:30.210
the reality of the lives that we live every day, people all across this country.

96
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.690
<v 0>That's always the case though. When people get in control of things,</v>

97
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.610
they always metal make it easier for them, make it better for them.

98
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.890
What can I do to make this a little easier? Is there another way,

99
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.360
how can I help right myself here?

100
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.640
How can I make sure that when I get outta office,

101
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.080
I can do these public speaking tours and make a quarter million dollars a pop.

102
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.280
Yeah. When I hear about the money,

103
00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:53.560
those guys make to just go and talk like what, who is paying for that?

104
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.360
Who is paying to listen to hill? Are you killing?

105
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:57.840
What are they getting out of it? What are you getting out of that? That's right.

106
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.480
Can I listen? I would love to like pre pretend to be a banker,

107
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.720
to put a lizard skin face mask on and go sit with those bankers and listen to

108
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.040
one of those conversations that Hillary Clinton got paid a quarter million

109
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:09.320
dollars to talk. Yeah.

110
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.200
<v 1>Never released the transcripts for what is.</v>

111
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.840
<v 0>That about? Who is it's it was some weird,</v>

112
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.630
sneaky deal that they yeah. Where nobody wants to pay that, like,

113
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.870
go do that in Madison credit card. See how many tickets you sell. Yeah. Right.

114
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:25.910
Exactly. Bill and Hillary are doing like the speaking tour thing right now.

115
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.790
Yeah. I am baffled as to who is gonna pay to go see bill and Hillary

116
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.270
them. That's right.

117
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.190
<v 1>They're doing it together now, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.780
<v 0>Bill is so old. Why doesn't he just come clean? Yeah. You know, I, I,</v>

119
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.020
I would love to get that guy and just get him drunk and put him on the,

120
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:44.220
and just like, have him just talk about life,

121
00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:46.060
knowing you only got like a few years left.

122
00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:49.500
Everything's falling apart in your body. Yeah. What are your regrets? Yeah.

123
00:06:49.501 --> 00:06:51.540
What'd you do wrong? What could you have done differently?

124
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.660
Stop all this bullshitting. Yeah. Like what, what, you know,

125
00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:56.980
should have him on your show. I would love to,

126
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.330
I would love to do mushrooms with 'em. That's what I wanted to,

127
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.530
I would have 'em on the show and, uh, do it in, uh, Colorado.

128
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.010
Cause they decriminalized mushrooms. &lt;laugh&gt; it's just, yeah.

129
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.570
This role of being the person that is in control of this country has

130
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:14.410
always been this impossible task.

131
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.200
And when I see a person like you, who wants to do it? Yeah. I, I, I say, listen,

132
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.000
you have some of the best ideas and the most healthy perspective that I've ever

133
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:25.280
heard from anyone that's ever running for president.

134
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.400
But why would you want to do that to yourself?

135
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.920
Those are the two things that I think of.

136
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.000
<v 1>Because it's not for myself and,</v>

137
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.560
and it's not to be in control of the country and the people it's to serve the

138
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.880
people and our country.

139
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.310
It's a continuation of this mission that I've chosen for my life to be of

140
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:44.990
service, to find different ways to do that. You know,

141
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:48.990
it started in Hawaii with gathering my friends as a kid and going and picking up

142
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:53.230
trash off the beach on the weekends and experiencing even then at a young age

143
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.270
that, that made me happier than,

144
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.750
than anything else than, you know,

145
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.820
go going and playing video games with my friends or anything like that.

146
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.580
And that, um, that mission, that,

147
00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:09.740
that was deeply ingrained in me further with my service in the military,

148
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.140
serving as a soldier where, you know,

149
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.380
I'm serving alongside people of all walks of life, as you know, every race,

150
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.380
religion, ethnicity, orientation, everything, every one of us wearing that same,

151
00:08:19.381 --> 00:08:24.130
you uniform serving that same flag that represents the American people

152
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.370
with that. Laser-like focus on putting service above self.

153
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.170
And that's what I seek to bring to the white house, to,

154
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.330
to restore those values of integrity and honor, uh,

155
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:37.490
and respect to make it so that,

156
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:40.010
that white house is a beacon of light for the American people to,

157
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.640
to know that that white house belongs to them and represents them and their

158
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.040
interests and their interests alone.

159
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.400
<v 0>Does anybody, I mean, even a person like you who's on the outside,</v>

160
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.520
do you think anybody truly knows what it's like to run the country until they

161
00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:57.480
get in there? Do they, can you even have an idea of what,

162
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.160
how impossible a task it is to be in control of the economy, the environment,

163
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.360
the, the infrastructure, the military, our, our position in the world.

164
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.880
It seems like the most insane duty yeah.

165
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.950
To require someone to run all the, those things,

166
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.350
to be aware of all those things,

167
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:20.110
to be responsible for all of the successes and all of the failures. Yeah.

168
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.390
<v 1>Um, it's an awesome responsibility. There's no question about that. Uh,</v>

169
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.350
and I think it fulfills that, um, that higher, that higher,

170
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.420
that higher calling that this is not about any kind of selfish interest.

171
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:39.060
This for me is not about any kind of ambition that I've had.

172
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:40.940
I've never had any kind of thought, well,

173
00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:43.980
I wanna be president one day or even I wanna be a member of Congress one day.

174
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.940
It's always been about, uh, how can I,

175
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.820
how can I best be of service and how can I make a greater impact?

176
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.380
And that's what I've seen throughout my time in Congress,

177
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.220
where I've served on these committees, I've served on the foreign affairs,

178
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:57.370
in our and services committees I've been,

179
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.170
been calling for and fighting for an end to these wasteful regime, change wars,

180
00:10:02.171 --> 00:10:04.610
an end to this new cold war and nuclear arms race.

181
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.210
There's only so much I can do as a member of Congress, uh,

182
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.850
to be able to serve as president and commander in chief.

183
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.570
I know that I can make that kind of impact and see change in our policy that

184
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:16.920
keeps a, our country safe.

185
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:19.920
That moves us closer to that future of peace and prosperity.

186
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.040
And that's where I hope to be able to make a difference.
