WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>Like the Scarlet letter, like how, how old is the Scarlet letter?</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.520
And we're still doing that now. McCarthyism. Yeah, right? Yeah.

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.400
This is something that we we're we're prone to it. Do you.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.680
<v 1>Think it's because people are scared that they're gonna get called out on it</v>

5
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:14.080
themselves. So when they see someone who's doing something wrong,

6
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.760
like go after 'em attack 'em with everything,

7
00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:18.240
they have's almost to divert any sort of,

8
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.710
because people are scared that people are gonna turn am.

9
00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:23.550
Especially in this day and age, when the people turn on people for like,

10
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:25.950
you know, the Garrison Keeler story. Mm-m &lt;negative&gt;,

11
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.590
he's the saddest story in this, me too stuff.

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.910
Because Garrison Keeler is a guy who had the lake will be gone Chronicles as

13
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:34.110
this PBS show.

14
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.950
Its radio shows ongoing for decades and he's a writer and he

15
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.380
hugged a woman. She, he was, he was consoling her. He hugged her.

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.580
And apparently, while he was hugging her,

17
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.500
his arm went down her back on her back and he apologized,

18
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.940
she pulled away. He apologized, he sent her a letter. He apologized, you know,

19
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.180
he said, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. She says don't wor no worries.

20
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:02.010
Don't worry about it. Years later, when all this me too frenzy, she, this up,

21
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.810
he gets fired. They pull his name off the shop for touching a girl's back.

22
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.890
It's CR it's. Like the frenzy was so hot.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.010
They didn't wanna be accused of not doing anything. So they pulled this guy.

24
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.730
I know. And you know, there's the worst side of it, right?

25
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.690
There's the Harvey Weinsteins of the world. There's the, there's the,

26
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.810
there's the people that are absolutely monsters. Right. There's those.

27
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.240
But then there's people that just got caught up in the wave of outrage.

28
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.080
And it's just, it's a strange, a strange time. Like the there's no balance.

29
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.960
<v 0>To it. Well, the pendulum's gonna swing swing until, you know,</v>

30
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.880
our attitudes balance out. I mean, this, the fact, the me,

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.800
the me too movement is not a bad thing.

32
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.190
Cuz it's bring up some serious issues that we've had in. Our's a good,

33
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.070
a good thing. It's a great thing to happen. Yeah. So, but in the meantime,

34
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:51.430
there's gonna be collateral damage for that until we now get back to a time

35
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:56.390
where we can, like men will act like gentlemen and we'll be able to have

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.710
interpersonal relationships with women at work and in a setting and make it

37
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.020
professional. But at the same time, we also don't want to sterile environment.

38
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.540
Right. You know, when you go, when you go to these like seminars, cause like,

39
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.500
even for our show now, because of all this, you have to have like a,

40
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.500
a sexual harassment meeting before you start. Well.

41
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.820
<v 1>They had those in the nineties. Exactly.</v>

42
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.220
I went to those for hardball show that I was on in 94.

43
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.540
<v 0>But one of the things they always say, cuz you can't define this. Right.</v>

44
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.540
You know it, when you see it.

45
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.500
<v 1>Well, that's what they used to say about pornga.</v>

46
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.090
<v 0>But that's what we've lost that ability to understand that.</v>

47
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.610
Like I think that that applies to.

48
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.650
<v 1>Legally. That's not a good definition. It's a problem know.</v>

49
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.010
<v 0>But, but it, it, but that is the definition, right?</v>

50
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.570
It's the same thing that goes with oversenitivity mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think

51
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:38.850
that too, right. We should know it when we see it and we, we're not,

52
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.690
we're not recognizing that. It's like, you know, you're acting,

53
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.090
this is a bit much right now sometimes. Did you hear.

54
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.360
<v 1>About the two college kids that got drunk and had sex and the boy, uh,</v>

55
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.120
upon waking up and sobering up,

56
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.880
decided to preemptively accuse the girl of sexual assault

57
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.880
because he was intoxicated. So he filed and went after her,

58
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.600
she got suspended from school. They had to do it because otherwise, you know,

59
00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:06.240
they would be sexist cuz they do it all the time. If it's a boy and a girl,

60
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.040
it's always thought that if a boy like, do you know the ocental college story?

61
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.560
Mm-mm &lt;negative&gt; so pretty famous story from a few years back where these two

62
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:18.360
kids, they were in college, uh, the guy called texts, the girl, you know,

63
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.830
I'm coming over. She's like, do you have condoms? He says, yes. You know like,

64
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:25.870
so clearly intent has been established, right? Goes over, has sex with her.

65
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.990
Her friends convince her because she was intoxicated that it was sex, uh,

66
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:31.470
under the influence. So it was rape.

67
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.910
And so she goes to the university officials and they, they suspend the boy.

68
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.270
He sues and wins.

69
00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:42.100
And the whole thing is the whole thing's chaos because this kid gets kicked

70
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.380
outta school. And actually did he win?

71
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.620
I need to know that if he won let's check. I fact check. Yeah.

72
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:49.700
Let's fact check that ental but.

73
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.340
<v 0>Now you gotta have a now to even interact with him when you have to have a</v>

74
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.540
notary. Well, that's what they're.

75
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.373
<v 1>Saying. People.</v>

76
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.340
<v 0>Video, I consent to, you know.</v>

77
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.130
<v 1>So here's where it gets even screwier there was a real article the other day</v>

78
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.990
that was saying,

79
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.330
is it physically possible for two people to simultaneously sexual assault each

80
00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:06.530
other? And they're,

81
00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:11.010
they're debating this in a college cuz they're trying to figure out if two

82
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:15.490
people are both drunk and like they get together and they're both sloppy and

83
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.970
hammered and they decide to have sex. Do they both sexually assault each other?

84
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.120
<v 0>Isn't this it's really about choices that we make.</v>

85
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.600
<v 1>Well, it's also about taking responsibility for your actions.</v>

86
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.533
If you're an adult,

87
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.320
if you decide to get in your car and you're drunk and you plow into a bus and

88
00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:33.440
kill a bunch of people, no one says, oh, Eric was just drunk.

89
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.760
He is not responsible for his actions. You're responsible for your actions.

90
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.840
If you're drunk, if you're driving a car and he kills somebody,

91
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.670
but the idea is a girl comes over your house and you're drunk. And you know,

92
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.550
you're not responsible for your actions then,

93
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:48.390
especially if you're a girl and you're drunk,

94
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.110
you're not responsible for your actions. Then if you're having sex with a guy,

95
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.790
but you're definitely responsible for your actions.

96
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.950
If you're a girl and you get in a car and drive and hit someone and kill.

97
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.390
<v 0>But at the same, but at the same time though, like a girl,</v>

98
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.860
a girl or anyone should be allowed to be with her friends

99
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.380
or with his friends and you get sloppy drunk, uh, and.

100
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.260
<v 1>You're protected. You.</v>

101
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.620
<v 0>Should take care of you should be, you should be.</v>

102
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.220
It's not okay that somebody decided to like go further with it. Well, you.

103
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.780
<v 1>Know, well the most egregious case is obviously Cosby, cuz that was his,</v>

104
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.621
his thing. I mean,

105
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:23.050
if he did do what everybody's accusing him of doing and we have no reason to

106
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:23.884
think he didn't,

107
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.250
he was taking people that thought of him as a mentor and thought that he was

108
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:31.130
gonna help their career. Right. And that's, that was his hustle.

109
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.530
And he would just drug him and they'd wake up with their,

110
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.970
sore and their pants off and not knowing what happened and be super confused.

111
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.250
It's horrible. I mean, that's, that's the worst version.

112
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.920
<v 0>That's the worst version of it. And then, but then it's like, you know,</v>

113
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.760
this is one of those things where I'm saying it's like this, that,

114
00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:49.760
that it's hard to define. There's no like real definition.

115
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.880
You can't put it down in writing to say like, this is what this is.

116
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.680
Because then you got a situation where you're out on a date with someone,

117
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.840
things are going well, you think it's going well, you get into bed.

118
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.720
And then that person in what, for whatever reason decides, uh,

119
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.640
I think we should stop. I don't wanna do this anymore. And that, that,

120
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:13.160
that could be, that could be on the same level as druging.

121
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.440
<v 1>Somebody, a Z and sorry case or clubbing him on the head. That girl writes a,</v>

122
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.030
that crazy story. The 5,000 word story.

123
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.230
<v 0>That disease is a bizarre thing is just about him not being a gentleman. Right.</v>

124
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.670
That's.

125
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.070
<v 1>All that was not just dad,</v>

126
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.230
but she was just grossed out by it and decided to go after him.

127
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.630
<v 0>But you know, I know I can understand being in a situation like, like, you know,</v>

128
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:34.510
people got on the woman cuz they were like, you know what, Hey,

129
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:36.630
you still blew him three times. Right? Yeah.

130
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.580
But understand that being in a situation where you're like you're because this

131
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.780
happened to me. All right. I, I, I was at a comedy club, you know,

132
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.980
I told this girl, this was years ago. I told this guy, I said, she was like,

133
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.420
I'm coming back to your hotel. Like, you know, no, I don't think you should.

134
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.140
I didn't want to. I wasn't like I wasn't. She forced herself on you. It wasn't.

135
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.140
I mean, you just explained. Imagine if you were a girl.

136
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.210
<v 1>I that's, that's where.</v>

137
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.610
<v 0>It gets really scary. Oh. But first of all, everything she's saying to me,</v>

138
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.250
right this whole night up, up to getting to my hotel.

139
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.090
If I would've done that to a woman is right. Assault abuse,

140
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.290
like threatening from the jump you heard Ali won. Talk about this. I mean, no,

141
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.410
but this is what happened. So I get I say to her, uh, I was like,

142
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.970
I don't think I said, I wasn't really intoing I at the time I wasn't, I,

143
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.840
I don't know if this is a good idea, you know, I think you should go home,

144
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.920
you know? And then she's like, no, I'll walk you to your hotel.

145
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.760
Cause we were hanging out all this sta everybody's hanging out this place after

146
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.840
the Sunday night show, you know, I said, okay, we get to the hotel. I go, well,

147
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.400
thanks for walking me. But I think you should prob no, you know,

148
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.480
I' wanna clean your Dick with I know. Yeah, yeah. You know, I was like, that's,

149
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.350
you know, it's like, uh, I, I would give you a massage.

150
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.510
It was all this kind of stuff. Whoa. I'm like, I think you should go.

151
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.350
I'm not really. And then, then my ego kicks in. Cause I'm like, well, you know,

152
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.750
all right, you, you like me like this. Okay. So we get up,

153
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.670
we finally get upstairs. I still am like, maybe we, I,

154
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:54.550
maybe we shouldn't do this. You know? And then she starts to like,

155
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.550
oh, you're oh,

156
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.180
because you're not into it's because I'm I'm hideous or whatever.

157
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.660
So now I felt like, oh, I'd have to her. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

158
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.580
I felt, I felt like I gotta do this.

159
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.220
It's like I had to do this because I don't want to become across.

160
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:14.740
Like I'm you know what I'm saying about the reason how I apply this to the

161
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:18.980
disease situation is the fact that this girl is in a situation where she feels

162
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:22.650
like, I guess I have to do this. Like I may not wanna.

163
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.530
<v 1>Do it. I don't know we're were speculating. You know, I can say.</v>

164
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.890
<v 0>You I've been in a situation where I didn't necessarily wanna do it,</v>

165
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.730
but I felt like the social pressure of like, well, man,

166
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.210
I have to follow through with what I'm doing right now. No, I get.

167
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.130
<v 1>It. Yeah. That's definitely.</v>

168
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.170
<v 0>Probably. And then in the morning I,</v>

169
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.320
I have to fly when we're not even in the morning, I said, I're finish.

170
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.120
And I'm like I said, Hey, you know, you gotta go because I gotta pack.

171
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.240
And she started to cry. Oh boy. And I thought this, if this was happening,

172
00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:49.560
now this could be a situation.

173
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.040
It could easily be somebody she could tell her story differently.

174
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.360
So we don't know. That's why there's no rules.

175
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.200
What this lady did was she was aggressive and flirting and she wanted what she

176
00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:03.000
wanted and she got it. You know? So that sometimes is okay,

177
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.760
depending on the person that you're dealing with,

178
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.840
but that same situation with someone else, right. Could be no,

179
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:13.520
this was horrible. Right. I, I, I felt, I felt intimidated. I felt, you know,

180
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.030
it's all in how you, you interpret it, interpret.

181
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.270
<v 1>It. Yeah. Yeah. It's definitely,</v>

182
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.110
it depends on who's talking and whether or not you're tracked each, like,

183
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:25.190
here's a perfect example. If you and your girlfriend, um,

184
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.230
decided to get drunk and uh,

185
00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:30.350
your girlfriend was drunk and she called you up and said, uh, come on over,

186
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.070
you know, uh, you know, I'm horny. I want you to me.

187
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.550
If you went over and did it,

188
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.620
you would in some people's eyes be guilty of sexual assault.

189
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.820
I know because she was drunk and she couldn't consent.

190
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.700
<v 0>And this is why I'd never done that. By the way, my,</v>

191
00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:46.780
one of my ex-girlfriends was like that. She wanted to get drunk. Really.

192
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.740
She was like, I just wanna have sex when I'm drunk. You know,

193
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.220
I just couldn't do it. I didn't.

194
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.380
<v 1>Feel more nervous about it.</v>

195
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.890
<v 0>I, it wasn't about, it's just, it was just me personally. I, I don't drink. Oh,</v>

196
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:58.050
you don't drink at all. I don't drink at all. So, oh. I,

197
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:01.530
I always felt like if I'm not drinking, it just feels like,

198
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:04.330
what if she says she wants to do something right. That like,

199
00:10:04.331 --> 00:10:05.770
she doesn't normally want to do. Right.

200
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.410
And then she's gonna get sober and be like,

201
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.530
why did you do that to my butt hole or whatever? &lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean?

202
00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:13.530
Like, why did, and you're like, what? But you said she goes,

203
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.040
cause it'll always come back to, well, you know, I was drunk. Right.

204
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.040
And I didn't really mean I didn't, you know, then I'm like, okay,

205
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.240
I don't wanna be the choice maker in that situation. Well, that's.

206
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.960
<v 1>The best thing about not drinking right. In that situation. If you don't drink,</v>

207
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.000
you never have to think like that.

208
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.360
<v 0>But, but that's why sometimes I don't want to hang out.</v>

209
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:32.560
That's why sometimes I don't want to hang out with people that are like that,

210
00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:36.480
get right. Dumb, drunk you're out. And then, then I become responsible.

211
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.310
<v 1>Oh, well what's the worst when you're sober.</v>

212
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.510
<v 0>Yeah. It's like, whoa, I don't wanna deal with this because they, their.</v>

213
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.950
<v 1>Behavior is so gross. Gross.</v>

214
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.510
<v 0>Yeah. You know, then you see your friend,</v>

215
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.710
especially if you have like a female friend, you're not,

216
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.350
you're not like that with them. Right. But then you're out and then she's,

217
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.350
you know, her skirt's coming up and you see the creepy guy,

218
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.740
you see the guy that she's like, oh, the guy like, oh man, what do right now?

219
00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.740
Like if I don't stop her from going,

220
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.420
and then something happens that she doesn't want to happen. Is it my fault?

221
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.980
<v 1>Stop her. And she's like, you're a hater. Right. I love him. Yeah.</v>

222
00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:07.220
He is so cute. Oh.

223
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.740
And we were gonna have an amazing time and you hate her.

224
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.260
<v 0>This, all this Harvey Weinstein and all this kind of, it's set, you know,</v>

225
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.250
its set ugly dudes back like 20 years.

226
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.210
&lt;laugh&gt; all my advances that I've made with hot chicks has just been like,

227
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.450
I'm so glad I have are friend doing this time, but you're.

228
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.370
<v 1>Not power. Here's the thing. It's not about ugly.</v>

229
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.650
It's about Harvey Weinstein being in control of a studio. Exactly. And,

230
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.210
and scaring all those girls into him and allegedly raping some of them,

231
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.010
you know, I mean, I don't know what he did or didn't do, but he definitely,

232
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.913
he did a lot of.

233
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.400
<v 0>I wish I just wish that a lot of these people, I wish it's too.</v>

234
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.880
Maybe now people will have the courage to like come out.

235
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.520
Cause it's such certain, cause it' suck to hear about like, you know,

236
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.800
this happened to Angelina Jolie and then like, oh, so then she,

237
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.200
there was a certain time when she was like right.

238
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.960
The most famous woman in Hollywood. And she didn't say anything about,

239
00:11:56.961 --> 00:12:00.000
I still didn't say anything. Yeah. So it sucks that we lived in a black ball.

240
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.920
I know it sucks that we live in a culture. Like, so maybe what that's,

241
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.320
why some innocent people are getting, getting caught in the crossfire. Right.

242
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.480
So we can obliterate this sort of behavior and attitude from our culture.

243
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.630
But in the meantime, while we're going through this,

244
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.390
there's gonna be some kilos and there's gonna be some people that yeah.

245
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.030
Are gonna get caught in the crossfire. Did you.
