00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 1>Statistically, they said 5% of those will be dead. It's not even well.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.750
<v 2>They thought 0.1%. But what they thought was the all.</v>

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.200
<v 1>Powerful. God's just like the UN says, you will not question us big.</v>

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.700
Tuck says you will not close you into anything. The UN says we only humans like,

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.580
oh, we shouldn't do a lockdown. It's killing millions of people, starvation,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.240
but still it's like worst keeping a lockdown going to get on a nation said,

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.510
well, what do you think should be done? I mean,

9
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.570
I think we should look at something, but isn't much worse than the flu and say,

10
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:34.950
we all need natural vitamins and nutraceuticals and

11
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.510
sunlight and health.

12
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.750
And people should just know they've got to deal with the way it is because we

13
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:43.140
always get diseases. We always get viruses. We always live with the idea.

14
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.390
We got to lock society down and go into our houses.

15
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.880
And this is a post-industrial move

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.250
that they're using to roll out these systems to keep us locked down our homes,

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.030
right? And if you want.

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.920
<v 2>To be cynical, this is where you step in and say,</v>

19
00:00:55.921 --> 00:01:00.210
the reason why they want us to be upset and they want the economy to be is

20
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.580
because they hate the president and they want him out of office and they want to

21
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.410
regain power. They want the Democrat.

22
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.800
<v 3>Or remake some of the American economy in the image of what they want.</v>

23
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.180
They want to remake a lot of these,

24
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.530
these systems that they feel are for whatever reason,

25
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.800
then just, or unjust or whatever.

26
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.440
And they want to use this opportunity to kind of redraw.

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.340
<v 1>The lines. Exactly that after nine 11, exactly. The, this is the new nine 11,</v>

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.670
the UN and, and the day, most group all say,

29
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.180
this is the post-industrial world. The great reset.

30
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:34.200
I got a copy of it for right here. And they say in these documents,

31
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.790
we are going to reorganize society. COVID is good to shut down.

32
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.790
The carbon carbon is bad. We're going to end success.

33
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.820
We're going to end prosperity. We're going to track everybody.

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.940
We're control their lives all under the name of COVID. They said all.

35
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.820
<v 2>That. They said, we're going to end success. We're going to end prosperity.</v>

36
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.420
<v 1>Oh yeah. In the lockstep Rockefeller document, 2010,</v>

37
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
they say we'll have a viral release or simulated one that creates total fear.

38
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.720
We'll bring in a police state martial.

39
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.030
<v 2>Law available for someone to read. Absolutely. It wasn't.</v>

40
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.610
<v 3>A subject called agenda 21 or something where they were saying,</v>

41
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.920
we want people living in cities. We don't want home ownership,

42
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.870
compact cities yet. And as.

43
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.880
<v 1>You were saying it earlier, they go, oh,</v>

44
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.130
it's for the greater good that we don't have cars anymore.

45
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:15.690
It's for the greater good we have.

46
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.240
<v 2>Done. Second one. I was saying, what I was doing was give playing devils.</v>

47
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.870
You were quoting them. What I was saying. You said that Joe,

48
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:23.700
you believe in that I was saying that autonomous,

49
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.140
I do believe in cars to autonomous vehicles are in the future.

50
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.980
At least likely to be safer than people just driving and texting. Well,

51
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:32.250
it's not.

52
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.491
<v 1>Safe.</v>

53
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:35.580
Given the control of these corporations and robots making ourselves obsolete,

54
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:36.660
we need to build a pro-human future.

55
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.320
<v 2>Oh I'm pro-human but I know you are.</v>

56
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:44.370
I'm not saying you're not Joe feller thing from 2010. So that was a weird side.

57
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.630
<v 4>I started and I was already looking this up as he mentioned it,</v>

58
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.570
because I was going down my own little rabbit hole.

59
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.120
It says when I first started to find it, my first search,

60
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.020
it says there's a small or large conspiracy has been built out of this small

61
00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:00.640
grain of truth for this document from 2010. Okay. That's what it starts to say.

62
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.360
So I haven't.

63
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.530
<v 2>Snopes small grain of truth. God. It's like, I don't think,</v>

64
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.320
is it Snopes that you go, let's focus on the grain. If true.

65
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.520
Who says there's a grain of truth?

66
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.860
<v 5>Hold on. No, no. It's.</v>

67
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.420
<v 1>Operation lockstep.</v>

68
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.860
And it says a global police state will be brought in from a pandemic and

69
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:21.700
there'll be worldwide martial law. It actually says it in the document. Okay.

70
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.280
It's like, they always go like, oh, there's no hunter emails.

71
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.000
The emails are real. Right. I love that clock. It is weird.

72
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.900
<v 2>That they're saying TGT studios. Okay. Isn't it is weird. There's a document.</v>

73
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.630
Okay. The Rockefeller foundation annual report,

74
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.590
2010 control F what would you like me to look up?

75
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.470
Uh, look up, uh, police state, look up, just look up police state.

76
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.760
I forget the exact.

77
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.040
<v 1>Words. I mean, let's just go read it for yourself.</v>

78
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.620
Control F police state came up. This is just one paper.

79
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.670
<v 4>I mean, that's the whole PDF is here. It's like, it's really, really, really.</v>

80
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.140
<v 2>Long. So when you control F police, state, nothing. Okay. What else?</v>

81
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.390
Uh, I mean, I've, I've, I've read it.

82
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.180
<v 1>Before it says that. So anybody can go read it right now.</v>

83
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.500
So you think they edited it? No. No. I mean, I can't remember the exact word.

84
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.890
Okay. Well.

85
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.080
<v 2>Let's look up pandemic, look up. Pandemic.</v>

86
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.830
<v 1>Pandemic just means widely distributed epidemic means directions.</v>

87
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.960
Four mentions of the word pandemic. Okay.

88
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.700
<v 2>All right.</v>

89
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.660
With no network to transfer critical infectious disease information without open

90
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:27.990
lines of communications, thousands more false sick.

91
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.620
The new in quotes disease becomes an unchecked pandemic.

92
00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:33.330
By the time the,

93
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.310
the right expertise is brought to bear on the partial world. It's too late.

94
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.300
The disease has spread around the globe in a world of global trade and travel.

95
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:46.290
What's traded faster and travels furthest are the microbes in every handshake,

96
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:50.640
Southeast Asia. So what are they? What is this in reference to? Okay.

97
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:54.900
It says a few miles east bababababa young boy has been hit. And hold on.

98
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:58.050
Don't please go back to that. Yeah, just, it's just,

99
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.560
it's just a scenario that they're painting. So make that a little larger. No,

100
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:05.640
no, no. Go back to it. Just go back to where it was. All right.

101
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.270
The potential pandemic, the fast few decades have severely tested.

102
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.600
The world's ability to work across human borders. Detection remains weak.

103
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:13.530
In many parts of the world.

104
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.650
The public health response has frequently been slow and fragmented.

105
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.160
The looming threat of infectious disease presents humanity with a new challenge

106
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.660
to communicate and collaborate swifter and with greater efficiency than ever

107
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:27.120
before. That doesn't sound like that. Trying to end the world. Well.

108
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.190
<v 1>You're just reading one, one of these documents. I already,</v>

109
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:31.050
I can pull up the articles I can show to yourself,

110
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.720
but this is world government controlled.

111
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.500
They talk about a worldwide police state. You searched the term pandemic.

112
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:38.880
I'm telling you what's in these things.

113
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.760
<v 2>Okay. A emerging pandemic, the new century, SARS, avian, flu, and swine flu.</v>

114
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.060
If we don't move investigated systems to bring in global governments,

115
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:51.900
like they're trying to prevent pandemics. If they don't move quickly,

116
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:54.720
viruses will, uh,

117
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.210
by continuing our drive to invest systems that coordinate efforts and share

118
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:02.030
information. The Rockefeller foundation is working to,

119
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.070
which is the global government controller to meet the health challenges of an

120
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:08.450
interconnected world. Isn't.

121
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.450
<v 3>The perfect analogy. Terrorism, because it's like terrorism exists.</v>

122
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.190
People want to prevent terrorism, but it's like,

123
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.390
how many rights do you give up in order to do that? And then, you know,

124
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.210
all these proactive measures that we take to prevent terrorism.

125
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.590
A lot of them create more terrorists,

126
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.720
who I think it's like a balance of like beat remaining a free society and

127
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:30.110
dealing with a lot of the men. Listen, I sit here, you know, we.

128
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.560
<v 1>Sit and we talk about something and whether Jamie can find it or not becomes the</v>

129
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:37.040
arbiter, whether it's real. So they found something about an at and T lobbying.

130
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.270
They did find the thing about this.

131
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.590
I've got the operation lockstep documents where they say,

132
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.080
we're going to bring in this global authority table.

133
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.420
<v 2>Then you have to show us those.</v>

134
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.950
<v 1>Well, I mean, I'm sitting here in studio talking to you about this.</v>

135
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.540
<v 2>But I understand what you're saying, but we wanted.</v>

136
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.800
<v 1>To try to, you know, everybody else watching this is going to look.</v>

137
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.570
<v 2>It up. Well, I hope they do. They're gonna go crazy.</v>

138
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.590
I hope we wish we could have found it right then if it's real. No, no, no, no.

139
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:07.730
You want to show it, but it might be an interpretation of what they're saying.

140
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.620
Like the window.

141
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.020
It says specifically the women quote is just a criticism of Trump.

142
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.170
She's blaming all this lock. No Whitmer.

143
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.100
<v 1>Was found by the,</v>

144
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.480
by the Supreme court of Michigan and by a federal court to have seized all three

145
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:23.140
branches of government and basically set up martial law. They,

146
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.280
we use those terms and she was overturned.

147
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.010
<v 3>That quote. I want it when you say,</v>

148
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.430
if you are sick of lockdowns and you're sick of not being able to go to church,

149
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.580
Joe Biden should be elected. That is not a huge jump.

150
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.260
<v 2>From what he said. No, it's not a huge job.</v>

151
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.290
But the problem is the way it's being said.

152
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.440
She was talking about how bad Trump handled the,

153
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.690
the rate of infection for of course.

154
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.220
<v 1>And let's expand on that. I remember interviewing Lou Dobbs like 15 years ago,</v>

155
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.510
back when he was still on CNN. And we were looking at documents where it said,

156
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.400
we're going to bring in global government,

157
00:07:55.401 --> 00:08:00.110
the north American union using the threat of viruses and migration flows and

158
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:03.950
economic collapse. And they said like a deadly flu or deadly SARS. Yeah.

159
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.740
I'm sitting here watching this power, grab watching the UN and,

160
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.490
and big tech saying, well,

161
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:15.380
you can't say that that the UN is wrong because the UN is in charge since when

162
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:18.080
is the news WHL and all these doctors,

163
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.890
all these medical doctors that come out and say other things other than like our

164
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:25.370
steroids cured it, or, you know how I dropped the chloric. One helped you.

165
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.540
How are they being banned? Even if they were wrong, they should be,

166
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.910
have their license removed. That's what that's about.

167
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.750
It's not Google decides that if something isn't the UN it's taken down,

168
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:37.660
that's all narrow archive.org.

169
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.910
<v 4>I found, I went to the second page of this link,</v>

170
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:43.030
but this is like scenario narratives. It says lockstep.

171
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.490
It talks about a pandemics from 2012 and the SARS and all sorts of H one N one.

172
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.180
So I skipped into the next page just to, while you guys are talking.

173
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.420
And this was the part that that's a little strange where she's getting to into

174
00:08:55.421 --> 00:08:58.200
what I think he is now tours out. Um,

175
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.670
it started here cause it says stuff about Kenya in 2025 and people being weary

176
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.060
of top-down 20, 25.

177
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.050
<v 2>People seem to be growing weary of so much top-down control and letting leaders</v>

178
00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:11.870
and authorities make choices for them,

179
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.810
whatever net, wherever national interest clashed with individual interests,

180
00:09:17.811 --> 00:09:18.680
there was conflict.

181
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.180
Sporadic pushback becomes increasingly organized and coordinated as

182
00:09:23.181 --> 00:09:26.840
disaffected youth and people who have seen their status and opportunities slip

183
00:09:26.841 --> 00:09:29.300
away largely in developing countries,

184
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.490
incited civil unrest by 2026 protestors in Nigeria

185
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:39.200
brought down the government fed up with the entrenched cronyism and corruption.

186
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.880
Even those who like the greater stability and predictability of this world began

187
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:47.630
to grow uncomfortable and constrained by so many tight rules.

188
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.150
And by the strictness of national boundaries,

189
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.060
the feeling lingered that sooner or later,

190
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:55.070
something would have inevitably upset.

191
00:09:55.071 --> 00:09:59.330
The neat order that the world's governments had worked so hard to establish.

192
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.060
<v 1>Okay. I'd never read that, but that's the other stuff it's in there.</v>

193
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:03.620
I'm telling you thousands of pages, man.

194
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.230
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

195
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.380
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

196
00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:14.810
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

197
00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:18.500
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

198
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.520
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

199
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.320
That's all we're asking. Go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
