00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 1>Tell people what you did cause it's pretty crazy.</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.570
<v 0>Um, so I did, what's called free climbing.</v>

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.000
I free climbed a route on El Capitan,

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.870
which is a 3,200 foot cliff in Yosemite national park.

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.150
And he did it in under 24 hours.

7
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.810
<v 1>That is a long way to go. Yeah, 3,200. And.</v>

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.110
<v 0>It's something 3,200 feet is what I say.</v>

9
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:28.880
I think it might just be like a little more than that.

10
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.690
<v 1>When you're halfway there.</v>

11
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.980
Emily Harrington becomes the first woman to scale El Capitan via its notoriously

12
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.660
difficult golden gate route. Why is that route more difficult?

13
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.910
Well, okay. So there's a router route.

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.830
<v 0>I don't think it really matters. I see. Yeah. Yeah. Um,</v>

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.910
so essentially ELCAP is this giant cliff face and there's,

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.310
there's hundreds of routes up El cap, different like pathways you can take. Um,

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.630
and right now there's currently only like 15 ways to get up at via free

18
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.230
climbing, free climbing, being using only your hands and feet, uh,

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.290
to ascend and a rope in case you fall. Um,

20
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:12.380
and I chose the route called golden gate,

21
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.710
which is more difficult than the route free rider,

22
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:19.190
which people are very familiar with because that's the route that Alex Honnold

23
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:21.860
free soloed, meaning he climbed it without a rope.

24
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.640
<v 1>Yeah. That seems insane. So you're less than Satan to him.</v>

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.560
<v 0>Yeah. Definitely less insane than him. Alex is a dear friend of mine,</v>

26
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:34.190
but there's some things I don't understand about him. Yeah. I don't know.

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.680
<v 1>If he understands those, those things about him. No.</v>

28
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.790
<v 0>I mean, I have an enormous amount of respect for him, but, um, what he does is,</v>

29
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.320
is truly remarkable.

30
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.550
<v 1>Um, you bumped your head while you're doing it too. I could see the.</v>

31
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.140
<v 0>Yeah, you can see the scar. Um, I, that, yeah, and that's actually,</v>

32
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:55.280
the second time I hit my head, uh, trying to, trying to do this, uh,

33
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.000
last year I had a really bad fall, um, wound up in the hospital,

34
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.800
full concussion. The whole thing this time, it was slightly less, uh,

35
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.770
less serious, but maybe more dramatic. Cause it,

36
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:08.780
it happened like way higher up on the wall.

37
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.000
<v 1>How high were you up?</v>

38
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.550
<v 0>Um, 2,800 feet. I'd say like almost to the top. It was,</v>

39
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.900
uh, it was a whole, it was very dramatic. Um, I,

40
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.030
so the day was actually going really well. Um,

41
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.860
I've been trying to do this for a few years now.

42
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.030
Probably I would say three years, I've been working towards this goal. Um,

43
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.010
and I'd actually done the route in 2015 over the course of six

44
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:38.480
days. And I really wanted to like do the same route in 24 hours.

45
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.510
<v 1>Can I stop you there when you do it over six days? Do you sleep?</v>

46
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.590
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. That's how most people climb El cap, they sleep on the wall.</v>

47
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:47.600
It takes like five to seven days or so.

48
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.360
<v 1>That seems more sketchy.</v>

49
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.490
<v 0>It's it's,</v>

50
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.650
it's different because there's a lot more logistics involved, right?

51
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.330
Like imagine you have to like live in the vertical world for days on end.

52
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.910
So think about everything you do. Like from when you wake up to,

53
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:04.380
when you go to bed.

54
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.740
<v 1>Including pooing. Oh yeah. You have to pu vertically.</v>

55
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.790
<v 0>Yeah. We use like, we use wag bags or like, you know,</v>

56
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.880
little like plastic bags and you're like go in that bag and then you put it in

57
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:15.714
another bag and.

58
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.660
<v 1>You put it in.</v>

59
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.180
<v 0>Another bag, you put it in another bag and then you like,</v>

60
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:24.810
hang it below everything and you take it up with you and then you like,

61
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.630
you take it. Yeah. You don't leave it, obviously.

62
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.040
<v 1>Stuff it in the crack up there. Is that someone going? No,</v>

63
00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:32.880
that's just someone hanging out.

64
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.180
<v 0>That's like how you do it when you live on the wall. So you have that ledge.</v>

65
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.040
<v 1>Um, like the Michael Jackson song live in on the ball. Yeah,</v>

66
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.770
no, that's fine. You know, I'm not familiar. It's a famous song.

67
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.810
Um, so you sleep in that thing. I would get zero sleep.

68
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.130
I don't like sleeping when I'm near the edge of my bed. I get nervous.

69
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.383
<v 0>How, uh,</v>

70
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.160
it's amazing how exhausted you are at the end of the day and how

71
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:05.670
used to the whole, like how used to it, you get,

72
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.090
you just adjust the human body's like humans are really remarkable in their

73
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:13.410
ability to like adapt to things. And so it's pretty cool how,

74
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.490
yeah, it's really scary at first, but then the more you do it,

75
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:19.290
the more you're just like, okay, well this is.

76
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.780
<v 1>Are you when you're sleeping in that thing,</v>

77
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:23.870
he fully is harnessed in and strapped in.

78
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.200
<v 0>You sleep in a harness and you just usually have like a loose, um,</v>

79
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.440
like rope or sling or something attached to the anchor point.

80
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.410
So like if you roll out, you know,

81
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.540
if you're one of those people that like rolls out of bed at night.

82
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.010
<v 1>Um, yikes.</v>

83
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.070
Could you imagine just the feeling of like waking up swinging,

84
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.310
hanging from your harness.

85
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.740
<v 0>He's so he is actually COE. Is that sling around his waist? No,</v>

86
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.090
that's just like, yeah. That's like last resort. Like that's,

87
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:57.660
that's Tommy Caldwell. He, um, while you're a psycho, he, uh,

88
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.800
he free climbed perhaps the hard, the hardest big wall in the world,

89
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:06.150
also on El cap called the Dawn wall. Um, and he was up there for 17 days.

90
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.950
So when you eat, imagine 17 days.

91
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.910
<v 1>Look at all this stuff. That's like, he's like a homeless person up there. Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.680
There's a lot of stuff. You know,

93
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.760
like the homeless people have those little camps. That is a, he's a maniac.

94
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.120
That's a crazy person. Look at him, checking his fingernails.

95
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.030
<v 0>You see, he is also, he's also actually missing a finger,</v>

96
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:26.790
which is pretty rare for an elite level rock climber.

97
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.860
<v 1>Oh, wow. What happened in his finger? Um.</v>

98
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.330
<v 0>I believe it was a table saw accident, home improvement accident.</v>

99
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.140
<v 1>Ooh. And so he's using everything, but his index.</v>

100
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.940
<v 0>Yeah. He kind of climbs, um, he clinical arms like this and,</v>

101
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.210
and uses the little, the nub he's yeah, definitely.

102
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.930
Tommy's one of my true heroes. Ultimate climbing hero.

103
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.610
<v 1>Did you have, uh, is that as a very small click, right? Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.310
Of Savage psychos that are willing to climb mountain faces.

105
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.550
<v 0>Yeah. It's a relatively small group. I mean,</v>

106
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.830
it's growing, climbing's definitely growing in popularity. Um,

107
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.070
but it definitely used to be like a little bit like a small little community.

108
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.300
And I think we still feel that way.

109
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.790
<v 1>A danger in the climbing world or not a danger, a concern,</v>

110
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:20.650
I should say of people who are seeing people

111
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:25.540
like Alex Honnold and yourself become famous and get all this

112
00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:29.290
attention from these very dangerous climbs.

113
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.770
And they want to perhaps accelerate their progress and,

114
00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:36.250
and jump right in and try to do some really risky things.

115
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.950
<v 0>I mean, I could see that being a danger, um,</v>

116
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.860
especially with like what Alex does climb without a rope.

117
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.360
I would still argue that what I do is a relatively safe form of climbing,

118
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.800
climbing the rope. When I fall, the rope catches me. It's super safe.

119
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:58.300
When I call the rope catches me, um, free climbing El cap in a day,

120
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.860
what would I just did? I definitely cut some corners and, um,

121
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.060
took more risk,

122
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.920
but that's an achievement that not many people have done or really strive to

123
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:13.210
do. Um, and so I think, I think for the most part,

124
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:14.680
climbing is actually a very controlled,

125
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:19.240
very safe activity and you can make it as dangerous as you want it to be.

126
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.223
Does that make sense?

127
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.970
<v 1>Yes. I understand what you're saying. Um,</v>

128
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.510
so if you're a person like Alex is deciding, you know, he's,

129
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:30.490
he maps these routes, he does them with ropes and then he's like, I can do this.

130
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.940
Yes.

131
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.090
<v 0>And Alex, Alex is so unique in a way.</v>

132
00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:37.510
And I think anyone that watches the movie free solo,

133
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:42.490
anyone that talks to Alex understands that what he does is he it's so

134
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:44.800
well thought out and it's so well-planned,

135
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.080
and every single decision he makes is very calculated.

136
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.500
And I think that that's just,

137
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.860
and I think that that's a Testament to what climbing is truly about. Like,

138
00:07:56.861 --> 00:08:01.600
we're not like we're not out to go feel an adrenaline rush when we go

139
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:03.010
climbing. Like if you're feeling adrenaline,

140
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:06.490
it essentially means like you messed up, like something's wrong. Um,

141
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:10.720
and climbing is very much more about like the movement and the challenge and

142
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.780
the mental challenge of all of it. Then,

143
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.420
then going out and like trying to get a thrill.

144
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.340
How did you get involved in this?

145
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.650
I started climbing when I was 10 years old. Um, I was at,

146
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.390
I grew up in Boulder, Colorado,

147
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.990
and my parents used to take me to the Boulder reservoir, this Lake,

148
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.270
me and my cousins. Uh.

149
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.620
<v 1>Everyone in Boulder is a Subaru Subaru.</v>

150
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.540
<v 0>For my 16th birthday. It's like 70%.</v>

151
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.600
<v 1>Of the cars out there. Green Subaru is there.</v>

152
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:42.820
So practically work in the snow. Yeah.

153
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.880
<v 0>I had it for years. Um, so anyway, um,</v>

154
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.360
my parents took me to the Lake and they had this little festival there and I

155
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.870
grew up, I'm an only child. I grew up with my two cousins who were boys.

156
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.550
And we were just like super with each other all the time. Like,

157
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.870
all I wanted to do was be better than them at like literally anything.

158
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:02.820
It didn't matter what it was. Um,

159
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.920
so we were at this Lake and they had a little festival with one of those tower

160
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.330
rock towers, you know, the ones that they let the kids climb on. And, uh,

161
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:14.850
we all tried to climb the wall and I just remember it was like, well,

162
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:17.550
I have to go to the top because they went to the top and you know,

163
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.680
there's like no other option. Um,

164
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.710
but the interesting thing that happened when I was climbing was it was just this

165
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:26.820
feeling of like, Oh, I, this is what I, this is what I'm meant to do.

166
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.460
Like it was like, I just felt like I belonged up there.

167
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.970
And I remember the feeling so vividly even now,

168
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.100
23 years later, um, it was like, I was scared, but I kinda liked it.

169
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.290
And I just really, I got down and I was like, dad,

170
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.300
I want to go climbing like that. That's what I want to do.

171
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:45.120
I want to quit everything else. I was a gymnast. I played soccer.

172
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:47.010
I was a ski racer. I was like, I don't want to do,

173
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.080
I don't want to do any of that anymore. I just want to climb.

174
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.770
