WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>Boom and we're live. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.290
so just to give everybody a good way to start this,

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
you have a book, a book is called the desert in the sea,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.450
and you have one of the most disturbing and craziest stories.

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.980
I think I ever read you were kidnapped by Somali

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.540
pirates and you were held hostage for more than two years. Yeah.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.360
What the was that like? And what does it feel like to be a freak?

8
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.490
Amen. Now, after.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.280
<v 1>All that, are you kidding? It feels great in America. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.480
Wandering around the valley.

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.170
<v 2>The valley where I was born and raised, by the way. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.600
This is the first time I've been back in the valley for a couple of years now.

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.260
What.

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.640
<v 0>What, what happened and how w how did it happen?</v>

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.150
<v 1>Long story. Um, so I w I went to Somalia in the first place to write a book,</v>

16
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:58.100
a very different book about Somali pirates right in front of me. And, um, I,

17
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.400
so I'm a journalist. I was working in Berlin at the time,

18
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:05.990
and I had followed a very long trial of 10 Somali pirates in Germany,

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.250
um, in Hamburg for about a year, all of 2011.

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.960
And before that,

21
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:15.350
I had already thought about going to Somalia because the pirate story,

22
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.260
it was interesting and all sorts of ways that I thought other writers weren't

23
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.590
getting to. And I had met another journalist,

24
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.840
a documentary maker named Ashwin Ramin,

25
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.220
who also wanted to go to Somalia for his own project. And, uh,

26
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:32.720
so we talked about going for a long time, and by the end of 2011, um,

27
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.250
in the middle of the trial, um, we, all our plans came together and, and,

28
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.070
uh, we wound up going in January of 2012,

29
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.390
and we had about 10 days of good research. Um,

30
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.520
we both got pretty good material,

31
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.220
and we were in a part of Somalia where other journalists had gone.

32
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:53.150
So we weren't doing something that was totally off the map, you know? Um, and,

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.710
uh, on the 10th day, uh, Ashwin flew off to Mogadishu. And, um,

34
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.770
I went with him to the airport. We saw them off,

35
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.590
and it was on the way back from the airport that, um, uh,

36
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:08.540
truck was waiting for our car and the truck, which was actually a technical.

37
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:11.870
So a battle wagon with a Canon in the back

38
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.610
stopped us, aim the Canon through the windshield, overpowered my guard,

39
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.420
and 12 guys with Kalashnikovs pulled me out of the car.

40
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.530
So I was, they put me in another car and we drove off.

41
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.140
So from that moment on, I was captive.

42
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.210
<v 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

43
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.950
<v 0>And so they were obviously trying to get some hostage money.</v>

44
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.140
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, no, it was about money.</v>

45
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.020
And I think they were hoping for both of us, by the way, um,

46
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.920
Ashwin feels very lucky that he didn't get captured. So they had planned this.

47
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.710
Yeah. And they were probably waiting for our car earlier in the morning.

48
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.853
And it was just,

49
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.370
Ashwyn's good luck that we took a different route to the airport.

50
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.250
How much money were they asking for? Well,

51
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:54.590
so the first thing they asked for me was $20 million,

52
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.690
but that was after the first week. So the,

53
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.840
I went for a week without having a phone call home. Um, and in that period,

54
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.210
seals rescued two other hostages from another part of central Somalia, um,

55
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.030
including Jessica Buchanan, an American,

56
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.900
and I think nine Somali guards died in that raid.

57
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.400
And they had some clan relationship to some of the guys holding me.

58
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:20.410
And so the guys holding me were very upset.

59
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.520
And I think that's why they asked for 20 million and held more importantly held

60
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.790
onto that demand for so long, what they held onto it for almost a year.

61
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.100
<v 0>That specific number they wouldn't budge. And so they were in negotiations.</v>

62
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.220
<v 1>Yeah, there were negotiations, but they were, you know,</v>

63
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.850
phony negotiations in some sense because the Somalis weren't,

64
00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:39.900
weren't really negotiating.

65
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.630
<v 0>So for some background,</v>

66
00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:46.380
for people that are unfamiliar with the situation in Somalia,

67
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.580
Somalia, if, uh, correct me if I'm wrong,

68
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.420
that area was traditionally fishermen.

69
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.230
<v 1>And yeah. That's wrong. It's right. So that's actually the point of the book.</v>

70
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.150
That's actually one level of the title of the desert and the sea. So that's, uh,

71
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.760
um, you, you get the idea from things that Somali pirates like to say, oh,

72
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.170
that they're just frustrated fishermen. Uh, that's the only part of the story.

73
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.270
And so that's a, that's a very important premise in the book. They, they, um,

74
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.070
there are, you know, fishing communities on the coast and they're being, um,

75
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.930
hard hit definitely by illegal ships that come in to steal the fish, you know,

76
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.880
but that's a problem up and down Africa. And because of that problem, um,

77
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.450
once Somalia had no government,

78
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.990
there was no Navy Navy to defend the coastline. Um,

79
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.970
local sort of clan leaders would send out militia boats with militiamen and

80
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.180
hold fishing boats for, you know,

81
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.920
$50,000 ransoms over 24 hour periods, you know, really nothing very much.

82
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:56.340
And they called it a license fee. And that's how you did business in Somalia,

83
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:59.310
in the nineties. We didn't hear about that. It was too small time.

84
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.810
We started to hear about it when they graduated to capturing cargo ships.

85
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.120
<v 0>What I had heard was that, um,</v>

86
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.950
there was illegal dumping that wasn't just official, so, yeah. Yeah. And that,

87
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.450
um, they initially called themselves the people's coast guard of Somalia or the

88
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:16.590
voluntary coast guard. Yeah.

89
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.060
<v 1>One or two, uh, pirate, um, gangs tried to call themselves that. And,</v>

90
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.680
you know, they had a point, there was no, no one else patrolling the coast,

91
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.940
but that wasn't really what was going on. No, um, I was captured on land,

92
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.350
first of all, uh, every other CA uh, hostage I met was a fishermen,

93
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.560
a poor fishermen captured hundreds of miles from the Somali coast.

94
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.850
So that's not protecting the cost.

95
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.050
<v 0>So what role does this stuff called?</v>

96
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.020
Cat K H a T. This is a,

97
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.790
it's a plant that they chew and it has like a stimulant.

98
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.830
<v 1>Yeah. It's a little bit like Coca leaf,</v>

99
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.730
but I think actually it's a narcotic gets you high at first. Um, and then you,

100
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.680
and you wake up depressed and you need more. Uh, but these guys,

101
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.950
every single pirate I met was addicted. Um,

102
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.750
and they wound up having to sit in front of these piles of cut, um,

103
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.190
every afternoon just to get high enough, uh, for their addiction. And,

104
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.350
um, then, like I said, they would,

105
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.310
they would crash at night and then do it again. Uh, in my case, there were,

106
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.530
there were guards 24 hours a day,

107
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:25.700
which meant there was also a shift that slept during the day to cut at night and

108
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:29.900
then, and then crash in the morning. W did you try any of that stuff? Yeah.

109
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.520
I mean, they, they kept offering it to me. It wasn't like they, I, you know,

110
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.330
take like two or three stems with three or four stamps. Not, not much,

111
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.490
but it changed your mood. You know,

112
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.050
you could be depressed and you'd feel better,

113
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.000
or you could be a little bit sick and you just wouldn't feel it anymore. Um,

114
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.180
but I didn't want to get addicted to it. So I didn't,

115
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.840
I didn't keep pushing that. It's that addictive. Yeah. Well, I saw it.

116
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.560
I saw how addictive it could be with the guards, uh, you know,

117
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.250
a little bit on an afternoon. Didn't make me want to keep doing it necessarily,

118
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:04.030
but every, every now and then I did it just for the sake of my mood. Yeah.

119
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.780
That's always.

120
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.613
<v 0>In the narrative,</v>

121
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.940
this cat stuff that they're somehow or another unhinged,

122
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.380
because they're on this stuff all the time.

123
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.770
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, you can get really unhinged in the sense that you're,</v>

124
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.740
once you're wired on it, you're easily sort of upset.

125
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:21.220
And these guys would have sometimes have fist fights in front of me and that

126
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:23.620
kind of thing. Not all the time, but yeah, they would get,

127
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.590
they would get hopped up. They would just get jittery.

128
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.890
And that's that it's very dangerous with Kalashnikovs lying around.

129
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.750
<v 0>So their culture somehow or another has evolved</v>

130
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.970
to this point where it's insanely common to kidnap

131
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:43.360
people to the point where if you, if you talk about Somali pirates,

132
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.460
there are very few countries where pirates go after their names so

133
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.000
easily.

134
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.530
<v 1>Yeah. The, they, um, kidnapping became part of the culture.</v>

135
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:58.450
That's true, but pirate bosses, which are not so active now off the coast,

136
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.300
um, also have other businesses that they get involved in.

137
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.080
And so I've written about this in the meantime too, they, they get involved in,

138
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.760
uh, gun smuggling and also even people smuggling on the horn of Africa. So, um,

139
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.910
whatever it takes, that kind of equipment, you know, SUV's,

140
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.130
Kalashnikovs cheap food. When.

141
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.110
<v 0>You say people smuggling, what do you mean?</v>

142
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.360
<v 1>Um, it's a good story. I found out, uh, I'm,</v>

143
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.740
I'm the person that proved that on the route between Somalia to Libya.

144
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.050
Um, some former pirate bosses were active in moving people. So in other words,

145
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.220
Somalis who want to go to Libya will put themselves in the hands of some

146
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:38.620
traffickers and some of those traffickers might be ex pirates.

147
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.260
<v 0>But w w go there as far as just being transported willingly,</v>

148
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.760
willingly at first.

149
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.880
<v 1>And then, um, there's always a place in Sudan where it,</v>

150
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.420
where it shifts from being a willing to being unwilling.

151
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.940
<v 0>Well, this is an issue that's been going on in Libya. I'm sure you saw the,</v>

152
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.680
the most recent slave auctions that were videotaped and put on

153
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.310
YouTube.

154
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.680
<v 1>Which was the stories are awful. I've heard this firsthand.</v>

155
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.330
<v 0>Yeah. Insanely disturbing that you're watching a videotape of slave</v>

156
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:12.180
auctions in 2018.

157
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.180
<v 1>Well, it's more than disturbing it's revival of what was going on, uh,</v>

158
00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:21.980
when slavery was legal. So in other words, um, okay. Where the,

159
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.670
where the Somalis are involved up to the, to the, uh,

160
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.810
Libyan border is one story. That's the story I've covered. Um,

161
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.210
what happens in Libya is a different story,

162
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.290
the clans and the routes that migrants take through Libya,

163
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.500
the clans they put themselves in the hands of, um,

164
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.360
are still the same as the cleanse and the routes that we used during the slave

165
00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:49.040
trade. Um, so there's a S there's almost like a, you know,

166
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:51.200
there's a, there's a historical memory there of what,

167
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.670
what went on and it's the same thing happening. Um, so,

168
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.500
so I th I suspect a lot of migrants don't quite know how bad it can get. Uh, um,

169
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.390
the route up until Libya is probably easier

170
00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:09.740
than Libya itself. Olivia itself sounds like a horror show for the migrants.

171
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.700
Yeah.

172
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.820
<v 0>Well, it's particularly, it's one of those bizarre things.</v>

173
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:17.840
We have a horrible dictator, like [inaudible] and you say, well,

174
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.620
it's probably a good thing to get rid of that guy. Right. But no,

175
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.290
when you get rid of him, then you have this power vacuum,

176
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.800
and apparently it's a failed state now, and it's gotten even worse. Yeah.

177
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.800
<v 1>It's, um, it's going in the direction of Somalia right now.</v>

178
00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:33.800
And there a couple of rival governments. I think it's a little bit more stable,

179
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.120
uh, than that Somalia was after their dictator fell. But, um, it's,

180
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.900
there's similar. There's a similar thing going on. Um,

181
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.220
I it's true. Uh, Gadhafi was a bad guy and,

182
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.310
but he was also a bulwark and he knew that,

183
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:52.970
and he used that to his advantage with a bulwark against,

184
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.260
against migration pals.

185
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.250
<v 0>I've never heard that expression. Oh yeah. Bulwark a bulwark. No.</v>

186
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.970
What does that mean? A roadblock. Oh, okay. Um,

187
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.380
when you were there,

188
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.090
when you decided to take 10 days and you'd done all this research,

189
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.290
what, what did you expect when you went there and what was different?

190
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.730
<v 1>Well, so we, we were careful about finding security. We found, um,</v>

191
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.410
a Somali elder in Berlin who could offer the protection of his

192
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:26.150
clan in Somalia. And he had done it with another, uh, journal journalist,

193
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:29.780
a German journalist. And he took us out from Galkayo,

194
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.650
which is a town in central Somalia out to the coast, uh, to hobo,

195
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.940
which is a pirate town. You might've heard of pirate town, actual pirate town.

196
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.220
Yeah. So it's all pirates. Well, it's in, it's in the control of,

197
00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:44.030
of pirates. So in other words, the,

198
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.680
the government that sits in Galkayo has no influence there.

199
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.410
Uh, the pirates are the ones with who, who can have the say, so.

200
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.920
<v 0>What is their business like? I mean, when you say it's like a pirate town,</v>

201
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:59.290
so the pirates are essentially in control, but like,

202
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.300
what else is going on there? If you've got pirates and goals? No, normal.

203
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.990
<v 1>Somali life is going on there. But, uh, the, the, you know,</v>

204
00:12:06.991 --> 00:12:07.980
let's say the police force.

205
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.800
<v 3>Would be pirates. Whoa. Yeah.</v>

206
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.450
<v 1>I mean, when we got there,</v>

207
00:12:12.451 --> 00:12:17.130
it was pretty quiet and we didn't see much normal life. And we had a, um,

208
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.270
a very organized interview and lunch, um,

209
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.440
one afternoon with, uh, with a guy who turned out to be a real pirate,

210
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.870
you know, that wasn't a joke. And then we, we left around sundown and,

211
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.030
and that was it. We didn't spend a whole lot of time in hopium.

212
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.250
<v 0>When you were there and you, uh, well,</v>

213
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:42.530
you eventually got captured and taken hostage. What,

214
00:12:42.531 --> 00:12:44.130
what was the initial experience like?

215
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.600
<v 1>Well, so when that happened with the, with the technical,</v>

216
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:52.800
with the truck at first, my mind actually recoiled from what was going on.

217
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.490
I mean, I actually was in denial for a couple of seconds. I thought, okay,

218
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.780
just a roadblock. Um, but once they captured me, I thought,

219
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.330
know, this is going to be really hard on my family.

220
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.813
<v 3>Jesus.</v>

221
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.110
<v 1>And they, they, they beat me with their guns. They broke my wrist,</v>

222
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.490
they blinded my, my scout, uh, and they broke my glasses.

223
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.180
So that's the other thing I noticed right away was that I'm going to be blind.

224
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.150
<v 0>How bad are your odds? I'm near-sighted.</v>

225
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.920
<v 1>It's not, not, not good.</v>

226
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.000
<v 0>And this is like initial, like right.</v>

227
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.500
<v 1>Away. Yeah. Oh yeah. It happened in that first skirmish. Yeah. So your,</v>

228
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:33.240
your wrist was broken right away. Yeah,

229
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.310
because I was trying to hold the car door closed and they,

230
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.740
they pounded on it with her gun barrels.

231
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.303
Wow.

232
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.130
<v 0>And, uh, is it hard to talk about this?</v>

233
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.640
<v 1>Uh, no, because now I've written the book.</v>

234
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.740
I wouldn't have been able to do this before writing the book,

235
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.610
but writing the book, familiarized myself with my own memories, you know,

236
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:55.170
it made me fluent with this it's material.

237
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.190
<v 0>But your physical state seems to shift when you discuss it, like, oh,</v>

238
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.410
maybe your, your, your shoulders have risen. You're like,

239
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.670
yeah. I mean.

240
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.850
<v 1>It's a question of, you know, it's, it's not pleasant.</v>

241
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.900
<v 0>I couldn't imagine. Yeah. I mean, it must've been just insane.</v>

242
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.750
Um, so you said there was a long period of time before your, your,

243
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.600
before they contacted anybody, who do they contact?

244
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.840
<v 1>Um, okay. So it was a week and they, I, so I had a grant,</v>

245
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.840
a reporting grant from the Pulitzer center on crisis reporting.

246
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.620
I should have called them. Uh, but I had all my notes stolen,

247
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.260
which means all my phone, phone numbers too.

248
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.850
And so when they finally brought me up to a bluff with a little cell phone

249
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.210
and said, call somebody, I said, well, bring me my notes.

250
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.900
I need to find the right phone number. I said, no, just call someone.

251
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.363
So I called my mom.

252
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.743
<v 3>Oh, Jesus.</v>

253
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.600
<v 1>Um, and, and that's what happened by that, by that time,</v>

254
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.520
the FBI had informed her had actually come to our door, um,

255
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.580
and briefed her a little on what to say on the phone. So, um,

256
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.470
she was ready for the phone call, you know,

257
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.940
she'd been sitting around for days wondering when she was going to hear from me.

258
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.590
Um, so, but that was also true about the Pulitzer center.

259
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.530
It was also true about my colleagues at Spiegel online in Berlin.

260
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.630
It was also true about my family in Germany.

261
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.610
Everyone had been briefed a little bit.

262
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.353
<v 3>Now.</v>

263
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.600
<v 0>Were they waiting for a specific reason? Why did they wait a whole week?</v>

264
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.790
<v 1>Delete you? It's a really good question.</v>

265
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.530
I kept asking for a phone call and I mean,

266
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.290
I was sitting there kind of in a panic too, you know?

267
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.580
And what were they saying to you during this week? You have a broken arm, right?

268
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:40.540
Right. So.

269
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.350
<v 0>You're, you're obviously you're in pain. You can't see. Yeah.</v>

270
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.280
<v 1>Yeah. I was in, uh, the first, first they took me to a Bush camp.</v>

271
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.330
Then they took me with a couple of other hostages to a prison house

272
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.590
and, uh, yeah, in my wrist, in a sling. And, um,

273
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.980
it just was, it was painful and it was, it was confusing.

274
00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:05.530
I really didn't know what was going on. And then slowly,

275
00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:08.080
they brought a doctor in to look at the wrist and then slowly,

276
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:11.560
they took us out into the Bush. And then finally they put me on the phone.

277
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.340
<v 0>So you, you got medical treatment for your wrist?</v>

278
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.380
<v 1>Sorry. Yeah. The guy said it was, it was probably a livestock doctor,</v>

279
00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:24.430
but the guy was, he was a very sympathetic old, older man. Um,

280
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.030
but he said your wrist is not broken and he put a splint on it. And that was it.

281
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.080
It was broken, not broken in half, you know,

282
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.770
but definitely I felt, I felt bones moving around in there. Yeah.

283
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.380
It's been re rearranged. It's been reshaped.

284
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.830
<v 0>Um, did you eventually get medical treatment.</v>

285
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.460
<v 1>When you get home before it? Oh yeah. When I got home to get surgery, no,</v>

286
00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:49.150
two years and eight months later, it was, it was okay. It's a of functioning,

287
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.300
but yeah, it's, it's set wrong, but it's a functioning risk.

288
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.440
An x-ray just so you can see how weird it looks. It didn't even bother. Wow.

289
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.750
<v 0>Now when you're there, um, once you get the initial phone call,</v>

290
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.360
what is, what is the process like after that? Are they there?

291
00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:06.610
Are they talking to you about what they want? Yeah.

292
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:10.570
<v 1>They said, okay, you have to demand $20 million from your mother. Well,</v>

293
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.440
I think I must have smoked or something. They said, it's not funny. I said, yes,

294
00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:17.650
actually it is. That's not a serious demand, you know? Um,

295
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.150
but that was their opening gambit.

296
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.270
<v 0>20 Million. Why, why specifically? 20 million?</v>

297
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.490
<v 1>Good question. They, the first two hostages I was held with,</v>

298
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.290
um, two Seychellois fishermen. Um, the ransom for them was also 20 million,

299
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:33.490
but that's 10 million each.

300
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.440
So maybe they were just doubling it for the American.

301
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.140
<v 0>There was a time where they told you that if people showed up for</v>

302
00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:42.850
you, that you were going to be killed.

303
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.100
<v 1>Oh, sure. They said that right away,</v>

304
00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:49.740
because by the time the phone call had happened, um, the, the raid,

305
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.870
uh, for Jessica Buchanan and politics that had already happened too. So,

306
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.760
um, they even mentioned that to me.

307
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.550
And of course I had no idea what they were talking about. I had no news,

308
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:04.470
you know? So, um, I mentioned it to my mother on the phone. I said,

309
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:05.910
they're talking about a rate. And they're saying,

310
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:08.850
if somebody else comes from me, I'm going to get shot dead. But you know,

311
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.640
those are already the terms of a kidnapping. Right. You know,

312
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:15.720
that was not a big change in my situation. Uh,

313
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.620
and my mom could tell me very little on the phone about, about the rescue,

314
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:23.790
but she had something positive in her voice. She said, oh yeah, the rescue.

315
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.960
And I thought that doesn't sound like the pirates of course told me the hostages

316
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.050
had been killed. Like that doesn't sound like it went bad,

317
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.140
but it was still another month and a half or something.

318
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:35.460
Before I found out the full story.

319
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.720
<v 3>Jesus two and a half years,</v>

320
00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:43.340
is that what two years and eight months, God, now.

321
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.370
<v 0>You ate with them. You got used to them.</v>

322
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.100
Did you almost become friends with them?

323
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.260
<v 1>Sure. I became friends with, you know, half friends with,</v>

324
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.200
with about half the pirate guard group that was with me at

325
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.110
that point. So I was held at a number of places.

326
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.910
They also placed me on a tuna ship.

327
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.410
I was placed on a ship hijacked by Somali pirates for about five months.

328
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.000
And I think I'm the only Western writer to know life on a ship like that

329
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.710
five months. Yeah. For the full spring and summer of 2012.

330
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:22.310
Wow. And then it was, it was after that, that I was held on land,

331
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.510
um, alone with the guards. And that's when I got to know the guards.

332
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.970
<v 0>You must've had this feeling like they're never going to find me,</v>

333
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.080
they're moving me around. They're putting me on a ship.

334
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.760
<v 1>That was a problem. Um, once the, especially when they put me on the ship, I,</v>

335
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.750
I felt like any, um,

336
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.190
progress the military had made.

337
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:44.450
I didn't and finding my location would have been completely reset. You know,

338
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:47.770
I was terribly depressed when they first put me on the ship. Oh.

339
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.510
<v 0>And you were there for five months.</v>

340
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.790
<v 1>Yeah. But once I was on the ship,</v>

341
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.060
I felt better because there were 28 other hostages,

342
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.900
the crew of the ship and they were great. Um, it was,

343
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.820
it's always better to have company when you're accounting.

344
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.110
<v 0>Yeah. So the, the other people that were running the ship when they captured it,</v>

345
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.100
they were there as well. Yeah.

346
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

347
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.440
And that was a crew of 28 guys from east Asia and Southeast

348
00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:15.440
Asia. Did they speak English? Only five of them.

349
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.670
So five of them were from the Philippines and we got along with them really

350
00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:23.990
good. Uh, everyone else we had to get to know somehow and,

351
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.480
and the ship, they couldn't speak to each other either because they had,

352
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.180
it was like a tower of Babel on the ship. Um,

353
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.400
and so they've developed their own pigeon,

354
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.040
which is what sailors have done for centuries. You know,

355
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.900
it was a pigeon mixture of English and Chinese and a few other words. Wow.

356
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.820
Yeah. That was fascinating. Yeah. I.

357
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.530
<v 0>Could imagine now, as a writer, you,</v>

358
00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:47.740
you had to be sort of like halfway torn. Like God, if I out of here,

359
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.670
what a story. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

360
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.950
<v 1>Uh, I knew I was, you know,</v>

361
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.200
living through interesting things and gathering good material, but, um,

362
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.010
after at least a year or so in captivity,

363
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:04.710
I stopped hoping that I was going to get out of life. I mean,

364
00:21:04.711 --> 00:21:08.550
things were going so badly as far as the negotiation was concerned that I

365
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:10.710
thought this is really, I'm really in deep.

366
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.110
<v 0>Now, is that standard for them to hold people for that long? Yeah. Uh.</v>

367
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.910
<v 1>Yes and no. Um,</v>

368
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.350
I think I was held longer than any westerner. Um,

369
00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:26.340
but the men on that ship didn't get out for an, a,

370
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.540
for a total of five years. Uh, just under five years they were held. Um,

371
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.050
but they did get out eventually they did get out in 2016. Wow.

372
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.720
And I was privileged enough to go to Nairobi and see them there.

373
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.340
I took them by surprise. Wow. So you flew out to meet them. Well,

374
00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:45.780
I was still living in Berlin and I was following the, the case very closely. Um,

375
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.230
and, uh, I helped raise the money, the,

376
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.160
the lawyers who were running it, um, so let me down there. Um,

377
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.920
and that was really nice and it was nice for the guys too,

378
00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:59.850
because they were obviously confused. There was nothing but very well-meaning,

379
00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:03.210
but completely anonymous people around them, you know? And then they were,

380
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.550
they kind of came out of the, um,

381
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.960
terminal in Nairobi and they were still obviously still sort of a little bit

382
00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:12.750
confused and that tapped one of them on the shoulder and he recognized me and it

383
00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:17.340
was pandemonium. Wow. There's a, it was wound up on a Reuters video.

384
00:22:17.341 --> 00:22:21.590
I think it's available now. How did you eventually get freed? Uh,

385
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.250
they, so my mom raised around some, um,

386
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.880
she raised it with help from family and friends and also some magazines.

387
00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:34.320
I'd worked for some institutions in the U S and Germany.

388
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.970
And, um, when she talked the pirates down,

389
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.780
um, to 1.6 million and I, I,

390
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.000
I got out for some reason at the very end,

391
00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:48.360
the pirates came down like precipitously. Um,

392
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.720
the very end after holding on for like,

393
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.080
I think they went down to four or 5 million or something like that.

394
00:22:55.081 --> 00:22:57.690
And then at the very end, that came down to what was on offer.

395
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.870
<v 0>No explanation.</v>

396
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.530
<v 1>Not really except that from my point of view, um,</v>

397
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.000
there were labor, there was a labor unrest stirring among the guards.

398
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.170
So in other words, the guards were sick and holding me. Um, and so I,

399
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.460
um, uh, one day towards the very end, but, um, you know,

400
00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:20.910
a few weeks before I got out, one of the guards actually said, Michael,

401
00:23:20.911 --> 00:23:25.380
we might go on strike. Do you need some help with that?

402
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.870
I can go on a hunger strike if you want. They're like slow, slow.
