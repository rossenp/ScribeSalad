I did see this. It's the Andrew CUO about rock and chop shop.

23
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.600
Quick story. When I was a boy, I would watch howdy duty.

24
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.640
One day I received a gift. It was a howdy duty dog.

25
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.000
It was my favorite toy to play with until the day I found something

26
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.320
more fun to play with my penis. Sit back, rock,

27
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.950

<v 2>Welcome to the show.</v>

31
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.790
We'll be getting to the controversy and my imminent arrest in a minute.

32
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.543
For somehow.

33
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.780
I have decided to ditch Mitch and go with a young hip side.

34
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.140
Kick the king of Staten island. Pete Davidson,

35
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.940
Pete what's happening? Uh, nothing, I guess.

36
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.560
Fascinating. &lt;laugh&gt; okay.

37
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.350
I have been accused of touching women's privates. Not true.

38
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.003
I'm Italian.

39
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.470
We talk with our hands and all that my hands was saying

40
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.230
was what time is it?

41
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.630
&lt;laugh&gt; and sometimes when you hear your family &lt;laugh&gt;.

42
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.543
<v 0>Makes sense,</v>

43
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.660
family. &lt;laugh&gt; I love it.

44
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.180
You gotta admit that's an all time. Excuse though.

45
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.820
It's a ridiculous thing to say. It's just, and the video did you, did he put up,

46
00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:00.040
did you see the video where you, I didn't see it. Oh, Cuomo. When he,

47
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.280
I think it was like at the press conference, he put up this video of him,

48
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.360
like touching all the people. He goes, I've touched men. I,

49
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.000
and there's a picture of him kissing a guy.

50
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.880
I touch that women I've touched powerful people.

51
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.840
He's holding bill Clinton's face as he's like kissing him on the cheek.

52
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.350
And it was like a really, it was interesting defense. If at the start I'm like,

53
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.950
let me see that. Can I see the video? You I'm talking about Jamie touch.

54
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.150
Everyone. Cuomo shows gallery of him kissing men. Women. Yeah. LGBTQ. What?

55
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.710
This like he was snitching on himself. Yeah. He's like,

56
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.470
he's like you think I touch people? Of course I touch.

57
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.270
And he just put all the different people he's touched,

58
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.070
but it looked kind of innocent. Look, oh, let's see this.

59
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.550
I let me gimme some volume.

60
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.260
He's narrating. Oh my God. Oh, we got three seconds. Two,

61
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.700
one S here.

62
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.520
<v 3>We go.</v>

63
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.900
Raised against me questions that have sought to unfairly

64
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.860
characterize and weaponize every day interactions that I've had with

65
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.330
any number of, of new Yorkers.

66
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.730
The New York times published a front page.

67
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.090
Picture of me touching a woman's face at a wedding

68
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.410
and then kissing her on the cheek.

69
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.650
That is not front page news.

70
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.160
I've been making the same jet in public all my life.

71
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.920
I actually learned that from my mother. That's her fault.

72
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.680
<v 0>And from my fault, tell your, I learned how to be a pervert from my mom.</v>

73
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.640
Very warm. It's a long line of perverts.

74
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.240
<v 3>Nothing more indeed. There are hundreds.</v>

75
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.510
If not thousands of photos of me using the exact same

76
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.590
gesture, I do it with everyone, black and white,

77
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.510
young and old,

78
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.430
straight, and LGBTQ powerful people.

79
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.710
Look at this. Look at.

80
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.820
<v 0>This Clinton,</v>

81
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.380
one nose to nose ES people who I meet.

82
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.540
<v 3>On, on the Street's after the event,</v>

83
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.900
the woman told the press that she took offense at the gesture.

84
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.380
And for that, I apologize.

85
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.650
Another woman stated that I, her on the forehead is our.

86
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.210
<v 0>Chris, let me hear that part.</v>

87
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.010
<v 3>Miss parti. And that I said, cha Bella.</v>

88
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.410
Now I don't remember doing it, but I'm sure that I did.

89
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.490
I do kiss people on the forehead. I do kiss people on the cheek.

90
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.920
I do kiss people on the hand. I do embrace people.

91
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.560
I do hug people, men and women.

92
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.720
I do on occasion say char Bella on

93
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.560
occasion. I do slip and say, sweetheart, people,

94
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.880
I do tell jokes some better than others.

95
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.080
I am the same person in public. As I am in private.

96
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.830
You have seen me do it on TV, through all my brief things.

97
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.710
And for 40 years before that, I try to put people at ease.

98
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.150
I try to make them smile.

99
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.390
I try to connect with them and I try to show my appreciation and

100
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:30.224
my friendship.

101
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.830
I now understand that there are generational or cult

102
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.540
perspectives that frankly, I hadn't fully appreciated.

103
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.300
And I have learned from this

104
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.700
now the state already has an advanced sexual harassment training

105
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:54.100
program for all employees, including me,

106
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.410
but I want New York state government to be a model of office behavior.

107
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.650
And I brought in an expert. Okay.

108
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.210
<v 0>So this is all before he resigned. Yes. That was the last ditch effort.</v>

109
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.090
Like we were supposed to see that and be like, you're okay. And,

110
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.530
but it's more than that, that he's accused of. No, the accusations are crazy,

111
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.290
right? The accusations that he was trying to like finger girls, right? Yeah.

112
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.320
The like that like cha Bella. Did someone get upset at that? Maybe?

113
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.400
I don't know. I think that's a little bit crazy. I mean,

114
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.320
he is like an older Italian guy, so there's gonna be a certain amount.

115
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.560
Why is that offensive? It means. Hello. Beautiful. Yeah. Why is that offensive?

116
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.840
I guess. I don't know. Or goodbye. Beautiful. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.280
Yeah. So you're Italian. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

118
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.430
how do you like resist touching? Yeah. Like how,

119
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.230
how does that Italian is not come out? Like,

120
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.910
I don't know when you're around ti I have a little bit of Irish in me. Oh,

121
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:48.590
that's what it is. Standoff. You just go like this,

122
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.070
see 5% standoff in me. I don't, you know, but yeah. He's being an old guy.

123
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:56.630
He's, what is he? 70 years old? I don't wanna offend.

124
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.180
It was just that that'd be fine. That is, I think there's some theory. Yeah.

125
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.100
And you know, maybe he was trying to hit on girl.

126
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:03.380
He was trying to get his Dick wet a little bit.

127
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.180
And do you know the whole story with the lady who was she's the attorney

128
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:10.460
general, right? The one who prosecuted this James is her name. Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:10.821
Do you know?

130
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:15.780
She was in another party and he made her denounce her party in order

131
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:20.250
to come over to work for him. And then she immediately went after. Whoa.

132
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.210
Uh, is that yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. It's heavy.

133
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.930
So he's got like a history of making women do things they don't wanna do. Well,

134
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.730
I don't know if he made, you know, I think it's a political thing.

135
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.730
You probably do a guy too. Bus and balls, but YESS it's um, yeah.

136
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:39.370
It's just so interesting. I don't know. Cause you see that you're like, yeah,

137
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:42.200
this is how old were like old people are way more tactile. Yes.

138
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.240
At least like Mediterranean folks. Yeah. They were very touchy. That's fine.

139
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.880
And I don't think that's and I think that's a lot of like the Biden thing. Like,

140
00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:50.120
you know, like the Biden sniffing kid. I don't like that.

141
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.400
You wouldn't let him sniff your kid. That bothers me.

142
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.200
I'd let 'em sniff my kid really a hundred percent. There's not kids.

143
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.400
Once you have kids. You're like, why are you sniffing my kid? Your,

144
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.000
your father instincts would kick in. Let me think. Plus I,

145
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.080
I don't think you'd remember if it's a kid or not.

146
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.720
I think he'd be confused just in the moment he's like is like a,

147
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.960
a smaller person. That's it? Yeah. I just sniff and mid did.

148
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.630
That's that's one of my favorite were past times, dude.

149
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.270
I'm a midget sniffer dude. I, if I see a Midge, I gotta smell them. Dude.

150
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.590
They smell so delicious. I just don't think like, I think that thing is,

151
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.270
is way bigger. A deal than it needs to be the sniffing. Yeah.

152
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:30.910
Like the cognitive ability is to thing that scares me, not sniffing kids. Right.

153
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.350
Just keep the kids away from 'em.

154
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.300
I think the sniffing kids in public is part of the cognitive decline.

155
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.620
Like he doesn't recognize that people don't like that,

156
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.740
but you don't think it's just him being 200. Look at him. Well, these kids, he,

157
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.220
oh, that one on the side is up at the bottom. Right? I mean,

158
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.140
it looks like he's pulling. Yeah. They're all up. Yeah.

159
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:51.100
That one she's really uncomfortable. She away from him. Yeah.

160
00:09:51.101 --> 00:09:54.220
They're distorting their facial expressions. Yeah. It's very strange.

161
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.420
But why would they smell like that?

162
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.210
Like why would they come in smelling like that, Joe? That's why?

163
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.250
Why would they wear perfume that day? Why it's smell so good?

164
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.570
Why would they do that? They wanna be sniffed. Am I victim blamer? Maybe. Holy,

165
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.930
dude. Maybe, but just for sniffing, it's like, it's the worst. I mean, if,

166
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.650
if that's the worst thing that happens to you, you get sniffed. Yeah.

167
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:14.850
Like you can get over a sniff. Yeah. You know, it should.

168
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.743
And I think it's an older,

169
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.280
I think the Cuomo stuff that was messed up is probably he was trying to finger

170
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:23.120
these girls or gravitate or just being a real like scumbag. And um,

171
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.640
I'm just not surprised like anybody like that wants to be in a position of

172
00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:29.800
power. Yeah. Uses their power.

173
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.040
