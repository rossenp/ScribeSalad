00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 4>Definitely before four. Okay. I gotta go over my notes and.</v>

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.880
<v 0>Hell, I'm so excited to see you guys. I'm like,</v>

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.200
it's this other stuff is just extra, you know,

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.560
like I was ready to just hang out and come to your show tonight.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.670
Cuz I haven't seen you perform and like at least over a year.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.310
<v 1>Really a year and a half at the store.</v>

8
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:27.070
Was that the last time mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah, kind of missed that place.

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.710
Ugh. So.

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.590
<v 0>What what's happening with.</v>

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.630
<v 1>It? Nothing. Cause they can't,</v>

12
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:35.510
they can't even have a outside bar anymore really? Cause they,

13
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.710
they had like an outside bar and everything. They shut that down.

14
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.670
That would've been perfect.

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.540
They have the outside are going on for a while and then they,

16
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.780
they wouldn't let 'em do outside shows like there's just so much horse.

17
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.620
<v 0>That's such a bummer because they actually could have had small shows there.</v>

18
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.740
<v 1>What are you got there? What is that? That's KPO. What is KPO?</v>

19
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.060
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; Jamie, you wanna take this one? Um.</v>

20
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.330
<v 2>It changes the bass notes of the guitar.</v>

21
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.980
<v 1>The bass.</v>

22
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.550
<v 0>Notes.</v>

23
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.450
So well changes all the it's it basically like raises you can raise

24
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.930
the key. You can like.

25
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.710
<v 1>Not raise the key.</v>

26
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.650
So the sound from the microphone is registering on that. No,

27
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.050
no that bar Nope.

28
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.920
Well how's it's it's for her sound from her mic.

29
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.080
Oh the sound from her guitar is registering on the microphone.

30
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.320
She was doing that for tuning. Yeah. That's what I'm asking. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

31
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.154
Sorry that.

32
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.960
<v 2>Cap on the.</v>

33
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.880
<v 1>Neck is what we were talking about. No, that's not what we're talking about. Oh,</v>

34
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:36.200
you were talking about this. I'm talking about the app. Oh yeah. How's a tuner.

35
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.760
Yeah. How's that work? So it's registering, it's seeing the,

36
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.670
it's hearing the sound from the microphone. It's registering on that,

37
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.750
that meter. Yeah. And it's showing you exactly where each string should be.

38
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.310
Is that what it is? Oh yeah.

39
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.150
<v 0>You know, I just saw this new app.</v>

40
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.710
<v 1>That's so that's not a KPO. No, I, I would've got looking for the KPO app.</v>

41
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.790
I thought you I'm looking for a KPO. What are you talking about?

42
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:57.624
There's this new.

43
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.830
<v 0>My friend told me about it's called decal meter and it measures the frequencies.</v>

44
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.420
<v 1>Whether or not you're gonna go deaf like last night show. Yeah. But I.</v>

45
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.500
<v 0>This is where I wanna like, like if I had the no, if,</v>

46
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:15.740
if I had the wherewithal to have brought this out,

47
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:18.740
when I was visited by aliens the other day &lt;laugh&gt;.

48
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.780
<v 1>And realized like your negative numbers.</v>

49
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.890
<v 0>What frequency is that? I mean, not like I could have actually seen.</v>

50
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.690
<v 2>My phone just for that's what it's doing. It's tuning it to the.</v>

51
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.490
<v 1>Exact frequency that okay. Oh interesting.</v>

52
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.530
So each string has a very specific frequency mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; oh.

53
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.050
And a lot of times people just do it by ear, right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

54
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.370
<v 0>You just kinda so it, no,</v>

55
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:43.450
I wouldn't say a lot of times it's if you have perfect pitch, my,

56
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.360
my friend has perfect pitch. He's like, I can tell you,

57
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.240
I can't tell you the name of the, of the note,

58
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.240
but I could tell you if it's sharp or flat and when it's perfect. And he does,

59
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.440
it's crazy. It's so crazy. I don't.

60
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.760
<v 1>Have, that's just a rare of.</v>

61
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.240
<v 0>Ability. I think you can. Well, they say we're all born with perfect pitch.</v>

62
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.320
They say all babies are born with perfect pitch and it's just something you lose.

63
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.441
<v 2>Apparently.</v>

64
00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:10.320
But I think sometimes it's just naturally there and then other times you can

65
00:03:10.321 --> 00:03:15.040
like cultivate it. Jamie Fox notably has perfect pitch. I believe that.

66
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.000
That's why you can recreate people's voices. So, well.

67
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.510
<v 0>I believe the, that makes sense. Thanks.</v>

68
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.310
Feel like my pitch has been changing since I haven't been singing that much,

69
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.990
but we'll see &lt;laugh&gt; but I, okay.

70
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.710
So yeah, this tune is like,

71
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.270
I haven't really written anything like this and it's um,

72
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.190
yeah, it it's kind of like has to do with everything we've been talking about.

73
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.660
Just a summary pretty much. Okay.

74
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.580
All right. It's called. Save for love.

75
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.250
<v 3>Like that pie. Make it burn red. Make it here.</v>

76
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.770
Like the storm that's at your window.

77
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.250
Fill up those lungs, honey.

78
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.690
It won't be long for the moments gone in your dealing with your

79
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.770
sorrow. Take what you can get

80
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.840
all of your blessings.

81
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.120
Cause that hurricane ahead might be never.

82
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.760
And then reigning. Hell

83
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.240
no, one's going sleep through this one. There ain't no

84
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.070
it's gonna hold it all.

85
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.930
Then those busted bridges. Hold yourself accountable.

86
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.530
Give that soul deep within your voice.

87
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.610
Like parable and make room full the hateful.

88
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.050
See don't match your table.

89
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.210
Give them bread for their broken hearts and kindness. If you are able,

90
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.160
cause ready, need help.

91
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.320
No, one's gonna sleep through this one there. Ain.

92
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.600
No, no

93
00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.320
it's gonna hold it all.

94
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.790
When there's to carry, don't be angry that it's heavy, honey.

95
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.860
You know you alone.

96
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.060
There's arms here at the ready to help you bear the load.

97
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.660
No it ain't on one way road.

98
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.500
We gotta do this thing together and grow

99
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.860
its rain. Hell

100
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.810
no, one's gonna sleep through this one. There ain't no,

101
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.170
no walls. It's gonna hold it all the

102
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.273
say

103
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.550
it's beautiful. Thanks. &lt;laugh&gt; Hey, thanks man.

104
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.350
&lt;laugh&gt; it's probably one of the

105
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.260
truer hippier ones I've written, but I it's like it took me a minute. It.
