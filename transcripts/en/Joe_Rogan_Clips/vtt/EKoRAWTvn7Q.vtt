00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.880
Where was the situation that was happening during the Obama,

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.760
the Obama administration,

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.800
where they were trying to put a pipeline through and they were hosing people

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.080
down and right.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.480
It was on private land and they were going through private land and people were

7
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:19.000
protesting it, but they were, they were forcing it through anyway, where was.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.230
<v 1>That? That was standing rock in, in, in North Dakota. And, um,</v>

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
um, that's still going on today. In fact, I think this week,

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.950
is that a hearing that, well, it, the Fort Laramie treaty I think is,

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.390
is affected by that. So, um, uh,

12
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:38.870
there are some land right issues there, but we're,

13
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:43.180
we're talking about burials and sacred is, uh, not to mention, uh,

14
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:48.180
water quality, uh, and the tribes, um, Obama stopped it,

15
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:52.540
but as soon as Trump got into office, he, he, um, he,

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.980
he pushed it forward. Um, and,

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.460
and did not consult with tribes and it's been a fight ever since same thing

18
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.320
happened with, but Obama.

19
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.930
<v 0>Was going through it and then they put,</v>

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.530
they put a stop to it right before he left office. Right, right, right. I mean,

21
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:11.490
I watch, I just I'm so cynical. I wonder how much of that is horses.

22
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.530
How much of that is, well, what a stop to it? Eh, you know,

23
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.610
just let you know it's going through, don't worry boys.

24
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.610
<v 1>Well, you know, the Obama administration was probably one of the more favorable</v>

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.320
administrations to Indian country. Um, uh,

26
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.160
there were many presidents that had never even gone to a reservation,

27
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.520
like the majority of presidents and he did, uh, and he did actually,

28
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:38.640
he was adopted into the Croation, I think. Um, so he,

29
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.680
he's an adopted tribal member. That's.

30
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.270
<v 0>Pretty cool. Do you think he's visit? It had since then? I.</v>

31
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.190
<v 1>Don't know, but that's, but, but that, that administration really did, uh,</v>

32
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.870
a, a lot of work in Indian country that had never been done before.

33
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.990
And they actually, uh,

34
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.510
were looking to tribes and building a government to government relationship

35
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.420
that, uh, no one had ever really, uh, done as well. Uh,

36
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.580
every year they would,

37
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.140
he hold a big tribal consultation in DC where tribal leaders would come from

38
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:14.380
everywhere, um, and consult with, um,

39
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.540
Obama and his administration. Uh, it was, uh, uh,

40
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.580
really unprecedented. And, um, it was,

41
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.690
it was a really happy time. And as soon as Trump got into office, uh,

42
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.530
the doors closed, the doors closed. So even though, um,

43
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.130
he appointed, um, uh, assistant secretary for Indian affairs,

44
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.090
a Tara Sweeney, who's Alaska native, um, that, uh,

45
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:47.640
administration in the department of interior and, uh, uh,

46
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.680
under the president has just been so closed.

47
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.200
It's been hard to get anything done or to get heard,

48
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.880
or even actually have that government to government relationship anymore. Um,

49
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.800
uh, we've been left out of a lot of the decision making process that's going on,

50
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.960
uh, all over Indian country.

51
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.480
<v 0>Uh, well, that's a, it's a very good thing to hear about Obama that he did that.</v>

52
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.440
It's sad to hear that the Trump administration has abandoned that, but mm-hmm,

53
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.080
&lt;affirmative&gt;, it's nice to hear that someone was making an attempt to do that.

54
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.830
Um, so what I'm getting is that there really is no,

55
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.390
no long term solution. There's no solution. You're saying that the,

56
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.270
I think there's a lot of.

57
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.830
<v 1>Solutions with, I think there's a lot of solutions and a lot of moving parts.</v>

58
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.550
And I think, I think, you know, um, uh,

59
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.860
Indian nations need to determine for themselves how best to handle the problems

60
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:47.700
within their communities, but outward facing, um,

61
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.860
to have a strong government to government relationship that takes

62
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.660
into account not just takes into account, but actually, um,

63
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.580
requires the, um,

64
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.290
prior and consent of those tribal nations before affecting their

65
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.050
rights or, um, uh,

66
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.410
or at least some diplomacy or negotiation, uh,

67
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.370
with varying interest before decisions are made. I, I think that's,

68
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:17.650
that's the heart of, of, of what needs to happen outward facing.

69
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.200
And also we need to take a look at, at our curriculum in schools.

70
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.960
We really need to, um, most of our CU all of our curriculum in,

71
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.000
in public schools is about looking at native American pre pre 1900.

72
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.880
So, um, uh,

73
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.840
and not caring that into today and who contemporary native

74
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.790
American tribe are and what they're doing to help their people. And,

75
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.150
and what's so wonderful about, um,

76
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.670
Indian country today is that, uh, though there have,

77
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.270
there are some places that are still,

78
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.310
there are some anti-Indian hate groups out there that fight tooth and

79
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:05.060
nail against anything, a tribe in their area tries to do to, um,

80
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.020
uh, develop economically. There are other communities where, um,

81
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.260
tribes have been able to, uh, bring in economic development,

82
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.820
whether that's through gaming or otherwise. And by the way, um,

83
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.060
Indian gaming is like no other type of corporate gaming.

84
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.130
And I think a lot of people don't understand this.

85
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.370
So if you're a gambler go to Indian casinos,

86
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.010
cuz that money goes towards Indian nation governance.

87
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.290
It's not like a private business. It is, um,

88
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.090
legislated that, that money, uh,

89
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.970
from those casinos go back into Indian nation governance

90
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.280
and are used for jobs and employment and social services

91
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.200
and all of that relieves the state and other government agencies from,

92
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.280
from having that, um, that responsibility. So are those.

93
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.400
<v 0>The success stories of modern, those.</v>

94
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.360
<v 1>Are the success stories. I mean, if you look at so Oklahoma, uh,</v>

95
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.760
the state of Oklahoma is fighting, um, Indian nations in,

96
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.840
in Oklahoma, um, about gaming,

97
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.280
trying to get more money outta gaming, but the,

98
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.190
that Oklahoma tribes have brought in, um,

99
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.590
uh, tons of money, a hundred thousand, uh, jobs have been created,

100
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.310
um, in, in casino and other economic development. Um.

101
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.230
<v 0>So who's fighting it.</v>

102
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.510
<v 1>And why, um, the governor is fighting it, governor, governor did,</v>

103
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.340
I think is his name. And, uh,

104
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.860
he's trying to rego renegotiate gaming compacts in

105
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:45.860
order to bring more money into the state.

106
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.540
So essentially trying to tax, um, that, uh,

107
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.420
for state purposes.

108
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.100
<v 0>Even though it's on native land. Right.</v>

109
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.303
<v 1>Right.</v>

110
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.330
<v 0>Interesting. So it's almost in,</v>

111
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.010
in a way another attempt at violating a treaty. Absolutely.

112
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.890
So denying the sovereign nation, right.

113
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.450
<v 1>Well, in the Indian gaming regulatory act, which was passed,</v>

114
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.490
there's so much federal legislation, it's insane of federal Indian law. I mean,

115
00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:18.960
it has its own 25 USC, this huge code of, of,

116
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.560
of stuff, man. Uh, but the Indian gaming regulatory act,

117
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.000
uh, was passed because Indians were finding success,

118
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.560
doing gaming in states were getting off, um,

119
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.000
because they were doing it without any interference,

120
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.110
which is their inherent sovereignty to do so. That's hilarious.

121
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.670
So this, so this, this act came, which was kind of a compromise where,

122
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.750
where tribes can do, what's called class two gaming,

123
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.950
which is based on bingo and, and there's electronic bingo games, um,

124
00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:55.230
that are kind of like slot machines. Um,

125
00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.180
so tribes can do class two gaming without any parents with state,

126
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.140
but if they do class three gaming that's card games and other types, um,

127
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.740
then the state, um, uh,

128
00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:11.780
they have to work with the state in order to develop some kind of compact and,

129
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.420
and revenue sharing, uh, for class three gaming. So the state,

130
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.380
the federal government, again,

131
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.770
allowed state to interfere with that inherent tribal, uh,

132
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.290
sovereignty to regulate their own economic development.

133
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.890
<v 0>Yeah. That's an issue with all, uh, of these native American casinos, isn't it,</v>

134
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:31.770
they don't get the full Vegas treatment.

135
00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:33.850
They can't have all the games that Vegas can have.

136
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.090
<v 1>Uh, they can, that's the class three gaming, but.</v>

137
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.050
<v 0>They have to do it through the state. Right.</v>

138
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.200
So versus through their sovereign government, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

139
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.040
it's so strange, right.

140
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.800
It's like for in under one hand they get no help at all.

141
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.360
And then when something comes along that allows them to economically thrive.

142
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.120
Then the government's like, hold on, where's our.

143
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.680
<v 1>Piece. So why do you think this is so, um, so much because they can,</v>

144
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.920
and, and so much legislation looks at tribes as if they're inferior.

145
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.040
Yes. So back again to those watershed cases of, of justice Marshall. Yeah. Um.

146
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.320
<v 0>They're inferior, um, even, uh, uh,</v>

147
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.230
being able to assert D over non-Indians who come into

148
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.270
our territory and do something wrong. Um, we can't right.

149
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.990
Can't so if someone breaks the law in a, in a native American reservation,

150
00:09:25.991 --> 00:09:26.431
mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

151
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:30.510
they're under the federal government's guidelines or the state government's

152
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.373
laws.

153
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.660
<v 1>Uh, uh, the tribe does not have criminal ju over non Indians within.</v>

154
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.020
So.

155
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.260
<v 0>If someone comes in and robs a casino, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

156
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.820
then the state has to take.

157
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.980
<v 1>Care of it. Right. State or the federal government,</v>

158
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:44.420
depending on what type of crime.

159
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.500
<v 0>Ideally, would it be that the native Americans would take care of it?</v>

160
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.380
<v 1>Yeah. Why not?</v>
