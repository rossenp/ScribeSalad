1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's just nuts, how much money is involved in it,</v>

2
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:07.080
and how many people look away. You know,

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.600
people are trying to stop different flavored tobacco smoke.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.160
I see you're a vapor. Well.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.920
<v 1>That, that I actually looked into that very, very deeply. This, this was the,</v>

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.280
the tobacco industry had a problem. The problem was this. I,

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.910
I kicked the cigarettes with this, cuz it's just, you know,

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.710
you can have nicotine in it or not, but you know, it's not. And.

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.470
<v 0>If you had any health consequences from using that thing, zero,</v>

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.310
keep hearing about people getting lung issues and well.

11
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.670
<v 1>Okay. So a couple things happened, the lung issues, and I don't know who,</v>

12
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.110
you know, personally, but there was a, I don't know, anybody personally,

13
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:42.340
there was a scare and the scare killed a couple of people like 10 people.

14
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.980
And what it turned out was that was people who had vaped, uh,

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.060
THC cartridges and some cause you know, the people who put the,

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.580
you buy your THC, uh, cartridges from a dispensary here,

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.780
it's actually packaged by somebody else, not by that person. So you have,

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.380
you know, king world or whatever these different, you know,

19
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:03.570
that's kind of a reput brand, but it's packaged somewhere else.

20
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.970
That means putting it, you know,

21
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.530
putting the stuff in and they put in some vitamin E acetate.

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.530
And that just kinda like created a, a, we, you know,

23
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:15.290
heat that up and became a web of some inside your lung and you up.

24
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.370
So that's a bad thing, but had nothing to do with vaping,

25
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.090
nicotine with the,

26
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:24.280
with the typical chemicals that you get from reputable companies to do.

27
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.480
<v 0>That. Can I ask this is the, the,</v>

28
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.560
the vaping from marijuana with their processes more problematic than, uh,

29
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:31.440
vaping of tobacco?

30
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.840
<v 1>Well, it cer certainly was in that case because in that case,</v>

31
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:37.600
because someone changed the formula, then you need to have some,

32
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.840
some oil in there in order to keep it, you know, liquid and for it to, you know,

33
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.350
just for, or to be able to go into the vape and not.

34
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.350
<v 0>So the issue was actually the vitamin E oil. Yes. Yes.</v>

35
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.430
<v 1>And so, and so that stopped of course,</v>

36
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.950
somewhere someone did something and that happened.

37
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.750
<v 0>You know, a really high guy actually said this to me once he, uh, he,</v>

38
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.110
he told me that he uses organic MCT oil for his, uh, his vapes. And he was like,

39
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.500
can his vape? I'm like, bro, I'm not sucking on your or vape.

40
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.620
I don't even know you. You could be a crazy person. You could be,

41
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:09.780
you could be DMT vapes, they have DMT vapes now. Ah,

42
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:12.820
that's somebody hands you a vape pen. You might be going into orbit.

43
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.140
<v 1>For 20 minutes. Yeah. For.</v>

44
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.820
<v 0>20 Minutes. What if you're driving? Oh.</v>

45
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.860
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;, you know, well, well I think, you know,</v>

46
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.450
I've flown a helicopter high on DMT. No, no. On, uh, weed. Oh,

47
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.530
that's a different animal. Yeah. With an instructor, you know,

48
00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:29.530
he wanted to see how I did it and it was perfect anyway.

49
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.130
<v 0>Yeah. I play pool, which is a very sensitive thing. Like.</v>

50
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.170
<v 1>Not quite the same on death by helicopter it's, but, but you're.</v>

51
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.730
<v 0>Controlling the rotations of a ball. It's very delicate. Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.600
Like literally the amount of effort you put, if like you, if you good player,

53
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.920
the amount of effort they put really accurately depicts how many revolutions

54
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:51.200
of the Cub ball I'm sure. Yeah.

55
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.640
And after it's colliding with the object ball and you get more sensitive to that

56
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.400
when you're high. Yeah. Jujitsu's another one.

57
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.400
A lot of people do jujitsu high really. Yep. Interesting. It's.

58
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.881
<v 1>Really, really,</v>

59
00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:02.840
really common guys smoke out in the parking lot and then go roll.

60
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.960
It's really common. Well, that was, I,

61
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.640
I did the most perfect landing ever when I, when I, uh, probably super into it.

62
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.040
Oh. And it's very small input. The helicopter you've seen. It's very,

63
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:16.760
very small. Yeah. Um, anyway, so, uh, the,

64
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.790
the tobacco industry had a real you,

65
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.310
and that also comes back to the states because there's this master agreement

66
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.630
that was put in place decades ago,

67
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.110
that tobacco companies would pay a percentage of their sales to all states,

68
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.590
to, uh,

69
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:36.750
as a pre compensation for whatever up people get from smoking tobacco.

70
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.300
And all these states wrote big bonds against that money.

71
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.500
And so when the income from the tobacco companies was decreasing significantly

72
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:50.700
because of vaping, all of a sudden, the states are going, especially this one,

73
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.500
what the we have these bond, these bonds are gonna, you know, become, go bust.

74
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.180
That's you know, when you have your, your state bond go bust, you know,

75
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.330
real problem. It's financial issue, states and cities and everything go broke.

76
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.650
So everyone had an incentive to get rid of vaping, get people back on tobacco.

77
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.050
Um, so they, Tia bought Juul.

78
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.090
The, the vape, the vape that's I mean, this isn't, this is, you know, hardcore.

79
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.560
This is, you know, got a battery's all technical, you get the vape juice.

80
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.200
Juul is a prepackaged product. Kids were buying it like, like,

81
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.040
what is the benefit of that over a Juul? Uh,

82
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.000
you can control how much the draws see dudes that look like dragons.

83
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:34.880
They blow these gigantis and you can, you can put whatever you wanted it.

84
00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:37.440
Not just limited by what Juul wants to sell you. Yeah. Anyway,

85
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:41.070
back to the cause you like this story. Okay. So, so to states,

86
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.910
everyone's keyed up, they buy Juul for $18 billion. They buy it as a writeoff.

87
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.990
They want to get this company out of the market. Really.

88
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.710
Then they go to the FDA and they start all this about flavors, flavors, flavors,

89
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:57.870
flavors, you saw it everywhere. It was massive. It was a perfect storm.

90
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.700
We got 10 people dying from vaping, something completely unrelated,

91
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:06.700
but vaping e-cigarettes, he had an e-cigarette. He died. It was actually, yeah,

92
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:10.300
he vaped, but he vaped a bad T THC cartridges and, you know,

93
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:13.220
got a severe problem. So you know how the media plays that,

94
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:15.300
and it just kept on spinning spin. They're like, well,

95
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:16.620
we have to stop the children.

96
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.300
And the way you stop it is by taking away the flavors cuz children,

97
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.130
they want flavors. That's what the problem is that, ju over and,

98
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.330
and actually Tia who, you know, used to, they bought Philip Morris basically.

99
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:30.290
So it's the biggest tobacco company. They start,

100
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:33.610
they already wrote down half of it, right. Just taking the L on it.

101
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.730
They didn't want to get rid of it because in the wings,

102
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.610
they had their competing product,

103
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.400
which is I Q O S I quit ordinary smoking,

104
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.080
small eye capital QoS, and it heats tobacco.

105
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.080
So it's a, it looks like a vape pen. It has a, but it,

106
00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:55.760
it actually runs on tobacco and it doesn't burn it, it heats it up,

107
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.800
has whatever it, some kind of mechanism in the filter you inhale.

108
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.280
And it's almost their dream, which is the smokeless cigarette, very close to it.

109
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.480
But most importantly, it's not a nicotine, uh,

110
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.440
synthetic nicotine. It is tobacco product, which is their business.

111
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.280
And they got, they really ratcheted this up.

112
00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:20.190
So high that they got Trump in involved and Trump actually with Melania, they,

113
00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:22.350
they, they did a thing with, uh, Alex AAR,

114
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.070
the health and human services secretary. He said, um, uh, well,

115
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.910
you know, we, this vaping is very dangerous. Uh, we have a kid actually,

116
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.110
you know, was one of those moments where everyone loves to jump on Trump.

117
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.540
He said, Melania has a kid. You know, he forgot to say it was his,

118
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.500
whatever it was. And uh, now he's actually been overheard saying,

119
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.420
I wish I'd never gotten involved in that thing because he figured it out.

120
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.700
He figured out was a huge scam. The bill has been stopped,

121
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.460
but now they're still trying to push through, uh,

122
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.020
a bill that will help the tobacco companies even more by outlawing any type of

123
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:56.900
flavored, uh,

124
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.130
east cigarettes or juice liquid or what they just wanna get rid of.

125
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.570
<v 0>It. So it's really like who killed the electric car?</v>

126
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.570
<v 1>It's exactly that. And they just go look at it.</v>

127
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.490
Now I Q O S they're launching these new stories today that say,

128
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.530
oh my God, it's the saving grace. We have the new product.

129
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.930
We've all been waiting for right at the moment that vaping is gonna kill you.

130
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.160
It's hooking children because of flavors.

131
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.161
<v 0>So do you think they're,</v>

132
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.640
they're hiring people to write news stories and the news organizations are

133
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:28.040
picking up because they're being told to, they just do a press release.

134
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.560
<v 1>Just do a press release mate. Come on.</v>

135
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.600
It's so easy in the media to do a press release. And um, oh, by the way,

136
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.360
we're Al uh, so we're gonna buy, uh,

137
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.310
500 million advertising over the next five years.

138
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.830
Would you please run our story? Or, you know, you might wanna look at this,

139
00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:44.990
come on. It's tobacco.

140
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.790
<v 0>So do you think that they make a deal before they accept the press release to do</v>

141
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.910
advertising? Or do they wait a little bit, you know, it's.

142
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.670
<v 1>You don't even have to say anything. It's just the, yeah.</v>

143
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:56.820
<v 0>It's.</v>

144
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.630
<v 1>Implied. Why do you not hear everyone knows.</v>

145
00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:01.060
Why do you hear the discussion about, uh,

146
00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:05.500
over medication of children on television? Look at the number one advertiser,

147
00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:10.060
right? You, if you start talking, it it's just not discussed. You can't have.

148
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.300
<v 0>Because it is a controversial subject and it would be a good subject for</v>

149
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.540
television's contr.

150
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.780
A lot of people paying attention to it it's it would get a lot of ratings.

151
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.850
If you have a lot of stories about, over of children, people would be like,

152
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.730
what, what is going on? It would be something people would be interested in. Uh,

153
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.130
yeah. And yet they don't do it.

154
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.530
<v 1>Because the advertise, right. I mean, just look, look at your advertise.</v>

155
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.770
I have to turn off the sound these days,

156
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:38.370
