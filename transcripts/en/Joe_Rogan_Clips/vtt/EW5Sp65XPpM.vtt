1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
<v 0>About this there's some people don't want him to come back.</v>

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.690
Some people think they should, he be,

3
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:08.040
should be allowed to come back and he served time off. And, and then they,

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.860
the argument by a lot of women is yeah, but he hasn't said anything.

5
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:15.210
Like he had one on anything. Yeah. What is what, you know,

6
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:19.080
what shows that he's learned? Anything? Like what, what should you have to do?

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.190
<v 1>I don't know. I mean, Louis is very smart.</v>

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.700
I'm sure he'll if he wants to keep doing it after this reception,

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.240
he'll probably come out with some statement or do something. I don't know.

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.550
But the reality is, uh, what did he lose?

11
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.170
They took away networks took away his stuff. Just film distributors.

12
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.190
Weren't going to put out his film. Well, the film, but as a company from.

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.970
<v 0>By all accounts, the film was. Anybody has seen the film. I haven't seen it.</v>

14
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:49.400
Yeah. I have a few friends that saw it. They're like,

15
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:52.910
it's just so creepy and weird. Especially in light of like what he was doing.

16
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.350
Yeah. It's just like, no.

17
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.780
<v 1>But regardless whether it was good or not, I'm just saying,</v>

18
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.460
like the industry said, FX said, I'm taking this show from you. HBO said,

19
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.100
we're taking this stuff off Netflix and we're taking this off. Right.

20
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.920
<v 0>There's definitely, definitely lost money financially.</v>

21
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.930
<v 1>Sure. And those are entities that.</v>

22
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.110
<v 0>But is that punishment or is that them exercising their desire to not work with</v>

23
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:18.140
someone who's been accused of something that they don't want to be associated

24
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.380
with? Is that a punishment? I don't know. That seems to me that they're,

25
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.070
they're making a decision of who they work with and who they not work with.

26
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.510
Right. It affects him negatively, but it's not necessarily a punishment. Well,

27
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.373
there's.

28
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.320
<v 1>I don't know it. I think it would feel like a punishment. Sure.</v>

29
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.000
But my point is there's these entities that can prevent him from making a

30
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.600
living as a comedian though, he can walk into a garage.

31
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.100
And if he has fans, they're going to come see him. He has,

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.480
he has that under his control. Right? Yeah. Nobody can stop that.

33
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.460
Nobody. So he can do it. It's up to him whether he wants to, or not,

34
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.620
it's up to his fans, whether they show up or not.

35
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.730
And it's up to the people that hate what he did and really against him to not go.

36
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.770
<v 0>Right. Well, that's why this thing was weird.</v>

37
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:05.720
But like he just showed up at the cellar,

38
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.190
which is like his favorite place to go. And he just worked. And the.

39
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.960
<v 1>Audience like Kyle was saying, it's just,</v>

40
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.660
they're trapped in there and they can't get out. They,

41
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.900
they didn't have an option to say, I don't want it. It's really interesting.

42
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.180
<v 0>All the different spins though, all the different women's spins, you know?</v>

43
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.941
And w one,

44
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:27.260
one really bizarre spin that I saw was this woman was saying that this is

45
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:32.000
indicative of the problem of all comedy clubs and aggressive male audience

46
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.180
and women sitting there feeling threatened,

47
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.570
not being able to use their voice. I'm like user voice. Like,

48
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.940
what are you in the heck hall? They were saying like, you, like,

49
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:42.830
you would be more empowered if there were more women.

50
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:45.920
So you could heckle is that's not cool.

51
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.620
Like you're not supposed to do that at a comedy club. If you don't like,

52
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:52.160
someone just don't laugh, you know? But like,

53
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.820
but here's the thing. It's not your job.

54
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.950
Or it's not your place to say that you don't like someone when the other people

55
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:04.600
do like it. You know, if you're right. If you're to get up and walk out. Yeah.

56
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.330
Just like you're going to see a movie. Like you're an audience member, right?

57
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.400
The deal is you're not there to perform.

58
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.900
The audience is there to just sit there and laugh or not laugh. Right.

59
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.120
But don't be rude to the other people that are enjoying it.

60
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.500
So as soon as you break your sensibilities above the rest of the audience will,

61
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.770
you're a problem. Right. You've made, if you decide like, Hey,

62
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.450
I didn't like this. I'm going to go home and write about it.

63
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:26.770
That's totally abroad. That's.

64
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.930
<v 1>Fine. Get up and walk out or that's fine.</v>

65
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.780
<v 0>Go somewhere else and talk about it on stage yourself. Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.090
Nothing wrong with any of those things. But this,

67
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.540
this one woman's take was like, women don't feel like they have, uh, uh,

68
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.280
they can, they have the ability to speak out about it. I'm like speak out. Like,

69
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.160
so you're saying like to heckle, Hey, I don't want you on stage.

70
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.580
I know everything about you and your story.

71
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.840
And I want you to perform in front of me. Even those other people are laughing.

72
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.440
Right. And th th th that these aggressive men were yelling.

73
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.700
Good to see you back Louie aggressive men, like, well, okay.

74
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.730
That's like, there's a framing of this.

75
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.530
And this is one of it's becomes this male versus female framing that Louie sort

76
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.430
of represents aggressive men, sexual men, doing things to women.

77
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.130
They don't want, the women are sitting there in silence.

78
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:16.270
They don't want to be there.

79
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.500
And they don't have a voice because they feel overwhelmed and out overpopulated

80
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:22.270
or, uh, uh, outnumbered.

81
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.540
<v 1>Problem is those guys that, that Harvey and him and,</v>

82
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.730
uh, Matt Lauer and people like that,

83
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.140
they are the poster boys for that.

84
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.480
So they're going to be watched very closely. And.

85
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.640
<v 2>We're fitting to that. I get.</v>

86
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.560
<v 0>Confused by this one, by all accounts, Matt Lauer had affairs right.</v>

87
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.470
In the office with girls who worked with him.

88
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.820
So what was inappropriate that as he was having sex with his staff. Right.

89
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.331
<v 1>Right.</v>

90
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.360
But he was also hitting on people that didn't want to be hit on in his office.

91
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:58.800
Yeah. That was the accusations. Yeah. It wasn't just, he was dating them.

92
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.410
He was also, you know, making,

93
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.820
making weird advancements in the office. Yeah. Okay.

94
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.750
But I mean, all these guys, all these guys, you know,

95
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.850
they're all very complicated. They're all very fuzzy kind of things. But, uh,

96
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.910
you know, those guys are going to be watched very closely as you see,

97
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.720
Louie just goes to this little club and does a set and it's national news and

98
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.780
national debate. It's like, it's, it's, uh,

99
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.720
it's heady stuff.

100
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.880
<v 3>Teddy stuff. Yeah. What's.</v>

101
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.920
<v 0>Fascinating is that as a culture,</v>

102
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:36.660
we're going through this great time of change and this great time

103
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.640
of, uh, introspective thinking and of

104
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.310
observing our behavior and discussing our behavior and watching

105
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.150
this, like, you have the worst case. Examples of which my,

106
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.410
in my opinion is Cosby worst-case example, like drugging people. And yeah.

107
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.730
I mean, there's, there's a woman who was on television, on CNN.

108
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:00.110
She said something that freaked me out.

109
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.560
Once you said it is entirely possible that bill Cosby is the,

110
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.990
the most prolific serial rapist.

111
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.880
<v 3>In history. Jeez. And I heard that and I went, maybe she's right.</v>

112
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.530
Maybe she's right.

113
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.393
<v 0>Like how many,</v>

114
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.460
how many people does a regular rapist rate before they get caught? Yeah.

115
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.713
You know.

116
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.750
<v 1>Just, I mean, that's the number that came out against him.</v>

117
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:23.910
I'm sure there's other people that, yeah. Yeah. That's creepy. That's.

118
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.240
<v 0>Like far end of the spectrum. Right. And then on the other end of the spectrum,</v>

119
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.030
you got like Louie who's, um,

120
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.110
did something was definitely, you wouldn't want to happen to your wife.

121
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.550
<v 3>Now, your kids, your kids, but your friends. I don't know.</v>

122
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.780
<v 0>The whole story. You know, Kurt,</v>

123
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.760
Kurt Metzger was telling me that one of the girls who came out against him,

124
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:50.290
like they had been flirting like the whole weekend and talking about sex,

125
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:52.300
like the whole weekend. And then he did that.

126
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.260
And then he had sent the girl a text saying, I'm really sorry that I did that.

127
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:59.470
And she said, don't worry about it. Look, we were talking about sex all weekend.

128
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.810
And then when the accusations came out, obviously there's more accusations.

129
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.770
That seem to be more agregious she threw her hat into the mix as well. Right.

130
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.240
I don't know if that's true or not though.

131
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.360
The problem with a lot of these stories is you're hearing them third, fourth,

132
00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:17.560
fifth hand, you don't, you know, all you know is he said,

133
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.000
those stories are true.

134
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.320
And that he recognized that he did something wrong and he was going to take time

135
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:27.160
off. So that to me is not a guy defending himself. That's a guy saying, yeah,

136
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.620
I definitely up. I'm going to step back.

137
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.090
So he steps back for nine months or whatever it was. And people were saying,

138
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.470
that's not long enough. You didn't do anything like you gotta. So what,

139
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.460
what should someone do? Like in one of the things that Michael,

140
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:47.380
Ian black said on Twitter before they tore his Dick off and stuffed it in

141
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:48.214
his nose,

142
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.190
that was it crazy thing to watch because he's like super progressive,

143
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:56.650
very liberal. Yeah. And he was saying that, you know,

144
00:07:56.651 --> 00:08:01.570
like that me too has to offer men a road to redemption and you

145
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:03.490
know, and a lot of these women were saying, no,

146
00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:06.760
like every road to redemption begins with I'm sorry,

147
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.120
which is a very valid point, very valid point. Like you should,

148
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.410
you should have to say, I'm sorry. You know? And I think he's said, I'm sorry,

149
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.950
but I don't know what he said to the women. I don't know what he said.

150
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.920
I don't mean he had the one public statement. Did he say, I'm sorry.

151
00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:22.450
And that wide public statement and.

152
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.140
<v 1>Times article, it was like, kind of like a availed. I'm sorry. I think,</v>

153
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.870
I don't know. I don't know. You know,

154
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.360
I hesitate to comment on any of it because it's like his mess.

155
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.360
And like, if anyone that comments on it or it comes near it, or like the,

156
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.810
the owner of the comedy cellar, everyone's got to deal with the,

157
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:45.340
after the aftermath of what this guy did. It's like, why am I, you know,

158
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.320
as the, as the owner of the seller, it's like,

159
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.860
why is he have to get brought into Louise behavior?

160
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:56.010
<v 0>I saw at least a half a dozen articles written about what a piece of Che was</v>

161
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.080
for saying that he Louie deserves the opportunity to make a living. Right.

162
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.030
<v 3>Right. Going.</v>

163
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.820
<v 0>After Michael Che and his, and his useless opinion like, whoa,</v>

164
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.930
well, you know, but look,

165
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.010
it's there they're allowed their opinion that Michael Che's opinions useless.

166
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.430
I mean, this is one of the beautiful things about free expression. No.

167
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.870
<v 1>Completely. That's what, that's what I'm,</v>

168
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.110
that's where it's kind of the most interesting for me.

169
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.530
And I don't mean that I take pleasure in any of this cause it's horrible for

170
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.340
everyone involved. But, uh, it's interesting. Like I said,

171
00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:32.210
like there's companies that probably won't go back into business with him.

172
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.840
Right. But as a comedian, you know, he could put a show up in the park.

173
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.550
He could put a show up anywhere he wants.

174
00:09:37.551 --> 00:09:42.170
It's really up to him and people can protest it. They can not show up.

175
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.850
They could buy tickets by the thousands.

176
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.830
It's going to be interesting to see when he takes that part of

177
00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:52.040
his earning and that part of his life in his own hands,

178
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.290
you really can't stop him.

179
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.600
<v 0>Yeah. Um, in that way, uh it's it's like, it's how you frame it.</v>

180
00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:03.970
So I don't think, I don't think Louie's a bad guy at all. I think what Louis is,

181
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.300
is a pervert. And I think he's, you know, he's into,

182
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.130
I think part of it is like being naughty and doing something that's forbidden

183
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.180
and, you know,

184
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.740
in getting away with it and having these girls like him for being a

185
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.030
comedian and then doing that to them. I mean, this is just my speculation.

186
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.990
There's a lot of weirdness to it, but I don't think that he's like,

187
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.460
I'm an angry person and I don't think he's trying to be hurtful.

188
00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:35.750
I don't think any of that was, I think it was just terrible judgment,

189
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.060
everything. I mean, you can say a lot about it. That's up, but it's like,

190
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.850
what it is is not,

191
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.390
he's not like he's not trying to hurt people.

192
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.140
I think he's just weird, you know? I mean,

193
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.950
let's think about what it is he's asking. Can I jerk off in front of you? Right.

194
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.440
It's like, it's the whole, I mean, it's like, yeah.

195
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.520
When it comes to that kind of creepy is like the most

196
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.000
considerate way to approach it. Can I jerk off in front of you? I mean,

197
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.310
he's like literally asking.

198
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.163
<v 4>Adorable.</v>

199
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.000
<v 2>It's so up. I mean, it is a mess diminishing.</v>

200
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.060
<v 0>The effect that it would have on a woman who respects him and wants, you know,</v>

201
00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:19.910
she just thinks he's our friend. And next thing you know, he's got a Dick out.

202
00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:22.100
Like I get it. I'm not, that's not what I'm saying.

203
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.660
<v 1>It's a weird thing because you don't want, you, you,</v>

204
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.030
those women were obviously very hurt and there's degrees of like, oh,

205
00:11:29.031 --> 00:11:30.140
they texted this.

206
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:34.880
Or they said that to go out and do that to somebody in a powerful position and

207
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:38.900
come out and say it and know that you're going to get hate from the world.

208
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.030
They were in a place that they were hurt enough that they felt that they had to

209
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:45.830
say something and do something. Sure.

210
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.390
And you just want like on this personal level, you want them to be okay.

211
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.970
<v 0>Right. You want everybody to be okay. You want them to be okay.</v>

212
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.620
<v 1>Feel like they had justice and for coming out,</v>

213
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.500
being brave enough to come out and say something, you.

214
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.800
<v 0>Also want to protect people from that happening again. Right.</v>

215
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.760
And the only way, one of the only ways is like, you gotta kind of,

216
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.970
you know, this, there.

217
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.240
<v 1>Was, there was a, there's definitely a feeling, uh, you know,</v>

218
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.290
the comedy world is like separate and we're kind of like, you know,

219
00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:19.170
it's a crazy environment and nightclub kind of a thing.

220
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.490
And what you heard when these, once these women came out was, no,

221
00:12:23.491 --> 00:12:28.020
this is kind of inappropriate that girls women can

222
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.750
can't come into a club and just feel okay.

223
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:33.810
Like they have to field all this stuff and guys hitting on them all the time.

224
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.990
Like it kind of made you look at the scene and be like, all right,

225
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.260
maybe this scene could be cleaned up a little bit as well.

226
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:40.711
<v 0>Well,</v>

227
00:12:40.711 --> 00:12:45.570
it's like what I was saying about really a worst version of working out at a gay

228
00:12:45.571 --> 00:12:46.680
gym. It's like,

229
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.990
if you go to a gay gym and you see men Lear at you get that feeling that these

230
00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:54.030
guys wanna have sex with you and you definitely don't want to have sex with

231
00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:57.990
them. That is how women feel all the time. Yeah.

232
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.420
<v 1>And you're coming to the comedy store or wherever.</v>

233
00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:02.730
And you're trying to just start out as a comic and try,

234
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.830
that's such a big thing already.

235
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.700
And then you throw a whole nother layer on it that everyone's hitting on you

236
00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:12.550
from the doorman to the headliner. That's gotta be, uh,

237
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.340
a big thing. And it's like,

238
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.200
so I think that those women should feel good that it, it definitely,

239
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.880
they should, it made an impact.

240
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.340
They should know that they've been heard and that they,

241
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.300
they sh they shined a light on something that even people that were in it,

242
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.400
men that were in, it were unaware of, they were definitely heard.

243
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.600
<v 0>It's very difficult for people to consider really objective,</v>

244
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.280
consider other people's perspectives.

245
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.510
<v 3>Like really.</v>

246
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.230
<v 0>People consider it in a convenient way. Like, you know,</v>

247
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:45.870
like they know what they can get away with what they do.

248
00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:49.380
They really consider how the other person feels and things. And you know,

249
00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:52.890
and that's on both sides, hard, there's inconsiderate women,

250
00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:56.490
there's inconsiderate men. And then, you know, we, we both do it to each other.

251
00:13:56.491 --> 00:14:01.440
And then people develop bad traits and bad associations with the opposite sex.

252
00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:03.570
And it's a very common thing that people do.

253
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.370
But I think situations where the discussion is

254
00:14:08.371 --> 00:14:11.400
so emotionally charged,

255
00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:16.200
like this it's good for us. It's good for us. It, it allows the, this,

256
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.740
this public discourse, it allows this public discussion.

257
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.780
<v 3>Of it. Yeah. Yeah. And, and there hasn't.</v>

258
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.260
<v 1>Been like, you know, people that,</v>

259
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.880
that have gotten hurt by that have come out and said it like in our scene where

260
00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:32.940
they're like nice people and they've been attacked. It was very few,

261
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.830
but it was like, Hey, there's some big,

262
00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:38.640
important people in this scene and they're acting inappropriately. And then,

263
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.950
you know, you're right. I think it's good.

264
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.910
It's definitely woken up and moved it further. Right. I have a funny daughter.

265
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.810
I know you have a funny daughter who knows if they see our life and want to go

266
00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:49.351
pursue it,

267
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:53.060
you want them to be able to go to a club and not have to deal with a whole

268
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:57.320
nother it's enough when you're starting out to get five minutes of good material

269
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.500
and to get the audience, to like you and get the respect of your peers,

270
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.470
then you got to have worry about someone following you in the,

271
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:04.480
in the parking lot.

272
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.220
<v 0>I have a friend of mine, who's a comic.</v>

273
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.110
And she got hit on by this other guy who is a comic who shall remain nameless.

274
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.520
And, uh, she showed me some of the texts that he sent her. And I was like, holy.

275
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.680
All right. And one of them was like,

276
00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:22.090
I'm the only one that can make you calm or something crazy like that. Geez.

277
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.940
<v 3>Yeah. It's a, Hey bro. Yeah. But.</v>

278
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.460
<v 1>So then it comes down to, okay, so these women were heard,</v>

279
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.040
obviously it's created a, a movement, you know,

280
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.550
but then it becomes on the other side, it becomes about,

281
00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:42.490
but did this man's was he punished enough?

282
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.050
And do we have control over whether or not he's allowed to come back to as an

283
00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:47.860
audience? Oh.

284
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.050
<v 0>Like for a woman, like the,</v>

285
00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:54.640
the thing about a guy being angry with you that carries that threat of physical

286
00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:57.790
danger, you know, that's a different thing.

287
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.480
<v 1>I know. I was thinking I was on a hike the other day,</v>

288
00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:05.020
and I was thinking about that fine line at the end of the night in a bar,

289
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.190
those meat head guys were trying to like hit on girls. And when it doesn't work,

290
00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:10.930
they decide, they're just going to fight instead,

291
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.990
know that they're going to fight guys. Like, that's a,

292
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.450
that's a fine line between, you know what I mean?

293
00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:18.490
They're both almost violent acts.

294
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:20.830
It's like aggressively hitting on women and being like,

295
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.510
it's not going to happen. Well, screw it.

296
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.690
I don't like the way that guy's been looking at. I think it's just frustration,

297
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.900
but, you know, but,

298
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.590
but for looking at a male, doing that,

299
00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:36.430
like it is an aggressive, this is an aggressive animal here.

300
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.320
And he one man that he could have been,

301
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.350
I could have said yes and brought him home with me where he said no,

302
00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:43.840
and now he's punching that guy in the parking lot. That happened though.

303
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.920
<v 0>Common narrative don't get laid.</v>

304
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:50.170
They try to hit on girls and they just beat the out of each other.

305
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.990
<v 2>Yeah. It seems like it happens all those checks.</v>

306
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.760
It seems like it happens all the time.

307
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.200
<v 0>Oh, there's sex in my body.</v>

308
00:16:56.201 --> 00:16:57.100
And you can [inaudible], you know, when you were walking down the.

309
00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.500
<v 1>In the, even in the village,</v>

310
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:02.500
you're walking down the street and it's just like an angry frat group of guys,

311
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:04.660
just like, like raging.
