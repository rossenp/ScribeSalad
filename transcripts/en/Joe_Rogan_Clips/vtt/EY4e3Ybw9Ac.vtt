00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So when.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.750
<v 1>You were the first guy that I knew that was really into yoga back then,</v>

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:10.280
I knew Hixon. Like when that documentary choke came out was great document.

4
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:15.180
That was a great documentary and showed how much jujitsu and yoga

5
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.600
together made Hicks in this really incredible forest.

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.410
So it was the yoga had affected his mind in this great way cause he was able to

7
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.530
meditate and he would do all these incredible yoga poses.

8
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:30.180
He was so flexible and he had such dexterity of his arms and legs. I mean,

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.010
a lot of people got excited about yoga because of Hixon,

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.880
but you were the first guy that I knew that really went so deep into it.

11
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:41.580
You actually became an instructor. Cause when I first knew you,

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.790
I knew that you were in a band and that you,

13
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.360
you did yoga then a little bit because everybody called you yoga Ray.

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.410
But it's like, I felt like you were on this path and this,

15
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.370
this yoga packet tell and then paying attention to on social media and following

16
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:58.620
you. It's like, well, he's really into this.

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.990
I remember when you were moving to New York,

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.060
we had talked online and you were going out there to teach jujitsu or excuse

19
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:09.900
me, a yoga. And I was like, I don't even think he does jujitsu anymore.

20
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.220
I think he's just all doing yoga now. And that's what happened, right? Oh,

21
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:14.480
I did, uh.

22
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.170
<v 2>Music for most of my life. Um, with the youth of today,</v>

23
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.270
youth of today was the band before I became a monk. And then I,

24
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.130
and at the height of that career,

25
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.660
this was a New York city hardcore straight edge band. We didn't drink,

26
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:33.170
we didn't smoke. And we, you know, we're all,

27
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.460
oh, that's me. Yeah. In a more relaxed form. That's a good photo.

28
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.750
So that's what I did as, and, and um, the idea of the band,

29
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.740
we were teenagers. We were all teenagers, me and my, uh, my bed buddy Parma,

30
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.430
Nanda, who also later moved into an Ostrom. So, uh,

31
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.720
we started this when we were 16, 17, and, um,

32
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.180
it was a cool scene making our own music and stuff like that.

33
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:07.070
But when we got youth of today together,

34
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:11.360
it was about sort of a message of better living,

35
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.490
positive mental attitude. Um,

36
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.650
these spiritual principles like karma and what goes around, comes around and,

37
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.020
uh, uh, respect, dignity, um, uh,

38
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.460
controlling your senses and your mind. And what, what led you to that? Oh,

39
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.313
no.

40
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.770
<v 0>Really. No.</v>

41
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.510
<v 2>I've always been interested in my idea of a good time was this was like eighties</v>

42
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:36.051
in New York city.

43
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:40.670
Was it find these like ISTE Westy bookstores that have books on

44
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:45.590
yoga and metaphysics and reincarnation and just plop it down and read

45
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:50.360
books all afternoon by Swami's and solders and weirdos and Palm

46
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:53.330
readers and stuff like that. That's my idea of what a good time was.

47
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:57.860
And I always felt like life is meant for our self

48
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:01.780
edification. That's why we're here. We're here on a mission of growth.

49
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.580
And when I, when I read books by sages or mystics and things like that,

50
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.510
I was always like, I want to be like that. That's what I want to be.

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.750
That's bigger than anything out there that I want to be. So truthfully,

52
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.570
the band, I never really want, I'm not a musician.

53
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.730
I play a little bit of everything. I wrote all the songs,

54
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:23.080
but I always looked at myself as more like a seeker and it made me a

55
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.860
spokesperson. But then at a certain point in the success of that,

56
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.530
the band I started realizing, okay, now we're big.

57
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:35.670
And there's a lot of people who are following those sort of principles of

58
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:38.390
controlling your senses. We don't drink, we don't smoke. We, uh,

59
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.240
we don't take drugs. Uh we're uh, you know, w we can care about what we eat,

60
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.320
but that's not the goal. That's like a doorway to something bigger.

61
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.600
And so for me, I had to step away from that,

62
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.920
that even though it wasn't bad or anything,

63
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.110
it wasn't what I wanted to become. And it was a certain point in my life.

64
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.130
You know, you get to a certain end of a chapter in your life. And for me,

65
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.090
and at the time it was the height of the bands career here as well.

66
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.970
We started touring internationally and stuff like that,

67
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.180
but I realized there was no amount. And by the way,

68
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:16.560
this was eighties in New York, which is a very cool time run DMC, Madonna,

69
00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:20.910
the Beastie boys. You never knew like what was about to like blow up.

70
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:25.830
And you were with all these other people that they were your inspiration and

71
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:30.000
they were your friends and stuff like that, that, so, uh,

72
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.810
at that, that heightened excitement, I just said,

73
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.140
there is no amount of like material success,

74
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.060
one that's going to fill sort of like a God shaped hole in my heart.

75
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.190
There's no thing out there that I want. And it was,

76
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.180
it was also a very precarious time in my life. Um,

77
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.240
not precarious, but, uh,

78
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.360
a time where my father went into a coma for three years. Oh, Jesus.

79
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.730
I know it's hard. So horrible to even say that, think about it.

80
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.580
What happened was he got some unknown lung lung infection was young

81
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.640
64 unknown lung infection.

82
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.960
And there was some neglect in the hospital and

83
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.670
his lung collapsed.

84
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.740
And so comas are one of these places where you don't see Don dead he's is he

85
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:20.574
alive?

86
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.110
And it's so confusing for a person that loves that person,

87
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.300
how to even react. And, uh, you know, in, uh,

88
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.950
I'll say in a humiliating way, I couldn't really, I couldn't deal with it.

89
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.430
And I sort of shut myself off. And, um,

90
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:42.330
I went and just started working on my music, something I could do.

91
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.950
And then at his death, when he finally left his body,

92
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.870
I was cultivating a strong desire to go to India and, and study more.

93
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.680
And I was, at that time, it was also studying yoga, Ayurvedic medicine.

94
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 1>So he went into a coma three years for years.</v>

95
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.530
<v 3>Fired. And then when he died at the end of the coma at the never came out, came.</v>

96
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.620
<v 2>Out of the coma. And then when he, when he left his body,</v>

97
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.180
I decided I'm going to India. Now, this is, that was assigned for me.

98
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.050
And I quit the band.

99
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.390
<v 1>This is at the peak of the band.</v>

100
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.680
<v 2>It was at the peak of youth today, was that hard to walk away from all that.</v>

101
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.350
I was at a point where I was saying,

102
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.900
and you've probably experienced this too. And I'm sure Eddie probably does too.

103
00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:30.630
Sometimes when you become very successful at something, that same thing sorts,

104
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.560
the thing that you love, so it can eat away at you as well. Um, sometimes,

105
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.390
sometimes the peep I'll share it. I'll share with you how I have. I saw it.

106
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.970
I remember sitting in an Ostrom on 24th street. She and under Ostrom,

107
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.890
she even on there was like a, uh, a Swami. He came, he traveled the world.

108
00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:55.000
He taught the teachings of yoga outside, uh, India. And he wrote lots of books.

109
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.270
And there's a library of books were bookstore up on 24th street where he

110
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:02.620
has an Ostrom in New York city.

111
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.210
And I remember reading this one quote by him in the midst of,

112
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.100
uh, my life is in a band and being a teenager living in New York city.

113
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.120
And it was before you first.

114
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.130
So the first one was really interesting. Where is your happiness coming from?

115
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.470
Is it coming from your day-to-day living? Or is it just happiness from your ego?

116
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.330
And I thought, where is my happiness coming from?

117
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.760
Is it from me being a person that I want to be? Is it from,

118
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.510
you know, people, people nowadays, they collect houses.

119
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:42.850
They collect cars that collect so many things. I collected records.

120
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:47.680
I collected rare punk records. And in my brain, I thought, oh man, this,

121
00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:49.960
and you understand what the music scene was like,

122
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:52.240
that if you're unfamiliar with it, there was a band that was great.

123
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:56.860
And they'd put out 1007 inch records and then the band broke up.

124
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.360
If the punk scene always grew.

125
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.550
So these records you bought for two bucks are now worth.

126
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.230
People pay a hundred dollars for that record.

127
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.100
And so me and my guitar player per cell,

128
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.900
we had like thousands of incredibly rare punk records that if you remember the

129
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:14.530
world of records, no one played the records. Cause you could damage them.

130
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.840
What you did was you put everything on a cassette.

131
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.700
And so I started thinking about this quote by the Swami, who said,

132
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.590
man, where am I getting my pleasure from? I'm thinking, well, my, my,

133
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.290
my records are pleasurable. I was like, well, actually the music's pleasurable.

134
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.030
The records are only pleasurable.

135
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.240
<v 4>When somebody comes over my house and says, oh my God, you've got that record.</v>

136
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.890
That rare records impossible.

137
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.350
<v 2>And so once I've read that it was the first shattering of my</v>

138
00:08:41.351 --> 00:08:44.980
concept of self and where,

139
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.750
what is joy and what is pleasure based on my ego and all those

140
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:51.040
records that are really valued.

141
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:54.100
And I have really valuable records and we started our own record company at the

142
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:58.110
time. So we would basically print limited additions of their band.

143
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.730
We put out all our friends records, sick of it, all gorilla biscuits, um,

144
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.090
Israel bands that we grew up with our own band youth of today.

145
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.940
And so we put out these records we'd make limited edition.

146
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.140
And then we trade these.

147
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:14.460
It's like printing your own currency basically to make a long story short.

148
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.970
After I've read that one, quote, my whole concept of pleasure changed.

149
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.940
And I took all those records and I threw them out on stage,

150
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.890
all fans record collector fans. It was, but it was so.

151
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.230
<v 4>All the rare ones, it was so liberating.</v>

152
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.640
<v 2>For me to do that.</v>

153
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.570
And it was like the sh it was like maybe like the first attempt of shedding my

154
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.990
ego. That was a roundabout story.

155
00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:39.560
But the second part of that, that Swami wrote was, um,

156
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.400
and I'm paraphrasing this of course, um,

157
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.420
the diseases of the soul are not new.

158
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.120
They're ancient. The soul is pure. The spirit is pure,

159
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.710
but it gets covered by lust, greed, anger, and envy.

160
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.470
And I started thinking, well, not me, less lusty.

161
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.010
I'm not greedy. I'm not angry. I'm in a band. I have no money. You know,

162
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.890
and if you've ever been in the band, it costs money to buy a guitar,

163
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.550
got a guitar costs, money to buy strings, got strings, cost money to buy an amp.

164
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.730
So it's just like, it's a money pit to be in a band.

165
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.350
You get paid 50 bucks or whatever.

166
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.110
So I thinking not me, but as my band got more successful,

167
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.100
I, I realized, man, I do have,

168
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.770
there is money out there that I want.

169
00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:33.440
And I remember I got offered money for the first time being in a band.

170
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.400
<v 4>Wow. I get money. I should get, you know, I wrote these songs.</v>

171
00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:38.420
I should get more of that money.

172
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.520
<v 2>And you get in a fight with the drummer. No, I should get that money.</v>

173
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.710
<v 4>We should split four ways. No, wait. I do so much more.</v>

174
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.610
I book everything and I realized, wow, I, wasn't not greedy.

175
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.910
I just had no money. I'm covered with greed.

176
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.010
All these people hate the greedy hate the rich,

177
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.610
the 1% you got to see what would happen if you were in that position.

178
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.720
<v 2>Yeah. So that was like my first lesson in like,</v>

179
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.360
actually I'm complete. I thought I was above it. Cause I didn't drink.

180
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.680
Cause I didn't smoke. Cause I was a vegetarian.

181
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.990
<v 4>Big deal, big deal.</v>

182
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.210
<v 2>And it was this and the spirituality starts to work on these subtle things that</v>

183
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.910
are plaguing me. And you know,

184
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:17.090
the people are really want social justice out there.

185
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:22.200
There it's very easy to point the finger at everybody and watch what everybody

186
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:25.980
else is doing wrong. But in, on, on the yoga path,

187
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.470
it's about like putting the microscope on ourself.

188
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.260
Where am I wrong if I really want to change?

189
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.390
How can I start to really do some psychic surgery of my own ego

190
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.290
of all these other things that are, that are, that are baked onto the spirit.

191
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.170
So anyway, that was, I can't remember how you got on that tangent. Sorry.

192
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.400
I'm I go on tangents.

193
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.500
<v 1>A lot. Feel free to go on Tinder. So that was a.</v>

194
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.620
<v 2>That was my first like glimpse of like where I'm at.</v>

195
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:57.610
And so my point was my success. Oh, you S you said,

196
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.360
what was it hard to give up the band? And I was like, no, I was so over it.

197
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.490
I was over because here's another one envy that plagues the soul, they say.

198
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:09.550
So there's P there's people that are looking up to Joe Rogan.

199
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:12.460
I want to be like that. And there's people that maybe you're looking,

200
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.600
although you're pretty big right now.

201
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.220
I don't know if you're looking up to anybody, but,

202
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.420
but they're the feeling like in a corporate world where someone wants your

203
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:23.920
position and that plagues a person, a person who's

204
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.350
not gracious or a person who's like, there's a scarcity mentality. There.

205
00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:33.160
There's a younger, I know in the music world,

206
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:35.560
there's a band coming up and there's a band I want to get to.

207
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.260
And I realized that all these real subtle things,

208
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.650
they were plaguing my heart and these are the things I wanted to work on.

209
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.340
And um, yeah.

210
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.540
So, yeah. Was it hard to give up? No, it wasn't. It was great.

211
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.930
I relinquished it. You were on like.

212
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.470
<v 1>A spiritual quest. I mean a legitimate one.</v>

213
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.500
People talk about that kind of stuff all the time.

214
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.680
Like getting spiritual or being on a spiritual quest, but you,

215
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.090
you legitimately went on this quest and that's why I've found it so fascinating.

216
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.750
That's that was what was so appealing to me. It's like, okay,

217
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:12.390
this is a real one because there's not a lot of real ones.

218
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.090
There's a lot of people that pretend to be on these spiritual quest,

219
00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:17.370
but they really, they just want everybody to think they're spiritual.

220
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.470
It's like you were talking about the pleasure.

221
00:13:19.471 --> 00:13:21.030
What's the pleasure of owning records. Well,

222
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:23.820
the big pleasure was people coming over your house to think you're cool because

223
00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:25.620
you have these records coolest record, man.

224
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.210
That's the same thing with spirituality in a lot of ways. What,

225
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:33.150
what people love is the fact that someone finds out that

226
00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:36.210
you do yoga every day, right? Someone finds out that you meditate.

227
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:39.780
Someone finds out that you've read these books. The ego is so sneaky, isn't it?

228
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.550
Oh, it's so sneaky. And sometimes it's obvious that, like, you know,

229
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.900
it's like a funny story. Um, Brian Callan, when I first met him, um,

230
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.430
he's digital with us too. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah. I love that guy to death.

231
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.370
But when I first met him and went over his house, he had an apartment, Venice,

232
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.130
no door knob. That door knob had been broken out.

233
00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:01.740
So you could just open his door and walk in.

234
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:03.840
Anybody could open his door and people would walk.

235
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.240
Like he would come downstairs and there was a,

236
00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:10.380
a homeless lady cooking in his kitchen. She goes, son,

237
00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:15.090
you got it going on. And he was like, what? He's just eating my food.

238
00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:17.400
She was just cooking food in his house. Um,

239
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.760
but I came over his house and he had a book. I forget what book it was.

240
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.530
It was something obvious, like catcher in the ride or something like that.

241
00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:28.800
Sitting on this, I go, it was just sitting on his coffee table. I go,

242
00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.230
you're not reading that book. I go, you put that book out here.

243
00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:32.880
So when girls come over, they think you're smart.

244
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.080
<v 0>And he's like, you're so right. I'm a fraud. And we were both howling laughing.</v>

245
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.870
<v 1>But that's a thing that people do.</v>

246
00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:43.890
Like people want a well-stocked library, not just to read those books,

247
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.830
read the books then, but yes, but it's also,

248
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.850
there's an issue where people want people to think that you're

249
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.590
brilliant erudite, interesting person,

250
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:57.620
because you have all these books in your house. Like that's, that's, there's a,

251
00:14:57.621 --> 00:14:58.610
there's a factor in that.

252
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:04.300
<v 2>They say that Jeeva or the spirit has to go through eight L elements in each</v>

253
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.710
element to leave the material universe is according to the yogis.

254
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.810
Um,

255
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:15.550
and they get progressively double in size and the

256
00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:17.410
last one, so the first one is earth.

257
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.180
And then that last one is ego. It's the hardest,

258
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.710
it's the biggest of all of them. And it's so refined. Even people,

259
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.040
you do altruistic things, you do, um, things for yourself, betterment.

260
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.500
It gets wound up in religion. It gets rounded up in diet.

261
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.610
It gets rounded up in politics. It gets wound up in, in race. It gets round up,

262
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.510
wound up in animal rights. It gets wound up in against animal. Right. You know,

263
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.490
everything, the Eagle is the,

264
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:47.310
is the biggest thing and you can sort of see it on a person too. And I, and,

265
00:15:47.311 --> 00:15:50.590
and, and, and, um, almost better than seeing it on some,

266
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.100
someone else's to see it on yourself. That's like, that's the work of the Yogi.

267
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.130
It's trying to see ma'am I was motivated by that look.

268
00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:01.300
That was ill motivated again. So yeah, it's a constant, um,

269
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.290
checking in with the ego. I think that was part of my, I mean, think about it.

270
00:16:05.291 --> 00:16:07.390
I came from sort of like a scene where everything,

271
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.360
everybody had to be cool a certain way. There's certain look, a certain dress,

272
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.800
certain, you know, sneakers.

273
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.770
We wore certain haircuts we wore and now we're Adobe robe.
