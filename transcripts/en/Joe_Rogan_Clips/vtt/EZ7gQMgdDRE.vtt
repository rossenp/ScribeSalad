00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>I don't like comics that go on stage drunk. Right? I don't like comic.</v>

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.400
They need this alcohol or, or people that think weed, like, you know,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.400
people that think weed, like I not saying weed makes you lazy.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but lazy people shouldn't smoke weed.

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.240
<v 1>Right. And I know what you're saying. Well, as a person who smokes weed,</v>

6
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.830
it really bothers me because I'm not lazy at all. And I just,

7
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.310
I hate that connection between lazy people and weed. Cause I don't think that's,

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.630
I don't think that's what makes you lazy.

9
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.870
<v 0>I no, no, no. I'm not saying I'm not. I agree. That's why I'm saying,</v>

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.670
I'm not saying it makes you lazy. No,

11
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.510
but if you're already lazy and then you do this mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

12
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.150
it's not gonna be a winning combination. It's not just that.

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.950
<v 1>It just looks bad. Cause and you blame it on the win look at Jr.</v>

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.540
<v 0>Smith. I think that, I think that was a weed situation was jar Smith from the,</v>

15
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.820
from the, oh, you don't even, he don't even know Cleveland Cav. Jamie jumps in.

16
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.700
<v 1>To press the microphone. I know that guy. I know that guy.</v>

17
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.540
<v 0>I know what we're talking about. That's the game last. That's the game.</v>

18
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:53.980
How's the game. Cleveland Cavalier's he did something really stupid.

19
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.780
It was like two, it was like three, four seconds left. They their tie ball game.

20
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.410
Right? Uh, one of their other guys at the free one, he misses the free throw Jr.

21
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.770
Smith grabs the ball. Instead of putting it up to win the game,

22
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.130
he dribbles out cuz he thought that they were up and the look on his face

23
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:14.650
was like that kind of like I've seen this high look before.

24
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.690
I'm not saying he was on weed. No,

25
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.210
but I heard stories that he smokes a lot of weed. So,

26
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:23.280
and I'm saying like those weed people out there, like there's an example of it.

27
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.800
There are brilliant people that smoke weed. They are successful.

28
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:30.120
Look at LeBron's the look LeBron had on his face. &lt;laugh&gt; what.

29
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 1>The, man? What are you doing? First of all, first of all, how jacked is LeBron?</v>

30
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.263
Look at those.

31
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.160
<v 0>Shoulders. 6, 9, 2 50, probably 6% body fat.</v>

32
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:43.190
Look at the shoulders on that side. 33 year is old too.

33
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.270
<v 1>And he's getting better. Yeah. It's unbelievable. His shoulders are epic.</v>

34
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.413
Yeah man.

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.630
<v 0>There's another picture of him like straight on where he,</v>

36
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.110
he literally looks like an Avenger.

37
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.950
Like he could be like some sort of like keep.

38
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.030
<v 1>Him the away from Jeff. Novitzky you.</v>

39
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.790
<v 0>Know, look, look a picture. Look at that picture of them right there.</v>

40
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.590
That one where jazz Smith is smiling. Dude. He's weed. Look on his face.

41
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.140
<v 1>Oh. Hundred percent. Oh, that's a high guy.</v>

42
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.380
He just gets high. And I think that stoners understand other stoners.

43
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.300
I think that he got.

44
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.660
<v 0>Like a, he had a little blame, a brain slip. I guarantee he did. You know,</v>

45
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.140
when are paying you 17 million or they.

46
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.980
<v 1>Paid him off to try to drag it into seven games. That's jam thinks.</v>

47
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.500
<v 0>Oh my God. Look at it high as you guys go. That's boom. That's him. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.930
There's.

49
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.090
<v 1>Plenty of pictures of me that look like that too. Where I'm sober. They,</v>

50
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.650
they catch you. You could just catch a blink look. You could just look.

51
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.210
<v 0>Up J Smith high and I'm sure there's a website.</v>

52
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.370
<v 1>So he smokes a lot of weed. Yeah. Oh yeah. There he is. Smoking weed.</v>

53
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.690
He smoke weed. Well, there you go. Well dist,

54
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.730
doesn't it like one of those things, the NBA has it in their contract.

55
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:43.970
They don't test for weed. They, they do test, but it's not as, uh,

56
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.320
that's stringent as everywhere.

57
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.240
All the others tips for weed mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but these guys are all getting

58
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:53.000
high. Like it's blocker rooms have been for pool for,

59
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.440
you know, I told you I play pool pool. Marijuana's a performance enhancing drug.

60
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.680
A hundred percent. It makes my game 10% better.

61
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.560
<v 0>Don't I don't believe you.</v>

62
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.560
<v 1>You don't have to. I'm telling you he.</v>

63
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.320
<v 0>Does not make your, it makes it game better.</v>

64
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.440
<v 1>It does. It makes you more sensitive. Trust me.</v>

65
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.160
Oh's the reason why basketball players find it better too.

66
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.360
It puts 'em into some sort of a zone. Now,

67
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.040
are you saying that LeBron James knees weed? No, look,

68
00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:16.880
there's a lot of pro pool players who are top of the food chain who don't do

69
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.710
anything. Right. But lot of guys who,

70
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.310
like it say that weed bumps their game up quite a bit. And I'm one of 'em.

71
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.470
It makes me play better. I'm telling you,

72
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.550
you don't know cause you don't smoke weed. Can you?

73
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.030
<v 0>I, you need to experiment. Okay. I want to experiment. I want you to play.</v>

74
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.030
You gonna, you're gonna play pool. Do you play? No. You gonna play pool sober.

75
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.070
Okay. Okay. And then you're gonna see your results. And then.

76
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.780
<v 1>So the problem is if I sober and then I smoke high,</v>

77
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.740
I smoke pot and get high. I will have been warmed up by the playing pool,

78
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:48.500
sober and I'll definitely play better high anyway.

79
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.500
<v 0>Separate ex separate.</v>

80
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.980
<v 1>Days. But the problem with separate days is it have to,</v>

81
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.500
your body has to be like perfectly in tune in order to get real accurate

82
00:03:57.501 --> 00:04:00.810
results. Cuz one day I could've lifted weights, which up your pool game.

83
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:04.170
Like nothing. Here we go. Telling you, be honest with you. Just pick two days.

84
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:08.330
All my best games. I was medicated. Matt Barnes on his game day. Use of.

85
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.170
<v 0>Marijuana, Matt Barnes, who will not be in the hall of fame,</v>

86
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.290
who you know's good player. He he's right. But he's just right.

87
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:19.210
He's a role player I want, I want Michael Jordan to come out and say that,

88
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.520
then I'm gonna be like, oh wow. I, I want someone like that. No.

89
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.960
Don't tell me the role players. &lt;laugh&gt;.

90
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.720
<v 1>Well, see you're saying this though, as a guy who doesn't smoke pot.</v>

91
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.880
<v 0>I I, but I telling you for.</v>

92
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.760
<v 1>Jujitsu, for jujitsu, it's a huge part of the jujitsu world.</v>

93
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440
A lot of people get high and, and,

94
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.480
and then two jujitsu and they say it makes their game better. What's.

95
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.470
<v 0>The practical use of jujitsu.</v>

96
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.270
<v 1>Well, if you and I were in a fight that.</v>

97
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.110
<v 0>Would kill you that I think you would kill me. That's practical.</v>

98
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.510
I think you would kill me anyway. Yeah, but that would be the practical. Okay.

99
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.070
So just, just for that moment, but in.

100
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.870
<v 1>Any other time that, but no, no, it's not just would you wanna be.</v>

101
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.030
<v 0>High if you were like walk to your car late at night and then three guys came at</v>

102
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:00.751
you and you would,

103
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:04.740
would let me ask you what's the perfect circumstance then you're it's late at

104
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:06.460
night. You're headed to your car. I don't think.

105
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.460
<v 1>You understand marijuana.</v>

106
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.460
<v 0>Would you wanna, I'm just saying, would you want to, would you prefer,</v>

107
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.620
would you prefer to be sober or high either? You'd fine with either one. Yeah.

108
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.100
Okay.

109
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.420
<v 1>Good then. Depends. I mean,</v>

110
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:21.380
I'm not gonna be able to do anything different if I'm sober or high I'm we're

111
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:25.330
not talking about drunk. Now, if you said, would I want to be drunk or sober.

112
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.330
Yeah. I'd wanna be sober. Oh no. I'm not.

113
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.450
<v 0>I'm not. I get it.</v>

114
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.610
<v 1>If I'm worried about getting hit and I'm, I'm not,</v>

115
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.170
I'm sure about reaction time or one of the things about pot is it makes you a

116
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.490
little bit paranoid. So it puts you on edge. Oh, it makes you aware of. Okay.

117
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.760
The other thing is it focuses, you like very cleanly on what you're doing. Oh,

118
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:42.920
this is.

119
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.680
<v 0>Like, if you out here just really happy.</v>

120
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.640
<v 1>You're drawing. They're already. No, I like it.</v>

121
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.640
But if you're drawing or music or something along those lines where you're

122
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:51.720
really trying to focus a lot,

123
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.280
like writing a lot of people really like it for those things because it makes

124
00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:57.680
you really focus on what you are doing. But.

125
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.380
<v 0>Then I tunnel vision.</v>

126
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.400
But then I think what happens then is that that's whatever they were doing on

127
00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:06.320
that they don't apply it to. Cause I have a lot of, we all have a lot.

128
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.520
We both have a lot of pothead comedian, friends. Yeah. But,

129
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.640
and there's some of 'em. I know that when I started with them,

130
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.560
I know that they're not doing what they're doing now and that they're,

131
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:18.470
they didn't key. Keep going, exceed their expectations.

132
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.670
And I know part of it was because of the pot.

133
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.703
<v 1>I don't think it is.</v>

134
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.750
I think the pot is just the common denominator use is an excuse.

135
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.310
It's not the common denominator is no work ethic. Agree.

136
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:31.070
The common denominator is that. And it didn't help the work ethic.

137
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.590
I don't think it hurts or helps. I think it's just, it's a factor.

138
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.950
See a study on this. Yeah. I mean the,

139
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.540
the study would be skewed because a lot of failures that get high all the time

140
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.660
would be in the study. Right. But a lot of winners that get high all the time,

141
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:46.580
don't want to talk about it. I that.

142
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.100
<v 0>And I, by the way, I'm with you 100% on this. I,</v>

143
00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:52.900
what I hate is that the people that don't have any work ethic,

144
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.010
they look at somebody with a work ethic that smokes weed and say,

145
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.450
well, look, they made it cause they smoked weed. And I'm like, no,

146
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.930
they would've made it without.

147
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.650
<v 1>The weed. Yeah. They would've made it without the weed. That's what I'm saying.</v>

148
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.650
Before I ever smoked weed, I was already on television. Yeah.

149
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:11.690
I already had a Warner brothers CD, as you know,

150
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.530
I didn't start smoking weed until like 2000.

151
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.530
<v 0>I'm not, I'm not listen. I'm not anti weed.</v>

152
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.120
But I just think that that with anything there should be moderation. Yes.

153
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.110
<v 1>No, I agree.</v>

154
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.120
Like one of the best things I did last year was Ari and Tom Segura and Burke

155
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.040
Chrysler. And I, we did this sober October thing where for a whole month,

156
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.040
no booze, no pot. And we had to do 15 hot yoga classes in the month.

157
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.520
And I, I learned a lot in that month. I really did. Are you a different.

158
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.353
<v 0>Are you a different person?</v>

159
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.070
<v 1>It, no, it was good. You gotta get outta here. Nah.</v>

160
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.990
<v 0>Yeah. No. Have another really?</v>

161
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.270
<v 1>Yeah. Jesus Christ.</v>

162
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.310
<v 0>It's 32 20 bro. Yeah, I'm doing another one. I'm going, I'm doing, I'm going,</v>

163
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.110
going to see Barry KA, if you can believe that. Oh, congratulations.

164
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.303
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

165
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.270
<v 0>Um, Barry cats is a podcast. That's gonna be a interesting day for me. What,</v>

166
00:07:57.271 --> 00:07:57.630
what is.

167
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.900
<v 1>What was we just oh, about the pot, but what I forget what I was gonna say.</v>

168
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.260
Stoner thought, no, it's not Uhhuh. It's not whether or not you smoke pot.

169
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.820
It's whether or not you get things done and whether or not you write out what

170
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:13.860
you're supposed to do, whether or not you, you actually try to achieve goals,

171
00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:18.780
whether or not you're, you're actively trying to improve whatever you're doing.

172
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.690
Whether build cars or make carpet cabinetry.

173
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.650
It's just about whether or not you're working towards succeeding and,

174
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:28.490
and improving. And.

175
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.210
<v 0>I, I agree. Listen, I agree with you. I'm not anti pot. I'm I'm not. I.</v>

176
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.410
<v 1>Agree. I agree with you.</v>

177
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.370
But based on evidence of the people that are around a lot of us,

178
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.210
we should be anti pot. I should be anti pot, dude.

179
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.080
I know a lot of people that were, they were made me sad.

180
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.680
Like I'd run into 'em at the comedy store and they'd be like, bro,

181
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.960
you got any weed on you, man. You got weed. And I'd be like,

182
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.200
you're not doing anything. Yeah. You're not doing anything with your life.

183
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.600
And you want some weed, go get a job. Those are get some wheat. Yeah.

184
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.920
But then you also see guys like Ari who get high all the time and they're

185
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.680
constantly working or you know, are Doug.

186
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.440
<v 0>Benson. Who's like the most functional pothead I've ever met in.</v>

187
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.400
<v 1>My life. He, I all day he's a weird one or Snoop dog. Yeah. So, so.</v>

188
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.360
<v 0>There, there are people, but these are people that are, they're the exceptions,</v>

189
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.253
not the rule.

190
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.840
<v 1>I wonder there's a lot of people on wall street that get high.</v>

191
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:13.960
There's a lot of people that are involved in like the tech world,

192
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.670
that eye a lot. And what, what people think about it is that,

193
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.310
look it's like everything else, man.

194
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.590
It can be good for you or it could your world up. You know? I mean moderation.

195
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.630
I think there's some benefit to it. And what the benefit is, vulnerability,

196
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.750
creativity. It makes you feel vulnerable. It makes you reexamine things.

197
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.790
It makes you look at, I mean, people call it paranoia.

198
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.900
I just think it broadens your, your awareness. But.

199
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.701
<v 0>I think it's a standup.</v>

200
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:42.660
You already have a level of vulnerability just going on stage and talking about

201
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:43.580
things. For sure. So.

202
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.260
<v 1>That's like my, for sure. There's some of that.</v>

203
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.900
<v 0>I just feel like that's my drug.</v>

204
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.020
<v 1>It's a good drug. I mean, it's,</v>

205
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.020
it's definitely not one that's gonna ruin your life hopefully. Yeah.

206
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.380
Unless you tell a bad planet of the apes joke on Twitter. Oh.

207
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.370
<v 0>On that and Ambien, you know.</v>

208
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.810
<v 1>And Ambien.</v>
