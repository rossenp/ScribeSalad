00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Unlike China,</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.180
the United States has at least in perception,

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.130
a clear differentiation between business and

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.270
government. And one of the concerns that, um, uh,

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.200
when I've talked to experts in China and their electronics and their,

6
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:27.270
their technological innovation is that they're inexorably connected to their

7
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.160
government in some way, shape or form.

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.540
And that it's one of the main reasons that makes it incredibly difficult to

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:35.730
compete with them on a global marketplace. Yeah.

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.910
When you see that this,

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.560
our state department has told people to stop using Walway devices, cause Walway,

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.350
which is the number two provider of cell phones in this world.

13
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.260
Now they're connected to the Chinese government.

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.470
Like how do you take that? What, what,

15
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.620
what do you do about that situation and how.

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.380
<v 1>Relationship between private sector and government here in.</v>

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.240
<v 0>Particular with the competition? What look when it comes to data? I mean,</v>

18
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.960
we're very concerned about people sharing data. We've, we've done it ourselves,

19
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.690
we've spider, and we've proven through the Edward Snowden case,

20
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.880
govern our government's doing as well to us,

21
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.160
we're worried the Chinese are doing it to us.

22
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.110
Or so we're saying don't buy Chinese stuff,

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.080
they're gonna steal your data and steal your information and steal your,

24
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:22.380
your business secrets. Yeah. What can you do to stop that?

25
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.630
What can you do to mitigate what's already happened?

26
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.550
<v 1>Uh, well, I, you know,</v>

27
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.240
ultimately you can't stop every single individual with what they're purchasing.

28
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.800
I think that, um, you know, you can regulate what is, uh,

29
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.710
sold here in the United States. Uh,

30
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.450
I think there's a role that government can play,

31
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.420
especially as we're talking about artificial intelligence and that kind of

32
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:47.130
technology again, first and understanding it, uh, and then playing,

33
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.300
um, being that responsible party, uh,

34
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.250
to make sure that what is being developed is not something that's going

35
00:01:56.251 --> 00:02:00.840
to result in these, uh, unintended negative consequences.

36
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.470
Uh, so obviously our government isn't, uh, you know,

37
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.530
doesn't have ownership over private business in this country,

38
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.710
but we still do have sensible, uh,

39
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.910
regulations and responsibility that government has to play in regulating what

40
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:16.680
businesses can. And can't do.

41
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.690
<v 0>What's interesting to me is this competition aspect between</v>

42
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.860
dealing with essentially just the private sector here in America

43
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.890
versus the private sector in China,

44
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:32.730
that's combined inexorably with the military and that they have much more

45
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.450
influence over what gets done and how things get done. Um,

46
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.010
what did you pay attention at all to the state departments call for a boycott of

47
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.770
Walway products? What did you think about that?

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.350
<v 1>Uh, well, I understood it, you know,</v>

49
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:51.280
I think there is a concern about that technology being, um, being used to,

50
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:55.530
to get our information, um, you know, so that that,

51
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.590
um, can be enforced within the federal government, right?

52
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:00.940
So if the state department is saying, Hey,

53
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:05.200
the federal government is not going to purchase any Walway produced products or

54
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.900
cell phones or whatever the technology is, uh,

55
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.770
and encourage other people in the private sector to, to do the same.

56
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.150
<v 0>People were worried about over here is that what they're trying to do is stifle</v>

57
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.490
the development of this gigantic company and that what they're trying yeah.

58
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.750
Of Walway cause Walway went from having a tiny share of the marketplace about

59
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.650
five years ago,

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.760
to being the number two cell phone provider in the world next to Samsung,

61
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.110
the gesture surpassed apple, and that this is a Chinese company and that,

62
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.780
because this Chinese companies connected to the Chinese government,

63
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:42.340
the worry is that they're making ungodly sums of money and it's enhancing the

64
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:46.720
Chinese government's ability to perform surveillance or just to just compete

65
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.580
just financially compete on a global scale. And tech nerds, um,

66
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.820
seemed to be siding with Walway, which is interesting to me,

67
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.610
I've read a lot of tech blogs from people that are experts.

68
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:02.290
And they say that there's no evidence that these cell phones have anything in

69
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:03.940
them or are doing anything,

70
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.150
but that there has been some evidence of network devices.

71
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.100
And some of these network devices do have some sort of a third-party input or

72
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.970
sensibility, some ability to extract information that shouldn't be there.

73
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.320
That's interesting. Yeah.

74
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.670
And what this it's like when you're dealing with a situation where you're

75
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:26.650
competing with a country that also controls these companies that are

76
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.150
the biggest cell phone and electronics providers on the planet. Yeah.

77
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.600
How do you handle that? Like what, what is diplomacy with China? Like?

78
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.630
<v 1>Well, we can see what's happening right now with Trump.</v>

79
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.770
It's it's not working very well. Uh, you know, this trade war that,

80
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.860
that frankly, president Trump is escalating, I think is really,

81
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:49.600
really dangerous. Uh, it's having a negative impact on domestic producers,

82
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:51.760
manufacturers, farmers,

83
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:56.110
a friend of mine is a small business owner and he saw the news this morning

84
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:01.060
about China retaliating, um, with Trump's escalation,

85
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.020
I think with, with another increase of their tariffs and how he's thinking,

86
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.350
like my gosh, that's going to impact my small business. It got, I don't know,

87
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.310
probably less than 15 employees and trying to figure out how that's gonna impact

88
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.850
the pricing and production, manufacturing, everything, every step of the way.

89
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.150
What's so dangerous about, uh,

90
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.990
what Trump is doing with this trade war that he is, um,

91
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.880
that he's escalating is that these trade and economic wars can very

92
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.550
easily turn into a hot war.

93
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.770
And we're talking about a nuclear armed country in China. Uh,

94
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.390
so while there are trade differences and issues that we've got to address with

95
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.200
China and issues with intellectual property and other things, um,

96
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.510
the way that Trump is going about this,

97
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:48.790
I believe is very irresponsible and dangerous,

98
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:53.380
creating a huge amount of uncertainty for American businesses, uh,

99
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.100
while increasing tensions with one of the biggest nuclear powers in the

100
00:05:58.101 --> 00:05:58.934
world.

101
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 0>That's a scary thought.</v>

102
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.160
<v 1>It is. And, and the.</v>

103
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.410
<v 0>I think that it's possible that that could lead to a nuclear war that this trade</v>

104
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:09.830
war could lead to something military. Yes. Yes.

105
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.000
What is Trump's argument is his argument essentially is that China has been

106
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.610
treating us unfairly and that the rates that we're getting there are there,

107
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.760
they're not, they're not even.

108
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.241
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

109
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:24.970
Trump is recognizing a problem that exists that trade imbalance with China is,

110
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:25.550
is a real.

111
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.620
<v 0>Issue. Why does that trade imbalance exists?</v>

112
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.970
<v 1>Well, I mean, you can point to a, probably a whole host of,</v>

113
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.920
of issues in trade policy. I don't think it's any one single incident,

114
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.030
um, that has, that has created that imbalance and that, you know,

115
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:42.500
I'm in Iowa a lot these days.

116
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.740
And a lot of farmers have been struggling with that, um,

117
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.360
and would like to see it fixed, uh,

118
00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:51.830
a lot in the tech community would like to see these issues fixed,

119
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.600
especially related to intellectual property,

120
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.000
but the way in which Trump is doing it is having a very negative

121
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:03.040
effect on these American businesses and jobs that Trump is,

122
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:07.460
is supposedly advocating for both in, um,

123
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.090
but really in the uncertainty that that is being set where, you know,

124
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:13.910
it looks like they're on the brink of a deal just the other day. It looks like,

125
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:15.560
Hey, okay, the United States and China,

126
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:18.560
they've been working through these issues, they're on the brink of a deal.

127
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.050
And all of a sudden Trump sends out a tweet saying, Nope,

128
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.740
we're going to increase these tariffs from 10% to 25%.

129
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.860
And now China is left. Like, okay, I thought we were,

130
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.050
I thought we were close to working,

131
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.250
working things out and now left in a situation where they have no other

132
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.760
recourse, but to retaliate as they did this morning.

133
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.790
So you can see quickly how this thing is spiraling.

134
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:45.590
So out of control and increasing these tensions between our two countries

135
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.710
not being done in a way that that to me,

136
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.910
is strategic providing us with the certainty of that path forward to reach a

137
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.940
specific objective of correcting this trade imbalance,

138
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:57.680
which is how this whole thing began. Why.

139
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.880
<v 0>Do you think he's doing that? Why would he make it that.</v>

140
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.800
<v 1>It's hard to explain because it doesn't make sense.</v>

141
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:08.510
It doesn't actually serve us in our interests of our economic interests of

142
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:12.110
meeting that objective. I don't know if he thinks this is part of his masterful,

143
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.090
you know, negotiation skills, but it's, it's got a very dangerous effect. And,

144
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.070
and the fact that we have nuclear strategists in this country who

145
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.870
remind us that we are at a greater risk of nuclear war now

146
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.310
than ever before.

147
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:33.050
It's because of these kinds of things that are increasing tensions between the

148
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:34.760
United States and China, uh,

149
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:39.140
other things that are increasing the tensions between the United States and

150
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:42.320
Russia, you know, a country that we're, we still have, uh,

151
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.700
nuclear missiles pointed at each other that can be set off at a moment's notice,

152
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.650
literally leaving us as people with just minutes before

153
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.650
a nuclear Holocaust, a nuclear disaster, nuclear war.

154
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.140
<v 0>And you really think that this could be set off by these financial negotiations</v>

155
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:04.560
and by Trump saying something like that, and just changing his,

156
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.030
his offer in a tweet.

157
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.770
<v 1>You threatened a country's economy and their economic</v>

158
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.950
security. Where does that logically lead?

159
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.790
You threaten their ability to, uh, provide for their people.

160
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:21.660
You threaten their ability to provide that stable environment,

161
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.220
which China so much of what they do is just like, Hey, they,

162
00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:27.870
they look for that stability. What else,

163
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:32.010
what are the recourses there other than the threat of military force?

164
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.250
And in this case, when you're dealing with two nuclear armed countries,

165
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:38.520
this is what's at risk and it's something, you know,

166
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.420
it's hard for a lot of people to conceive of like, okay, my gosh, nuclear war,

167
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.030
really. I mean, this is something that, you know,

168
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:48.810
back during the cold war with the, the, the, you know,

169
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.380
kids going under their desk, these drills and, and, you know, okay,

170
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.690
where do you go find a bunker? Uh,

171
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.160
but this is something that that's a reality that we're facing today.

172
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.030
And it's something that, you know, we in Hawaii in January of last year,

173
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.770
went through with that missile alert.

174
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.060
<v 0>Yeah, that was crazy. It was terrifying, fake missile alert,</v>

175
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.530
nuclear weapons on its way.

176
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.210
<v 1>Right? Missile inbound towards Hawaii seek immediate shelter.</v>

177
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:16.200
This is not a drill.

178
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:20.520
That was the message that was blasted out to over a million phones all across

179
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:24.300
our state, on the radio, scrolling across the television.

180
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:28.440
And people immediate like seek immediate shelter. Okay. Where do I go?

181
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.100
Where do I take my kids? Where do I take my family at college kids,

182
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:34.230
sprinting across campus at the university of Hawaii,

183
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:39.090
trying to find shelters seek immediate shelter, but the, the sick,

184
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.130
um, insanity of all of this is that there,

185
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.080
there is no shelter. There is no shelter and no nuclear bunkers,

186
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.300
which, which really, I mean, and for,

187
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.080
for people in this administration and politicians who are ratcheting up these

188
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:58.950
tensions with these nuclear armed countries, bringing us to this new cold war,

189
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.300
they are not saying, okay, well, because we're doing this,

190
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.360
we're going to invest, uh, not just trillions,

191
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:10.380
but hundreds or thousands of trillions of dollars to make sure that every single

192
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:15.120
American in this country has a nuclear bunker within 10 minutes of their home or

193
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:17.190
their place of work or their, or their school,

194
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.990
because that's how much time we'd have.

195
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.530
That's what we would need in order to deal with the consequences of the

196
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.970
decisions that they're making and the failed leadership that they're providing.

197
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.070
And so this is,

198
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:33.180
this is an issue that I'm raising awareness about because of what's at risk.

199
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:37.350
I mean, this is, this is the greatest threat that we face,

200
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.970
and it requires strong leadership to walk us away from this brink of nuclear

201
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:46.410
war, to be able to, to work with other countries, uh,

202
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.770
based on cooperation rather than conflict deescalate.

203
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:54.660
These tensions work out our differences and, and walk us back from,

204
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.170
uh, walk us back from the brink. Stop this nuclear arms race.

205
00:11:58.171 --> 00:11:59.340
That's making us in the world.
