00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 4>Gentlemen. Anyway. Yes, sir. Good.</v>

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.520
<v 1>We're in Texas. Always. Great to be here with you.</v>

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.120
<v 0>Yeah. And, uh, another, another mover. You're you're a mover here as well.</v>

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.400
<v 1>Uh, yep. Uh, spent, uh, last month with his parents, uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:17.200
looking for a house and I think we've, uh,

7
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.910
found a nice house to move into in spring, Texas. What you.

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.943
<v 0>Over the edge?</v>

9
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.910
<v 1>Um, all the going on in California, uh, the laws,</v>

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.510
the restrictions, the taxes, 13.3%. Uh, the governor, the mayor,

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.990
uh, the Congressman, the senators. Is that enough? Yeah, that's enough. Okay,

12
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.190
good. I second to all that, that's what moved that's.

13
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.980
<v 0>Exactly. But as, as a doctor, right? When you look at the lockdowns,</v>

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.660
like this is, this is where it gets really controversial, right?

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.660
Cuz people are saying that the whole reason for doing this is to protect people

16
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.180
because the emergency rooms are overcrowded and uh,

17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.500
you don't think that's a suitable.

18
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.820
<v 1>No, I, I think restrictions of our rights is a, is a key issue there. I,</v>

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.650
you know, in looking contrasting what has been going on in Texas,

20
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.650
outside Boston, but in Houston and other places they're reasonable.

21
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.010
Abbot has been very reasonable about, uh,

22
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:13.970
certain factors that I love where a law abiding state.

23
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.290
Okay. We believe in individual rights, California is the opposite. Yeah.

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.800
How can you live pleasantly, uh, regardless of what occupation you're in,

25
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:27.640
how can you live there understanding that every movement that you're doing is

26
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:31.400
under surveillance. Cops are coming to your house during Thanksgiving or,

27
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.880
you know, is.

28
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.320
<v 0>That happening though? I didn't. I know, I know there's something happening,</v>

29
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.160
Canada. It was a really disturbing thing. Did you see about,

30
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.360
I did see in Canada they came in like full gustapo mode and just a family. Yeah,

31
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.150
yeah. One, they had five people in the house or something like that.

32
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.390
And people ratted 'em out. Like it's just, as soon as you make something,

33
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.110
a law and then you send cops out to enforce that and the cops think they're

34
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:56.750
justified and you get a few dumb cops and then they do something like this.

35
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.510
It just lets everybody know like, oh,

36
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.630
this is why it's dangerous to have too many restrictions because then you have

37
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:04.700
people that have, have to enforce those restrictions. Right.

38
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.820
<v 1>And they're not doing their job. I mean the sheriff and the head of police in,</v>

39
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.260
in California and Los Angeles came out and said they wouldn't upheld,

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.340
uphold the, uh, restrictions that Newsome was putting in.

41
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.180
I think in San Francisco also because it,

42
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.740
orange county would take them away from orange county.

43
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.580
It would take them away from their ability to do the real work,

44
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:25.730
protecting the citizens, not arrest them. Yeah. It's you know,

45
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:30.050
what happened in Staten island is just mind boggling with that.

46
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.890
Restaurateur was arrested and given a $10,000 a day

47
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.410
fine for having his restaurant open. He was social distancing. He had the, uh,

48
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.370
shields and protection. Everyone was wearing a mask,

49
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.440
but because they had on state island. So tightly, you know,

50
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.000
they're devastating all the businesses there, but he went up against it.

51
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.640
It just.

52
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.200
<v 0>Seems to me that the amount of money that it would've cost to open up</v>

53
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.240
new ICU rooms and, and figure out a way to staff them.

54
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.400
Would've been far less than the amount of money that it's costing.

55
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.760
All these people to lose their businesses, all these people to stop working.

56
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.220
Right.

57
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.280
It just seems rational that like the amount of money you could have figured out

58
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:17.120
a way to tax people like say, Hey, we're gonna let everybody open up, but we,

59
00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:21.150
we need a temporary tax on sales of whatever.

60
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.670
That'll just go to help this. And people probably would've said, okay,

61
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.430
well it it'll just keep and give people the opportunity. Like you,

62
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.230
you have your options, you have your rights. You can choose to go to work,

63
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.950
choose to go to these restaurants,

64
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:38.230
choose to go to these bars and will figure out some way to.

65
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.820
<v 1>Not New York city doing something like that. I don't know where they, I think,</v>

66
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.980
I think they were doing some, uh, in restaurants,

67
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:48.820
they were adding a small amount of additional tax to compensate for the COVID.

68
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.180
Uh.

69
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.940
<v 0>Well even they did, they shut down indoor dining and then complet. But they,</v>

70
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:57.300
at least they have outdoor dining, which is hilarious. New York has it.

71
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.050
And it's freezing and snowing. Doesn't have it.

72
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.130
And then the woman who votes,

73
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.650
it's one woman who decides to shut everything down,

74
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.170
goes to dinner outside the day.

75
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.450
She does it and lied and said,

76
00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.610
the reason why she was doing it is cuz her favorite restaurant.

77
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.770
And she wanted to say,

78
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.850
she was sorry to the staff and apologize for what they had to do.

79
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.760
Didn't talk to anybody full on lie. The people who work there going,

80
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.120
she didn't talk to us. Yeah. This is not just rules. Don't.

81
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.040
<v 1>Rules. Don't count.</v>

82
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.680
<v 0>For them. Yeah. It's just, I get that. People wanna stay safe.</v>

83
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.720
But as a doctor, does this make sense to you? Like what?

84
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.440
<v 1>No. You know, on my list, I have a couple of the, um, uh,</v>

85
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.230
the articles. It doesn't make sense. &lt;affirmative&gt; when you look at California,

86
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.310
the repetitive manner in which they put a lockdown,

87
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.870
we should see if it's effective, the numbers of cases dropping,

88
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.910
but they're not they're going up. So what does it tell us?

89
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:52.630
It tells us that the masks aren't working,

90
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.470
the six feet of separation is not working.

91
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.630
There's some other element that's out there that's creating, you know,

92
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.580
negating all the active modalities that they're doing. So why lockdown?

93
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.940
You know, the state allow people to have their, their employment,

94
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.040
but aren't.

95
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.380
<v 0>Aren't check me if I'm wrong.</v>

96
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.060
But is haven't cases gone down over the last two weeks since everything's been

97
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:19.780
completely locked up? No.

98
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.780
<v 1>They've been one day.</v>

99
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.490
<v 2>They went up. I know and saw that yesterday,</v>

100
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.570
spike Newsom said there's gonna be a surge on top of a surge Theyre.

101
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.490
<v 1>Waiting for. Right. And they're talking about right. &lt;laugh&gt; cause he's, uh,</v>

102
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.570
a doctor, he's the grandpa PBA, that's it? Are they using the PCR test to, uh,

103
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.290
to validate that that's a huge question.

104
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.450
They're using the PCR test and they're using the rapid one, but you know,

105
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.280
they're not, as, they're not accurate, they're not accurate.

106
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:48.160
They're just something we have now to utilize and then put a lot of credibility

107
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.840
on it. Um, the difference between the different PCR testing is that.

108
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.400
<v 0>So there's a spike around Christmas time,</v>

109
00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.240
which is supposedly due to what is the idea that it's due

110
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.840
to gatherings? Is it so it's cuz they were trying to say that it was related to,

111
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.800
uh, Thanksgiving. So between October, November, end of November.

112
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.680
But if you look at it, it seems like two weeks after the end of November,

113
00:06:13.681 --> 00:06:17.990
that would make sense. Right. That'd be right around. Show me like,

114
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.990
yeah, well that's that's longer than two weeks. Right?

115
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.430
Cause it seems like it kicked in the spikes kicked in right around. Uh,

116
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.150
well what is the big, first big spike right there? What is that? The 16, well,

117
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.590
that's kind of two weeks. That's two weeks ish.

118
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.670
<v 3>I would wanna know what cycles are testing.</v>

119
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.980
If there's any changes at the PCR test.

120
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.980
<v 0>I believe this is hospitalization though, right? Or is this new cases?</v>

121
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.060
This new cases. Yeah. It's uh, look, it's not good,

122
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.220
but you know, um, someone pointed out that the CDC website is finally, uh,

123
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.540
got information on and about vitamin D and, and some other things, right.

124
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:59.730
They just put it on there. Justin, just December, which is like Jesus guys,
