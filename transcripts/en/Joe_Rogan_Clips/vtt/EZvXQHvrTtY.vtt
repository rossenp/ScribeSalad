00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.300
Now you cover how many different subjects in this?

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.050
<v 1>I, I cover eight different campaigns of denial.</v>

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.840
<v 0>It seems like for you in particular climate change is the most disturbing.</v>

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.420
<v 1>That's well, that's the one that threatens the future of human civilization.</v>

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.430
And the one that, that I got started on. Yeah. But, um, but yeah, I cover,

7
00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:26.030
I cover seven other industries, including slavery, radium.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.430
<v 2>Radium, radium, what's.</v>

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.920
<v 0>The industrial strength denial take on.</v>

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.570
<v 1>Radium. Radium is a crazy, crazy story. Um,</v>

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.400
radium is this insanely, uh, radioactive element that was discovered,

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.780
you know, around just a right, right around 1900 by the curies and France.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.660
And it was a mystery. I mean,

14
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:51.440
it was way more radioactive than uranium and people didn't even know what

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.780
radioactivity really meant, but there was a, you know,

16
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.280
this sort of aura of wizardry around it. And, and when they discovered it,

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.710
they didn't, well,

18
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.770
the first thing they discovered and they discovered this the hard way was that

19
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:07.610
it burned your flesh. It didn't burn it right away, but you'd carry some around.

20
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:11.600
And then in a few days you would have a burn there because it was sending off

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.460
all of this energy. So they thought, okay,

22
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.560
we have this flesh killing cell killing element. What can we do with it?

23
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.340
And they thought, well, let's try to kill cancer tumors,

24
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.610
which was actually a very good idea. And they experimented with that.

25
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:27.770
That was the, the medical use for radium.

26
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.070
We're going to put this radium next to a tumor and then we'll take it away and

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.740
it'll shrink and we can use the same radium for the next tumor.

28
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:37.250
And so it was a very efficient thing. They would put it at well,

29
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.510
they somehow would refine it and distill it into tiny, tiny little amounts.

30
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:44.690
And then they would put it in a needle or put it in a vial or something and just

31
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:48.620
position it near a tumor. It started out as, or,

32
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.950
and they had to refine it and refine it down, down, down, down, down. Um,

33
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.180
and so the governments at the time in Europe and, uh,

34
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.070
and also in the U S thought, great, here's this weird, crazy, valuable stuff.

35
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.690
Maybe we should control this,

36
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:07.310
or so we'd make sure it gets used to actually cure cancer. And, and in Europe,

37
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:10.160
that's pretty much what they did in the U S we tried to do that,

38
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.840
but the industry,

39
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:16.490
there was a brand new industry that was just forming and they stepped forward.

40
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.660
The first company was called standard chemical. They stepped forward and said,

41
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.990
no, no, no, no, no. If, if the government starts taking over radium,

42
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:28.580
because it's radioactive radium or, well, everything's a little radioactive,

43
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:32.240
where will this stop? This classic sort of slippery slope argument.

44
00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:34.610
And somehow it, it succeeded.

45
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.780
And so what happened was this mysterious and potent element became a,

46
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.010
another commercial project,

47
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.000
commercial product to be exploited by this,

48
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:45.530
this company standard chemical.

49
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.690
There were some others that later popped up standard.

50
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:51.230
Chemical was founded by this guy named Joe Flannery. And he was,

51
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.240
he had background is his family w w were morticians.

52
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.400
And then he went into industry and then he kind of a snake oil salesman

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.730
salesman, and he kind of failed, but he wanted with radium.

54
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.090
He told Congress to cure cancer. Eve had good motive,

55
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.010
but he also wanted a big market, right. Cancer, you know, just one disease.

56
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.200
And if you reuse the radium, that's not a market.

57
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.640
So he was determined to expand that market. He actually opened what,

58
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.050
what was called the first free radium clinic in the world in

59
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:24.370
1913 and Pittsburgh.

60
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.510
And he invited patients in and hire doctors,

61
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:33.330
and thousands of them were injected with radium or they

62
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:34.350
drank radium.

63
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.940
So if you can somehow prove that consuming radium is healthy,

64
00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:42.240
then you have a market, right? And many of these people did have cancer,

65
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.440
but it turns out that that injecting them with radium would actually kill them a

66
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:50.700
lot faster than the cancer would have. And one of the clinic doctors was,

67
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.470
was questioned before Congress. And he explained, well, the way he looked at it,

68
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:58.290
he was just shoving them over a little more quickly.

69
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.720
So he wasn't worried about the fact that he was,

70
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.990
he was killing the cancer patients and they weren't just treating cancer

71
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:06.930
patients. They were treating anybody, they were treating arthritis,

72
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.890
they were treating joint pain. And so they were,

73
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.260
you know, giving this very toxic substance to people with low level chronic

74
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.670
problems. And then he would, he actually formed his own, um,

75
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.780
medical journal.

76
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.740
And he would have his doctors write up the results of this and put it in there

77
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:29.550
and send it out to all the doctors. Uh, so yeah, I mean, it,

78
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.260
it was really pretty crazy,

79
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:36.210
but he did succeed in launching this health fad where

80
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:40.350
suddenly there were lots of products that contained radium. Now,

81
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.610
some of them said they did, but didn't, but, but many of them really did. Uh,

82
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.840
and you could buy your radium, get your radium and all kinds of different ways.

83
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.290
If you want a radio after active drink, you could drink it.

84
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.580
You could still get injected. You could take pills. You could,

85
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.680
if you want to soak in, in radium, you could buy bath salts, ointments.

86
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.180
There was radio. Yeah. Was radium toothpaste. Uh, yeah.

87
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.000
Um, and oh, and, and one of the more interesting ones there were, uh,

88
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.880
radioactive rectal suppositories,

89
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.730
and these were marketed, uh, basically for male sexual dysfunction.

90
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.640
That's not what they called it, but they,

91
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:26.670
they said this was for, as I recall,

92
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.020
weak distur discouraged men who wanted to perform the duties of a real man.

93
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.040
Um, so yeah, and that was, you know, I think what happens is if you're,

94
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.690
if you're going to sell a quack product,

95
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:40.590
you try to identify problems that people are kind of embarrassed about.

96
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.680
So they're less likely to go to their doctor that they'll buy it out of the back

97
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.360
of a magazine. And then if it doesn't work,

98
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.630
they're not going to complain about it. They're not going to Sue you. Um, so,

99
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:51.740
and, but these were not just marketed for that. They were marketed for colds.

100
00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:55.260
They were marketed for obesity, for constipation, for insanity.

101
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:59.720
That was a big one trying to cure insanity. So yeah, it becomes a health fad.

102
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.600
Um, how long does go on for well,

103
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.850
pro it pretty much fizzled out in the thirties largely because one

104
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:12.830
particularly prominent and wealthy individual could afford to poison himself

105
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.130
very thoroughly by drinking these radium drinks, uh, every day.

106
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.470
And ultimately his,

107
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.720
his facial bones started to dissolve, fell out.

108
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:26.390
He had like holes between his sinuses and his mouth.

109
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.730
This is actually what happened as well to a group of workers who were painting

110
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:34.790
radium paint onto watch dials, which is actually a more

111
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.910
well-known part of this history. Um,

112
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.110
a lot of young women were hired to paint radium onto watch styles,

113
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.880
not just watch Dells, they put them on.

114
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.140
<v 0>Can I practice these images? Oh,</v>

115
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.690
but you can see it up here called radium.

116
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.580
<v 3>Jaw, jaw necrosis.</v>

117
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.450
<v 0>This went on, look at that one guy was lower. Jaws is gone on the second row.</v>

118
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.520
So this, oh my God.

119
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.630
<v 4>So radium, this went on for 20 years.</v>

120
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.360
<v 1>Um, well, yes. I mean, the industry got going in the mid, uh,</v>

121
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.690
19 teens. Um, this, this one, man,

122
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:20.290
I was just talking about died in the early thirties, got lots of press.

123
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:24.520
And that helped the health fad. Part of it go away. The, the worker exposure,

124
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.110
the young women, usually who were disfigured and died from,

125
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.973
from this,

126
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.840
that part of the industry of radioactive paint lasted a bit longer,

127
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.830
uh, into the thirties. Um, they, when they began,

128
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.140
they taught these women and young women.

129
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.910
They might've been 15 when they got hired,

130
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.830
they taught them to make a nice sharp point on their paintbrush with their lips

131
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:51.700
and tongue. And because there was this health fat around radium,

132
00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:55.210
they told them that this would, would put a glow in their cheeks.

133
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.420
And you've seen these pictures that they really had some,

134
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.150
some change in their cheeks, but it wasn't a glow. They end it,

135
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.270
they told them it was good for them. Um,

136
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.040
and so a lot of them, not all of them, I mean, so, you know,

137
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.150
not everybody died,

138
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.920
which made it easier for the industry to actually blame them. And,

139
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.570
and later the industry would say that these people,

140
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:18.520
with these horrendous disfiguring diseases,

141
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.910
that they were suffering from a preexisting condition,

142
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.160
that this was somehow not the fault of radium that they had hired cripples

143
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.750
and, and other people who, who weren't super strong because this was easy work.

144
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.400
And when they got sick,

145
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:38.110
everybody blamed them and they were being punished for their generosity

146
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.900
of hiring these folks in the first place. And, and by the way,

147
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:45.280
these women had radioactive breath at this point. I mean,

148
00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:48.670
so it was not like there was any doubt that they had radium lodged.

149
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.930
<v 2>In there. What is radioactive breath? It means they're exhaling radon.</v>

150
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.850
So this was at measurable.

151
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.460
<v 1>Yeah. Even, even by the standards of the time. Oh my God. Now,</v>

152
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.560
now one thing about the radium industries, you know,

153
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.650
denials like that blaming the victim are appalling. But, uh,

154
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.950
one of the things we did see is that the leaders of that industry,

155
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:11.460
including the guy who invented that radioactive paint and including Joseph

156
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:16.350
Flannery, uh, died. And, and certainly the,

157
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.060
the rate direct the inventor of the paint died because of radium exposure.

158
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.020
His teeth had fallen out according to time magazine,

159
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:26.820
his fingers had been removed.

160
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.310
Nobody else covered that particularly gruesome detail,

161
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:32.280
but then he died of anemia. These are all radium induced ailments,

162
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.910
Joseph Flannery, the guy who launched standard chemical. Well,

163
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:39.390
he had this great idea that he had all this radioactive waste, right?

164
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.750
So he hired a botanist to find out if it could be a fertilizer.

165
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.200
And then they published a report that you should, yes.

166
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.790
Spread radioactive waste on your food crops because it's great. Um,

167
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.420
he actually had him spread waste on his own garden. Uh,

168
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.280
and then six years later, Flannery died and the industry didn't mention this,

169
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.600
but his birth certificate,

170
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:04.560
which I managed to dig up mentioned that he had a contributing factor in his

171
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:09.410
death of anemia, which is something that radium exposure causes. I mean,

172
00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:13.800
death certificate. Is that what you, oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Right.

173
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.950
His deaths are too. Thank you. Um, so yeah, he had anemia and,

174
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:22.800
and if he believed his own clinic, his own,

175
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.750
his own sales pitch, he probably drank more Rainium to treat anemia. Um, so,

176
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.150
so he did die. So, so in these two characters,

177
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:34.800
at least we have people believing what they said enough to actually kill

178
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.300
themselves as well as other people.

179
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.280
<v 0>So it seems again that this is, there's this human characteristic that this,</v>

180
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:43.580
this tendency, when you start making money, you start justifying,

181
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:46.730
you want to keep that money coming in. So you start justifying your actions,

182
00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:51.650
manipulating the facts and just continuing to push out whatever it

183
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.290
is that you're doing. That's allowing you to earn this.

184
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.120
<v 1>Yeah. Well, and you know,</v>

185
00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:58.910
one of the reasons I talk about Joe Flannery is that he's, he's, uh,

186
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:04.340
I think a really good example of a certain kind of person that we celebrate,

187
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:10.100
um, because they invent things and they make things happen and they build

188
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:14.740
businesses, the founders of industry. Um, and w we,

189
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.740
we know from psychological studies that,

190
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.760
you know, th well, let me, let me back up, there's a model. Uh,

191
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.530
when you think about how the mind works,

192
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:26.900
that that governs a lot of this research,

193
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:31.490
that we've got a going system and a stopping system and approach system and an

194
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:35.390
inhibition system. One of the things that, uh,

195
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.950
activates the approach system is power. And if you have an approach,

196
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:43.370
an active approach system, you are focused on your goal.

197
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.170
You're focused on reward. Meanwhile, the powerless are focused. The inhibition,

198
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.230
uh, part of the mind is more triggered by powerlessness,

199
00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:54.730
and you're more focused on risk. So if you're focused on reward,

200
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:56.620
you're not focused so much on risk.

201
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.970
You're not so focused so much on consequence for other people. Uh, and,

202
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.450
and so of course that gets you hailed as a visionary.

203
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.770
And Joseph Flannery was hailed as a visionary. And he did, you know,

204
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.980
he was bold. He was inventive. He worked hard, he built a business.

205
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.770
He just didn't ask, you know,

206
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:19.210
should we actually feed this cell killing

207
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:23.410
radioactive substance that fuses into people's bones permanently to people

208
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:24.940
without any evidence of safety?

209
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.920
Or should we just go for it and see how it works? And, uh, so you know,

210
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.200
that, that I think is,

211
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.980
is troubling in the sense that you've got industry leaders who fit a certain

212
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.940
psychological profile, who rise to the tops of their industries,

213
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:43.150
precisely because they are reward focused.

214
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.980
But if they are not balanced out by other people whose job it is to say,

215
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:51.310
what about the risks? What about the consequences? What could go wrong here?

216
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.620
You have a recipe for disaster.

217
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.730
<v 0>And also ignorance at the time.</v>

218
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.990
No one really understood that kind of stuff in terms of what the general

219
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:06.570
public probably didn't really know what radiation could do to you.

220
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.340
<v 1>The general public didn't know at all. Um, and in fact, radioactivity,</v>

221
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.240
you know, there was this incredible aura around it. I mean, it was energy,

222
00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:16.620
it was stimulation.

223
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:20.940
That's one of the reasons it got used for sexual dysfunction and other sorts of

224
00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:24.960
treatments. Yeah. We don't know. And that's the problem with the case of a lot.

225
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.450
Yeah. Me too, with the case of a whole lot of these folks,

226
00:13:27.451 --> 00:13:31.110
the consumers of these products, we really don't know much about what happened.

227
00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:35.850
We know more about the radium girls who were the ones who, who used this paint.

228
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.360
<v 2>God, it's so disturbing. It's yeah. It's yeah.</v>
