00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.410
<v 2>It's just interesting that you were able to fight and to train a full camp for a</v>

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:11.160
guy like Vulcan Nowicki, especially a rematch with no sparring,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.830
with no partners with no nothing.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.780
<v 1>We had a lot of, we had a lot of like mental stuff, mental training, you know,</v>

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.340
that was a lot of mental things and visualization.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.740
Like I got to visualize or even just think of, think of new, new ways to move,

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.890
or, uh, I got to think of ways to set up stuff.

9
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.190
Like I just had more time to myself to think about actually the actual fight

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.640
and, and whatever. And then even with the, uh, with the sparring,

11
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.560
like the second fight for the Kotara, we didn't spar by.

12
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.500
I moved with my partners, you know, we grappled or we had up, we had ideas of,

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.940
well, this is how he moves. So I just got used to the movement and,

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.550
and we keyed on, on certain things and that's it.

15
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.430
But it wasn't nothing ever like cracking you, you know, like I would get,

16
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.370
I mean, you know how it is, you see all of these guys, they say like, oh,

17
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.220
I got hurt sparring. I got her support. And that's all my injuries came.

18
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.910
I got hurt from grappling hardest sparring hard. So if you just take that out,

19
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.780
you know, like you get a 200% of yourself, but it comes a point.

20
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.240
Like everybody thinks I'm telling everybody to start sparring.

21
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:07.770
You know what I'm telling? The young kid just toss boring.

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.580
I'm not telling the young kid to stop sparring when I was 16, I had to spar.

23
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.170
But it comes a point where you sparring enough to the point where everything

24
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:20.250
happens, even fights. Like I fought injured, I sparred injured. You know, I got,

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.910
I got,

26
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.590
I got hurt at to come to stuff like you need these times before the show,

27
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.190
because when it comes in the show and you get hurt in a fight or something,

28
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.890
you panic, you get buzzed in the fight, you panic.

29
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.270
But then if you do it in the sparring or these amateur fights, then it's simple.

30
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.300
But when you get to that second, yeah. When you get to that certain point,

31
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.630
then you start supplying and you save a brain. Because like right now,

32
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.860
I would say at least 85 to 87%,

33
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:51.240
or even close to 91% of the UFC fighters, you don't have to, you know,

34
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:54.180
if you didn't come to, to, to, to, uh, contender series,

35
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.570
I think you don't have to really a spar anymore. You know,

36
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:00.900
like we're all at a high level radio thinking and doing this,

37
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:04.410
like there's other ways that you could do to figure stuff out, you know?

38
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.470
And that's just what I think, you know, I'm not telling you to do it. You guys.

39
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.520
<v 0>Do a lot of drills.</v>

40
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.080
<v 1>With pals pills, with pads or even drills, uh, drills on drills, you know, like,</v>

41
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.880
you know, not like not really Dutch way, but like more, uh,

42
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.230
towards a fighter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we practice it. Yeah.

43
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.590
I'll practice it. You know, like we look, we look for, um,

44
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.950
whenever I watch tape, we look for consistencies, uh,

45
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.370
guys that they do consistent movements all the time and we work for those

46
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.110
moments. And then we go, we apply, we ask my partner to go. And now it's much,

47
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.990
it's much more easier to ask someone to, uh,

48
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.700
replicate this guy for me while we're moving versus tax someone to replicate

49
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.760
somebody when we're sparring hard. Cause I would spar hard with them.

50
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.960
They start getting, getting to beat, and they'd be like, Frick. This,

51
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:56.190
I give him a better look when I'm training, when I'm doing myself.

52
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.750
So I'm going to go to that. But that's not it.

53
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.090
Even if you give me a better as yourself, I'm trying to,

54
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.010
I'm trying to get ready for this guy. You know what I mean?

55
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.300
And a lot of people that's when Eagle and stuff come in and D and so on, so on.

56
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.980
So I didn't go.

57
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.730
I think so we figured out a way where it worked for me and you guys got to see,

58
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.880
you know, it's like, I just, I felt so good. My body, everything was like,

59
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.850
everything was fine. I felt great. If.

60
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.560
<v 0>You don't understand how good Calvin caterer is,</v>

61
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:21.550
you don't understand how good your.

62
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.550
<v 1>Performances. Cause yeah. I talked to you, I thought Kevin K was,</v>

63
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.550
and it takes two. And I tell everybody would, um,

64
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.010
would this let the numbers and stuff? You know, like the,

65
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.750
the reason why I didn't hit this numbers against, uh, against our Taikos,

66
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.140
cause we went only four rounds. You know what I mean? Like just like guys,

67
00:03:39.141 --> 00:03:40.960
like our take is a different beast too, you know?

68
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.660
I think so the rest said what he said and that's what happened in that fight.

69
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:47.200
But like Qatar, it was had a, like was crazy.

70
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.190
Cause one of the rounds I think so like the third or fourth round I hit him and

71
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.440
uh, he was just gone. Like I was like,

72
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.940
he was gone at 10 and got around and I was like,

73
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.400
I'll just kinda not walking off for the fit wrong. There's no way.

74
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.950
And jumping up and down. Yeah. Like, like,

75
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.410
like it was the first round I was like, I was like, okay then there's my answer.

76
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.940
Uh what'd you feel it getting punched? Some of my friends were going to do this.

77
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.970
<v 0>No, he's tough as, man.</v>

78
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:15.070
Because there were a lot of moments in that fight where he could have quit.

79
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.600
<v 1>You could have, and it's crazy. Cause like you see it, you see him,</v>

80
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.430
you see him get to that moment. Like,

81
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.880
I feel it like it's right there and he just throw like a bombing.

82
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.350
He landed on me. I'm like, I'm like what? I like what I'm like,

83
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:30.640
come on man. And they're like,

84
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.820
I hear every day I could hear his corner yelling at him and stuff and this and

85
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.360
that. And I'm like, God it cater. I was like, you know, I was like,

86
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.290
I was like one time. I was like, uh, um, well, it was funny.

87
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:44.770
It was at one time in a fight. Like he was just throwing it.

88
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:49.060
He somehow landed a left hook or overhand on me and he was on the fence and I

89
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:52.540
was like, well, if I was about to get finished, like come on care, just like,

90
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:55.120
come on, just do it. But then, you know, at the end of the day, it's like,

91
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.600
it's not my job. You know, I can't, I can't focus on what the ref to do,

92
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.270
what he's, what is, uh, if his team is going to throw in the ties,

93
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.580
got focused on him, you know? And I think they should have stopped that.

94
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.330
<v 0>Fight at any point in.</v>

95
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.040
<v 1>Time. I mean, at the end of the day, I'm in cater shoes,</v>

96
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.780
like me talking as a fighter, no way I was like, give me a shot. And this guy,

97
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.900
you know, he's a puncher, he's a puncher puncher.

98
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.900
Like this guy can like put someone down, you know? But you know,

99
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.330
it was funny cause like Teddy, Alice said the same thing,

100
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:25.300
but Teddy Alice was like telling me when I was on his show. He was like, oh,

101
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:30.010
he was like, but max, you never got dropped. So I don't know the odds of a,

102
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.370
the odds of him knocking you out. Cause he's a puncher puncher.

103
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.410
He stood not there. You know, it's slim, but it is there.

104
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:38.530
But at the end of the day, I can't speak on that. You know?

105
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.590
Cause as a fighter I'd be like, you know, leave, leave me in there. You know,

106
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.430
I want to fight, you know, like even like even my way with even like,

107
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.270
if you have been shipped, you know, you want to find the best guy. Right. And,

108
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.310
and the way I look at it is like, if it's the best,

109
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.240
it's not a fight is a fight until,

110
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.780
until it's over. And then it's, people's pers uh, perceptions on the fight.

111
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.570
So after the five rounds, then it's a fight. You know? Like I,

112
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.000
but I taught this supposed to be the two best guys in the world.

113
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.210
You know what I mean? Like my, my take on it was like, why,

114
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.200
why don't we just have these fights? Yeah, we have the rounds. We just go on to,

115
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.090
someone wins the fight.

116
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.540
Instead of we keep this perception out of it, we just keep going wrong.

117
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.560
And after five rounds, guess what? We're going to six. Guess what?

118
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.270
We went to say, we're going to someone quit.

119
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.150
That's how you find the best fighter in the world at that way.

120
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.280
<v 0>Jack Johnson style. Why.</v>

121
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.890
<v 1>Not? You know, that's the way I think, cause it's just perception.</v>

122
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.210
Is this a perception? Right? Because.

123
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.520
<v 0>I'll never do that in America, but they might do it in Asia.</v>

124
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.500
Maybe you could talk one FC.

125
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.550
<v 1>I might be doing some wild stuff like that. I, that they see some wild stuff.</v>
