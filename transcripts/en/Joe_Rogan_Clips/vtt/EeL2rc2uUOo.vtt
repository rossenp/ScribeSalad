00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.270
<v 1>Experience. Do you have a hot take on this handy? What's your hot take?</v>

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.390
<v 0>I get text messages from people saying, you know,</v>

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:12.690
give me the inside scoop as to what's happening and what I should do.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.460
And I don't have a good answer.

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.890
I have the same information sources that everybody else does.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.500
<v 1>My concern is, uh,</v>

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
not that we shouldn't protect people that are sick and people that are old.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.100
My concern is that these decisions are being done by politicians and that they,

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.870
they want to do this so that they can be elected come reelection.

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.470
They don't want people to be upset at them for not acting.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.900
And so they're making these decisions and they're not showing us exactly

13
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.190
how they're going to get out of this.

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.820
Like w when you're shutting down Los Angeles for a month,

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.460
did just the staggering amount of people that are going to be in debt. And,

16
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.130
and, uh,

17
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.170
and there was some number that we looked it up recently of the amount of people

18
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:01.110
that live check to check. It's crazy. It's like half of.

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.520
<v 0>The average American,</v>

20
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:07.470
the stat I saw was that they cannot absorb an expense outside of the normal,

21
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:08.580
over $400.

22
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
<v 1>Right. That's gone. That's already gone. So already, most Americans are. Now,</v>

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.060
just with this dip, and then they're talking about extending this to April 19th.

24
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.900
I just don't, I don't know if they have a plan.

25
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.090
I don't know how they're going to buy their way out of this. Like,

26
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:26.430
what do you do? How do you, how do you help those folks?

27
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.050
<v 0>I mean, I'm the wrong person to ask about that, but I would,</v>

28
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.340
I would hope at least at the politicians, I'm sure there's an aspect. Always.

29
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.340
If you are a politician in the back of your mind,

30
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.040
I have to conduct myself in a way where I can get reelected.

31
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.480
Like everything is probably viewed through that,

32
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:47.100
but I would hope at least that they're viewing it through the

33
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.400
humanity perspective. And as far as the decisions they're making,

34
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.960
I don't think anybody knows what.

35
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.420
<v 1>To do. Yeah. I don't think anybody knows what to do either.</v>

36
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.330
They feel like they have to do something. So they're doing something

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.690
we all need to look at Idris Elba. Cause that guy looks great. He does.

38
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.250
He's still he's. He's got it. He's got it. And it was, I mean, he seems fine,

39
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.860
Tom Hanks. He says he just kinda tired.

40
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.683
<v 0>It's uh,</v>

41
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.100
I can't make heads or tails of it because if you go the longer you spend on your

42
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:19.230
phone, I think the more or your computer,

43
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.680
I think the more confused you'll actually become, because I don't know,

44
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.091
to be honest,

45
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:27.210
who's telling the truth and who is not there's stories of people saying, Hey,

46
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.830
I tested positive for this. I don't have any symptoms. Hey, I live in Italy.

47
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:36.450
Three people are dead in my hallway and I got sick and I don't feel that good.

48
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.230
And then you watch people walking around in zombie apocalypse suits with,

49
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.210
you know, mop level four gear on not listening to, you know,

50
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.080
how we was walking on the beach yesterday. And you know, there's,

51
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.970
there are people there's a huge social bubbles.

52
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:53.910
They don't want to be near each other. And from what I can tell,

53
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.300
or from what I'm reading, and again, it's so heads or tails, you know,

54
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.480
you basically have to be coughed or sneezed on or a surface that one of these

55
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.380
infected people have touched or close proximity.

56
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.380
And there's people on the beach walking around and hazmat suits.

57
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.980
<v 1>Well, the time it's a wild time because of that,</v>

58
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.720
because there's no clear information.

59
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.940
And because you're seeing some people that look really healthy and then you've

60
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.350
seen the stories that come out of Italy.

61
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.980
One thing to take into consideration with Italy is Italy has one of the oldest

62
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.570
populations. They have a lot of old people and a ton of smokers.

63
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.200
Those two factors are huge here because this is a respiratory disease.

64
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.920
<v 0>Well, don't, they also have, uh, in comparison to the rest of the world,</v>

65
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.310
more generations living in a single household. Yes.

66
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.570
Which I would imagine is going to be, you know, as those generations move on,

67
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.570
you're going to have higher risk people living with people who are lower risk,

68
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:44.620
but transmitting it.

69
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.330
<v 1>Yes. That's the real concern.</v>

70
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.390
The real concern is you're going to transmit it to your grandma or someone who's

71
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:53.920
sick. There was a guy it's weird how the news gives you these stories,

72
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.670
because this was a guy that was 34 years old, that died. And they said,

73
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.090
he just got back from Disneyland. You're like. I thought you live forever.

74
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:05.530
Once you go to Disneyland, this is crazy. He just got back from Disneyland. How,

75
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.250
like the fact that they put that he just got back from Disneyland was it's all

76
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.960
heartstring pulling stuff. But then if you go deep into the story, this,

77
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.780
this young man just got over testicular cancer,

78
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.160
he had bronchitis and he had asthma.

79
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.850
So there's a lot going on there. He had the deck stacked against him.

80
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.870
We had the deck stacked against him. He's he's immune compromised for sure,

81
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.410
because of coming off of the testicular cancer.

82
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:35.230
And then on top of that with asthma and bronchitis,

83
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.120
and then he gets a respiratory disease.

84
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.190
Those are the people that really have to worry.

85
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.930
And I really wish there was a clear way to S to

86
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:47.770
help them other than shutting down everything for a month.

87
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.970
<v 0>I was talking to Evan heifer this morning called out of the blue.</v>

88
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:53.980
And we were having kind of a conversation about this.

89
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.280
And he brought something up that just about the, you know,

90
00:04:57.281 --> 00:04:59.920
the narrative and it's, to me what's happening right now is,

91
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.020
is it's interesting from a couple of perspectives for one I've

92
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:09.730
traveled into world enough and seen people living in a variety of different

93
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.920
living conditions. That right now, in my opinion,

94
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.840
at least people are getting a glimpse into what it is like to live

95
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:21.130
in the non first world where when maybe you didn't have a grocery store,

96
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:21.731
but if you go there,

97
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.460
you can't get everything that you want and you can't travel all, you know,

98
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:25.330
when you always want to,

99
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.220
and you don't have the freedom of movement that you want.

100
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.170
A lot of people live their life, take the virus out of the equation.

101
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.770
A lot of people live their life day-to-day and situations just like this,

102
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.280
or much worse. So I think it's should be eyeopening,

103
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.990
hopefully for people that there's a thin margin between, you know,

104
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.770
the excess and luxury that we have in the first world and how fast that can be

105
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.600
removed. We can start stepping down that staircase. Um,

106
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.180
and it shows to me, you know, I,

107
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.150
I try to view the videos that you see online of people,

108
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.910
fist fighting for toilet paper. I think those are the anomaly.

109
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:03.800
And I try not to let the anomaly paint the norm.

110
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.660
I don't think most people are doing that,

111
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.280
but there are people that are doing that.

112
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.690
And there are people who are going in and they're hoarding and buying it's.

113
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.820
I don't think the toilet papers are good example.

114
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.600
I can give you 15 different ways to wipe your without toilet paper.

115
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.350
Like you're going to be okay. Like if do you have a garden hose? I mean,

116
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:24.410
we can start there. I'm not saying it's the most sanitary tub. Yeah.

117
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.410
I've I think I've wiped my with a handful of gravel one time.

118
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.170
Cause that's all that I had. I'm not recommending it, but I'm just, you know,

119
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:34.910
really. Oh, for sure. It was what was in like close. Yeah. I mean, why not?

120
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.990
I mean, I have had many make it cleaner. I didn't really check.

121
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.220
I didn't have too much time,

122
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.370
but I've had many days where I started with two socks and ended with one I've

123
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:47.120
had t-shirts that became tank tops. I mean, there's options that you have,

124
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:48.950
none of these I'm recommending for anybody.

125
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.740
But what I'm saying is the toilet paper is not going to make the difference

126
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:53.570
between life or death. A weird one to horde.

127
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.460
<v 1>It's a weird one that people are freaking out about. Oh,</v>

128
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.270
because they're scared of.

129
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.430
<v 0>Food. Well, but they're scared.</v>

130
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.910
And I find that when people get scared,

131
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.710
like we were talking about right before we went on, um, when people get drunk,

132
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.170
a couple of the layers of their protective,

133
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.470
like this is who I want to portray myself. It starts to strip away.

134
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.880
And what I see are people who are super concerned about me

135
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.620
and far less concerned about we and the conversation I was having with Evan was,

136
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.280
you know, it'd be great if we were talking about, you know,

137
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.980
the people who are going to get crushed and then not a, you know,

138
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.690
an economic expert by any stretch,

139
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.270
but are the ones you already talked about are living paycheck to paycheck.

140
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.360
How about the elderly who are in the high risk category that are on social

141
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:36.590
security, fixed income.

142
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.190
And they can't even go out right now because they don't feel comfortable getting

143
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:41.840
groceries that people are going to get destroyed.

144
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.700
And I would love to have a conversation about a social construct or

145
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.910
relationship that we have where we start talking about, you know,

146
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:53.060
what are we going to do to get food and aid to these people?

147
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:56.630
What are we going to do to come together and help everybody out instead of and

148
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:00.530
target hoarding toilet paper. Yeah. And it's, to me,

149
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:04.790
a lot of that is driven by fear. And a lot of is driven by panic.

150
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:08.540
And believe me, I'm not an expert at all, probably on anything in my life.

151
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.240
But one thing that I have some experience in is, uh,

152
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.180
surviving and thriving in high risk situations that are high stress,

153
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.000
which is kind of what's going on right now. It's a different type of stress.

154
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.600
And the most dangerous thing you can do is lose control of your emotions or let

155
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.730
your emotions take over your decision-making cycle,

156
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.610
which is what I see people doing. And it's, it's so dangerous.

157
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.150
And I think we need to start finding ways to back away from that and start

158
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:31.580
talking about the, we greater than me.

159
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.440
I don't think there's a toilet paper shortage.

160
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.590
There's a shortage of people with common sense who are buying too much toilet

161
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:39.710
paper, which is freaking other people out. So they're buying too much stuff,

162
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.870
which they don't actually need, which is freaking up. You know what I mean?

163
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:43.280
It's just this cascading effect.

164
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.140
<v 1>Yeah. It's uh, a fear cascade. Yeah. It's not good.</v>

165
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.540
It's not good. It's also,

166
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.510
this is the first time we've as a nation have been tested like this with a

167
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.800
crisis where the country had to shut down. We don't have any experience in it.

168
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.350
So we don't know what to expect. What a health.

169
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.580
<v 0>It gives me a little bit of flashes is the right after nine 11,</v>

170
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.040
because we have had times where the country shut down, but it was very,

171
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:08.874
very brief.

172
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.920
But I remember like the solidarity after nine 11 and it was all about we and not

173
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:14.371
about me.

174
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:18.420
And I hope that it trends that direction because who knows when this is going to

175
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.720
end. I mean, my kids are out of school, I think for the year. Yeah.

176
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.590
<v 1>I think mine as well.</v>

177
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.510
<v 0>And you know what, if you're a single parent and you have to work, right.</v>

178
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.950
And what if your kids are getting to their three meals per day at school? And I,

179
00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:34.410
and I, you know, the school system in Montana where I live is already, you know,

180
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:36.510
they're actually doing a really good job come to these locations.

181
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.500
You can get free meals,

182
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.750
but that's assuming the kid has a way to get there because of.

183
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.530
<v 1>Montana's scalable. Right? There's a million people in the entire state.</v>

184
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.530
The state's a massive, it's not out of control.

185
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.600
California is 40 million people and there's one spot it's so preposterous. Yeah.

186
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.870
And there's so much poverty. There's so many people that are,

187
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.760
we're barely hanging on as it is.

188
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.070
And now they're off the cliff and they don't know what to do.

189
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:02.700
And there's no real protection set in place now to keep them from being evicted.

190
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:05.820
I don't believe in unscrupulous landlords,

191
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:07.950
people that have been looking for a reason to get rid of these people in the

192
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:11.970
first place, man, who knows, who knows, who knows, what's going to go on,

193
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.000
it's real confusing. It's real confusing.

194
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.970
And if you've seen the stats like the D here, I'm going to show this to you.

195
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.150
Jamie, maybe we could put this up on the, on the screen because it's kinda,

196
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.620
it's, it's,

197
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:26.760
it's really kinda crazy that this is the choice that they've made to shut

198
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.550
everything down. Um, here, I'm sending this to right now.

199
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.610
<v 0>Well, you know, it's funny, right? They made that choice last night.</v>

200
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.690
So we got to, we got here Thursday.

201
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.620
So a day before they made that decision and the decision was made last night and

202
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:42.750
went into effect in exactly the same amount of people or.

203
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.190
<v 1>Yeah, exactly the same amount. I mean, there's no real law. I mean, it's,</v>

204
00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:50.130
it's more of a recommendation than anything,

205
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:51.810
but they do have to close businesses.

206
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.350
<v 0>Well, I think there, we're hoping that people do buy into a social contract.</v>

207
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:59.640
Like maybe we can care about the we over me, but I just,

208
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.380
you see people not doing that when they're pressed and that,

209
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.310
and that gets rough.
