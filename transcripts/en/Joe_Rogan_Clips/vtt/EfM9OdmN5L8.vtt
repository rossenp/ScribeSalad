00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 1>Experience. What do you think about all this talk like Elizabeth,</v>

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:08.640
Warren's talked about it and some other candidates have talked about as mother

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.220
politicians have talked about breaking up these big companies,

5
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.460
breaking up Facebook it's too big breakup, Google breakup, Twitter.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.750
What do you think about that?

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.200
<v 0>Well, um, I think we have to study what happened to standard oil.</v>

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.070
What happened to standard oil? Um, standard oil. They, uh,

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.810
broke it up and it became, uh, Exxon Chevron,

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.970
Texaco. Uh,

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.140
I think BP don't quote me on that one. But.

12
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.040
<v 1>Does anybody have brand loyalty to gas? Does anybody like dude,</v>

13
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:38.970
I'm a Chevron man.

14
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.420
<v 0>They create those, those cards, right? Those oh loyalty.</v>

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.480
<v 1>Cards. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's how they create a loyalty program here.</v>

16
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:48.570
It is the evolution of standard oil. Jamie pulled it up on the screen. Yeah,

17
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:53.010
there you go. Wow. So standard oil was too big. Yeah. Like, this place.

18
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.600
Right. We have to move it around a little bit in 1911 standard oil of Kentucky,

19
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.220
1911. They did it. Right.

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.610
<v 0>So if you look at it, it's broken up in a, I think it says 34, right?</v>

21
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
34 companies. Right. So you see on the left, right. And in as you go,

22
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:12.000
what do you see? You see a consolidation, don't you? Hmm. You see these emerges.

23
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.190
Yeah. So when you break up a monopoly,

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.680
you're not really breaking up with not monopoly.

25
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.860
What you're doing is you're creating a divide and conquer dynamic. So it's like,

26
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.340
okay, I'll let my brother control this one. My sister control that one.

27
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:26.940
My cousin controls this and you actually corner the market.

28
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.140
So breaking up would not believe it. Isn't exactly a good thing.

29
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.240
<v 1>In that case. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.690
<v 0>In that case. And I think we'll see the same thing with Google.</v>

31
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.120
If we break up Google or what you're going to do is just have little

32
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:43.800
subsidiaries or little satellite things that will just control a certain

33
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:45.180
segment under a different name,

34
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:49.200
which would make it harder to track back to its source. So, you know,

35
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.680
when I say, you know, break up monopoly, I think that the establishments like,

36
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.780
yeah, come on, break me up, baby.

37
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.530
<v 1>You think so? I don't think they want to lose any control.</v>

38
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.120
I certainly don't think Facebook does.

39
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
It's not choosing to the Zuckerberg forever. Uh, right.

40
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.470
Aren't they trying to get rid of him, the board members like acid.

41
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.360
<v 0>Day claim, but get that robot out.</v>

42
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.240
<v 1>Of here, let's lose. He drinks water. Right? He does look like.</v>

43
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.073
<v 0>A robot, but.</v>

44
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.920
<v 1>When he drank water in front of Congress, but isn't it.</v>

45
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.250
<v 0>Socialism that's socialism when you,</v>

46
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.590
when the government comes in and tells you what you can do with your

47
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.080
cooperation. Yeah. That's socialism. So,

48
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:29.280
so what I feel is like the powers that be are pushing socialism, or like,

49
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:33.750
we can use this as an excuse to infiltrate corporations and, you know, blah,

50
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.560
blah, blah, blah, blah, and can start controlling this internet space.

51
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.050
So the internet space is now common.

52
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.130
<v 1>I'm of the opinion though,</v>

53
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:45.120
that if we believe in freedom of speech and you create something that's so big

54
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.800
that it's essentially a town square,

55
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.720
which is what I think these platforms are you. If you ban people,

56
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.390
especially if you ban people for, like learn to code,

57
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.740
like things that don't make any sense.

58
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.230
There's people that are getting banned for some pretty ridiculous ideas. Yeah.

59
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.810
That as soon as you start doing something like that,

60
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.570
you are going against the fundamental ideas.

61
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.970
This country is founded on absolute freedom of speech.

62
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.860
I think it's incredibly important that if you have someone saying something

63
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.920
that you think is wrong or is, is hurtful,

64
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.780
there should be an avenue where people can examine that and talk about it and

65
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.590
combat it with good speech with speech. That makes sense.

66
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.890
<v 0>Yeah. Well, you know, a couple of years ago, last year, I forget. No,</v>

67
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.970
it was about a couple of years ago. Um, I was lambasted for, uh,

68
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.070
defending white nationalists. I mean, you know,

69
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:34.690
when they first got deep platform,

70
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.360
some of them got deep platform were just white nationalist period. I'm like,

71
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.360
well, if this is how these people feel, let's listen to them,

72
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.580
let's listen to their gripes. What are they mad about? Right.

73
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:45.210
And then people are like, oh, how could you, these people are racist.

74
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.040
And I'm like, I don't care if they're racist. Like that doesn't affect me.

75
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.670
Right? Like I'm not asking them for a job. So they can't be racist towards me.

76
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.790
You know what I mean? But, um, when you have these,

77
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.330
these groups that people call fringe,

78
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.100
I feel like the people that are fringe are the test for

79
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.740
freedom of speech. It's not the people in the middle.

80
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.340
It's the fringe groups on the outside. If they don't have freedom of speech,

81
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.820
everybody in the middle of the group. So I stood up and I was like, yo,

82
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:15.460
let these dudes talk, like, stop doing that. Like, like, you know,

83
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:17.920
I don't care if they're racist or whatever people call me names,

84
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.910
but then now you see it coming down and we lost, you know, Louis Farrakhan,

85
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:26.010
he got D platform. He lost his verification, you know? And it's like, he's like.

86
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.530
<v 1>Was there anything specifically that he said that allowed him to do that?</v>

87
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.590
Or did they just make a sweeping cause they got rid of my, well,

88
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:33.820
they got rid of Gavin McInnes.

89
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.030
They got rid of a bunch of people that were on Instagram and Facebook that they

90
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:38.170
hadn't de platformed.

91
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.250
But it didn't seem like there was anything that happened that caused them to do

92
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:42.610
that.

93
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.470
It seemed like they just made some sort of a decision that I think was probably

94
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.890
based on preparing for the 20, 20 elections. Absolutely.

95
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.570
<v 0>So what I think what happened was, uh, the, uh, uh,</v>

96
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.200
the banning of Louis Farrakhan, it was just a theory, but they were like,

97
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.540
all right, if we ban these conservatives,

98
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.120
the conservative crowd is going to just go ape. Right.

99
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.300
But if we throw them Louis Farrakhan,

100
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.440
it'll kind of settle things down a little bit. Cause it'll look like were.

101
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.310
<v 1>Fair. I think.</v>

102
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.400
<v 0>You're exactly right. Yeah. So I'm like, so that's what they did. And like, oh,</v>

103
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.880
let's throw them in there and you know, smooth things over.

104
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.100
<v 1>That's exactly what I thought when I saw it. Yeah. I was like this seamless,</v>

105
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.993
weird.

106
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.160
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It's like, they have to justify.</v>

107
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.270
<v 1>Like, no, we got rid of him too, you know? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.050
It's a, it's a strange time because there's,

109
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.830
even though there is gab and there's mines and there's is a couple other

110
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.790
startups that are trying to make their way into the Jordan Peterson one.

111
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:43.870
And there's nothing that really stands out. And once someone starts,

112
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:48.360
once a giant group of people starts using something, unless it's like, what's,

113
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:50.980
what's hilarious is when they, one of them vanish like MySpace,

114
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:55.090
how badly did they match my space? Because MySpace had it all.

115
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.050
They had everybody and it just died and still around.

116
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.190
But now it's like some French music publishing platform. It's very weird.

117
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.750
You know, it still exists.

118
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.700
But what Twitter is right now and what Facebook is right now and what

119
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.320
Instagram is right now, it seems like there's no real competitors per se,

120
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.140
specifically YouTube. There's no real competitors.

121
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.210
<v 0>Because when you know, I don't wanna, you know,</v>

122
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.330
Dogpile on no minds or gab or anything,

123
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:30.410
but the problem is when you build a social network and this is why I will not

124
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:33.110
build a social network, at least not in the next 10 years,

125
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.300
you have to understand that you can't build a social network that mimics

126
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.620
another one has to break. It has to be different.

127
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.510
That's why snap is still here. Right? Snap is inside a certain demographic.

128
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.000
That's my daughters, you know, generation, right.

129
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.280
That's them right there on snap. So when you build these things,

130
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.050
you really have to sit down and say like, you know, what's the,

131
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.400
what are we going to focus on? Like with mine's right? You post videos,

132
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.730
you post photos. And then how do the photos appear? Right?

133
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:10.790
So when I look at mine's mine's is my Instagram. When you,

134
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.300
when you look at mines on mobile, that the font's really small. So it's like,

135
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.550
I can't read this. So I'm just going to use this for photos.

136
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.440
When I put the photos, it pops up, right?

137
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.550
So it's like his mind's going to go that route.

138
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.340
Are they going to go the video route? Are they going to go the tweet route?

139
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.570
You got to pick one and then grow from there. If you look at Twitter, Twitter,

140
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.900
DiNapoli's Fitch features in the beginning, you just had tweaked.

141
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.130
I'd say there was no threads. There's none of that.

142
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.340
So you have to start at your core, but when you,

143
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.110
the other problem they do is they try to build these social networks, um,

144
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.060
completely robust, right? With all the bells and whistles of the giants.

145
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.020
NaPro you gotta start small and slim and then let your audience tell you what

146
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:58.760
the next feature is. So what would.

147
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.710
<v 1>You, if you were going to start one up, what would it be?</v>

148
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.350
<v 0>Or do you know information? No, it's not.</v>

149
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:05.720
I don't want to give it out and information. I think information should be free,

150
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:08.420
but you know, I, I hate,

151
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.900
I hate the idea that people want to create social networks. I'm like,

152
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:12.470
they exist.

153
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.530
Let's use the ones that exist and let's just figure out how to make them better.

154
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:15.920
Right.

155
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.641
<v 1>When you do that,</v>

156
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.420
then those have so much power because they can dictate who's on and who's not

157
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:20.780
on.

158
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.110
<v 0>Right. So what you do is when you have something like a Twitter,</v>

159
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.180
you use your Twitter to congregate your minds. Right. But then you're,

160
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:33.650
you know, you're your Bill's of the world. You're,

161
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.300
you're Andrew Toby's of the world have to listen to the community and,

162
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.860
and then cure, rate their product around what the community needs. Right.

163
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.330
Andrew Toba figured out what the dissenter, when he found out, oh,

164
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:51.350
the internet is blocking comments. So he created, you know,

165
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:55.160
you can comment on anywhere on the internet and then Google Chrome smashed.

166
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.370
Right. I said, get that out of here.

167
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.490
<v 1>Yeah. Why did they do that? What was the justification for getting rid of that?</v>

168
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.340
<v 0>They want a sensor. They didn't want a sensor.</v>

169
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.110
<v 1>Inflammation. Is that what they want to do?</v>

170
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:07.440
Or they want to keep a competitor from using their platform and profiting off of

171
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.640
it. That's how I looked at it.

172
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.460
I looked at it from a marketing or a business perspective.

173
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.020
<v 0>I ain't worried about his name because.</v>

174
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.690
<v 1>It could have been, but if it becomes huge, I mean,</v>

175
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:18.450
anything can become huge if it's useful. Yeah.

176
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.170
It seemed useful to me that they were going to be able to comment on anything.

177
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.200
You'll have like a little link. And if you use gab,

178
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.300
you can comment on anything that comes up. Yeah.

179
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.620
<v 0>Yeah. You can look at it like that. I don't, I feel like, you know, they,</v>

180
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:33.720
their budgets is so huge. They, they, you know,

181
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:37.380
their cash reserves are so huge that they're not worried about competition at

182
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.680
all. You know, what they're worried about is, uh,

183
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.080
controlling thought and,

184
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.940
and that's their primary goal control thought, right.

185
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.980
For the betterment of the ruling class. And that's, to me, that's,

186
00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:57.210
that's the end all be all of it all. Um, but you, uh,

187
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.580
these, these, you know, the, these, these people that create tech products,

188
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:06.030
like when we create Coinbase app, or for example, my app, Jeff AtoZ,

189
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.540
Jeff it's eyes, do you only do one thing on different ties?

190
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.580
The only thing you can do is, uh,

191
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.180
save a video or ju or Jif from Twitter.

192
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.620
I always call it GIF.

193
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.513
<v 1>Is it Jeff?</v>

194
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.240
<v 0>I think it's.</v>

195
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.110
<v 1>I think it's CIF. I've never, I don't think I ever hear anybody say it could.</v>

196
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.943
<v 0>Be correct.</v>

197
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.180
<v 1>That'd be correct. Do you know what you call it? Jamie? I call it a GIF. GIF.</v>

198
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.650
GIF. GIF is peanut butter. Right?

199
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.600
<v 0>Jeff has peanut butter, but our app does one thing.</v>

200
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.530
Right. And people love it.

201
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.940
When I first came on as a co-founder, this app did more than that.

202
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.800
And when it did more than that, it didn't do as well as it does. Now,

203
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.210
what it used to do, uh, we had incentives, uh, to, uh,

204
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.620
share the app. You could edit G uh, gifts. Uh, you could,

205
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.640
um, put text on them, um, uh,

206
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.420
crop them all types of like, it had an editor in there. So I was like, yo,

207
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.320
take this editor, toss it out. Uh, oh, we had a keyboard. Um, you know,

208
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:11.640
it still has a keyboard, but I was like,

209
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.130
took some of the functionalities and I just started taking stuff out and just

210
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.830
like, get this out of here, get this out. I could definitely slim it down.

211
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.420
Right. As soon as we slimmed it down, we changed gave it a new face. Boom,

212
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.740
our revenue.

213
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.720
<v 1>Quadruple. Once again, tell people.</v>

214
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.240
<v 0>Give it to us, give it to us.</v>

215
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.350
<v 1>Jamie's got it.</v>

216
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.310
<v 0>Yeah. G I F I T.</v>

217
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.630
<v 1>I Z the ultimate Twitter gift downloader. Yeah.</v>

218
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.250
<v 0>Yeah. And this is this thing's about to be super huge. Uh,</v>

219
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.550
we have a gallery coming soon and that's going to be awesome.

220
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.870
I'm going to be perfectly curated. Um,

221
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.110
not speak to my partner Simone this morning about that.

222
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.620
<v 1>One of the fun things about Twitter, when someone says something stupid,</v>

223
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.470
and then you look at all the gifts underneath it, all names and gifts.

224
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.490
<v 0>So we empower people like black Twitter is on our app.</v>

225
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.200
So whenever there's a new video out, you know,

226
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.980
something funny happens and using it as a reaction. So we on iOS,

227
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:08.530
there's no way to save it. Now you can with our app,

228
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.090
but our app only does one thing and everybody's LA love it. Right?

229
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.440
That's that's the core of the business.

230
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.140
What's the core of minds. What's the core of gap.

231
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.250
What's the core feature to anybody? No, there is not a core feature.

232
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.413
<v 1>Yeah. I wouldn't,</v>

233
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.570
I would say just something as an alternative to traditional media.

234
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.413
You see what I'm saying?

235
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.160
<v 0>Yeah. So there is no uniqueness where there is no uniqueness. You can't compete.</v>

236
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.530
You have to first create uniqueness, um, or, or fill a need.

237
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.520
There. There's no need for me to be on these other platforms.

238
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:45.851
<v 1>Well,</v>

239
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:48.760
the problem is when you get on those other platforms and there's no one there,

240
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.410
let me go back to.

241
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.440
<v 0>The real quick. Yeah. And that's why I say, when you build a social network,</v>

242
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.530
the, before you build a network, you have, I mean,

243
00:12:56.531 --> 00:12:59.020
before you build the platform, you have to build the network.

244
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.300
<v 1>Mm what's interesting. If you go back to like 2003, when MySpace was king,</v>

245
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.350
and then you imagine what the world would be like 16 years later,

246
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:10.090
no one would have saw this coming.

247
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.130
No one would have saw all these social media platforms and that it's

248
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:18.370
used as a way of breaking news now. I mean,

249
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:23.200
especially in places that don't have real objective news.

250
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.030
So if you're in some country,

251
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:28.000
that's some war torn country in some horrible is going down.

252
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.440
You see the news breaking on Twitter before anywhere. Oh yeah.

253
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.120
Really interesting. Oh yeah.

254
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.630
<v 0>Tell people like screw Facebook and Instagram and news breaks on, on Twitter.</v>

255
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.490
You know, by the time, you know,

256
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:43.570
by the time I show all my friend of my friend shows me a video, I'm like,

257
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:45.040
I saw it on Twitter like two weeks ago, bro.

258
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.750
Cause he's on Facebook or he's on Instagram. Right. So it was like,

259
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.400
how do you market a product or market yourself when you're two weeks behind.

260
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.280
<v 1>Um, two weeks behind on Instagram though. I get a lot of on Instagram too. Like.</v>

261
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.540
<v 0>Rogan. Yeah.</v>

262
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.383
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.980
<v 0>So it's a bit different, you know,</v>

264
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.530
and I guess it depends on who you're surrounded by. Right?

265
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.750
So when we talk about a network, it's like, you know, who are the people?

266
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:16.090
<v 1>Who are you following? Who's who you interacting with? But I get like, mom,</v>

267
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.960
that's not true. I was going to say, I get like most of the up videos of news,

268
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:22.990
stories of bad things that are happening in the news, come to me on Instagram.

269
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:25.780
But I think send it to you. Yeah. But I think it's even,

270
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.990
I think it's even with Instagram and Twitter sending me things.

271
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.100
<v 0>Well, you did well when you're Joe Rogan, even ever your Hotep, Jesus,</v>

272
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.740
like a people will say to me, how do you know so much? I'm like, yo,

273
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.430
my followers, like yeah. Books and links and stuff like that.

274
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:41.050
Like they're just sending it to me. Um, you know,

275
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:43.990
sometimes I ask them sometimes I don't, but they're volunteering information.

276
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.210
Um, so when you're in that position, you know, you can afford it. But when,

277
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.250
so the key to marketing is this, you know, you, your four P's of marketing,

278
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:54.320
but the key to marketing is relevance.

279
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.030
If what you're talking about is irrelevant, nobody's paying attention to you,

280
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.050
right? Yeah.

281
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.730
So the only thing that makes somebody platforms relevant is the juxtaposition

282
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.330
to the big tech giants. You remove the tech giants. Are you still relevant?

283
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.850
What makes you relevant? Right.

284
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.130
<v 1>Right, right. That's where a lot of people that do content, whether they're, um,</v>

285
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.200
you know, podcasters or whatever,

286
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.400
they probably should be thinking about developing an email list and putting

287
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:23.181
things on the website,

288
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:25.910
having something available independently of these big platforms.

289
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.690
I've been thinking about that a lot lately doing what but something that

290
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.350
independent of these big platforms where like, if, I mean,

291
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:35.630
you see all these people that have gotten deep platforms. Yeah.

292
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.240
And I don't think I'm at the risk of that,

293
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.290
but if I didn't think these people were just a few years ago as the climate

294
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:46.040
shifts and people get more and more radical with this idea of de platforming,

295
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.920
I think it becomes like a game of like shooting ducks.

296
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.380
People get excited about it. They like taking people out,

297
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:52.490
whether it makes sense or not.
