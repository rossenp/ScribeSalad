WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.160
<v 1>In fact, this was one of the very important points in,</v>

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.680
uh, that Soviet coaches would make that do not force that adaptation. Uh,

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.360
David rigged rigor is probably the greatest weightlifter all times. So he is,

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.470
uh, oversee Excel world records in several weight classes and just unbelievable

6
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:25.304
athlete.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.550
So he just made a point that do not force the strength

8
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:35.350
development, do not force mass development. That's another problem. You start,

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.030
it's possible to build muscle fast,

10
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.950
but it's not gonna necessarily very quality muscle. So yes, take your time. You,

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.820
and, and this is interesting enough, Joe.

12
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.500
This is what old timers understood.

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.460
I'm a fan of, uh, books by all time strong man,

14
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.420
not all of them, of course, but some of them are just remarkable.

15
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.660
Earl Leaderman HES, an American strong man and educator.

16
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
He wrote a book back in 1925 called the seekers of strength.

17
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.450
And it's an awesome book.

18
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.090
So you read this book and if you follow the directions in this book from

19
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.770
1925, you will get far superior results.

20
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:19.370
And from most pop fitness and strength programs,

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.400
because people who had some San, some common sense, they were able to,

22
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.560
again, observe what's going on. They were not driven by some slogan. Oh,

23
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.280
one more rep.

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.640
<v 0>Whatever. Yeah. Yeah. The one more rep thing is, uh,</v>

25
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.080
it's very embraced here in America, you know, with, uh,

26
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.640
meat heads, which are my people. The,

27
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.830
the thing about it is that you think that mental toughness is going to push you

28
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.270
past your limits or what your perceived limits are.

29
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.110
And that that's where the real strength happens.

30
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.790
That's where the real growth takes place.

31
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.230
<v 1>That's a VI, that's a very valid point for, for you mentally.</v>

32
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.990
Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; not physically, mentally, but periodically. This is,

33
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.980
is very important point. You have to push the B push the body to the limit,

34
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.340
whether in competition or some other manner mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

35
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.260
but for a short period of time and not too often, that's.

36
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.340
<v 0>Very important. You know who Ronnie Coleman is, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.900
Ronnie Coleman, who was, uh, Mr. Olympia, just, uh, at one point in time,

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.300
one of the most impressive and spectacular physiques on earth mm-hmm

39
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.170
&lt;affirmative&gt; is now so injured from

40
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.370
all of his incredible lifts. He was known for lifting enormous,

41
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.490
enormous amounts of weight. And, uh, I mean,

42
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.090
I think when they asked him about if we do anything different,

43
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:40.690
cause I think he's had, I, I hope I'm not wrong,

44
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.280
but I think more than 11 back surgeries over the, the last few years. Yeah.

45
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:49.880
He he's essentially herniated every single disc in his back. And, uh,

46
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.880
a series of back operations. That's left him walking with crutches and you know,

47
00:02:54.881 --> 00:02:56.680
it's, it's bad. Um,

48
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.560
but this is the result of this sort of mindset

49
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.600
of a champion. You know, that he.

50
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.160
<v 1>Was Joe, pardon me? I'm going to interrupt you for a second, please.</v>

51
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.280
The champion has that mindset on the platform, the champion,

52
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.040
whenever the champion is in the gym,

53
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.670
he or she is going to approach this as a, as a work man, pretty much,

54
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.390
this is the plan. This is what I do. So you will find that absolutely.

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.710
In, in sports,

56
00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:29.190
you have to be extremely tough and you have to model some of that in training as

57
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.750
well, but in a very, very careful time manner. Yeah. So for instance,

58
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.970
um, top lifters,

59
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.083
power lifters,

60
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.640
they max twice a year at the nationals and at the worlds,

61
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.240
meanwhile, they train hard. They push themselves to do everything right,

62
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.000
but they do not try to squeeze out one extra rep. It just simply will not work.

63
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.960
It does not work. I remember having conversation with Andy Bolton. Andy is,

64
00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.930
uh,

65
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.750
the first man to deadlift a thousand pounds and just speak tiger athlete.

66
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.670
If you watch Andy pool in competition, it's just, just unbelievable.

67
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.070
It's a thing of beauty. And I just, Andy was telling me how,

68
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.230
how some lifters he have seen that would just simply try to hang with others,

69
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.620
better lifters in the gym and try to repeat exactly what they do.

70
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.220
And that's what happens after that. Nothing good happens from that. Mm.

71
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.260
You have to be tough when it's time in the gym, you have to do the plan.

72
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.900
And like, for example, um,

73
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.060
let's talk about heavy lifting. Okay. Just heavy singles.

74
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.970
Let's say &lt;affirmative&gt;,

75
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.130
if I'm sure everybody who listens to your program has at what

76
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:52.090
point of their life decided to up their bench press by going to a

77
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:55.810
max once a week. I'm sure everybody has. I have you have everybody has.

78
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.250
So how long did it last?

79
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.720
Typically six weeks for beginner and an advanced leave term

80
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:05.960
might tolerate two or three weeks and that's about it.

81
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.760
So for whatever reasons after that, you know, nervous system starts BI out.

82
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.400
Your endocrine system can keep up and that's it.

83
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.560
So for that reason before the competition,

84
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:22.510
you might take like a 90% single double or something like that. And

85
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.190
if you look at the longevity of power lifters,

86
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.190
and if you look at longevity of the weightlifters of the Soviet school, uh,

87
00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:33.990
that's very impressive. I'll give you one great example.

88
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.950
So well David rigor himself, who was the champion around, you know,

89
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:43.460
in the seventies. So he is way he is probably pushing right now, you know,

90
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.820
lives in a farm, works in a farm, but his coach doing great, very healthy,

91
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.620
but his coach that's, that's an even more interesting story. Uh,

92
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.980
Rud of blue failure. He was

93
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.800
probably the oldest to win the Olympics in weightlifting.

94
00:05:58.801 --> 00:06:03.280
He was 36 and he worked in the minds in daytime

95
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.480
and then trained hard. So &lt;inaudible&gt; ethnically,

96
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:09.000
he so ethnically he's German.

97
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.520
So one of the Germans living in the Soviet union and

98
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.750
eventually when the Soviet fell cook fit to immigrated to Germany.

99
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.950
And so a journalist came to visit him.

100
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.430
And so here is this really spry looking guy fooling around in the garden.

101
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.870
And the journal is asking, pardon me, sir, I speak to your dad.

102
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.950
So here's this guy who is, uh, almost 90 years old,

103
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.700
still looks about 30 years younger who still does jump squats with 90

104
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.860
kilos for sets of 10. And this is an example.

105
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.300
So heavy weights don't have the same longevity,

106
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.140
but that's has more,

107
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.300
that does not have anything to do with the training system that has to do with

108
00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:58.370
the fact this train you put in your system by eating so much, just not so good,

109
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.810
but this guy's have longevity. If you also look at, uh,

110
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.330
the power lifters, most successful power lifters, American power lifters,

111
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.250
Eddie Cohen competed for if I'm not mistaken,

112
00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:13.090
about 30 years at the highest level,

113
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.610
from a very lightweight class to much heavier one,

114
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.160
and he stayed are healthy throughout. He

115
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.880
maybe had one injury and Eddie right now, yours have a after retirement is very,

116
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:26.714
very healthy.

117
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.840
So you'll find that the mentality of saving this eye of the tiger

118
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.160
for when it matters, as opposed to treating every training day as a competition,

119
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.150
that makes a big difference for performance and for longevity.

120
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.830
<v 0>It just battles the mindset of always do more, always push harder,</v>

121
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.710
always give your awe, leave everything in the gym. This,

122
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:55.910
this is the mindset that people have been sort of indoctrinated into. Sure.

123
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:58.670
That they think that hard work is what really matters, but.

124
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.820
<v 1>Hard work does matter, but hard work can come in. A lot of different.</v>

125
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.660
It can manifest itself differently.

126
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.580
<v 0>Would that approach have worked with a guy like Ronnie Coleman because he's a</v>

127
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.220
body builder. So body builders,

128
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:13.620
obviously you're not talking about competition in sense of being able to lift a

129
00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:14.261
lot of weight. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

130
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.420
you're talking about just mass acquiring mass.

131
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.970
<v 1>Well, you know, the body builders from the older era,</v>

132
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.410
like Franco Colombo, uh, very sad that, uh,

133
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.410
Dr. Colomba passed recently, but he was an exceptionally strong man.

134
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.313
Very healthy man.

135
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.170
<v 0>He he'd swimming. Yeah.</v>

136
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.410
<v 1>But it was, it was a hard issue that has nothing to do with lifting.</v>

137
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.760
So he was very healthy and very strong till the end. And uh,

138
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:43.320
if you look at the guys of that generation, they're, you know,

139
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:48.000
they're doing great. Yeah. And if you look at other body builders, power,

140
00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:48.730
power lift,

141
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.560
let's say body builders who have some kind of a power bodybuilding approach,

142
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.920
these guys have been around longer as well. If you look at the old timers again,

143
00:08:56.921 --> 00:09:00.560
Dave Draper, these guys, oh, Clarence bass, you know, Clarence bass. Sure. Okay.

144
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.560
<v 0>Super shreded.</v>

145
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.240
<v 1>Clarence is a friend of mine and Clarence is, well, let's put it this way.</v>

146
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.880
He's uh, not a spring chicken, but he's got absolutely spectacular physi.

147
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.200
He's still staying very strong. Are there recents of discipline?

148
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.550
<v 0>He, what, how old is he now? He's gotta be in his seventies. Right?</v>

149
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.990
We were pushing.

150
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.830
<v 1>80. Possibly. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

151
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.713
<v 0>There he is.</v>

152
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.470
<v 1>Yep. That's Clarence. He's awesome. That guy's.</v>

153
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.550
<v 0>Awesome, man. That is crazy.</v>

154
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.030
That picture of him lifting his shirt up with this complete grandpa face

155
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.830
and just super Jack body.

156
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.460
<v 1>&lt;Affirmative&gt; that? Guy's incredible. Yeah. That's got the,</v>

157
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.540
he knows how to push himself when you need to push himself.

158
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.620
<v 0>Yeah. Well, he's very, very intelligent that guy, but.</v>

159
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.900
<v 1>Old top athletes and lifters are very intelligent. Mm. There are some Lukes,</v>

160
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.300
but they don't last long. Right.

161
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.300
<v 0>I see what you're saying. Yeah. For longevity,</v>

162
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.970
you sort of have to have that sort of intelligent approach. Um,

163
00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.050
so do you think a guy like Ronnie Coleman would've be able to achieve the mass

164
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.090
and the size and the, the way he was built with a different strategy?

165
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.130
<v 1>I can speculate. I don't know, but I can speculate.</v>

166
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.930
But if you look at the muscle mass that have been achieved by heavyweight power

167
00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:18.160
lifters, like Kurt Kowski mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; look up that guy.

168
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.320
Kurt Kowski Kowski K a R w O

169
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.760
S K I uh,

170
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.480
so if you see that type of development achieved by heavyweight power lifters,

171
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.760
then I don't see why not. Hmm.

172
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.760
And body builders have their own additional techniques.

173
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:39.270
They still have to their stuff or their separation and whatever it is that you

174
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.990
do. But I think there's a very good chance that he would have.

175
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.470
And if you look at the successful power, like Mike Hern,

176
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:51.870
for example, that's a very strong guy. He's a power body builder. There we go.

177
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.270
He is car wash. Right? There's.

178
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.510
<v 0>The size of that guy. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

179
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.700
oh yeah. He looks like a body, but look at the size of his legs. That is,

180
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.300
that is ridiculous.

181
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.060
<v 1>Yeah. And that guy just would not fool around with, uh, Peck,</v>

182
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.140
whatever deck and what have you Peck.

183
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.580
<v 0>Deck. Yeah. You, you say that disdainfully that.</v>

184
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.730
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; why don't we just say it was.</v>

185
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.050
<v 0>Respect. A lot of people don't understand what's wrong with it.</v>
