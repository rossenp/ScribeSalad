1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.760
<v 0>My theory is that when you do that and you carb restrict and you, you,</v>

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.010
you calorie restrict rather and get down, eat once that over.

3
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:10.800
You just want to reward yourself as often as possible.

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.830
So when someone comes along with something like a ketogenic diet and go,

5
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:17.580
no bread, no pop, you. You just, you just don't want to do it.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.750
<v 1>You get, um, but you get the same, uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.660
the adherence and the relapse is the same,

8
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:29.640
whether it's ketogenic or another diet like regaining weight. Yeah. But is it.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.810
<v 0>Correct?</v>

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.010
<v 2>That fixation like pasta and bread because there's no,</v>

11
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:37.170
no foods actually create. Yeah.

12
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.190
<v 0>Yeah. They have great stuff. Their waffles are excellent. They have like a.</v>

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.180
<v 2>Hamburger buns.</v>

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.550
<v 0>Now. Yeah. It's good stuff. I really like,</v>

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.190
I've made sandwiches with their stuff. Um,

16
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.570
what knocks me out more than anything of ketosis is just too much meat. Yeah.

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.650
<v 0>Yeah. That's the one that gets me.</v>

19
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.960
<v 1>Uh, again, I, I kind of go back to</v>

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.170
that. The data is very mixed. Again, if we look at the overall data set,

21
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:11.790
very mixed and all diets have terrible adherence. Right. But a lot.

22
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.410
<v 0>Of that that's discipline.</v>

23
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.570
<v 1>Yeah. But we also, now we've got.</v>

24
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.970
<v 0>It makes me crazy. I don't want to talk about people. Aren't disciplined.</v>

25
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.060
I really, really, I really have a giant hard problem with that.

26
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.430
As I know so many discipline people and I just,

27
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.790
I feel their momentum and vibration and I'm like,

28
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.440
I just want to concentrate on what they're doing.

29
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.740
Cause all these people that can't do it, I feel like that's contagious.

30
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.800
You started thinking about people that can adhere to diets and fall off.

31
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.350
I get it for you because it's something that you do. But.

32
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.730
<v 1>But I'm gonna, I'm gonna make a, so for you,</v>

33
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.800
the ketogenic diet cliques and, or,

34
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.400
or eating more meat clicks that that's something that you really enjoy.

35
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.860
You like the state you like to stay.

36
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.850
<v 0>I love pasta. It makes.</v>

37
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.620
<v 1>Discipline.</v>

38
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.300
<v 2>Easier because of regulation.</v>

39
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.530
<v 1>Data doesn't support that.</v>

40
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.600
<v 0>It doesn't support that it makes discipline easier in terms of your adherence or</v>

41
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.570
in terms of your long-term adherence, both, both.

42
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.590
<v 1>So, but, but hang on, hang on. For some people,</v>

43
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.240
for some people this works better because they feel better.

44
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.450
They have better adherence for other people. If you say,

45
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.440
now you've got some people. If you say, Hey, you can have a cookie, they would,

46
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.260
it would screw them because they would, they would just go crazy.

47
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.110
But for other people, if you allow them more flexibility,

48
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.101
their adherence improves.

49
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:30.060
What I'm saying is we need to give people all the options on the table,

50
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.080
not demonize any one diet and say, Hey,

51
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.640
maybe you try to figure out what works for lack of sounding, bro,

52
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.350
what works for you and what you can sustain. Go from there.

53
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.950
Let's see if this.

54
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.880
<v 2>Is totally integrated.</v>

55
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.120
<v 0>I am as well. But you keep saying Ken sustain,</v>

56
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.060
you definitely can sustain more than you do that.

57
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:54.990
The real problem is a giant percentage of the people are weak. Oh,

58
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:59.260
I would agree with that. Like it's in the 30, 40% people just quit. Give up.

59
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.820
Don't do what they're supposed to do.

60
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.790
Don't do as many reps as it's supposed to do. Don't work out,

61
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.370
take days off just because they're lazy.

62
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.280
And those are the people that get off the diet. It's a discipline issue.

63
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.114
More than anything.

64
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.980
<v 2>That is really big.</v>

65
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.700
So I think various foods that are emerging on the market right now at based

66
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.480
systems,

67
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.050
Virta health actually has a great app based system that actually coaches you

68
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.040
through that. Uh, and I think that's very helpful. So I think new technologies,

69
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.120
foods, and we'll make it will increase adherence.

70
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.140
Also when you have a person who knows and understands all the health benefits

71
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.810
associated with nutritional ketosis or just low carb,

72
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.050
I think that can be a motivating factor to make them stick to the diet.

73
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.320
<v 0>Yeah, but for a guy like you, who's rational and disciplined,</v>

74
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:44.170
but people they're self-destructive and weak, they're going to

75
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.010
need a burger and need fries and need to shake.

76
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.550
<v 2>Their choice. What's the point.</v>

77
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.870
<v 0>Of the whole conversation then? Well,</v>

78
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:54.370
the point of the conversation to avoid those,

79
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.000
cause they're going to drag you down to their mediocre level. I think.

80
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.740
<v 2>I think you need to sympathize with them a little bit because I think the</v>

81
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:07.480
market, and I think this is a fruitful area for entrepreneurs to create

82
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:12.040
technologies and foods that can actually enhance adherence to

83
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.520
eating strategies. We know about that too. So it's a combination.

84
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.640
<v 0>I feel like so much of it is what you're willing to accept from yourself.</v>

85
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.211
If you're,

86
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:24.160
if you are willing to accept this Seesaw obesity thing that

87
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.250
so many people get on, on and off this yo-yo effect.

88
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.830
If you're willing to accept that, that's fine.

89
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.370
But I just feel like it's a mental state. I really do.

90
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.890
I see once you achieve a certain amount of success,

91
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:38.380
people start sabotaging themselves. They start,

92
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.320
they start dwelling on the fact that they're doing well,

93
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.800
but how long can they sustain this? It starts being a big fat mind.

94
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.760
And that's when you say like what's sustainable,

95
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.010
what's sustainable a lot more than you're willing to do. What's sustainable is

96
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.030
the person out there that's listening. But you know what I mean? It's like,

97
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.140
there's a thing like we're giving people these escape clauses.

98
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.470
We're giving them these, these, these parachutes. They can pull,

99
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.820
don't pull the parachute. Just have a cheat day. That's fine.

100
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.990
But don't get off your diet, have a cheat meal, eat a giant sundae,

101
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.680
throw some syrup on that. Get that whipped cream going, do it once.

102
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.760
But don't live your life like that. That's nonsense. And I think.

103
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.020
<v 2>For, yeah, I wouldn't disagree with anything you said.</v>

104
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.340
<v 0>So people need to hear not this like this. Like, well you can't sustain it.</v>

105
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.680
The keto giant, giant not sustained you to stay.

106
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.260
<v 2>All with their control. If you do fast, sustainable, if you fast for three days,</v>

107
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.640
that will give you a lot of confidence that you have control over food. Fasting.

108
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.970
<v 0>No diet is sustainable. It's not sustainable over.</v>

109
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:50.080
If you look for general population and you get a bunch of weak and you get them

110
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:51.730
together, how many of them are going to keep it together?

111
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.840
How many of them are going to run every day?

112
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:55.690
How many are going to work out every day? Very, very, very few.

113
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:59.840
You're dealing with outliers particular just by virtue of what you do,

114
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.590
how many people are willing to put the work in to achieve this.

115
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.750
Now how many, how many people can achieve this physique? Very, very few, right?

116
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.260
So we're.

117
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.850
<v 1>Talking about outliers.</v>

118
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.730
<v 0>We're talking about how that's what I like. I like outliers.</v>

119
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.860
I don't like people to use to hook. I can't hear that. I'm not,

120
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.550
that's dangerous. So I feel like that is worse than carbs.

121
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.220
<v 1>That's why we talk a lot in the book about behaviors.</v>

122
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.490
Because if you change your behavior, that's what we,

123
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.450
I think there's not enough research focused on is let's look at the people who

124
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:34.610
actually achieve weight loss.

125
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.680
And if you look at people who achieve it and keep it off,

126
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.950
they do it through many different methods, whether it's low carb, low, fat,

127
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.730
whatever it is. But let's look at the behaviors that they make.

128
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.040
And those behaviors can tell us a lot about people.

129
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:50.660
One thing we know is they practice form. They, they weigh themselves very often.

130
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.000
So they're accountable. They, they practice some form of cognitive restraint,

131
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.410
whether it's weighing food, recording, macros, ketogenic, fat restriction,

132
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.710
whatever it is. And also they exercise regularly.

133
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.050
And one there's physiological benefits to that exercise lowers the body fat set

134
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:13.160
point that your body will defend. So it actually has a physiological benefit,

135
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.700
but also just mentally, like you said, I mean, I never,

136
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:20.330
if you took me back 30 years ago and you told me, Hey Lee,

137
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.130
or when I was 10 years old and you said, Hey,

138
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.980
when I was like bullied and picked on, had no self-esteem,

139
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.570
you're going to squat,

140
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.370
668 pounds one day on your back at 201 pounds

141
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.050
and set a it's been broken since then. But a world record. I would've been like,

142
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.240
there's no way. There's no way. But when you have discipline, like you said,

143
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.540
and you that doesn't just people say you should have more confidence.

144
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.610
That's a horse advice.

145
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.180
The confidence is built through you set a goal and you achieve,

146
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.060
you set a goal and you achieve, and you don't start out to say,

147
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.390
I'm going to set a world record. And that's your first goal, right? You use,

148
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.840
I like, what will Smith say? Say you lay a brick as perfectly as you can lay it,

149
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.020
you do it again. And you do it again and you do it again.

150
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:06.080
And you talk to anybody who's successful in anything.

151
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.240
They didn't start out saying I'm going to do this earth shattering thing. Right?

152
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.770
They started out and built that confidence over years and years of

153
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.680
achieving small goals, which then led them to their big goals.

154
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.170
<v 0>Now we're onto something because I think that the mental state,</v>

155
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:24.440
in which you approach anything, a workout routine, a lifestyle,

156
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.960
the way you decide to live your life, that is critical.

157
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.300
And here's one of the things that people are cynical about.

158
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.440
That's probably one of the best sources of fuel is inspiration.

159
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:37.550
From other motivated people go to David Goggins, Instagram page every day.

160
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:42.140
Watch that Savage. Watch what he does. And yeah, he's awesome.

161
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.820
But go to people like him, Cameron Hanes go to go to go to people like the rock.

162
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.050
Like these people just do it. There's no escape. There's no.

163
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.680
And sustain that. That's not, I don't want to hear that. That's nonsense.

164
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.890
<v 2>And failing is good. It's okay. If you fail, if you don't fail,</v>

165
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.570
you're not going to get anywhere. Get back on the horse.

166
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:01.860
You're not pushing yourself hard enough.

167
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.210
<v 1>When I say sustainability. I mean, if, if it's,</v>

168
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.660
if it's because everybody has stuff that they find again,

169
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:13.800
you find a carb restricted diet to be easier to stick to for you feels better.

170
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.350
It feels better for you. And that's fine. But if,

171
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.260
but if somebody is over here and says, you know what, I'm eating a low fat diet.

172
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.470
I feel great. My blood markers are good. I have plenty of energy.

173
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.910
<v 0>What's wrong with that? Nothing's wrong with that. Exactly.</v>

174
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.810
That's why libertarian unquestionably exists, right? There's a,

175
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:32.670
there's a giant difference between all this.

176
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.240
Some people eat peanuts and they die. Right. We all know that. There's just the,

177
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.940
body's just very, very different. They vary exactly.

178
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.230
They're the caloric requirements. The, the nutritional requirements. It that's,

179
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:44.280
what's hard about this, right.

180
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.200
Is finding this one thing that is best for you and

181
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.130
objectively and you know, and being really analyzing your,

182
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
your actual physical performance, which very people, very few people do.

183
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.520
They kind of say, well, I feel pretty good, but by what marker, right?

184
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.640
Or you w what's your personal best? What are you trying to accomplish?

185
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.550
Are you monitoring your heart rate? Are you monitoring your work output? Like,

186
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:08.610
what are you doing to show that this diet is optimal for you?

187
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.510
<v 1>Yeah. Well, and part of that is like, you know, it's hard to get,</v>

188
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.830
that's a lot of money that's going to be spent to, to get that data, you know,

189
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:19.050
for an individual. So part of it is going to have to be,

190
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:22.920
what do you feel good on? And what do you feel like is again,

191
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.870
most sustainable for you? Because no matter what that people want to diet,

192
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.460
what people really want is they want,

193
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.730
I don't want to have to track and I don't want to have to sacrifice anything.

194
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.520
And I want to get to my goal. Well, tough. That's not going to happen.

195
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.920
You have to pick what you're going to sacrifice. Right.

196
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.500
So if you say I hate tracking calories,

197
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.610
so I'm just not going to eat carbs because I can regulate my body weight that

198
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.500
way. Yeah. Do that.

199
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.500
I had a post on Twitter that was like one of my most popular Twitter posts.

200
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:50.760
I said, you know,

201
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.410
health improvements are largely driven by caloric restriction and weight loss.

202
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.630
But if, if you like vegan, if you like keto, if you like carnivores,

203
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.950
if you and I just listed a bunch of different diets and they help you create a

204
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:09.810
restriction and it keeps you at a healthy weight, then. Yeah.

205
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.650
Hell yeah. Like if somebody says, I like eating a vegan diet.

206
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.850
<v 2>Interested in losing weight, but ketogenic intermittent fasting is very,</v>

207
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:21.570
very easy for me. I love the food and I feel better. And uh,

208
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.480
I think all my biomarkers are improving. Can I ask you this.

209
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.180
<v 1>When you don't need any other reasoning for why you should do it? Yeah.</v>

210
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.190
<v 0>With him, it works now. Can I ask you this?</v>

211
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:31.680
When you say diets aren't sustainable, the data doesn't show that. Well,

212
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.890
you're talking about calorie restricted diets, that overall weight loss diets,

213
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.640
are you talking about dietary choices in terms of like ketogenic diets.

214
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.570
<v 1>Question. So it's that if you lose weight,</v>

215
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.670
we cannot keep it off. That is,

216
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:49.560
that is the big problem is that most people are able to lose weight and they

217
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.880
cannot keep it off because one that the self-defense system that we talked about

218
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.040
is a really easy way too quickly.

219
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.530
<v 0>Their body gets into this state where it's always trying to regain.</v>

220
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.450
<v 1>That weight back part of it, part of it. Yeah. Like losing it more quickly,</v>

221
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.170
there's debate about this. But I would say that it's,

222
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.870
you have to create a more extreme deficit to do that.

223
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.680
And so you are activating your body's self-defense system more intensely.

224
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.550
If I had to say it that way. So the rebound is usually bigger as well.

225
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.350
So it's, it's trying to find a way, okay, can we get this weight off?

226
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.150
And then let's really emphasize to people that the

227
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:32.650
diet after the diet, nobody talks about this, except for us in the book,

228
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.840
nobody talks about this. Uh, my co-writer for the book,

229
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.740
Peter Baker and I,

230
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.480
we spent were spent chapters talking about when you go and transition into,

231
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:46.120
okay, we've lost the weight we want to lose. We're healthier.

232
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:51.640
You have to have the same amount of discipline and intensity to then maintain

233
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:56.140
that loss. Because if you let up, if you let your foot off the gas,

234
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.100
now you don't necessarily have to be at the same caloric restriction level.

235
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.520
But if you just let yourself come out, I'm going to vacation. I'm going to eat,

236
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.880
I'm going to eat what I want. Boom, gained 10 pounds.

237
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.360
And everybody knows people like this, who they go and they do this.

238
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.500
And you've just,

239
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.690
you've literally just undid months of hard work in one

240
00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:17.524
week because.

241
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.160
<v 2>Would maintain that for a set amount of time, say six months.</v>

242
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.160
So I think that if someone can maintain that weight loss for six months,

243
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.710
that's like, sort of like the tipping point where they can go on.

244
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.700
<v 1>Got my wheelhouse right here. Okay. Ah, so, so that's a great point.</v>

245
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:37.720
So leptin is a, you I'm sure you've heard of people talking about leptin.

246
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.190
So when you lose fat leptin,

247
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.150
subscript secretion goes down cause fat cells secrete it. And uh,

248
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:45.100
it's kind of like your body's thermostat and body fat.

249
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.380
Everybody has like a set point. Their body likes to be at.

250
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:50.950
So if you lose body fat, you secrete less left than hunger goes up.

251
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.230
Metabolic rate goes down, grilling tries to yes.

252
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.320
And growling is in opposition to leptin. So you, you,

253
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.920
this is your body like a thermostat. So if on a thermostat,

254
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:04.420
if you set it at 75 goes too low, kick the heat on bump back up, goes too high.

255
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.190
Kick the cooling on, go back down,

256
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.470
left and acts that way with your metabolic rate and your hunger.

257
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.960
When you get down to a low body fat leptin's low your body,

258
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:18.130
you have a drive to regain that weight. Your, your hunger is higher. Your bot,

259
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:20.230
your, your metabolic rate is lower.

260
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.960
Leptin still stays low even years after a diet and people who

261
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:28.360
have, uh, kept the weight off.

262
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.250
So you would think there'd still be a biological drive to regain the weight

263
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.910
that said, and I'm going to go out on a limb here.

264
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.290
So any of my scientists who are listening on this feel free to call me out in

265
00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:44.680
the carpet. If you think I'm wrong, but just like obese people,

266
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.720
obese people actually have high levels of leptin.

267
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.380
They have high levels of leptin, but they become leptin resistant,

268
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.810
but then insensitive, right? If you stay at a re,

269
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.680
there is evidence that if you stay to reduce body weight for one or two years,

270
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.790
that that can become your new set point, that your body defense,

271
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.000
I think what can happen is even if your leptin doesn't go out for two years,

272
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:08.030
not six months. Yeah. It's a little bit longer. It's a little bit longer,

273
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.510
but it's a good start aneurysm what's happening. I think, I think, well,

274
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:15.020
I think it's probably multifaceted because nothing, your body's so redundant,

275
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.220
usually nothing is ever one thing. Typically just in our set point,

276
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.430
I think one of the things that happens is probably your body becomes more

277
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.010
sensitive to the leptin you have because you're leaving.
