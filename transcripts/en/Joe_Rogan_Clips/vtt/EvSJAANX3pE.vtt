00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.520
<v 3>Are Kelly still in jail too? I believe so. That's up. Why?</v>

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.240
Huh? Why? Why is it up? That he's still in jail. Are Kelly? Why is it up?

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.840
Are Kelly still in jail? Yeah, the has some jams.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.040
I'm not saying he shouldn't be in jail. He should be here.

6
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:20.040
Imagine it's a waste of talent. Imagine.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.350
<v 1>If they said you had to deal with &lt;laugh&gt;. Imagine if they made a deal with 'em.</v>

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.710
They said, listen, you can,

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.630
you can take months off of your sentence with each album you

10
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:32.450
put out. Oh.

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.283
<v 0>My God.</v>

12
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.310
<v 1>Wow. And all the money goes to charity. Hey man.</v>

13
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.390
<v 0>You need to be the new attorney general. Hey man, you can't.</v>

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
<v 1>Have a, a shiny time. Be like, listen, Mr.</v>

15
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.180
Moses let's make a deal. If you were the opposing,

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.380
if you were the opposing lawyer and you and I, Matt,

17
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.420
and we decided let's just smoke a joint and talk about this man. Oh, well, yeah.

18
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.140
<v 0>It's just hard. You know, right now with all the that had happened with R Kelly,</v>

19
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.730
it'd be very, very difficult to listen to a new or ACHI album.

20
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.090
And he didn't talk about it.

21
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.010
<v 1>Did you listen to the one that he did release? The one song that he did release?</v>

22
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.690
No, listen that man, it's pretty good. All his songs.

23
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.690
<v 0>I'm not. Got a lot of good songs. I'm not bullshitting. He's the piece of,</v>

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.410
but he's got great songs. Some people got.

25
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.450
<v 1>Upset at me that I said, listen,</v>

26
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.600
I understand he's an extremely flawed human being extremely,

27
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.360
but this song is pretty catchy.

28
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.640
Who was that one that he released on SoundCloud after he got like dropped by

29
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.640
his, is it? I believe I can fly remix. There was no,

30
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.600
there was a song he was talking about. I'm living in flight risk.

31
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.640
He was talking about his.

32
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.760
<v 0>Whole thing. Not guilty. All his, this has a soul called not guilty.</v>

33
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.430
He does Kelly does he?

34
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.270
<v 1>Yes. &lt;laugh&gt; probably with JayZ 18 songs.</v>

35
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.190
<v 0>In a row. He was on best, both worlds.</v>

36
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.670
<v 1>Out. Right? Remember trapped in the closet, right?</v>

37
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.070
<v 0>Remember that? Yeah. Trapped in the closet. Yes. He.</v>

38
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.030
<v 1>Had a whole, he had, he had a soap opera, bro. Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.990
<v 0>Yes. He did trapped in the closet. Trapped. He did. Are Kelly.</v>

40
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.630
Is he lit him out for, for COVID our Kelly's an innovator man. Well,

41
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:04.620
everybody else after Kobe, he's an R B. He's the king of R B. Oh.

42
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.020
<v 1>Okay. What I call a 19 minute song called? I admit, I admit that's it.</v>

43
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.540
Yeah, dude.

44
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.860
<v 0>It's I heard that 19 minutes. That's good.</v>

45
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.020
It was like trapped in the closet all together.

46
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.260
<v 1>Listen, I'm not saying I endorse what he's done. I do not separate.</v>

47
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.210
Not saying what I'm saying is this sounds that he's making the, the,

48
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.290
the things that he's saying,

49
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.970
you can apply them to what you think he did or didn't do and it'll it up for

50
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:30.550
you. Yeah, bro.

51
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.250
<v 0>If Hitler puts out a R and B soul out tomorrow with, with, with.</v>

52
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.250
<v 1>Delic on it, I'm not. Yeah. I'm not like forgiving him. Yeah. I'm not forgiving.</v>

53
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.970
<v 0>Him. What I'm saying is I'm getting Hitler. Yeah. The art I should, James.</v>

54
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.920
I do think some of them and them family and them, uh, and like that.

55
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.440
That was letting they daughter go with R Kelly.

56
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:48.840
They knew what the they was doing.

57
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.000
Like I'm not letting my daughter go with R Kelly, nowhere or any.

58
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.760
You know what I'm saying? Like, cause every black parent said,

59
00:02:55.761 --> 00:02:57.520
when they watched that documentary, they were just like,

60
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.360
I ever let my daughter go. Yeah. I'm not letting yeah.

61
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.040
I'm not what the is going on. You know what I'm saying?

62
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:04.240
And then like the with the hotel, I think a lot of that was.

63
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.320
But I think a Kelly, a nasty, he need to go to jail. But &lt;laugh&gt;,

64
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.440
you know what I'm saying? Here's the thing. Yeah.

65
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.040
I think that he let Ahoe be Ahoe but he was just dipping and shallow waters,

66
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.840
man. You can't do that. Yeah. You can't do that. A Kelly,

67
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.510
like I be Ahoe with some, like, it was some growing it's like, man, you rich as.

68
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.790
You have any woman you want.

69
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.710
Why do you wanna with a that can't even drink at a bar with you? You.

70
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.670
<v 1>Power dynamic. I think there's a ma there's a madness of that kind of fame.</v>

71
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.390
Yeah. Like the, the level of fame that he had.

72
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.990
And you ever see that one video where he was on stage and these girls literally

73
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:38.950
reach up and grab his Dick while he's dancing and singing in front of,

74
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.460
of 'em &lt;laugh&gt; I seen that imagine Sinatra in a similar

75
00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:44.740
circumstance. &lt;laugh&gt;.

76
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.953
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

77
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.380
<v 1>I, I want you to stop and think,</v>

78
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.020
and I'm not saying that Sinatra did the same that R Kelly did,

79
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:55.940
but I want you to imagine, I would. I want you to imagine, oh,

80
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.500
she KA what kind of,

81
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.690
kind of a connection does this man have to his fans? I mean,

82
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.810
he is dancing in front of these ladies in there.

83
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.450
He's singing to their face and they're patting him down and people are screaming

84
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.410
for the people that are just listening to this. This is wild.

85
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.130
<v 0>Mean. This is, I mean, this is Jesus Christ. It's wild.</v>

86
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.720
<v 1>But they grab his Dick. Eventually there goes, grab, goes, she's massage.</v>

87
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.560
And Dick.

88
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.680
<v 0>Bobby singing bag, Hey, Hey, this one of his last shows he did too.</v>

89
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.960
He's telling her to do it by the way, just saying why my balls

90
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.560
people wiping.

91
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.640
<v 1>Me. Listen,</v>

92
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.920
we need Jimmy Fallons and we also need art Kelly's oh my, we need,

93
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.470
we need hyenas. And we need lions.

94
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.950
<v 0>Keep on wiping me.</v>

95
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.110
<v 1>We need Republicans and we need Democrats. We need everybody, everybody. But,</v>

96
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.183
um.

97
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.830
<v 0>Is she wiping his? There was some.</v>

98
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.270
<v 1>That he did &lt;laugh&gt; it was different than this. The problem with this guy,</v>

99
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.470
the stuff that he did was like, you start looking into it and you go, Jesus,

100
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.860
how, how old is everybody? Like, what is this? It's like the stage,

101
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.700
like doing that. The art that he produced, like being able to stand on stage.

102
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.060
And this girl grabs his Dick in front of everybody.

103
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.620
&lt;laugh&gt; I'm not endorsing anything he's ever done ever that's criminal.

104
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.980
But that is wild.

105
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.860
<v 0>That is wild. That's wild.</v>

106
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.820
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.010
<v 0>S oldschool, doop. I feel like there it, when that back in the day, you know,</v>

108
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.730
but like that, like girls don't.

109
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.130
<v 1>Panties on stage. I know,</v>

110
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:29.450
but they're grabbing his Dick in front of the whole world.

111
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.890
<v 0>I mean, you seen the five heartbeats. Oh, this is my favorite. Hold on,</v>

112
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.810
time out. This is my favorite R Kelly song. Do you have your passport?

113
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.610

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.260
<v 1>What was the one where the girl calls up and he at he's getting his hair done.</v>

126
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.060
Why we in the studio? What is that one? Where, where the, he is a whole thing.

127
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.500

<v 0>Woman on the phone. You know what I'm talking about? A woman's fair.</v>
