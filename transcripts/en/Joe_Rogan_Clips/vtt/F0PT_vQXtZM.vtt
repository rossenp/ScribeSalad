WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Oh, presidential candidates though. Yeah, for sure.</v>

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.680
Or you wanna go chase everything? Presidential candidates? I don't know.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.640
I love Yang's. And what I was gonna say about,

4
00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:12.160
I like him as a human being before we got into cutting off baby. Yes.

5
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.000
Love his energy. Like him as a person a lot. He's like, he's real.

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.310
Yes. You know, he's like most politicians are aliens and he's not,

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.470
and it's so refreshing and yeah.

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.511
<v 1>I like him a lot.</v>

9
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.670
Like him also said that police officers should have a purple belt in Brazilian

10
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:30.350
jujitsu. &lt;laugh&gt; which I completely agree.

11
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.870
<v 0>He has a lot, like, I went to look at the policies on his page, like, like,</v>

12
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:34.270
who is.

13
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.230
<v 1>This super.</v>

14
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.910
<v 0>Rational. He's great. And one of the things that is so like,</v>

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.020
refreshing about him is that the,

16
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.740
I don't know if I've been in a room in the past year with so many

17
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.780
former Bernie and former Trump people, which are a lot of his supporters.

18
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.300
Mm. You know, are like disaffected, disappointed, Trump people.

19
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.340
And then people that supported Bernie in 2016. And there's just,

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.810
I don't know, like when you hear him talk,

21
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.770
the villain of his stump speech is not Donald Trump,

22
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:08.170
even though he hates Donald Trump,

23
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.290
the villain is Amazon and big pharma and, you know,

24
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.000
automation,

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.850
like the things that are actually transforming and decimating

26
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.490
the country. Yeah. And I just think it's refreshing, but he's.

27
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.840
<v 1>Like a Paul year for automation. Yes. He's like, Hey,</v>

28
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.240
this is your jobs are going away. Your jobs are going away. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

29
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.920
He's a great guy. Liked him.

30
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.041
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

31
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.200
And then I also feel like I've gone on this emotional journey with Biden where

32
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:40.120
at first I'm like, totally. Like I liked him then I'm like, Ugh, he's old.

33
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.790
He's kind of losing it. No way he can. And,

34
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.310
and now I feel like I've gone back to maybe.

35
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.910
<v 1>Like, let me put you back on track cuz he's way too old.</v>

36
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.510
I know it's not just that he's too old. He's not coherent. He's falling apart.

37
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.470
I know like hasn't he had a stroke or something.

38
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.950
<v 0>I don't know if he's had, A's had a lot of plastic surgery that's for sure.</v>

39
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.270
Has he look at his face?

40
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.630
<v 1>Yeah. Trying to look younger. Um, and.</v>

41
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.460
<v 0>The caps and I don't know, but here's, it doesn't matter. Blood pressure.</v>

42
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.540
I think it's gonna, I think the candidate,

43
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.300
I will be very surprised if the candidate is not Bernie,

44
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.820
both because of the fundraising and because of where he is in the polls and

45
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:18.540
because, and this is the most fundamental thing. The,

46
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.300
the energy in the country right now is a populist energy.

47
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.610
And I just don't think that a moderate, like the ones that I like,

48
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:30.570
like a Klobuchar or a Biden can capture that the energy of the base.

49
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.210
I think it, I think that energy is just really with Bernie.

50
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.490
<v 1>You have more faith in a democratic party than I do.</v>

51
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.290
I think they're gonna up and put Elizabeth Warren in. And I think, oh,

52
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.170
my Trump's.

53
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.810
<v 0>Gonna chew up. Don't you think Trump would. Okay.</v>

54
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:44.960
But if it's Bernie verse Trump, yes. Who wins? Cause I think Trump still wins.

55
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.120
<v 1>I think you're always gonna have a hard time when someone's the incumbent.</v>

56
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.561
Right.

57
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:53.040
You're always gonna have a hard time when someone is the sitting president who

58
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.600
is extremely controversial,

59
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.920
extremely PO polarizing, but also we're in a great time economically.

60
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.440
That's, that's hard for people to deviate from.

61
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.080
It's hard for people to deviate from good economy.

62
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.160
When you look at the stock market, when you look at yeah.

63
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 0>But most people don't have stocks. Like it's people are like.</v>

64
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.520
<v 1>It's it's perception though. It's a perception.</v>

65
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.270
You look at unemployment rights are very low. You know, there's a,

66
00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:24.150
there's a lot of things that you could point to the standard issues that you

67
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:28.350
point to. And then you deal with all this loneliness on the left.

68
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.790
That Trump is the complete opposite of if you he's the

69
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.230
antithesis, he's the middle finger to all of it. Yes, exactly. Yeah. The,

70
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.950
when I, when he got in office, I said,

71
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.940
ed political correctness just got hit with a missile to the Dick.

72
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.420
And that's what it was like when that guy got in office,

73
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.020
like what the he just want after all that grabbed the stuff and all that,

74
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.500
all the craziness that, yeah.

75
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.100
The fact that he was able to weather that storm and it didn't even seem to shake

76
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.380
him. I mean, like you.

77
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.220
<v 0>Said, he could shoot someone in the middle of the fifth avenue kind of.</v>

78
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.890
<v 1>Think he actually could. Yeah. Well, as long as the person was a Dick,</v>

79
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.090
as long as the person who shot was a real, like it, well, you know, we do,

80
00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:07.370
we really need that guy. No. Well, we need Trump as president.

81
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.650
It's gonna be hard. It's gonna be,

82
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:11.770
it's always hard to get someone out of office. I mean,

83
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.690
what sunk George H w Bush was Ross Perro.

84
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:19.770
And a lot of people forget that Ross Perro, this eccentric billion,

85
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.440
I got on television and bought an entire half hour of regular

86
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.200
primetime television and put on this display of why you're getting

87
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.720
and explain taxes to you and explain. So.

88
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.800
<v 0>So is Mike Bloomberg gonna be the Ross Perro of.</v>

89
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.601
<v 1>2020? No,</v>

90
00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:39.520
he's not as charismatic and he's not very well liked and it doesn't make sense.

91
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.230
He doesn't make sense. I don't think he's, he's wasting his time.

92
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.350
<v 0>I just think he's the opposite of what people want.</v>

93
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.270
<v 1>Right now. Yeah. They don't want a billionaire. No, no. They don't want that.</v>

94
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.830
They do not. What Bernie stands for is a guy who, well, look, you could,

95
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:54.550
you could dig up dirt on every single human being that's ever existed.

96
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:58.310
If you catch them in their worst moment and you magnify those moments and you

97
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.110
cut out everything else and you only display,

98
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.380
display those worst moments that said you can't find very

99
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.500
many with Bernie. He's been insanely consistent his entire life.

100
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.580
He's basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing,

101
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.500
his whole life and that in and of itself is a

102
00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:21.850
very powerful structure to operate from. Yeah. And.

103
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.770
<v 0>He's addressing the thing that people are most obsessed with right now,</v>

104
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:28.490
which is economic inequality. And he's really consistent on.

105
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.410
<v 1>It. Did you see him here? Did you see? Yeah, of course I did. He was so normal.</v>

106
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.993
He's normal.

107
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.090
<v 0>He's so normal. Did you find him winning though? Like, did you like him? I like,</v>

108
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.570
cause I feel like there's a huge division in people.

109
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.720
I know either they love him or they really, really think that he's like gruff,

110
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:45.800
obnoxious all of that.

111
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.040
<v 1>Well, I know you don't like TSI, but I love her. I love her. I love her.</v>

112
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.560
I think she's awesome. I love her.

113
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.320
I love Bernie and I love Andrew Yang and I talked about Toi and Bernie the other

114
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:59.600
day, but I forgot to bring up Andrew Yang. And I apologize for that. I said,

115
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.320
everybody else can eat. &lt;laugh&gt; I didn't mean Andrew Yang. I really,

116
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.440
I do like him. I just, it was just a mistake. What.

117
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.400
<v 0>Is the TSI appeal.</v>

118
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.480
<v 1>For you? Well, I think she, first of all, is, uh,</v>

119
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:10.640
someone who's served twice overseas,

120
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.520
been deployed twice and understands the actual cost of war worked in, you know,

121
00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:19.790
medical units saw people murdered and shot down and, and,

122
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:23.390
and destroyed by war. And she wants none of it.

123
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.230
And she wants us to have less intervent, interventionalist,

124
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.910
foreign policy decisions that affect people's lives and send our young

125
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.270
brothers and sisters over there to get killed. That's one thing,

126
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.780
she's a person who in Congress, she understands how it works. She's a very nice,

127
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.900
friendly person. I believe her when I talk to her, she's very genuine, you know?

128
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.260
And uh, you know, if you want a woman president that's, that's what you want.

129
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.700
You want a young woman who has served in Congress,

130
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.540
who has served overseas. Who's been deployed.

131
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.410
She makes a lot of sense with a lot of the things she's saying.

132
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.210
That's what I like about her.

133
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.810
<v 0>Got it. Okay. Klobuchar.</v>

134
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.770
<v 1>Uh, zero opinion on her. Okay.</v>

135
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.770
<v 0>Yeah. I like her zero charisma though. Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.370
<v 1>I haven't been paying attention. Like, uh, there's there's certain look,</v>

137
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:16.010
there's only so much time you have in a day and only so many days in your life.

138
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.640
And uh, until things start really popping where I have to pay attention to her,

139
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.893
I'm just like she ain't.

140
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.840
<v 0>But who are you gonna vote for in the primary?</v>

141
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.280
<v 1>I think, I think I'll probably vote for Bernie. Interesting.</v>

142
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.000
Yeah. Cause I like,

143
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.120
I think Bernie and toy together would be a devastating combination. I really do.

144
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.000
I don't know if they'd ever work out together. I don't know.

145
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.510
I don't know if that's possible, but I think them together might work.

146
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.270
That might work. That might get enough people to go, you know what?

147
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.030
This is all just too crazy. Let's, let's try something different.

148
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.110
<v 0>And what do you make of the people that are speculating that toy's gonna run as</v>

149
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:52.870
a third party or all that she's not going to. Okay.

150
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.390
<v 1>I don't think she's going to, I don't think she has any plans to do that,</v>

151
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.710
but that was the worry that, you know, she's a Russian asset.

152
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.060
One of the things that Hillary Clinton had said that I found that very strange

153
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.380
and Hillary Clinton was calling her a Russian asset. Like you found it strange.

154
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.460
<v 0>That Hillary Clinton said.</v>

155
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.620
<v 1>That I do, but I, I, you know, I'm not a fan of Hillary Clinton. I just,</v>

156
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.500
I'm not a fan of that whole, they're a part of a different world, right?

157
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:19.100
They're a part of a different world where corruption was open and accepted and

158
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.210
it was a part of the program. You know,

159
00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:24.930
if you pay attention to the Clinton foundation, you pay attention to the,

160
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.050
the amount of money that they would get paid to speak to bankers.

161
00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:30.050
And the fact that they wouldn't release the transcripts.

162
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.610
That was the great thing about Bernie during the 2016 election release the

163
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:36.970
transcripts. &lt;laugh&gt;, let's see those transcripts, you know, like.

164
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.240
<v 0>I watched you at Larry. David's so strange.</v>

165
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.640
Like I only see.

166
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.760
<v 1>Larry David, Larry, David does a amazing job as him. It's.</v>

167
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.840
<v 0>Like the meld. It's very weird. Yes. Like I was watching the,</v>

168
00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:52.760
the weekly episode of when the times endorsed the candidates or the two women.

169
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.760
And it was like, I'm, it was very strange. I was like,

170
00:08:55.761 --> 00:08:58.560
thinking that I'm literally looking at Larry &lt;laugh&gt;.

171
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.840
<v 1>But him as a human being when I was hanging out with him and I,</v>

172
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.200
I believe in him, I like him. I like him a lot.

173
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.960
<v 0>I know that the, like the like most scandalous thing about him,</v>

174
00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:10.640
the daily mail just like, was like Bernie Sanders.

175
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.710
He requests his junior suites in his hotels to be 65 degrees.

176
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.110
And he asks his staff to collect honey packets. &lt;laugh&gt; like,

177
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.830
this is like for his tea. &lt;laugh&gt; like, cool. Like,

178
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.310
that's.

179
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.070
<v 1>Hilarious. That's all they got on him.</v>

180
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.790
<v 0>Yeah. It's it's no, I mean, the thing to get on him on is like, you know,</v>

181
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.710
his apologetics for,

182
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.940
so union for Nicarag HES foreign policy stuff, it's just a disaster.

183
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.580
And that's what the, that is what Trump will crush him on. I mean,

184
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.620
Trump wants Bernie to be the candidate. You think so? Yeah. Yes.

185
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.660
<v 1>I, you don't think he wants.</v>

186
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.660
<v 0>Warren. I mean, Warren would be great too. Cuz then he has Poons.</v>

187
00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:51.494
Yeah, but like.

188
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:55.890
<v 2>I.</v>
