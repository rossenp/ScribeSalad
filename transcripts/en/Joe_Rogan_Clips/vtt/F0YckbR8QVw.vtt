00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.960
<v 2>What you don't hear only on Tucker Carlson. I don't know how that happened.</v>

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.880
Is anyone criticizing the pharmaceutical industry,

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.040
the number one advertiser in all media's pharmaceutical industry,

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.320
you will not see. So it's you it's CNN.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.630
Can't criticize the vaccines because, and they're advertising. Yeah.

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:22.510
They get calls. It's,

8
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:27.270
it's built on advertising and it's easier to discredit someone.

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.710
Uh, because when you say this guy is, uh, is a horrible person, right?

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.750
Advertisers run away from that. They don't want, this is,

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510
it has no different than Twitter or YouTube.

12
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.910
It's not really about political opinions.

13
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.540
Political opinions can leverage the advertiser relationship to get someone

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.060
canceled. Right. That's the mechanism. So this has become so good now.

15
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.940
And you know, like, what are they called? Sleeping giants and media matters.

16
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.180
And all these types of groups who organize. I mean,

17
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:00.380
I haven't seen it on podcast index. I've got a whole thing, Tim. Dylan sucks.

18
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:03.450
You have to get him off. He's a homophobia, he's a racist, he's a transphobia.

19
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.730
And then I'll see that, you know, five other guys who have podcasting 2.0 apps.

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.450
They have the same, the same note. Now there's no advertising.

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.690
So we're all like, whatever. Have you wait.

22
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.970
<v 0>A minute, hold on. Have you really seen something that says, Tim,</v>

23
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.370
Dylan's a homophobia? Oh yeah, he's gay.

24
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.330
<v 1>I'm just telling, of course, I'm just know how crazy that is.</v>

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.800
Are you asking me if the world has gone insane, Joe.

26
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.640
<v 0>But the fact that they wanna say that Tim Dylan's a homophobic.</v>

27
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.720
Cause he makes fun of gay people. He is actually gay.

28
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.520
<v 1>Yeah. I didn't know that I don't care.</v>

29
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.000
<v 0>But he's openly gay discusses.</v>

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
<v 1>It all the time. But the point is it's to leverage. This is,</v>

31
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.630
and this is okay where this all comes from. Ultimately I think is again,

32
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.390
the prob money, corrupts money is the root of all evil.

33
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.870
And, uh, right now we're in a position where the global banking system,

34
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:58.030
which is far from remove from even anything you and I can really understand

35
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.620
how credit works and how this 400 trillion worth of that

36
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.260
surrounds the bond markets. It's all just, it's an illusion. Um,

37
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.580
in order to, uh,

38
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.220
&lt;laugh&gt; in order to keep the control, um,

39
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.380
we have to utilize this at every single moment.

40
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.260
We have to use it as a wedge for everything.

41
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.370
And all of these companies are nothing more than a part of that system.

42
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.290
Hmm. They are the,

43
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.170
the money flows through everything and it's most of its advertising base.

44
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.970
All of Silicon valley is, is a hits business. Uh, instead of carry what,

45
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.210
what your users want. They want hits. So they'll acquire hits, oh, this is this,

46
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.570
this YouTuber's great. We're gonna help hook 'em up. Uh,

47
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:46.440
this podcast cast is great. We're gonna give 'em 60, 80, a hundred million,

48
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.960
no offense, but it's hits business. They're buying hits,

49
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.440
not doing anything more than that. And if you don't play along,

50
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.440
you're going to lose your income overnight. So ESG, have you heard of this?

51
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.560
No. Environmental, uh, I feel have a drink. You wanna have a drink?

52
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.720
I'd love a drink, especially when they get into ESG intense. No,

53
00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:10.360
but the ESG is fascinating. Bring some glasses in. Yeah.

54
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.520
So ESG and, and this is now something that if you want to invest in a company,

55
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.910
they will on their investor relations page, they'll show you at ESG score.

56
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.070
ESG stands for environmental social corporate governance.

57
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.150
And this is where the woke culture comes from.

58
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.430
So they've created this kind of phony baloney rating system that says, well,

59
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.870
if you I'm, I'm exaggerating. But if you mentioned that you are, you know, uh,

60
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:38.470
have a green agenda and you,

61
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.660
and you believe in carbon credits and you might trade some credit somewhere,

62
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.580
then you get a higher score and therefore you're more investible.

63
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.140
And it's very interesting to see how big investors like insurance company,

64
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.500
institutional investors,

65
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.580
they are steering away from anything that does not have the right ESG rating.

66
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.010
And so in order to, uh, have investors continue to be interested in the stock,

67
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.410
which is important for the company, for its perception, certainly for the, uh,

68
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.210
the officers of the company and the shareholders, uh,

69
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.970
you have to move this, move this along continuously.

70
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.290
And so it's very simple to see why doing a woke ad as Nike or as

71
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:22.280
any other company. Um, and, and, uh,

72
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.680
pride month is fantastic because you could, pride is easy,

73
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.040
throw up some flags show, the right people, trends, whatever, right?

74
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.840
And then you got a high ESG score.

75
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.320
And so this is a control mechanism that is being used throughout all

76
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.440
corporations worldwide. And I don't even think it's stoppable.

77
00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:41.670
People are just starting figure out what's going on.

78
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.830
That's where all this is coming from. Nike.

79
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.910
Doesn't give a about black people that way. I don't believe it.

80
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.590
They care about their stock price. Of course,

81
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.350
individually there's people who care. There's no doubt about it,

82
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.230
but it's driven by ESG. It is the, and so it kind of started with the, uh,

83
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.620
DEI, the diversity equity inclusion that has now moved over to, um,

84
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.420
and you can look it up. SASB, SASB,

85
00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:09.100
that's the board of standards and statistics for corporations,

86
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.860
and they have this formula, how you measure, uh, your ESG score.

87
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.860
And if you're really investible. And it's funny because you'll see,

88
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:21.140
like Nike has a 75% score Tesla, which you think would be really good,

89
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.410
38 because you know, not woke enough or Elon, you know, says the wrong things.

90
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.650
So it's actually harder to invest, uh,

91
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.610
for institution to invest in Tesla because of their low ESG score. Really?

92
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; huh? Yeah. This is, this is some,

93
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.890
I'm just really learning about this myself. What,

94
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:42.520
how did you find out about this ESG stuff? Ah, kidney's brother. I kidneys.

95
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.640
&lt;laugh&gt; you don't remember that joke? No, holy. You're my age. No.

96
00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:51.280
What is the joke from? It was a old joke. It's like some moronic kid in school,

97
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.760
you know, figured it out. And then, uh, it's like, Hey, how come?

98
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:57.520
You're not a moron? The moron says, uh, kidneys, kidneys. Oh, what, what?

99
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.400
It was on that doesn't quite work. What was that on?

100
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.640
<v 0>Was that.</v>

101
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 1>A joke on? That was when I was in third.</v>

102
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.200
<v 0>Grade. Oh, like a joke joke. Yeah. Like, oh, like two Jews walking to a bar.</v>

103
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.063
That kind of a joke.

104
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.800
<v 1>Yeah. Only less offensives.</v>

105
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.760
<v 0>Is that offensive? Well, the joke,</v>

106
00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:15.440
the Jews joke is they buy it two Jews walking a bar, they buy it. Yeah.

107
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.830
Boom shot lock. It's.

108
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.663
<v 1>Not.</v>

109
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.830
So this ESG stuff is really being utilized to control.

110
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.230
Ah, it. So society, society in general and,

111
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.310
and Twitter has to adhere to the same thing.

112
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.670
<v 0>And they're using it as a method to maximize profits because people will support</v>

113
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:36.950
companies that are woke because it aligns with their own purse.

114
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.100
So the companies espouse.

115
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.180
<v 1>I wouldn't say profits, I would say shareholder value. Okay.</v>

116
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.540
That's a little different than profit.

117
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.860
<v 0>Why, what, what is the difference between profit.</v>

118
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.740
<v 1>And shareholder? Well, this is so currently,</v>

119
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.740
if you are a CEO and you have a board and everyone has stock and all your

120
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.300
C-suite people, and you're important, people, all, all of shares and, uh,

121
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:57.060
the way the mechanism works, all right,

122
00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:00.370
we have the federal reserve and interest rate is at zero.

123
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.810
So big companies can go to any bank or, uh,

124
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.290
and literally federal reserve is a bank to, and say,

125
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.130
I need a hundred billion and they're gonna give it to me for almost 0%.

126
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.810
You know, cuz what we pay on credit card interest or something.

127
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:15.610
That's not what banks pay. They pay almost nothing.

128
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.120
So they get that free money and uh, then they buy back their stock buying back.

129
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:22.680
Their stock makes the price rise.

130
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.080
Everybody who has stock wins that has been going on for a long time.

131
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.281
That's that's,

132
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:32.160
that's the number one way of getting really rich in a public company, apple,

133
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.120
you know, this was the thing when Trump had is repatriation of the money and,

134
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.830
and also the, uh, the corporate tax cut. The main thing, that was a problem.

135
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.150
And I'm not sure how they dealt with it was, well, you're getting all this,

136
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.830
you you're bringing this money into the country, uh,

137
00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:47.870
or you're getting a tax break.

138
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.670
We don't want you just using it to reinve to buy your own shares.

139
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.270
Cuz you buy your own shares.

140
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.750
You're only making yourself wealthy off of actually the backs of the American

141
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:58.670
people because we didn't get that tax revenue. Mm.

142
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.540
And that's the system how it's worked and now they're just expanding it into

143
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:06.940
this E this mythical ESG. And you know, it's based on how, how green you are,

144
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.460
uh, you know, net zero aspirations reports, wokeness, uh,

145
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:13.294
social justice.

146
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.500
<v 0>And it's also because it's connected to the idea of being a better person.</v>

147
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.370
It's so easy to support. God love it, brother, look at the ads.

148
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.570
And it's one of the rare times where a corporation will get support from the

149
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:30.290
general public for yeah. For sticking with, because.

150
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.570
<v 1>We're good people. Yeah. And we all believe we're good people. People are.</v>

151
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.970
I love it. I want my,

152
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.970
my L G B T Q L G B B T Q Q I a P plus two BS.

153
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:43.720
I bye. And by curious, that's in there too, by curious.

154
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.880
<v 0>In my version, there is,</v>

155
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.560
is H in there yet just overall horny &lt;laugh&gt; can't people just isn't that

156
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:51.480
pansexual. Are they in there? I, I love.

157
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.600
<v 1>I find it so insulting that, you know, it's called the LGBTQ community.</v>

158
00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.800
It's not a community. It's just as insulting as the black and brown community.

159
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.120
Oh, what zip code do I go to, to meet some black and brown community people.

160
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.080
It's really, that to me is offensive. I hate that. But anyway,

161
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.480
so it's so good to have that group. And by the way, the LVES don't like the GS,

162
00:09:13.481 --> 00:09:17.430
the GS have problem. He's I mean, all this that's a great, um, uh,

163
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.110
Chappelle bit actually. Right, right, right. Yeah. The alphabet people. Yeah.

164
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.950
He's, he's spot on with that spot on. It's not a community, but anyway,

165
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.310
it's such a, it's being abused. Um, just, uh, black lives matter.

166
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.230
Ink, not black lives matter. The feeling is good people cuz we're good people.

167
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.660
We don't want racism. We don't want people hurt. We don't want people, um,

168
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:42.700
discriminated against, but we're being used like ponds and saying, oh,

169
00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:46.580
well then do this and go here and say yes to this. And then before you know, it,

170
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:50.500
you're kind of stuck in the system where you're afraid to say that's not okay.

171
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.220
Yeah. And for me it's as simplest saying,

172
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.100
I do not believe in an L G B T community.

173
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.850
I believe in people and they do their own thing and they love who they love and

174
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:02.770
do what they want. And that's one thing mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

175
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:05.970
it's not a community that you can put together and say,

176
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.810
this is what we're doing for them. Right. Right.

177
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.450
And I think trans women are the most abused by corporations.

178
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.930
Now they're using 'em everywhere and every ad and you know, just to,

179
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.320
just to push and push and push well.

180
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.680
<v 0>It's just because it's in Vogue. Right. So this is something that they latch on.</v>

181
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.840
<v 1>In Vogue or ESG. Yeah.</v>

182
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.880
<v 0>They, they latch on to, to, but of course, what does.</v>

183
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.760
<v 1>It stand for again, en environmental social corporate, uh, goals,</v>

184
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.160
a governance I'm sorry. Governance, environmental, social corporate governance.
