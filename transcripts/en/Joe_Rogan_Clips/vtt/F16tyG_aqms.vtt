WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.120
<v 3>You know, uh, Les STR. Yeah. Uh, so he did that show.</v>

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.440
<v 1>About Survivorman Bigfoot. Yeah. But it.</v>

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.273
<v 0>Just went away.</v>

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.400
<v 1>Bro. That show, I love Stroud. I love him. Love him.</v>

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.800
Love Survivorman that show was so dumb. Yeah.

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.630
He had a guy on the show that is known in the Bigfoot world

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.510
as being full of. Yeah. Which is bad.

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.270
Like if the Bigfoot world's pretty open mind &lt;laugh&gt;

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.990
This is one of the things that I wanted to bring up about that four 11 to hunted

11
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:35.180
thing.

12
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.070
There's audio recording that was supposedly taken

13
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.860
from the 1970s from Northern California.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.620
Um, I wanna say Sonoma,

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.340
I don't remember where it was. It was somewhere in Northern California,

16
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:56.060
but it's called they call 'em the, uh,

17
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.850
samurai sounds the Samura and it's the weirdest, man.

18
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.850
It's like these guys had this spot that they would go into the,

19
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.650
into the mountains and they would hunt every year and they built the structure

20
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.250
out there and then they brought recording equipment and they claimed to have

21
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.690
recorded sounds of these animals, these Bigfoot,

22
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.063
and that they,

23
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.720
these Bigfoot were around them all the time while they were up there.

24
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.480
Now what's crazy about it is the sounds are so weird.

25
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.400
It sounds like someone pretending to be Japanese that doesn't actually speak

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.640
Japanese. Have you ever heard it? Uh, we'll play it for you.

27
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:37.560
It's cuz it's the weirdest.

28
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.990
It's it's sounds so strange and fake,

29
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.420
but you know,

30
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.830
like they have these quote experts that say the human voice is not

31
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.950
capable of making sounds remotely similar to this.

32
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.430
The range is which doesn't make any sense if you know who Michael Winslow is.

33
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.670
Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. That guy who, that guy went on.

34
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.740
<v 0>He does a woman ping when she goes to the bathroom. He does everything.</v>

35
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.460
<v 1>Yeah. He does everything. He did lead Zeppelin.</v>

36
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.260
He played a whole lot of love with his mouth. Yeah. And it sounds incredible.

37
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.180
But um, this samurai sound like there's these loud. Whoops. Whoops.

38
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:16.780
And these guys are like in the foreground, you know,

39
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.180
like the guys who are recording,

40
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:22.660
they're trying to communicate with these things. They sound so calm. I mean,

41
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.290
if they're really were as giant eight foot apes out there

42
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.570
wandering around like, you know, two,

43
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:34.650
300 yards away from you screaming and whooping and talking, would you really?

44
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.050
And you're in the woods, would you really be so calm?

45
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.290
Wouldn't you be freaking the out. Yeah. Yeah. Would these guys, do you have it?

46
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.350
Yeah.

47
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.810
<v 2>I'm trying to make sure I find the right thing.</v>

48
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.640
Cause I I'm stumbling across some traps. Oh. Like people are make around the.

49
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.520
<v 1>Internet. I wish I could remember the gentleman's name. Well, I think.</v>

50
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.080
<v 2>I have it. That's all I'm saying. So Ronald J Moorehead and Alan Berry maybe.</v>

51
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.960
<v 1>Is that right? Yes. Ron Moorehead. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's it.</v>

52
00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:04.850
The Sierra mountains. That's what it is. All right.

53
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.970
And so, um, it's the weirdest ever. Listen, just listen to this. You're gonna,

54
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.650
I read what it could be, but we'll listen first. Oh, it could be as well.

55
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.723
It could be

56
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.673
That sound like

57
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.510
Listen to the guy. This is, hold stop, stop, stop.

58
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.910
This is a terrible version of it.

59
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.540
There's a better version of it where you can hear the guys really clearly the

60
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.620
people talking. I don't know why that's so scratchy,

61
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.900
but they're, they're like they're over by the lake. Like they're,

62
00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:14.140
they're talking like that. They hear

63
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.980
This very strange sound and they're coming calm about it. Yeah. And these,

64
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.330
you know, supposed experts are analyzing it.

65
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:26.210
The human body is incapable of making such sounds,

66
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.570
you know, in that area of you got it. I don't know. It says HD

67
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.320
They're knock. That's another thing that Sasquatch do they knock?

68
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.603
One's weird.

69
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.350
Scoot ahead a little bit and hear the samurai. Sounds

70
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.130
Still sounds terrible. Anyway, these people believe that,

71
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.730
Les Stroud was balls deep in this balls with that guy.

72
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.370
Apparently he had an experience and I talked to him about his experiences.

73
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:45.920
Pretty interesting. He was in, um, not with that guy, but,

74
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.280
but he was in Alaska and uh, apparently he heard some crazy noises.

75
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:53.480
Like some monkey sounds outside of his in the middle of nowhere.

76
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.080
No one was over in there and he said he heard something run away.

77
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.880
Some bipedal sound of something running away. But again,

78
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.620
even though he's an experienced woodsman and he's a guy who's,

79
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.040
you know,

80
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.340
camped out countless nights in the middle of nowhere and survives in the middle

81
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.700
of nowhere and documents it.

82
00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:16.340
Like he's the reason why those survivor shows exist. Yeah.

83
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.770
As that guy literally would starve to death and try to eat like bark and

84
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.290
whatever the he could for seven, you could see his face like sinking in. It was,

85
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.930
he was losing weight. I mean, he really did do that.

86
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.410
He did all sorts of different things to try to survive and then documented how

87
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:31.690
he was doing it and what he would do.

88
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.650
But he got obsessed with Bigfoot and then developed that Bigfoot show.

89
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.680
And unfortunately, a lot of people lost a lot of faith in him because of that.

90
00:06:40.681 --> 00:06:42.800
They're like, no, you're the legit survivor guy.

91
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.840
And now you're doing this show and this is why it's ridiculous.

92
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.680
There was one episode of the show where they had this guy who he was with,

93
00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:54.520
who had video of the Sasquatch, like high definition video.

94
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.310
And it looks so fake. Yeah. It's like,

95
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.430
he's like the Sasquatch is looking at him through the woods and he's like,

96
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.750
there he is. There he is. It's a guy with a mask on that's.

97
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.590
<v 0>Saw, he goes, yells out. I'm a Sasquatch. Like God, he just.</v>

98
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.510
<v 1>Yell that out. Oh no, he makes the, makes the sound big foot. But this,</v>

99
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.590
you know, the, the guy who had the videos known to be like full and here he is,

100
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.140
got this guy on his show. And then he, you know, is this real? You be the judge,

101
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.820
like, yeah, I'm gonna say, it's not real. It's a guy with a mask on. I think I.

102
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.580
<v 0>Did read that. That, that guy was very not respected. Yes.</v>

103
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.700
<v 1>In that, by the Bigfoot community. Yeah. You know the Bigfoot community again,</v>

104
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.340
very open-minded &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. He.

105
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.773
<v 0>Varis into everyth.</v>

106
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.450
<v 1>Was the other thing. Like they would,</v>

107
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:45.810
they would see trees that would fall over like in certain patterns.

108
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.410
And they were convinced that Sasquatch was leaning these trees against each

109
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:51.244
other.

110
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.250
<v 0>I thought it was like, yeah. To not to let you know where not to go. Yeah.</v>

111
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.400
<v 1>That's they had this idea. I mean, it's all theory, right? Yeah.</v>

112
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.000
<v 0>I think I's following the wrong guy, dude.</v>

113
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:03.800
I believe all the stuff that he likes fake. I'm like, yeah.

114
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.880
I only watched that less crowd one cause of that other guy.

115
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.240
<v 1>Well, I want it to be real. That's the thing I do too.</v>

116
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.240
If someone had a convincing big foot encounter where they caught it on

117
00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:19.440
video where I was like, holy, what is that? Like? What is that?

118
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.590
Or there was something, but there's nothing like, I, you know, I've,

119
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.910
I've talked to a lot of those people when I,

120
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.310
I did this show called Joe Rogan questions,

121
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:32.350
everything for sci-fi and me and Duncan Trussel actually went camping in the

122
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:35.870
Pacific Northwest. We didn't really camp. We pretend to go camping.

123
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.670
And then we went to a hotel. Yeah. And then we came back the next morning, like,

124
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.740
well rough, no camping.

125
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.340
But we were out there for days trying to look for Sasquatch and talking to

126
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:47.380
people that hunt for Sasquatch.

127
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.100
And the one conclusion that we came to is it's a bunch of unfuckable white

128
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.100
dudes. Like.

129
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.180
<v 0>That's just out there just out there camping.</v>

130
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.040
<v 1>It's just, but the, the desire for it to.</v>

131
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.520
<v 0>Be real is so strong. It would change. I watched, you know,</v>

132
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.560
like that finding Bigfoot show, I used to always think, cuz people like,

133
00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:08.400
why is it on I'm like, I don't know, man. Cause it's fun to watch.

134
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.960
And if they find him, the world is different now,

135
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.190
like if they come back with Bigfoot, everything's, everything's different.

136
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:17.110
Everything's getting different with the alien thing. Yeah.

137
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.430
The fact that they're saying it's that that's like true. You're like,

138
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.150
that's a lot, dude. That's a lot to take. If we get, you know,

139
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.630
I know that they have the videos and stuff, the aliens, but like if you, if you,

140
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.230
we get up straight up, start talking to one, I mean, I don't know what's.

141
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.190
<v 1>Gonna happen. Well, here's something that came out, uh, today. Jamie,</v>

142
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.940
I'm gonna send you this, uh, cuz uh, uh, saga and jet from uh,

143
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.420
rising on the hill and I've been going back and forth with this. And I,

144
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.420
I found this today and sent it to him. It's um,

145
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.720
I'll send it to you right now, Jamie. Um,

146
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.640
it says paradigm shifting UFO tech that alters space

147
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.710
time is operable us Navy, chief tech officer.

148
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.430
So it's some story that I didn't bother looking into because

149
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:06.670
I, I saw it when I was on my way out the door. And I was like,

150
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.310
what in the is this?

151
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.630
Cuz there's been all these sightings of these things that move in some weird

152
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.470
way, paradigm shifting UFO tech there.

153
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.820
So there's these things that been that move in this weird way that don't show

154
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:24.140
any propulsion system and oh, due to censorship,

155
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:25.700
please join us on telegram.

156
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.420
I'm gonna say documents obtained by the drive show.

157
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:34.460
The revolutionary technology that is capability to alter space time may actually

158
00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:36.660
be operable. According to the Naval,

159
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.050
a enterprise chief technology officer. Dr. James,

160
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.090
how do you say that name Shehe is.

161
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.050
<v 2>Comparable in quotes? What is.</v>

162
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.290
<v 1>That? I don't know. Good question. Reflect on. Uh,</v>

163
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.170
why is technology that is a potential to change the entire human experience for

164
00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:56.650
the better always used for the defense purposes and military applications.

165
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.720
What are betterments? What about the betterment of humanity? Yeah,

166
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
I don't know. Um, but it's Christopher Mellon.

167
00:11:06.161 --> 00:11:10.320
Who's that guy who keeps coming up with all this, uh, UFO. Textile.

168
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.080
Can you scroll back up please? If someone's.

169
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.840
<v 2>Just like writing, I was reading through Twitter. It's like a story.</v>

170
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.800
It's not really like an article.

171
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.390
<v 1>Right? Um,</v>

172
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.790
Twitter feed of Christopher mill on the former deputy assistant defense

173
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.550
secretary for intelligence from 97 to 2002 doing so I came across an interesting

174
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:30.070
post from the drive regarding documents. They received via the freedom,

175
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.590
freedom of information act regarding a space time modification,

176
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:36.390
weapon developed by the us Navy,

177
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:39.260
which apparently has already gone through experimental testing.

178
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.500
This in turn led me to evidence suggesting that other revolutionary type of

179
00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:47.780
technology that could no doubt be used to change the world for the better blah,

180
00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:52.020
blah blah was already operable. Yeah, I don't know. But that, this is what, um,

181
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.400
if you pay attention to the UFO world, do you pay attention to that at all? Uh.

182
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.373
<v 0>Not like.</v>

183
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.480
<v 1>Actively, there's a guy named Bob Lazar in his.</v>

184
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.320
<v 0>I do know that from cause you.</v>

185
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.360
<v 1>Talked to him. Yeah. It was one of the weirdest conversations I've ever had.</v>

186
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.800
Cause you're like, I mean, are you crazy? Are you full? Or is this real? Yeah.

187
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.640
Cause if it is real, it's wild. This,

188
00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:12.320
this thing is a special effect.

189
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.630
Created a guy who was a special effect artist. Do you remember his name?

190
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:19.110
Jamie who made this thing for us? This gentleman,

191
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.650
he's got a, um,

192
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.370
design designs by Perry designs by Perry at Instagram.

193
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:34.040
And he created this thing and this is like a

194
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.200
scale model of what Bob Lazar supposedly worked on.

195
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.400
He was hired by the United States military to work at area

196
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.250
S four,

197
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.040
which is part of the area 51 like area 51 site

198
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.200
S four site four was this place where he

199
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.190
allegedly worked to back engineer,

200
00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.470
these spaceships and the way these things moved around was exactly how this

201
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:06.310
Christopher Melan guy or this article rather quoted him as describing that they

202
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.550
use some sort of gravity space, time bending technology.

203
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.780
So they didn't use a propulsion system like a rocket shoot, flame out the back.

204
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.380
They bent time in front of them and just would shoot instantaneously to wherever

205
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:20.900
the they wanted to go. So.

206
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.660
<v 0>You'd be like.</v>

207
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.460
<v 1>Instantly be able to go instantly.</v>

208
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.540
What's is that there was an instance off of the, uh,

209
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:33.380
coast of San Diego in 2004 where, uh, a Navy pilot, uh,

210
00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:36.330
by the name of commander David Craver, who I've also had on the show,

211
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.330
experienced this thing that they call the tic TAC UFO.

212
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.690
They tracked it with radar. They tracked it with, um, their,

213
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.890
the camera systems on the, on the, on the, on their plane.

214
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.890
And they even have video footage of this thing.

215
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.890
It went from 80,000 feet above sea level to one

216
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.080
in a second. Wow.

217
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.280
That's the amount of time that it takes for radar to do the blip PIP. Yeah.

218
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.360
Blip. So in that time it traveled 80,000 feet.

219
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.120
They have no idea how the it did that. It shows no propulsion heat, signature.

220
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.600
They took video footage of this thing. And it went from there.

221
00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:16.790
It took off where they couldn't even follow it with their eyes just appeared to

222
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.590
the predetermined destination where they were supposed to coordinate later.

223
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.950
So it's like it's reading their tracking systems or reading where they were

224
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:28.910
going. And the people that worked on the aircraft carrier were telling the,

225
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.510
the fighter pilot, like we've been seeing these things over, you know,

226
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.750
we see them like every couple weeks we have no idea what the going on. Yeah.

227
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.420
And they, they just say, well, there it is. You know, what,

228
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.453
what are we gonna do about that?

229
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.860
<v 0>Yeah. I like to picture the, like an alien in that tic TAC. He's like, well,</v>

230
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.580
slow it down. You're kind of crazy right now. Like he's,

231
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.500
he's having a bad day and there, cause he's gotta be having just a day.

232
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.600
Whoever's in there some kind of day. Maybe, maybe having a day. That's a,

233
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.960
it's a lot to, yeah. I don't know.

234
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.720
You think it's like a lot to just tell people,

235
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.880
like if they had to be like to tell like just earth,

236
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.240
all of us humans on earth to like wrap our head around what would happen?

237
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.030
I think.

238
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.760
<v 1>What do you say if that's all, you know,</v>

239
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:12.030
like if you are the military and all, you know,

240
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.590
is that something can do these things, something can move at the speed.

241
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:15.791
You know,

242
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:19.350
the New York times had a front page article about it a couple years ago. And um,

243
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.790
but basically they're saying, Hey, you know,

244
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:27.670
there are videos of things moving in away that we don't

245
00:15:27.671 --> 00:15:32.340
understand that aren't exhibiting a heat signature that indicates a propulsion

246
00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:36.940
system. And we don't know what it is. And this is, and then the, the there's uh,

247
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.740
the COVID 19 bill that just got passed.

248
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.460
And one of the provisions in the COVID 19 bill is that they have 60, no,

249
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.180
180 days to release all the information they have about UFOs.

250
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.200
<v 0>That's a.</v>

251
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.410
<v 1>You know, but I don't know if they're gonna do anything with,</v>

252
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.010
I think they're gonna do nothing. That's funny that it's in these.

253
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.970
<v 0>Yeah. We don't have 19 bill. Like.</v>

254
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.090
<v 1>That's a lot of weird was in the COVID nine bill, 19 bill, like,</v>

255
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.530
like foreign aid.

256
00:16:01.531 --> 00:16:05.010
There's a lot of foreign aid to Pakistan aid to all these countries.

257
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.010
It's like people just to get it past, they're like, okay, we we'll say yes,

258
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.720
but I want you to do a little, little favor for me and at this, in the bill.

259
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.840
Yeah. And there's, you know, it just shows you how greasy politicians are. Yeah.

260
00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:16.320
Yeah. It's.

261
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.160
<v 0>Kind of crazy. Yeah.</v>

262
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:22.080
<v 1>Yeah. But that's allegedly what all that UFO technology is.</v>
