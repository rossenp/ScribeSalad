00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 1>When you say studies magic, what do you mean? So, um,</v>

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.690
well he wrote a great book called high magic, which is,

4
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.560
I think that's what it's called.

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.850
It's a fantastic book on magic is really the wrong word for it.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.850
There's a entire like, uh,

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.110
mythos or religion that got sort of wiped out by,

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
um, Terence McKenna talks about it a lot. I got kinda wiped out by, um,

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.760
I guess, you know, superstition,

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.770
so witchcraft as we understand it now because of Hollywood is like, you know,

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.980
ladies riding around on brooms and, but it just needs to be [inaudible]. It

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 used to be like healing women who would like deliver babies and stuff. And

13
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.980
, but these, these were all connected to they're all at pagan roots. And, um,

14
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 and so essentially you can follow back this branch of data that some people say started in Sumeria or Egypt

15
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.980
, uh,  ways of, um,

16
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 meditating ways of connecting with the universe that are ritualistic in nature, but 

17
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.980
seem

18
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 mysterious to us because even though like, if you want to see what it looks like, just 

19
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.813
look at a Catholic mass, you're looking at a ceremony.

20
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.270
It's fear, gee, I guess you'd call it.

21
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:22.950
That is a magical ceremony where bread gets converted into the flesh of a

22
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:26.760
God that you eat. So that's your watch. They're all wearing robes.

23
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.250
They're burning incense. So that is magic.

24
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.200
That's what ceremonial magic looks like.

25
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.570
It's non different from ceremonial magic.

26
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.390
Someone in the Catholic church might tell you this isn't magic.

27
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:40.950
This is me praying to the

28
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:44.340
infinite and asking for forgiveness.

29
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.660
That's magic. You're connecting with a divine intelligence.

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.860
You're hoping from your connection with the divine intelligence to produce some

31
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:57.390
change in your own psychology in your own life and maybe

32
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.690
create good fortune or whatever it is. You're praying for healing,

33
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.430
whatever it may be. That's magic. So magic is that.

34
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:06.780
And that it's,

35
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.040
I'm not saying the Catholic Catholicism wouldn't necessarily be considered,

36
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.090
uh, a branch of magic. But I mean,

37
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:16.530
one of the things he said in this interview is like,

38
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:21.180
if the Bible is one of the most powerful, magical grimoires, there is, I mean,

39
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:23.760
you read that. If you really look in it,

40
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.960
there's all kinds of bizarre stuff that doesn't seem to make it onto the

41
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:30.690
Christian radio. Look what well,

42
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:34.290
like when in the book of Genesis it's why are they saying,

43
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.530
why do they refer to themselves as a plurality when God's talking?

44
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:40.530
It's not like, if, when they're saying like,

45
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.280
why do we throw Adam and Eve out of the garden? It's we,

46
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:47.400
if we don't do something about this, they will become like us.

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.070
We there's a plurality that's being mentioned there.

48
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.270
And so what does that plurality? So throughout the Bible,

49
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.270
there's mentions of angels. The book of Ezekiel,

50
00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:01.600
the famous one that UFO ologists go to is there's all these

51
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:06.130
contacts with angels, hyper dimensional beings that have some data set.

52
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.250
They want to bring to the world quite often,

53
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.580
depending on what book you're in at some terrifying prophecy about the end of

54
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.850
the world that's coming. But sometimes it's, you know,

55
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.700
some message of hope or some message of healing.

56
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.210
So you could say magic is a

57
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.700
non-Christian oriented method for connecting with those

58
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.630
various entities using ritual.

59
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.230
That's one branch of it. Um, now I'm not saying by the way,

60
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.390
these beings exist or don't exist, but you could say,

61
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.900
if you wanted to get like psychological, you could say,

62
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.440
we have buried inside of us. Um,

63
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.990
bit archetypes, bits of the collective that are buried deep inside of us.

64
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:53.260
And that there are ways to connect to these, uh,

65
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.920
little fragments of the collective mind.

66
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.600
And you know, many people know, have their own method for doing that.

67
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.520
One of the methods to do that might be doing a ritual and for a moment,

68
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.140
allowing yourself to imagine that you're trying to talk to an extra

69
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:12.040
dimensional beam,

70
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.920
Alister Crawley famously did one of these rituals and contacted a,

71
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.290
oh God, what was it? I can't remember what the being was called,

72
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.420
but it looks like a gray alien.

73
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.960
This is before people were talking about gray lands. When you looked at it,

74
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.870
he drew it. There's a drawing of it. Yeah.

75
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.580
And it looks like a gray alien as well. It's like the 18 hundreds.

76
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.770
<v 2>Alister crowd was in the 18 hundreds.</v>

77
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.570
<v 1>Right? 1918, 19. Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.280
<v 2>When you keep pulling it, your ghillie suit,</v>

79
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.980
you remind me of a drunk overweight girl with large breasts.

80
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.870
It keeps adjusting her halter top. Like you're in Florida, outside drinking.

81
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.590
It's a motel. I told that, I'm going to leave me.

82
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.220
I'm going to leave you Clarence. I'm tired of y'all.

83
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.970
I told them with a cigarette in her hand. Wow. Look at that.

84
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:00.580
Drawing by Allister Crawley. Yeah. That does look at your.

85
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.620
<v 1>Gray alien man. And that's.</v>

86
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.080
<v 2>What we're going to look like, man, let's cut the. Right?</v>

87
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.360
That's what we're going to look like. Right? When you,

88
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:11.740
when you see people that are hairy and, and, and brutish you,

89
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.970
we think of them as being like closer to prehistoric man. Right?

90
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.900
You see a guy covered in hair. He looks more like a beast.

91
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.820
And when we see people that are thinner and more slender,

92
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.230
they become more, more a gentle version of people. And we associate that.

93
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.760
Oftentimes with intelligence,

94
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.680
we associate directly associate intelligence with frailty, right?

95
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:39.760
We all do that. When you see some, some super genius guy, usually they're frail,

96
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.530
right? Occasionally they're bad asses,

97
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.440
but there's a lot of those super genius guys that couldn't fight their way out

98
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:45.820
of a wet paper bag. Well,

99
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.930
Hawking's the ultimate example because his body literally failed him while he

100
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.370
was coming up with his greatest discoveries. Yeah. So this is this our future.

101
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.960
We're going to have big heads.

102
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.340
They're going to CRISPR your way into a head that lets you live

103
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.960
in any dimension you want.

104
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.310
At any time you transport yourself from one planet to the other.

105
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.080
Imagine what we've done with our stupid monkey brains.

106
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.890
Now imagine it was 150% larger,

107
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.460
150% more brain, and then incorporated all sorts of electronics.

108
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.300
It lets you interface with space,

109
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.750
time around you in all kinds of wacky ways of communicating.

110
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:28.490
We couldn't even possibly imagine.

111
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.970
Now just like people from the 18 hundreds couldn't have ever possibly imagined

112
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:32.804
cell phones.

113
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.770
<v 1>And this is the idea is like, okay, we're going to go there.</v>

114
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.280
And then when we get there, the way we understand space,

115
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:42.890
time is going to be different than the way we understand it now.

116
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.830
So what that means is theoretically,

117
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.780
you could connect or communicate with a being that is

118
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.310
outside of space time,

119
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.900
which is a future version of us right now using like

120
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.460
various methods, DMT being one of the big ones on the planet right now,

121
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.420
but also using other methods that are a little bit more precise because with

122
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:07.340
DMT, it's kind of like,

123
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.220
you're not really putting in GPS coordinates necessarily.

124
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.480
Some people do it with intention.

125
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:16.400
Like a shaman will do it like with intention and, and can like, you know, hi,

126
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.220
excuse me, can you get me another bloody Mary?

127
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.700
<v 2>I told you, Clarence, I'll leave you cigarette in your hand.</v>

128
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:25.910
Flip flops on. I will leave you. If you.

129
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.890
<v 1>Keep seven of these diamonds I I'm out.</v>

130
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.130
<v 2>Of here. Clarence is over there with Miller light. You ain't going nowhere.</v>

131
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.350
Just stop. Just stop. You always do this. She gets drunk, says she's leaving.

132
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.760
I'm a lead Clarence.

133
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.890
I'm gonna leave you son of a.

134
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.220
<v 1>I'm putting on my ghillie suit and going down to Tampa.</v>

135
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.700
<v 2>You son of a, I'm going to visit my family and Clearwater.</v>

136
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.940
<v 1>Here, Clarence it's over anyway. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.680
Maybe you can connect through time and space to these things that are

138
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:01.910
already here. Like our understanding of time and space. We're locked in man.

139
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:02.744
But like,

140
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.580
so magic is like ridiculous on one level as it absolutely

141
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:12.140
sounds and is on one level on another level is at the very least a creative

142
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:16.910
technique so that you can sort of summon a dream state while you're awake with

143
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.850
the intent of causing some change in the world,

144
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:21.890
around you using for a lot of people,

145
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:23.570
what would be considered a non-standard way?

146
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.350
<v 2>Well, just in terms of your perception of how you view the world,</v>

147
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.650
you can alter that pretty radically. I mean,

148
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:34.130
from someone who has an amazingly positive perception versus someone has an

149
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:37.250
amazingly negative perception, you look at the results, right?

150
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.390
Over overwhelming benefit of being a positive person.

151
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.980
There's something to thoughts and ideas that propel you in a good way.

152
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.800
And for having a good architecture for having a good philosophy,

153
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.190
having a good operating manual for how you view the world,

154
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.210
how you act and behave part of that.

155
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.220
So you getting up at four o'clock in the morning. That's what that is.

156
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.290
You only can forcing your ability to sort of dictate the positive aspects of

157
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.170
your future. You're you're deciding to take action.

158
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.080
You're strengthening your bond with the,

159
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.810
with the way you interface with the current reality.

160
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.250
And I was doing it re I mean, not rigid happened. Let's stop. What the? Oh,

161
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:21.060
Christmas God, listen, man. If you want to meet me here, I'll meet you here.

162
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.440
We could do some 5:00 AM sessions. I love that, man. I mean, yeah,

163
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.860
