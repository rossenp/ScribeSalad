00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. To, to all of us in the political world,</v>

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.000
Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great mystery. And frankly,

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.960
we kind of like it that way. It makes you, it, it,

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.320
it keeps you out of the freight.

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.440
<v 1>It's more of a mystery now. Cause I said that I wouldn't vote for Biden. That,</v>

6
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:18.640
that I, I said I would vote for Trump over Biden. All these people went crazy,

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.110
but let me, let me be, you know what,

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.910
I'd also vote for Whoopi Goldberg over Joe Biden.

9
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.630
I'd I'd vote for Mike Tyson over Joe Biden.

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.070
I just don't think it's a good idea to take someone who's struggling with

11
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.350
dementia and put him in one of the most stressful positions the world has ever

12
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.830
known. That's what I'm saying is not an endorsement of Trump,

13
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.980
is it is a me saying you shouldn't have a man who is clearly

14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.020
clearly in the throes of dementia. I mean, there's, I'm not a doctor,

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.580
but when you can't form sentences in public and you forget what you're

16
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:55.900
talking about and you you're, you wander off into these conversations.

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.860
If you're not smoking pot, you, you're not hot. If you're not on pills,

18
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.010
like what's going on. Well, the cognitive decline,

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.890
he's an older man that has mental issues and you know,

20
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.250
not to be cruel to him. He he's, he's suffering medically.

21
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:15.290
This is is a real issue. And the Democrats wanna sweep that under the rug.

22
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.050
And Trump is already chewing him apart. He's already dismissing him. I mean,

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
there is a recent thing that come Al Kalinsky posted a video, uh,

24
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.080
on his Twitter talking about this is what happens when you don't discuss the

25
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.073
elephant in the room.

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.960
And it's Trump saying you used to do doing a press conference.

27
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:35.520
And they asked him a question about something that Biden wrote. He goes Biden.

28
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.640
Didn't write that. He's like, he, he that's a democratic operative.

29
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.800
He didn't read it. He, he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now.

30
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.510
And he's gonna, he's gonna continue to do that. And it's,

31
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630
it's such a vulnerable point. And I,

32
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.830
I don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone

33
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.830
who's clearly got a problem. I mean, this is, I mean, I,

34
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.910
I don't wanna be mean to the guy, but we've all seen it. That's not normal.

35
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.220
It's not normal to get, like when he's talking about the,

36
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:08.940
the creator and he literally loses what he's saying. He's like, oh, the,

37
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.740
you know, the thing like the misquoted.

38
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.260
<v 0>The decoration of independence twice now, which is, I mean, that's,</v>

39
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:17.940
it's a very simple document. &lt;laugh&gt; I don't understand.

40
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.020
<v 1>Well, there's a bunch of those things.</v>

41
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.330
Like when he was talking about the cure and losing what he's that you have to

42
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:29.090
take care of the cure and he he's, he's struggling. The guy's struggling. Yeah.

43
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.930
He's tired. This is his extremely stressful process to run for president.

44
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.570
And the idea that he's gonna be able to get through this and be okay on the

45
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.490
other side to run the country for four potentially eight years is crazy.

46
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.480
Here's a better one. Epstein EP scenes killer. That's one.

47
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.040
Nobody thinks that that guy hung himself. No one. How about that guy?

48
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.200
So if you have various theories or various stories that people come out and talk

49
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:56.040
about with that one.

50
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.161
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:03.000
And I just actually yesterday listened to Eric Weinstein's solo podcast on,

52
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.200
on Jeffrey Epstein. Yeah. I don't know if you've listened to caught it. He,

53
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.360
he talks about his kind of conspiracy view of it. Uh.

54
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.760
<v 1>I wish I was there when he met him.</v>

55
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.640
I would've been fascinating to see cuz Eric is too smart.

56
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.310
He's almost like too smart. He's one of those guys he's talk to him like, oh,

57
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:21.190
you poor bastard. You're burdened.

58
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.350
You're you're burdened trying to make sense to the world around apes, you know.

59
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.710
<v 2>And all the trauma of in the, like we were talking about,</v>

60
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.510
he's still also the 13, the 20 year old kid. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

61
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.670
So he's seeing, uh, he had a few run-ins with authority, which makes it,

62
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.750
which makes him suspicious of authority.

63
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.060
And I think our life experience defines that.

64
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:44.620
So you can see Epstein in a lot of different ways,

65
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:46.260
depending on how you've experienced.

66
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.740
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. Life, I mean, um, uh, but.</v>

67
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.460
<v 2>If you were there &lt;laugh&gt; I, I, I could tell you &lt;laugh&gt; very nice.</v>

68
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.300
Uh, I could, well, C.

69
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.380
<v 1>B kill cliff on your, your certain.</v>

70
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.330
<v 2>&lt;Affirmative&gt;. I like it. Uh, I, I,</v>

71
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.290
I know actually quite a lot of people that have met Epstein.

72
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.570
<v 1>Do you really? Yeah, because you're in the scientific community, right? Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:08.970
Yeah. And.

74
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.803
<v 2>Especially at MIT.</v>

75
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.250
<v 1>He was a big donor. He,</v>

76
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.130
he tainted a lot of people's reputations by knowing him in a weird way.

77
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.930
Basically.

78
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.050
<v 2>If you took a picture with him, your reputation is tainted. Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.560
<v 1>Uh, yeah. Whether you knew him or not.</v>

80
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.520
<v 2>But I think I, I do think that, uh,</v>

81
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.080
outside of conspiracy theories that he was an exceptionally charming person.

82
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.760
So he was good, you know, at charming people, you mean at charming people. Yeah.

83
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:38.960
Yeah. I don't mean to make it sound. Yeah.

84
00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:41.150
I know what positive or negative it is is what it is,

85
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.510
is the devil is gonna be charming, so. Right, right.

86
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.710
And the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity

87
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.710
for towards scientific ideas, even out there, big scientific,

88
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:56.830
especially what do you think.

89
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.950
<v 1>That was though? Have you ever thought about that?</v>

90
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.900
Do you think that it's possible that look, I mean,

91
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:08.340
if you just look at it from perspective of, is it the, the big theory,

92
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.860
the big theory, right?

93
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.300
Is that he's some sort of a intelligence operative, right?

94
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.020
Yes. So if he's an intelligence operative, do you,

95
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:23.410
don't you think it's a part of his job to try to end infiltrate the scientific

96
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:24.211
communities? I mean,

97
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:27.530
there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative,

98
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:31.530
it's not like, they're like, Hey, go pursue your interest. &lt;laugh&gt; do, Hey,

99
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.570
do I hear you have a really big, uh, love of science?

100
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.290
Just feel free to do that on the side. No. What, what, what the was he doing?

101
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.490
If he's an intelligence operative, what is he?

102
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.640
Is the intelligence having sex with underage girls? It can't be that, you know,

103
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:45.241
this is one reason.

104
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:48.440
People believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of 'em are true. Yeah.

105
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.000
All of, of them, not all of them, but I, I point to, with you, um,

106
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.880
with the Epstein case, like you were one of the first people, I mean, as a,

107
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.000
literally you're a professional skeptic &lt;laugh&gt; and,

108
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.960
and you looked at some of the evidence, you're like, oh, well, you know what?

109
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.440
This might be a conspiracy &lt;laugh&gt;. You know? And when I said,

110
00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:10.480
when Michael Shermer thinks it might be a conspiracy,

111
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.800
it's probably a conspiracy. &lt;laugh&gt;.

112
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.720
<v 3>There's been enough of them. I'm still not sure about that one,</v>

113
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:17.990
because after I posted something about the, you know,

114
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:21.190
the two cameras broke or whatever, somebody wrote me from that prison saying,

115
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.750
all those cameras are always breaking like, oh, it's.

116
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.550
<v 1>A little convenient though that, you know,</v>

117
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.150
he winds up strangling himself in a way that Michael Baton, the,

118
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.070
the famous autopsy doctor says is completely inconsistent with

119
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:37.580
hanging and much more consistent with someone strangling you. I,

120
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:40.820
including the actual area where he was hanging from,

121
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.620
supposedly like it's consistent with someone strangling you from behind.

122
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.180
Not consistent with you hanging by your own weight.

123
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.740
<v 3>Yeah. After Weinstein got his, his, um, Harvey Weinstein got his conviction.</v>

124
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.780
I thought, oh boy, be they better have a real suicide watch on this guy,

125
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.930
cuz yeah. He's he surely has a black book just as big is.

126
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.330
<v 1>Epstein's. Oh, I'm sure. Well, I think what,</v>

127
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.650
what he's got is probably more incriminating to him though. You know,

128
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.850
I think what he's got is probably, Hey,

129
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.490
I had sex with all these starlets and turned them into big celebrities and

130
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.650
this, and I bet he probably doesn't want that out.

131
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.600
Especially at this stage of the game. Nothing.

132
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.960
I don't think anything he's got is gonna make him look good.

133
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.520
And I think with the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much about

134
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.400
too many powerful people. There's just so,

135
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.640
so many connections that could be made with that guy and that, you know,

136
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:33.201
to this day,

137
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:36.960
people are asking questions that people like bill gates don't want to answer or

138
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.350
prince Andrew or anything they're like, know, I don't wanna talk about this.

139
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.773
Yeah.

140
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.670
<v 3>I didn't, I didn't hear the one about gates, but,</v>

141
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:46.470
but prince Andrew of course gates.

142
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.470
<v 1>Apparent apparently flew on the Lolita express four years after he was</v>

143
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:51.304
convicted.

144
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.310
<v 3>Oh, okay. Wow. All right. According.</v>

145
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.590
<v 1>Daily year or whatever the it was. I don't, I would,</v>

146
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.340
I would ask Jamie to look that, but I've got his computer right now. iPad.

147
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.380
&lt;laugh&gt; hook it up on your iPad. Find out if it's true.

148
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:07.980
If bill gates flew in the Lolita express, cuz that's what I was reading today.

149
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.460
There, people were trying to ask bill gates,

150
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.820
but it's so hard to know what's true and what's not true today.

151
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:16.980
That's the thing is there's so much data. And so, I mean,

152
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.050
one of the things that's really sad about the loss of respect for mainstream

153
00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:26.250
journalism and mainstream media is, well, if we count, can't count on them,

154
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.610
then who's regulating the independence. Who's regulating these websites.

155
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:32.610
Who's regulating these people that are just, you know,

156
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.010
so called independent journalists that are just tweeting things and finding

157
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:38.370
things. Yeah. Putting things up on their websites.

158
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:42.240
It's it's so hard to tell who telling the truth and who's not dude.

159
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.040
You wanna see.

160
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.840
<v 4>People in America. with football, with LSU football or Georgia football,</v>

161
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:50.640
college football. See what happens? You think things are bad now.

162
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.760
With the college.

163
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.560
<v 1>Football, you know, this is a weird time too,</v>

164
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:57.040
because it is right before the election, you know, election comes in November.

165
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.320
Like imagine if this had this was going on right now.

166
00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:04.600
And the election was like next week, God imagine chaos. Your boy,

167
00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:09.600
Bernie dropped out. Yep. It's a rap Biden. Ain't beaten Trump.

168
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.440
Nope. That's your bass. That's the guy.

169
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.190
It shows you how crazy this system is that they wanted him,

170
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.990
that they wanted Biden to, to, to be their guy that they don't.

171
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.750
They can't admit that he's in cognitive decline. I mean,

172
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:27.590
it's very strange. Listen, I up all the time. I speak for a living.

173
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.070
I up all the time. But Biden, Biden, but Biden. No, he up man.

174
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.870
You're politician. I up all the time too.

175
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:37.100
But we're also taught for hours and hours and hours at a time.

176
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.300
If I had a prepared thing that I was doing, like my standup, I don't up in.

177
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.660
Right. I would. You would be sharp as.

178
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.700
If you were having one of those conversations, they're asking you, look,

179
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.620
if someone wants to ask me questions about things that I understand,

180
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.540
like MMA or like comedy.

181
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.460
Like if you want to ask me questions about things that I think about and talk

182
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.930
about all the time, you have your black belt in both those. Yeah.

183
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.890
I can talk to you and really clearly about those things and make a lot of sense.

184
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.450
He can't do that about politics and he's been a politician forever.

185
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.650
And that's your. He's, he's an, you know, he's a guy who's suffering,

186
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.890
he's in decline and they're gonna try to wa him out and whoever his VP is,

187
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:17.880
whether it's Kamala Harris or a she baby, whoever it is,

188
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.680
but that's who you're voting for. You know, he's I mean,

189
00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:23.720
it's sort of like when Dick Cheney was basically running the country, well,

190
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.400
George Bush was the president. Yeah. You know, I don't know. We'll see.

191
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.320
There's no way he beats Trump. He doesn't beat Trump. Not a chance. No,

192
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:36.080
not a chance, especially because of the timing of this right now, we're in the.

193
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.630
Right? We're in the April. is the worst time of the Corona.

194
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.430
A lot of people are dying. There's a slight drop off in New York.

195
00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:45.550
People dying less today than yesterday.

196
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.270
Slight drop off yesterday from the day before.

197
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.510
So things are looking pretty good, California. California's gonna be, yeah,

198
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:54.390
California's looking very good, right? Yeah. We're crushing it. Huh?

199
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:58.180
California is looking very good. So, and then where's that. Oh, here it's.

200
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.260
And so, and then you go June, July, August,

201
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.740
hopefully everything's up and running again.

202
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.900
Economy starts coming back on track. Trump makes uh, a couple of great speeches.

203
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.700
B Biden is more in decline. It's not gonna get better. No. Those two face off.

204
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.250
Trump's gonna light him up. Like economy central roast.

205
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.530
He's already dismissing him. Yeah. He's already, he's like,

206
00:11:20.531 --> 00:11:23.090
he doesn't know sleepy Biden. He's like, but he's saying like someone said,

207
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:24.730
Biden said this. He goes, he did. First of all,

208
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.090
he didn't write that it was democratic operative.

209
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.210
He probably doesn't even know what it says. He's gonna destroy him, man.

210
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:32.330
He's gonna kill him, man. I mean, it's such an easy target.

211
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.890
It's like Mike Tyson versus a three year old. It's true. It really is.

212
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.760
It's it's it's a terrible fight. Yeah.
