<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.320
<v 1>Experience. Very, not only individually, but I think we very,</v>

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.400
uh, we become different creatures in different conditions. Sure.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.960
So people sometimes will ask me like, what's your, you know,

5
00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:16.840
what is human nature? What's your opinion, you know, based on these books.

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.400
And I say, it's like asking, what's the natural state of H two. Oh,

7
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.910
&lt;laugh&gt; right. It's it boiling? Is it ice? Exactly. What are the,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:25.750
what's the pressure? What's the altitude. Yeah.

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.510
Don't you feel like you're different people with different people as well. Yeah.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.590
Yeah. I had a girlfriend, um, a Spanish.

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.470
She was her mothers, French,

12
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:40.910
her father's catallan she was raised in Spain and then lived in Miami, uh,

13
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.180
when she was 13 to 15 or something. So she spoke English really well,

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.860
Spanish, French, and Katalan perfectly right.

15
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.420
And we were living in San Francisco and I was high.

16
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.800
I was smoking a joint.

17
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.220
She was across the room talking to her mom on the phone in French.

18
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.410
And then her mom put her dad on the phone, you switched to Kalan. And,

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.250
and I was just high enough that I noticed like, wow,

20
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.250
that's not Peggy talking two different languages.

21
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.170
And then three, cuz she would like put her hand on the phone and say,

22
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:16.810
oh my mom said no, no, no. So English, French Kalan.

23
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.770
It's not Peggy speaking three languages.

24
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:22.600
Those are three different Peggys she's different.

25
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.680
Her facial ticks and her movements and her body position changed depending

26
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:29.560
on the language she was speaking. Right.

27
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.920
And at the time I was in grad school and um,

28
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.960
I thought this is like multiple personality disorder.

29
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.360
So I started researching multiple personality and I,

30
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.990
I sort of came up with this idea,

31
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.270
that language in her case because she learned them all when she was very young

32
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.510
reconfigures the brain in such a way that she actually has different identities

33
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.470
in those languages. Ooh. And next time we were,

34
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.910
I started talking to her in Spanish and she freaked out. She got mad at you.

35
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.620
Yes. She like, like I was, I was a stranger suddenly. Whoa. Yeah.

36
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.020
I just said, I, you know, I just said like you're beautiful or something.

37
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:13.980
She's like, ah, get away. Wow. GU Eddie's muwa I like get away from me.

38
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.980
You creep like, cause our whole relationship had been in English. Yeah.

39
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.460
Yeah. It was strange. So anyway, so I looked into multiple personality disorder,

40
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.810
the story, everything. Uh, and I dunno if you you've checked that out.

41
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.450
You remember Stanley crippner my buddy who came down and did the podcast with

42
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.890
you? Yeah, he, he had done a bunch of research on that and um,

43
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.090
there was a movie called sybel. Yeah,

44
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.450
I remember that he was the consultant for that movie. Oh,

45
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.520
he was also a consultant for, uh, Rosemary's bay. Remember that? The,

46
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.240
the possession. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, um, that's a Polansky movie.

47
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.000
I think so. Yeah. Yeah. One of the early ones. Yeah. Um,

48
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.880
people have with multiple personality disorder, uh,

49
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.640
the research is bizarre. It,

50
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.840
it seems to indicate that people have different physiological states in the

51
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.600
different personalities. So you could have a different baseline,

52
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.400
heart rate, blood pressure, uh, you know, these sort of different.

53
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.080
<v 2>Baseline heart.</v>

54
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.440
<v 1>Rate. Yeah. In the different even it's now this is dis I,</v>

55
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.190
I don't know how reliable this is,

56
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.190
but I even read that some people have different, uh, ocular pressure.

57
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.430
So that one personality needs reading glasses and another doesn't what,

58
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.410
yeah.

59
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.230
<v 2>Oh my God. How much is psychosomatic? Like really? Like how, how much,</v>

60
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.670
how much of who you are and how you,

61
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.700
how your body work is dependent upon the way your brain is,

62
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.980
uh, catching things. Right?

63
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.140
<v 1>Culture, language. Yeah. Personal experience. I mean,</v>

64
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.900
is it all your mood? How much you slept the night before, you know,

65
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.780
all these things, uh,

66
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.700
Ty into identity is something we take for granted, but it's,

67
00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:02.370
if you start to look at, at it, it's like, it's like gravity, you know, gravity,

68
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.050
we sort of included in our calculations,

69
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.530
but nobody has any idea what's happening. Right. How does that work?

70
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.370
Like ohtractive.

71
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.490
<v 2>Got real touchy about it. Oh really? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. When I brought it up, he,</v>

72
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.643
I think he's,

73
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.490
we had a weird conversation and I think part of the weird conversation,

74
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.360
it was the first conversation that he he's had publicly,

75
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:24.200
since he's been accused of, you know, right. The, the,

76
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:27.240
but he came back from that sexual misconduct. Yeah. Well he was, you know,

77
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:31.160
they found him innocent according to whatever internal right. Um,

78
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.880
investigation they had, you know, when they were doing his television show.

79
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.560
Right. The, you know, planetar but um, it's still,

80
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.590
even if F even if he's proven innocent, you've, you know,

81
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:47.950
you've got the weight of who knows how many people that think you're a creep

82
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.070
now. Right. You know,

83
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.830
and he's carrying that around because he was always thought of as being this

84
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.230
jovial really sweet, nice guy. So he's a little tense anyway. That's.

85
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.230
<v 1>Why I start out admitting I'm a creep &lt;laugh&gt; it's good. Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

86
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.670
I am a creep. You.

87
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.460
<v 2>Can't just take it from there machine &lt;laugh&gt; exactly.</v>

88
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.300
You cannot shame Charlie sheen. Um,

89
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.580
but we had this conversation about gravity and it was weird. It, it was like,

90
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.780
I was arguing with him, but I wasn't arguing. It was like, I was like, what,

91
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.260
what is caus you like, like what causes it? And he's like, we know,

92
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.500
like he went into this whole thing. We know what it is. We know how to,

93
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.370
to measure it. We can that's good enough for me. Yeah. It was,

94
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.730
it was a very tense conversation. Well, that's.

95
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.130
<v 1>Interesting. Yeah, it was. Cause it is a faith-based thing there, you know,</v>

96
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.090
like he he's right. They know how to measure it.

97
00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:35.010
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but we also know how to measure placebo. Right.

98
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.450
And we don't know how the that works.

99
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.490
We know that hypnosis people can have open heart surgery under hypnosis or have

100
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.840
limbs amp or all sorts of amazing things with no anesthesia whatsoever.

101
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.840
Has that really been done? Oh yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Have.

102
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.673
<v 2>You ever been hized.</v>

103
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.600
<v 1>Yeah, but I, I don't have high hypnotic ability. Mm. That differs.</v>

104
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.070
Uh,

105
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.120
it's another thing that differs among people and Stanley actually has a really

106
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.160
interesting theory, uh, along those lines, which is that in, uh,

107
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.680
prehistoric populations, hypnotic ability would be, um,

108
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.240
uh, adaptive because a lot of the healing rituals were

109
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.150
keying into placebo response. Uh, so if we have a certain ritual,

110
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.390
if you're susceptible to, you know, you believe in that like voodoo, uh,

111
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.550
there's a, you know,

112
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.470
voodoo death people die when they a spell is cast or a Curtis believe. Yeah.

113
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.630
Cause they believe it. If you don't believe it, it doesn't happen.

114
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.710
So it happens, uh, the opposite direction as well with healing. So his,

115
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.620
his idea is that that would've been of a very adaptive, um,

116
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.940
characteristic in prehistoric societies. Whereas in contemporary societies,

117
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.340
it's mal adaptive because you're more susceptible to advertising or you're

118
00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:53.220
easier to manipulate. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. So I, uh, yeah, I've,

119
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.300
I've uh, when I was in grad school,

120
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.050
I had some professors who worked with hypn this, and I studied it a bit,

121
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.490
uh, along the same,

122
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.810
around the same time I was looking at multiple personality disorder,

123
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.410
cuz I was real interested in this question of how the brain and the body

124
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.170
interact. How much of, you know,

125
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:15.890
there's all this research showing that people with the same, um, condition in,

126
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.920
in hospitals exactly the same age, same prognosis and all that,

127
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.880
they heal significantly faster if their hospital window looks out on trees

128
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.000
as opposed to looks out at another building. Mm. That,

129
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:32.960
something like that makes sense. Just looking at something like nature. Yeah.

130
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.800
Keys the body in to S to some sort of energy that,

131
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.480
that helps it to heal completely.

132
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.470
<v 2>Makes sense. I've met people with multiple personalities. Well,</v>

133
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:46.390
Roseanne Roseanne's got mul doesn't she make sure that's true. Um, I,

134
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.590
I know another one. That's a weird one is the football player. Hersche Walker.

135
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.830
I think he had traumainduced multiple personality disorders. Wow. Does she?

136
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.590
<v 0>There's the articles that says like bill, bill ma reminds us. She does.</v>

137
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.950
And then Roseanne says she doesn't so.

138
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.740
<v 2>Yeah, I think.</v>

139
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.660
<v 0>And then the does two does one says seven,</v>

140
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:06.300
having seven personalities is tough her saying it. So.

141
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.380
<v 2>Yeah. Well here's the thing about Roseanne? I mean,</v>

142
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.900
I'm saying this for the 10th time,

143
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.020
I guess she was hit by a car when she was 15 and she was put in a mental

144
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:18.380
Institute for nine months afterwards.

145
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.970
She had severe brain of damage and she lost her ability to do mathematics and

146
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.450
like really scrambled her brain.

147
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.730
And that is probably the birth of the Roseanne that we know the comedian. And,

148
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.730
um, that's also the case that Sam Kenon, Sam Kenison was also, uh,

149
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:37.170
like a pretty normal kid. And then he was hit by a car and, you know,

150
00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:39.730
pretty severe brain damage as well. And, um,

151
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.040
brain damage for especially, um, apparently

152
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.520
as a, especially has an impact on, um, your ability to be, uh,

153
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.520
rational and impulsive behavior. Like people with brain damage.

154
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.360
A lot of times get very impulsive. Yeah. It's a bit very so widely. Yeah.

155
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.880
You know, it's um, what,

156
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:04.000
what happens to you dependent upon like what kind of trauma,

157
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.600
where the trauma is and what part of your brain, but um, yeah. When,

158
00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:09.680
when they said it about Hersche Walker, I was always confused.

159
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.960
I wonder if it was from football,

160
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.510
like football trauma or was it personal trauma? Like, you know, abuse.

161
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.190
<v 1>Yeah. People with are diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.</v>

162
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.470
If I remember correctly,

163
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:26.030
almost always were severely abused as kids mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know,

164
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.150
and in fact the, the rationale is that they develop the,

165
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.980
uh, alternate personalities as a way of escaping a reality it's intolerable.

166
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.050
Makes sense.

167
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.140
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, people do weird things with horrible memories,</v>

168
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.941
you know,

169
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:45.100
they bury them to the point where they don't even really have access to them

170
00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:47.460
anymore. Yeah. With sexual abuse and some,

171
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.580
some traumatic events when you're young. Yeah. Who but the human brain,

172
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.740
then the way it adapts and molds to things is so bizarre.

173
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.890
<v 1>Yeah. There's a, there's an anecdote that is in this book, civilized to death.</v>

174
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.090
Notice that EG. Ooh, good segue to the book. Um, pull that over here. Yeah.

175
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.530
It's uh, by the way, the,

176
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.330
the art is done by a guy who listens to my podcast it' oh, really?

177
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.490
<v 2>It looks like, but the art by a guy looks podcast, &lt;laugh&gt; cheeseburger,</v>

178
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.120
a cheer wearing a cheeseburger with a nice suit on.

179
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.800
<v 1>Yeah. It's got an iPhone. Um, uh, oh yeah. The story.</v>

180
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.880
So there's a species of grasshopper in

181
00:10:27.881 --> 00:10:31.720
north Africa that, uh, you know,

182
00:10:31.721 --> 00:10:34.960
they hang out they're grasshoppers. They they're dispersed, they eat grass.

183
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.750
They're chill, right? Rains come the grasslands,

184
00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:41.110
expand grasshopper population increases.

185
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.510
Then the rain stop the grasslands contract to the point where the PO the

186
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.870
density of the grasshoppers triggers, uh,

187
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.830
dormant genes. So there's an epigenetic, uh,

188
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.990
event in these grasshoppers and they start to,

189
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.620
to transform and not over generations, individuals,

190
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.620
front legs get shorter back legs, get longer. Thorax changes,

191
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:06.820
shape of the head changes, coloring changes,

192
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.700
and behavior changes from being these chilled out, solitary,

193
00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:13.500
relaxed grasshoppers. They start attacking each other.

194
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:18.210
They become cannibalistic. Whoa. And they swarm locus.

195
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.130
Exactly. They become locus. Yeah.

196
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.690
So this species of grasshopper and locus is the same species. Yeah.

197
00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:30.170
It's the same DNA. It's just responding to different conditions. So,

198
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.971
you know,

199
00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:34.010
we were talking about the brain and you know who you are and what identity is

200
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:38.360
and all that. And this, I was reminded of this when you said, uh, you know,

201
00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:41.280
people are so different and the H two oh thing. Yeah.

202
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:44.160
We're not only different as individuals in the same context,

203
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.440
we change completely given the context we're in. Yeah.

204
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.160
So the focus of this book is that hunter gatherers were essentially a different

205
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.360
sort of animal. They were essentially, you know, uh,

206
00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:58.880
the parallel is with the grasshoppers and now we're swarming. Yeah.

207
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.600
Now we're a different kind of animal, even though our DNA's the same. Well.

208
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.760
<v 2>That completely makes sense. I mean,</v>

209
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.880
people that live in small towns are so different than people that live in

210
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:07.670
cities. Yeah.

211
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.960
It's so rare that you find someone who has a small town sensibility in

212
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.710
Manhattan. Yeah. Chewed up. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; right. Literally. Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:12:15.711 --> 00:12:16.190
Literally.
