WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Who was a veteran as well. Mm. Um,</v>

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.280
that's one thing that you have over them for sure.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.360
Is that you understand from firsthand experience and sacrifice what it

4
00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:16.360
means to actually be in war and to be in combat. Yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.320
<v 1>I mean, over, I, I still serve in the army national guard now over over 16,</v>

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.510
I've deployed twice to the middle east. And, uh, coupled with my experience in,

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.190
in Congress serving over six years on the foreign affairs and the armed services

8
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:31.671
committees,

9
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:36.350
working intimately on these issues related to national security and our foreign

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.830
policy meeting with leaders of different countries in the world, it,

11
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.260
these experiences and the understanding that I've gained from them that

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.180
best equip me to walk in the door, walk into the oval office on day one,

13
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:53.620
ready to do the job of president. And most importantly, commander in chief.

14
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.260
<v 0>What hurdles are you encountering that you didn't expect?</v>

15
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.370
<v 1>Uh, you know, a lot of what's happening are things that, that,</v>

16
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:09.570
that we kind of did expect, you know, the, the smear campaigns, mm-hmm,

17
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.850
&lt;affirmative&gt; the, the misinformation campaigns. Um, do you think that's.

18
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.610
<v 0>That someone's doing this on purpose,</v>

19
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.290
or do you think this is team mentality in action,

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.930
where people are supporting a particular candidate and they look at you as being

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.320
competition and that candidate, like, what do you think is happen?

22
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.760
<v 1>I think it's probably a combination. Um, you know, I'm,</v>

23
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.840
I'm challenging the establishment challenging the status quo,

24
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.560
challenging the foreign policy establishment, uh,

25
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.480
and challenging the political establishment in calling things,

26
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.480
as I see them calling it straight and, and speaking the truth,

27
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.590
whether that be calling out leaders within my own party or leaders of the other

28
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.830
political party. And, um, you know,

29
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:54.790
I think that that strikes fear in a lot of people who are uncomfortable with

30
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:59.550
it at a minimum and who are concerned because when, you know,

31
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.910
we, the people rise up and say, Hey, what's really going on here.

32
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.020
We're calling out self-serving politicians in Washington from both political

33
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:12.260
parties who are putting their own political interests or the interests of their

34
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:16.060
party ahead of the interest of the people, or they're putting the interests of,

35
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.180
you know,

36
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.420
whatever greedy corporation in their lobbyists is writing the biggest checks to

37
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.140
their campaigns ahead of the interests of the people.

38
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.490
So the more this awareness comes out,

39
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.530
the more people stand up and speak out and say, Hey, this is unacceptable.

40
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.970
This is unacceptable.

41
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:35.890
Then it's threatening that very power base that they, um,

42
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.290
have, have thrived and, and lived off of for far too long. We.

43
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.770
<v 0>Should talk about how you're funded too.</v>

44
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.730
Just so people understand your position. Yeah.

45
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.040
<v 1>So people powered can campaign 100, we take hundred percent,</v>

46
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.160
no NOPAC contributions, no lobbyist contributions.

47
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.800
Every single dollar that comes to my campaign for president is coming from

48
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.480
individual people across this country,

49
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.000
whether it's a dollar or a thousand dollars people who are giving whatever they

50
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.280
can, uh, in joining this movement.

51
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.160
<v 0>There's a great joke. I, I think it's from Dennis Miller.</v>

52
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.440
I hope I'm not misquoting it, but it's,

53
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.600
he was talking about how politicians wear patches in their jackets,

54
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.800
like NASCAR drivers seriously. &lt;laugh&gt; that is like,

55
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.040
you should have to know seriously. Yeah. So.

56
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.790
<v 1>What you have those disclaimers there?</v>

57
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.510
<v 0>I, what if I put my tenfoil hat on,</v>

58
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.750
when I talk about these interventionalist foreign policy wars and,

59
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.190
and regime change wars, the,

60
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.390
the tenfoil hat thinks military industrial complex. Yeah.

61
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.190
People being asked or forced into making decisions that

62
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:40.780
benefit these giant corporations that makes make weapons and profit off of war.

63
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:45.220
Yeah. This is the worst case scenario in, in terms of conspiracy theories,

64
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.300
the idea that someone wants war so that they can make money and they don't care

65
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:53.780
if people die even needlessly, this is our number one conspiracy fear. Right?

66
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:54.614
If you had to think about,

67
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.580
of all the things that you hope are not true about the way the world works.

68
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.090
Yeah. That would probably be an number one.

69
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.851
<v 1>Well,</v>

70
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.570
you can take your 10 foil hat off because the military industrial

71
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.530
complex is a real thing. This is something that, um,

72
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.690
president Eisenhower talked about.

73
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.010
<v 0>Which is an amazing speech, amazing speech.</v>

74
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.930
<v 1>His, his last speech. Yeah.</v>

75
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.850
As president of the United States of all the things that he could talk about,

76
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.160
he chose to focus on the military industrial complex and how D should do that.

77
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.280
<v 0>Right now. It is. I feel like we should play that. Yes.</v>

78
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.760
Just cause it's absolutely it's play that clip. It's so crazy.

79
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.560
And most people have never heard it before.

80
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.120
And you hear about the term military industrial complex.

81
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.760
And one thing that has been done,

82
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:39.760
that's really interesting is the word conspiracy has become a dirty word.

83
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:44.030
Yeah. And that dirty word or a, a word that's it it's,

84
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:47.830
it's easy to make something silly by calling it a conspiracy. Yeah.

85
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.110
Even though there are times where people conspire to do things that's right.

86
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.390
I mean, that's why that word exists. Right? I mean,

87
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:58.670
it's not like people don't make plans to do things that are illegal. Yeah.

88
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.910
Of course they do. That's why the FBI's around and yeah,

89
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.780
but this is from the national archives and this was Eisenhower's speech.

90
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.460
As he was leaving office, I.

91
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.340
<v 2>You with a message of leave taking and.</v>

92
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.380
<v 0>Farewell 1961, police did not get very much attention when a new press, oh,</v>

93
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:16.700
who was this guy? Jamie, you picked up the wrong version, son of a.

94
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.500
I'm sure there's a, an actual version of it. Yeah. Here we go. Chill. Uh,

95
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.610
January 17th, 1961. Back when everything was black and white.

96
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.730
<v 2>The president of the United States. Good evening. My fellow Americans,</v>

97
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.530
we now stand 10 years past a midpoint of a century that has witnessed four

98
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:37.690
major wars among great nations.

99
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.920
<v 0>This is a bad one, too. Jay, we son have a while.</v>

100
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.800
<v 1>He's looking for the right clip. What people, I think.</v>

101
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.800
<v 0>He's just gonna play music in the background. That's all it's gonna do. What.</v>

102
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.680
<v 1>Most people don't know is that his,</v>

103
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.080
his first draft of that speech said congressional military

104
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.200
industrial complex, whoa.

105
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.160
And somewhere between the draft and the speech that was delivered,

106
00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:05.640
he took out that word congressional,

107
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.560
but he was directly connecting those dots. Whoa. That some may say,

108
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.400
oh, well, that's just a conspiracy theory.

109
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.270
But he was connecting those dots with the influence that the military industrial

110
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.110
complex has on leaders in Congress who are making decisions about how our money

111
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.030
is spent and where our troops are sent off into battle congressional.

112
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.590
<v 0>Congressional, military industrial complex. Wow. I need extra foil.</v>

113
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.063
&lt;laugh&gt;.

114
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.270
<v 1>Gets you a new box, fine.</v>

115
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.340
<v 0>Speech. It's crazy how they couldn't keep the camera steady back then either.</v>

116
00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:40.060
I're still gonna do it either. &lt;laugh&gt; thanks.

117
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:41.900
Someone else's voice might be here. It.

118
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.820
<v 2>Goes good evening. My fellow America, just skip ahead. A.</v>

119
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.700
<v 0>Couple seconds here. A.</v>

120
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.980
<v 2>Vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment.</v>

121
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.580
Our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no

122
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.090
potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his destruction.

123
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.970
Our military organization today bears little relation to that known

124
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.370
of any of my predecessors in peace time or indeed by the fighting men of world

125
00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:11.090
war II or Korea

126
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.050
until the latest of our world conflicts.

127
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.560
The United States had no armaments industry.

128
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.840
American makers of plow airs could with time and as required,

129
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.360
make swords as well,

130
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.160
but we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.

131
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.840
We have been compelled to create a permanent arminance industry of vast

132
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.910
proportions added to this three and a half million men and women

133
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.550
are directly engaged in the defense establishment.

134
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.590
We annually spend on military security alone more than the net

135
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.110
income of all United States corporation corporations.

136
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.780
Now this conjunction of a immense military establishment and a large arms

137
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.100
industry is new in the American experience.

138
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.780
The total influence economic political,

139
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.540
even spiritual is felt in every city, every state house,

140
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.420
every office of the federal government.

141
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.650
We recognize the imperative need for this development.

142
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.770
Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.

143
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.290
Our toil resources and livelihood are all involved.

144
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:36.010
So is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government.

145
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.000
We must car guard against the acquisition of warranted influence,

146
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.680
whether sought or unsaught by the military industrial complex,

147
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.760
the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will

148
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:56.480
persist. We must never let the weight of this combination in danger,

149
00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.080
our liberties or democratic processes. Okay. We should take nothing for grant.

150
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.740
We.

151
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.040
<v 0>You, you could listen to the rest of the speech if you want to online,</v>

152
00:09:04.041 --> 00:09:08.200
but it's very chilling. Yes. Cuz this is the sitting president leaving office.

153
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.040
And this is what he wants to tell people and.

154
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.000
<v 1>A soldier. Yes. He's the guy who had military experience.</v>

155
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.470
He's a guy who saw first hand wearing the uniform and then serving as

156
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:21.430
commander in chief. And this was his final warning to the nation.

157
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.470
<v 0>The military companies are like most companies,</v>

158
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.590
they always want to grow. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; companies seek infinite growth.

159
00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:32.190
They, they constantly seek better quarters every year.

160
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.510
They wanna make more money than they did last year. That's what they're doing.

161
00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:36.140
They're they're in the business of making money.

162
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:39.020
They're not just in the business of creating things.

163
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.460
They they're creating things for a profit that's right.

164
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.700
And they're gonna have a little wiggle room. And especially with politicians,

165
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.780
with politicians that are in their pocket and they've spent millions of dollars

166
00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:52.660
helping them along the way. Yeah. And you know, they're gonna,

167
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:53.980
they're gonna help each other. Yeah.

168
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.050
And this long in history of helping each other. That's right.

169
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.930
<v 1>That's um, I mean, you, you,</v>

170
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.410
you see that very directly through contributions that are being made,

171
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.290
uh, to politicians by different defense contractors and the corresponding

172
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.330
votes that are then taken. Uh,

173
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:17.280
but you also see this corruption that's happen before our very eyes,

174
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.160
uh, happening within places like the Pentagon,

175
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.480
where you either have people in uniform or civilians who are working in

176
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.400
contracting, for example, in the Pentagon,

177
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.000
laying the groundwork for writing up these contracts major multi-billion dollar

178
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:36.480
concontracts with these big defense contractors and then the

179
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:37.950
lay down the uniform,

180
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.510
or you retire from service either as a civilian or in the military.

181
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.630
And then you turn around, leave that door and walk into another door,

182
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:49.070
working for the very same contractor that you just wrote the contract for.

183
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.430
Yeah, this is happening. This is what, this is what we need to change.

184
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.260
And we're talking about both campaign finance reform,

185
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.340
but also reforming this kind of corruption and this revolving door that's

186
00:11:03.341 --> 00:11:04.940
happening in different parts of our government.

187
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:07.940
You see it happening in wall street too. Yes. The S E C regulators,

188
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:11.180
people are supposed to be regulating wall street are coming from wall street and

189
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:14.500
then going back to wall street to work for the very same companies that they

190
00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:17.850
were supposedly just charged to late.

191
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.810
This is a big problem that we've gotta fix.

192
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.530
<v 0>Yeah. There's a fantastic documentary on that, uh, called inside job. Yeah.</v>

193
00:11:23.531 --> 00:11:25.570
I dunno. If do you see it? Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. You,

194
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:30.450
you see when he's confronting these guys who are professors who then go and

195
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:34.490
take these jobs and make millions of dollars with the very regulations that they

196
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:35.850
help put into place. That's right.

197
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.760
<v 1>And it's happening with foreign policy as well. When you look at who,</v>

198
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.480
who are the main people who go and testify in front of Congress, uh,

199
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:46.400
coming from think tanks very well known think tanks, uh,

200
00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:49.760
global think tanks that specialize in foreign policy. Uh,

201
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.160
they don't have a placard on,

202
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.280
on their desk when they're testifying before congressing we receive funding from

203
00:11:56.281 --> 00:11:59.440
Saudi Arabia, from Q mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; from the United Arab Emirates,

204
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:04.040
from all these different countries who are spending a lot of money funding,

205
00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:07.240
these thinktakes that then come forward and, uh,

206
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.200
push policies or push ideas to leaders in Congress that

207
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.950
not coincidentally benefit the countries that are funding them.

208
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.933
<v 0>What,</v>

209
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.910
what could be done to stop that other than someone like you getting

210
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.190
into power? Well, and what could you do once you get in there?

211
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.910
<v 1>I think, I think two, two things. I mean, obviously as,</v>

212
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.510
as president and commander in chief,

213
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:34.300
you set the tone for the kind of leadership ship that we have in this country

214
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.740
that will put service above self. And th this is what,

215
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.100
what I will bring as present,

216
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.860
bring those soldiers values of putting service above self,

217
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:46.900
putting service to the American people in your country.

218
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.260
First and foremost ahead of everything else ahead of the interest of a political

219
00:12:51.261 --> 00:12:53.020
party or a corporation or,

220
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.770
or a foreign country for that matter and work to pass legislation in Congress

221
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.250
that would close these revolving doors that would require this,

222
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.170
uh, transparency. When you're talking about who is funding,

223
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.250
who and where is this money coming from?

224
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.050
I think members of Congress should not be taking pat contributions should be

225
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.880
relying solely on contributions from people in this country so that they know

226
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.120
exactly who is funding their campaigns.

227
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.280
<v 0>That really seems like a nobrainer. Yeah. That one seems like a no brainer.</v>

228
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.000
If you really want, and'mething what the people want.

229
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.880
<v 1>It's something that that's starting to happen organically.</v>

230
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:28.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as more and more people, uh,

231
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.600
are calling for this kind of reform and saying, Hey, look, if you want my vote,

232
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.990
then I expect you to not accept those contributions and to run a people

233
00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:38.110
powered campaign.

234
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.910
<v 0>How many people are doing that besides you?</v>

235
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.950
<v 1>Uh, there's a couple who are running for president.</v>

236
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.430
There is a slowly growing number of people who have run for and got,

237
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:52.030
gotten elected to Congress. Uh, but look, it's, it's, uh,

238
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:54.270
it's in the margins compared to where we need to be.

239
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:04.380
<v 3>So.</v>
