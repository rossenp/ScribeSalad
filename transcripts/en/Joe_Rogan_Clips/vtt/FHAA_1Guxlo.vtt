00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.040
Here's the thing that I've always wanted to ask someone like you,

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.320
what do you think was happening before the big bang? Yeah.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.160
<v 1>It's a, it's a, it's a deep question. And a, and a, and a subtle one.</v>

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.280
And there's sort of two ways that I like to think about that question.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.150
One is it could be that, uh, the big bang was an interesting event,

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.670
but not the first event in the totality of reality.

8
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.870
It could have been the first event that sparked the expansion of our part of

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.713
space,

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.150
but it could be that there's a grander realm of space within which we sit as a

11
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:40.950
small part. And that grander realm may have been here for,

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.740
or a far longer period of time. It may have experienced its own big bangs,

13
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:50.460
maybe a collection of big bangs that may extend infinitely far into the past.

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.100
So it could be that the answer to the question of what happened before the big

15
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:58.740
bang is a lot of other big bangs or a lot of other quantum events that were

16
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:02.730
taking place in a larger landscape of reality than we have direct access to.

17
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.811
However,

18
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:08.530
another answer is that the very question may not make as much sense

19
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.530
as the words seem to suggest. We know how to parse that sentence.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.410
We know what it means to talk about the moment before the big bang,

21
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:18.890
because we know how to talk about the moment before your birth or the moment

22
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.280
before the civil war or the moment before any event that happened the world.

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.520
We fully understand the meaning of that kind of sentence,

24
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.000
but it could be that when it comes to the big bang,

25
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.840
the sentence actually doesn't mean anything.

26
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.520
It could be that the big bang was the place where time itself started

27
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.840
and, uh, honking himself, had a wonderful analogy to get this across. He said,

28
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.600
look, I'll dress it up a little bit.

29
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.150
Imagine you're walking on planet earth and you pass by some and you say, Hey,

30
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.430
can you point me in the direction of north?

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.750
I wanna walk in the northward direction. They point you continue to walk.

32
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.190
You pass by somebody else say, Hey, which way is further north.

33
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:54.830
And they point you in that direction.

34
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.510
But when you get to the north pole and talk to somebody there and say, Hey,

35
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.830
how do I go further north? They look at you and say, whoa,

36
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.860
that question doesn't mean anything, because this is where north begins.

37
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.100
There's no notion of going further north than the north pole.

38
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.060
And it could be that that spacial metaphor applies to time.

39
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.460
Talk about a billion years ago, 10 billion years ago.

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.940
But if you go to 13.8 billion years ago,

41
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.050
the big bang that may be where time started and you can't go further back in

42
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:28.330
time than the very origin of time itself.

43
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.650
<v 0>That freaks me out. Yeah. See that that's one that,</v>

44
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.810
that it gets in your head and you, what do you mean beginning of time? Yeah.

45
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.770
Why would time have a beginning?

46
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.970
<v 1>Good. And it could be,</v>

47
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.360
it could be that time is an emergent quality of

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.080
reality. I give you an analogy. Boy,

49
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:51.040
what I mean by that is we all know what temperature means.

50
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:53.920
Intuitively something's hot. You feel it something's cold. You feel it,

51
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:56.040
your body understands those concepts.

52
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.560
What physics has done is it's gone deeper into the concept of temperature and

53
00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:05.520
revealed that it is nothing but the average motion of the particles

54
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:09.080
making up the environment. So if the molecules are moving really quickly,

55
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.600
you've got a hot environment. If the molecules are really moving slowly,

56
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.240
it's a cold environment.

57
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.750
So temperature emerges from the motion of particles.

58
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.350
So if you have like one particle,

59
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.310
you can't really talk about it being hot or cold, cuz you need a conglomerate.

60
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.750
You need aglomeration of particles to be able to talk about their average

61
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.150
motion. And in that sense,

62
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.870
temperature is this emergent idea that rest upon more fundamental ideas,

63
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.540
the molecules and atoms that make up reality, maybe that's true of time.

64
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.863
Maybe time.

65
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.780
As we know it is a property that only makes sense in certain environments when

66
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:50.660
there's enough stuff arranged in the right patterns. But fundamentally,

67
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.260
maybe there are atoms or molecules of time,

68
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.220
which when not arranged in the form that we are familiar with,

69
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.130
don't yield time. As we know it,

70
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.370
time itself may be a quality of the world that exists here in this environment,

71
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.170
but doesn't even apply in other environments that are configured

72
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.530
radically differently. Whoa.

73
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.850
<v 0>That's a heavy one. Yeah. That's a heavy one. We,</v>

74
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.040
what also is a heavy one is what caused the big bang. Yeah.

75
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.080
Like why would something smaller than the head of a pin? Yeah.

76
00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:27.200
Become everything that we see in the cosmos. Yeah.

77
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.160
<v 1>So there are ideas for the answer to that question. Look,</v>

78
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.440
all of this is tentative, right?

79
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:36.120
Because it's very hard to do measurements that go all the way back to the

80
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:36.580
beginning.

81
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.150
We have astronomical observations that we need to be sure are

82
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:43.550
compatible with the predictions of our theories and so forth. So,

83
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.190
so we as good scientists do what needs to be done to try to test these ideas.

84
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.470
But the idea that I think most physicists or cosmologists buy into at the moment

85
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.390
is that gravity can have two manifestations.

86
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.910
The usual form of gravity that you and I know about is the attractive.

87
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.060
You drop something toward the earth.

88
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:06.780
And it moves downward because the earth and the object pull on each other.

89
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:09.420
That's the ordinary gravity that we experience every day of our lives.

90
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.660
But Einstein's equations actually allow gravity to also be repulsive.

91
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.900
It can push outward as opposed to just pulling inward.

92
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.450
And this is something that we have never benced because the gravity created by a

93
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:28.730
Rocky object. Like the earth is always the attractive variety.

94
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.370
The gravity created by the sun. Again,

95
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.730
a compact object is always the attractive variety,

96
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.770
but Einstein's math shows that if you don't have a, a Rocky object,

97
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.130
that's isolated in space,

98
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:45.040
but rather energy at its uniformly spread through a region of space

99
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.880
that, that kind of entity yields repulsive gravity.

100
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.240
Why is that important to your question? If the very early universe,

101
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:57.440
that little tiny head of a pin that you're talking about,

102
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.200
if it was filled with a uniform bath of this energy,

103
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.040
we call it the inleton field. The name doesn't matter,

104
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.720
but if it was filled with that energy,

105
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.440
it would've been subject to repulsive gravity. What does repulsive gravity do?

106
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.400
Pushes everything apart, causes everything to rush outward.

107
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.910
So the bang of the big bang may have been a spark of repulsive

108
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:25.430
gravity operating with a tiny region of space that pushed everything apart.

109
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.510
<v 0>And this concept of repulsive gravity is just theoretical.</v>

110
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.190
We observed any sort of element in the universe that.

111
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.710
<v 1>It, it is theoretical,</v>

112
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.940
but it's at a level of understanding that I think most

113
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:44.060
physicists would say causes it to migrate into the camp of

114
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.980
established understanding of how gravity works. So number one,

115
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.180
Einstein's equations have now been tested over and over again in a whole variety

116
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.940
of circumstances. The detection of gravitational waves,

117
00:06:56.941 --> 00:06:58.930
just a couple of the years ago, it was like the,

118
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.890
the crowning triumph of Einstein's math a hundred years ago,

119
00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:04.530
the math says there should be ripples in the fabric of space.

120
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.370
A hundred years later, we finally detect ripples in the fabric of space.

121
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.570
So we are very comfortable with any prediction that comes out of Einstein's

122
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:18.240
mathematics and right in the mathematics is the prediction of what I was just

123
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.560
described. And you've got uniform energy in a region, repulsive gravity.

124
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.160
The other thing is we currently witness that the expansion of the universe is

125
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:31.200
speeding up, not slowing down since the 1920s.

126
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.520
Everybody thought that yes, the universe is expanding,

127
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:35.960
but it will slow down over time. Why?

128
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.750
Because gravity pulls things back together. You throw an apple upward.

129
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.510
It doesn't go up faster and faster.

130
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.030
It goes up slower and slower because the Earth's gravity pulls it back.

131
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.630
Everybody thought that would apply to the universe as a whole. It's expanding,

132
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:50.910
but expanding, ever slower.

133
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.030
The observations in 1998 culminated in 1998,

134
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.540
which when the 2011 Nobel prize showed that the distant galaxies are moving way

135
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.220
ever more quickly, the expansion of space is speeding up over time.

136
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.020
It's accelerating. How do we explain that?

137
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.660
The best explanation we currently have is repulsive gravity.

138
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.420
We believe even today, the universe is seuffuse with a bath of energy.

139
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.010
We call it dark energy. We believe it's uniformly going through space.

140
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.850
I like to think of it almost like a, as a Turkish sauna.

141
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.770
It's like the steam filling the sauna,

142
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.690
this energy filling space and that repulsive gravity we believe is responsible

143
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:34.610
for the observations that the distant galaxies are rushing way faster and faster

144
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:37.010
over time. So it's circumstantial,

145
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.280
but the case for repulsive gravity is quite strong.

146
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.280
<v 0>And what would have caused it to coal?</v>

147
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.240
What would've caused it to compress in initially. Yeah.

148
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:51.200
Like why would all that matter be in this tiny yeah.

149
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.520
Less than a pin size object. Yeah.

150
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.440
<v 1>So I have no idea and nobody else on planet earth has any real idea</v>

151
00:08:58.441 --> 00:08:59.920
other, but we do have theories.

152
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.160
And one of the theories suggests that in the very early universe,

153
00:09:04.161 --> 00:09:06.240
it was a highly chaotic environment,

154
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.080
very hot with all the fields fluctuating, wildly up and down.

155
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.440
And the idea would be that if you wait long enough, we're,

156
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.190
it's hard to know what weight means in this environment,

157
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.670
but don't press me on my definition of time.

158
00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:24.270
Back then just sort of intuitively if you wait long enough on rare

159
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.030
occasions, the energy will just happen to flatten out in a region,

160
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.470
become uniform.

161
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.870
And then that region explosiively inflates grows large.

162
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.780
So, you know, it's imagine you're looking at, um, a, a BA a,

163
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.620
a, a pot of boiling water. The surface is of course,

164
00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:48.740
widely undulating up and down. But if you wait long enough,

165
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.780
very long time, since you've never seen it in neither of I,

166
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.330
there will be a little patch on the surface of that boiling water that flattens

167
00:09:56.331 --> 00:10:01.330
out why that only means that the water molecules happen for an instant to be

168
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:06.290
moving in just the right way to keep that little patch of water from wildly

169
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:10.650
bubbling, it will happen. It's rare, but if you wait long enough, it will occur.

170
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.250
Similarly, the widely undulating feels in the early universe.

171
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.080
If you wait long enough, a patch will flatten out, you get the uniform energy,

172
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.040
plug it into Einstein's equations, that region explosiveively inflates.

173
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:25.120
And I mean, explosiively,

174
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.680
it can go from a size that's much less than an atomic diameter

175
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.240
to larger than the observable universe in far less than a blink of an

176
00:10:35.241 --> 00:10:38.270
eye intent to minus 30 10 to minus 35 seconds.

177
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.510
That's how powerful rebulsive gravity can be.

178
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.750
<v 0>That is so baffling. Yeah. So before that, before this happens,</v>

179
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.870
you just have, in this theory,

180
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.990
you just have all of this energy sort of randomly

181
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.540
interacting with other energy in the universe with no physical objects. Yep.

182
00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.800
<v 1>Yep. It's.</v>

183
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.500
<v 0>And that could have been.</v>

184
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.380
<v 1>Forever. That could, and, and in fact, that's the main point.</v>

185
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.420
There's nobody who was hanging around, looking at their watch saying, good God,

186
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.100
when is this big bang gonna finally happen? You know, so,

187
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.780
so you can have this, uh, cosmological pre-show,

188
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.890
you can have it last long as you, like.

189
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.290
The only thing that you need to happen is that sooner or later,

190
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.330
a region flattens out and then the cosmological show begins.

191
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.450
<v 0>And if we're looking at this model of the universe,</v>

192
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:33.530
being this infinite universees yep.

193
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.570
With different characteristics and different qualities to them,

194
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.800
this could be happen ING throughout infinity. Yeah. All over.

195
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.680
<v 1>The place. Yeah. And in fact, this so-called inflationary.</v>

196
00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:46.680
Cosmology is the technical name for the subject,

197
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.640
says that it says that it's quite likely that this explosive

198
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.240
inflation of the region that we currently inhabit,

199
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.240
it was just one of many such events.

200
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.240
And therefore there are other far flung regions throughout this larger

201
00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:07.360
cosmological landscape where things have also inflated,

202
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.000
but the details can be different.

203
00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:12.440
The physical details can differ from what we are familiar with. And,

204
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.270
and the differences can be small temperature differences in one part of space

205
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:20.590
versus another, or they can be far more significant. Even the,

206
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.790
the particles that make up that other realm may be different from the particles

207
00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:28.590
that make up our realm. Their masses can be different.

208
00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:29.830
Their charges can be different.

209
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.470
Their fundamental physical features can be different.

210
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.100
So out there in that wider cosmological landscape,

211
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.820
it can be the wild, wild west of realities. And they.

212
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.940
<v 2>Don't have to worry about proton.</v>

213
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.750
<v 1>Deterioration.</v>

214
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.420
There may be realms in which they don't have to worry about protons falling

215
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.700
apart. Um, uh, the wild,

216
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.090
the really crazy idea is that if you're very careful

217
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.490
mathematically and analyzing these theories,

218
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.890
you realize that there have to be realms out there that

219
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.010
duplicate ours as well, many can be different,

220
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.050
but there have to be versions of this reality that are also

221
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.970
instantiated occur out there in other realms. Yeah. So,

222
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.520
so you come to these crazy sounding,

223
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.640
sci-fi sounding ideas that you and I are having this conversation out there in

224
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:23.840
other distant realms, an infinite number of times,

225
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.080
perhaps infinite number of times,

226
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.160
and more over small differences can also arise in these other realms where maybe

227
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.190
our positions are interchanged at the table, or, you know, maybe you're in is a,

228
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.070
you know, Joe Green and I'm Brian Rogan,

229
00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:40.910
or there's like strange realities that can be taken place.

230
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.830
And this is not an overworked theorist imagination.

231
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.830
This is the careful dispassionate analysis of the mathematical equations.

232
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.710
Now I should say, there are some physicists who see this implication and say,

233
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:56.860
whoa, you guys have fallen off the deep end.

234
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:02.140
Your theory has imploded because any theory that predicts that

235
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:07.180
kind of a wealth of realities that are kind of untestable because they're

236
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.340
so far away that we will never interact with them.

237
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.100
That's the kind of theory that we have been trained to avoid to excise. Mm.

238
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.410
However, the more, you know, forward thinking,

239
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.010
I'd like to describe us physicists say, Hey, uh,

240
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.970
math has proven to be a very valuable guide over the course of hundreds of

241
00:14:25.971 --> 00:14:28.290
years. And if this is where the math is taking us,

242
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.850
it's at least worthy of our attention to investigate it fully and possibly come

243
00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:36.600
to the conclusion that this is how reality actually behaves Jesus.

244
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:46.840
<v 2>I.</v>
