00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 2>To me, it's all about body language and all about sort of, and this is why,</v>

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.740
you know, I'm so into horses and dog training and stuff like that.

4
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.574
And horse body, let's.

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.200
<v 0>Say some bears. And while you're out here, I.</v>

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.580
<v 1>Did Texas. I love Texas bears. I love you.</v>

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.710
<v 0>She's saving bears out here. She's mad at people. I'm like, whoa.</v>

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.750
<v 1>I love Texas. I love Texas. But when you, when you have Texas and West Virginia,</v>

9
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:27.990
but you're ready to fight anyone at any time. And there are a lot,

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.130
there's an incredible amount of, uh, uh,

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.790
animal cruelty in Texas that I, that to me is against what Texas is all about.

12
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:39.390
Like putting bears in boxes. What was it called? The central capital.

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.910
It was called the Capitol Texas zoo. It's right. out here.

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.480
There's bears in cages. The ones that, uh, the Chinese, uh,

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.160
used to do the gallbladders, take them, you know, like the gallbladder,

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.610
some medicine, and they're in these cages and there's no.

17
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.310
<v 0>Water. I mean, black bears. Is that what you're saying? I'll show you. It.</v>

18
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.320
<v 1>Must be a black bear. Yes. I got the name.</v>

19
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.830
<v 0>I know that gallbladder thing is like, it's so bad that they,</v>

20
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:05.550
you're not allowed to. Even if you legally hunt a bear, you can't open up.

21
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.330
It's uh,

22
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.210
it's Oregon cavity because people are worried that people are shooting bears

23
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.010
just for their gallbladders and bridge Columbia.

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.660
<v 1>The Asiatic black bear and this, uh,</v>

25
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.210
capital of Texas zoo,

26
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.620
which is trying to say it's like rescuing them is all about the Asiatic black

27
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.990
bears, a species whose population is rapidly decreasing,

28
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:26.700
due to illegal hunting for its gallbladder,

29
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:28.560
which is used in Asian folk medicine.

30
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.130
And then you're going to put it in a box and not give it any water that me off.

31
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:35.730
And it's a USDA violation. So I go around to these like, seeing.

32
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.400
<v 0>Cat, calling these people out publicly right now on this podcast.</v>

33
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.480
<v 1>I guess I just did. Didn't I, these mother, here's what you do.</v>

34
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.420
<v 0>This is a real problem for them. You understand that, right?</v>

35
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:47.040
You just like opened hell's door.

36
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.420
<v 1>It's a real problem for me because these have guns at all times. And it's,</v>

37
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.100
it is a really dangerous thing to, for me to be into memory.

38
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.590
I did it with the giraffe and those crooks and in LA and most of it,

39
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.270
I do privately. Yeah. Malibu.

40
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.500
<v 0>Out here. Like how did you find out about.</v>

41
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.800
<v 1>This?</v>

42
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.730
I found out about it because I'm in a pretty like hardcore group of people that

43
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:13.440
try to rescue people. They try to shut down, uh, illegal behaviors, zoos,

44
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:16.530
roadside zoos, because the, and I know it was like, when he's crazy,

45
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:18.930
she loves animals. Like it gives a to me.

46
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:23.340
Once I started learning the statistics on whenever there's exotic animal

47
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:25.890
trafficking, it's usually accompanied by human trafficking.

48
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.300
It's all the same people.

49
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.230
So when you see a lion running free and Houston or lion,

50
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.090
private ownership of lions, tigers bears, any apex predator, there's usually,

51
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.570
you know, teenagers from another country in the same truck. So it's like,

52
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.270
it's like dog fighting. It's like, people are like, oh, it's just dog fighting.

53
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.880
Who cares? That's that's, what's in the front yard.

54
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.860
But if you see that in the front yard,

55
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.140
go into the basement and see what else is going on.

56
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.410
So that's why that's what, um,

57
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.340
the top three most profitable black market businesses, right?

58
00:02:56.341 --> 00:03:00.370
It's arms drugs, and then humans animal trafficking.

59
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.930
So it's the same people, no one traffics Jaguars. And doesn't throw in a couple.

60
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.590
<v 0>You know, what's weird. Pause and think about this for a second. Okay.</v>

61
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.520
It's weird how we have, uh,

62
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.100
associations with animals where there's acceptable, torture and death,

63
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.150
and some where it's not. And with exotic animals,

64
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.010
we're especially sensitive,

65
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.290
especially sensitive to the idea of killing bears or putting bears in cages.

66
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.080
But if you found out the chickens are in the cage, right next door, you're like,

67
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.690
wow, that's a chicken factory. They're making, they're making McNuggets.

68
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.620
Oh you to do it.

69
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.370
<v 1>Okay. And they're delicious. Put some honey on that. I think I know.</v>

70
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.900
I think I can say why I, my, because when you see an apex predator,

71
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.380
Elian tiger or bear, that's so incredibly strong, you know,

72
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.740
how much abuse had to go into containing that animal?

73
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.650
Because they're so incredibly strong, you know, Michael Jackson,

74
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.650
I mean the in LA, Bob dot. I'm gonna say it.

75
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.510
Who puts chimpanzees and cages so that they don't build any muscle.

76
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.260
If you're seeing a chimpanzee, a lion tiger or bear in a cage, they were,

77
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.070
they had to, um, they gotta be on fentanyl. They're on all these drugs. Uh,

78
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.150
Natasha daily wrote a really amazing fentanyl. Oh yeah. The ones in Thailand.

79
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.440
Oh. They put them in cages like this so that they don't grow any muscle.

80
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.750
And any Chimp like Michael Jackson's chimps,

81
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.960
there were three of each because when they have the same name, when they,

82
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.790
well there's chubs. Yes. There was like a,

83
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.670
Chubb's want to Chubb's two and then a bubbles one and two,

84
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.940
because after a year you can't hold a chip in a tuxedo. It's going to rip your.

85
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.020
<v 0>Face off. Just.</v>

86
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.650
<v 1>Beat your. So after about a year, they send it off to experiments.</v>

87
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:36.340
There's one actually in a zoo in Armadillo, Texas, one of the chubs,

88
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.540
I know where all Michael Jackson's animals are like, that's, that's my hunting.

89
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.350
Yes.

90
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.360
<v 0>Yeah. There were all of Michael Jackson, like.</v>

91
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.090
<v 1>All of that. I mean, a lot of them were sold for experiments. Oh,</v>

92
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.900
elephants are kind of spread out. Yeah. One of them died for experiment.

93
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.020
The chimps work. Cause I mean,

94
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.070
Chimp experiments space out of CC quilt. Yeah.

95
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.150
But uh, yeah. I mean, it's a big, a lot of colleges and universities,

96
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:07.930
the ones that are waiting around for their student loans and imprisoning people

97
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.660
financially do a lot of experiments on college campuses.

98
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.780
So I don't do a lot of this publicly because I'll get murder.

99
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.710
<v 0>And you go from living in the castle, living in the Michael Jackson,</v>

100
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.410
Neverland castle to get an experiments done on you.

101
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.260
And you don't understand English. And you're like, what is happening?

102
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.690
I had the life. I had the life.

103
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.390
Now I'm strapped in and they're experimenting on me.

104
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.650
<v 1>I went from being by Michael Jackson to being probed, you know,</v>

105
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.240
in Texas, what the it was.

106
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.230
But chimps, you know, I mean, they get so strong.

107
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.750
They have to keep them in cages. So their muscles don't build.

108
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:46.750
They don't feed them any protein. And then they inject them with, you know,

109
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.400
I mean, uh, there's one, uh, university, which I'm not going to say right now.

110
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.070
Cause I'm like getting all my ducks in a row,

111
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.100
but they put Botox in their muscles so they don't develop any muscles.

112
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.560
Did I ever.

113
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.170
<v 0>Tell you about the time I went to a tiger place in Thailand?</v>

114
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.160
Did I tell you about this? I did. We did a bunch of animal things.

115
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.640
Me and my family in Thailand. We did one of them. That was really cool. We, uh,

116
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.980
we hung around with elephants and you fed them. And I,

117
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:13.040
I had it on my Instagram page. You give them sugarcane and you wash them.

118
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:15.740
And then if you're not riding 'em and no, you do ride them,

119
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.610
but they want you to ride them. They let you, you way, it was much.

120
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.440
It's one of those stupid hats with the cigarettes in it.

121
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.060
That's the away way to an elephant.

122
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.300
<v 1>Yeah. What they have to do to get them that compliant is pretty brutal.</v>

123
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.430
<v 0>You know, none in this place, this place, first of all,</v>

124
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.160
these animals are completely wide open and they're free ranging.

125
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.940
<v 1>Shelter. Trust does a great job too. If they raise them from being babies.</v>

126
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.631
<v 0>Do that.</v>

127
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:43.070
But they also take animals from circuses and re-introduce them to the wild.

128
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.530
Cause while you're walking with these elephants,

129
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.570
they just grab a tree and start eating it.

130
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.790
Like they can do whatever the they want. And they're,

131
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.820
they're so not intimidated by you in any way.

132
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And the relationship that the trainers had with the elephants was love.

133
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.070
It was all petting, giving them sugarcane. They gave them food and they,

134
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:03.590
and they were always washing them. And when you have this,

135
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.880
they did it very slowly.

136
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.220
<v 1>'Cause a lot of these elephants. If you reintroduce them to the wild,</v>

137
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.620
they'll die right away. And the, all the elephants will actually kill them.

138
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.150
<v 0>This place in Thailand, they have,</v>

139
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.820
they have successfully reintroduced many to the wild.

140
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:16.790
And one of the things that they did is you don't just ride the elephant.

141
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.960
You have a relationship with it. Yes, that's it. So you see, they,

142
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:21.200
they bring you over,

143
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.350
like this is the elephant that you're going to have a relationship with and

144
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:28.760
you're gonna feed him sugar cane and wash him. So I'm handing them sugar cane.

145
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.660
They take it gently with their trunks, their sweets.

146
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.330
<v 1>That's amazing. I don't w do you remember the name of this place?</v>

147
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.480
Cause I always love to promote the.

148
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.420
<v 0>Oh, we stayed in Chiang Mai and it was a hour maybe outside of that.</v>

149
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.140
Not, not that far away, but the way they did it was, it was all about like,

150
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:49.880
what you paid for for that experience would go towards funds to

151
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:53.600
help these animals and reintroduce him to the wild and also get them from

152
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:57.620
circuses and rescue them from some other places. I didn't like the writing part.

153
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.920
I would say my mom, but everybody else wanted to do it. But my thought was like,

154
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.340
I just, I like feed you in a WashU. I want to be your friend.

155
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.320
I don't think you get on top and be like, we am writing.

156
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.650
<v 1>That's a language elephants understand, you know? And,</v>

157
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.280
and I think that the really places, which is most of them give the good ones,

158
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:17.810
a bad name, which sucks. I went to one, I went to Costa Maui, uh,

159
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.530
and I don't remember in Thailand where I went to one and there's, uh, you know,

160
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.940
you go there and everyone's riding them.

161
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:26.420
And then you look down and there's just chains between their feet. And I just,

162
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.510
it killed it crushed me because I thought I was going to this amazing sanctuary

163
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.300
because anyone can put sanctuary in front of their thing.

164
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.580
But I think I've heard you talk so much about, um, you know, captivity of,

165
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.970
you know, dolphins and whales. It's just,

166
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:41.300
when you see that and when you're like, this is just intolerable,

167
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.770
like these animals are not designed to be in it's prison.

168
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.510
You're watching this incredible thing be in prison. And you know that this,

169
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.200
the second it gets out could kill everyone within a 50 mile radius.

170
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.940
The fact that they're in this cage,

171
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.460
what had to happen in order to confine them that way. I mean,

172
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:58.110
what happened for someone to put you in a cage?

173
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.810
They'd have to shoot you with darts that, you know,

174
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:05.700
so it's so heartbreaking to see powerful animals be reduced

175
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:09.420
to a zoo exhibition.

176
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.070
<v 0>A shelf trinket, it's sick.</v>

177
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.730
<v 1>In look. And a lot of animal people are crazy as.</v>

178
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.850
And you know, as we say, animal people, aren't always people,

179
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.180
people because a lot of people that are real big and animal rescue have a lot of

180
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:22.860
childhood trauma. They were neglected.

181
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:27.180
They were abused as kids and they see something voiceless and that can't,

182
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.690
you know, send emails or make phone calls being abused and they go nuts.

183
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:34.170
So I don't with a lot of animal rescue people because they're not rational.

184
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.830
My thing is like,

185
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.800
let's focus on changing a law instead of trying to get every elephant out of

186
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:42.480
every zoo. Um, but, uh, you know, I think that, you know, someone like you, uh,

187
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.350
I think we're similar in that we see how up it is to have an apex predator in a

188
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.310
box.

189
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.540
<v 0>Yeah. W w um, we went to the, the elephant thing and the elephant thing was,</v>

190
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.160
it was, it actually felt good because these elephants, they,

191
00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:58.470
they w they came over the top of the hill. They just showed up out of nowhere.

192
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:01.260
There's no fences. They came over the top of the hill and they come,

193
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.690
when they know that they're going to bring out the sugarcane and they're going

194
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.630
to meet these people and they're choosing to do it. And the way they meet you,

195
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.150
they just walk right up to you. I'm telling you, it's, it's wild.

196
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.280
Like they just, they bump into you.

197
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:13.980
Like they bring their face to you and you pet them, you, oh, hello,

198
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.890
nice to meet you. Yeah. They like being pat and.

199
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.960
<v 1>Feed them after chimpanzee, I.</v>

200
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.130
<v 0>Believe will, they can paint. They might be smarter than chips. You know,</v>

201
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:26.640
like they can, they can paint things. They can't solve complex puzzles.

202
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:30.030
Like chimps do, chimps can spell things. Chimps can do a lot of stuff,

203
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.870
but they remember their, uh, their loved ones, their family members for like,

204
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.560
they have.

205
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.660
<v 1>Decades and decades. It kills.</v>

206
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.140
<v 0>Me. They've reintroduced ones after like, you know, more than 10 years apart.</v>

207
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:43.090
And they recognize each other instantly and they run and hug and they're,

208
00:10:43.091 --> 00:10:46.380
they're rubbing trunks and everything. It's wild a source. Well,

209
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:47.160
there's something.

210
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.310
<v 1>So the closest we have to dinosaurs and you look at them and you're, you know,</v>

211
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:51.630
and I there's this place pause arc.

212
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.130
<v 0>I don't think they've been around that long.</v>

213
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.540
<v 1>Interesting. I mean, but they feel like they move. Like it is like.</v>

214
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.830
<v 0>Jurassic park special. There's something special. It's, Snuffaluffagus.</v>

215
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.370
<v 1>I mean, it's also like, you know.</v>

216
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.900
<v 0>The fact that something exists like that, that's so big. And yet it'll like,</v>

217
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.200
if you're nice to it gentle, like, here's the thing. It's like,

218
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:13.860
you really can't keep a tiger as a pet in an open area.

219
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.120
But you can in Thailand with these elephants, like the,

220
00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:19.140
the relationship they have with people is very different.

221
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:21.390
Like that thing just walks up to you. You can pet it.

222
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.630
There is not a chance in hell. You could do that with a tiger.

223
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.621
There's not a chance in hell.

224
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:29.700
You would let one of your friends or your children get on a tiger.

225
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.590
<v 1>I mean, and if they do anyone touching any apex predator, that's abuse,</v>

226
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:38.340
they have to take the Cub from the mom right away.

227
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:40.440
They have to dart the mom with the tranquilizer tick.

228
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.960
Because when everyone's like, I'm holding a bear, a bear Cub,

229
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.830
I'm holding a tire cup. It's like,

230
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.010
you think that the mom just willingly gave that up. No.

231
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:49.080
And then it's not getting any of the breast milk.

232
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:51.000
So they have all these auto-immune issues and they,

233
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.750
their spines don't develop properly. So the place that I work with in Alpine,

234
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.860
it's all these bears that have been in Cub petting as adults.

235
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.380
And they can't really walk well, they're all up.

236
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:07.120
It's once you see the aftermath of what happens with any kind of tiger,

237
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:07.841
I mean,

238
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:11.050
they have about six months and they just send them off to either get killed or

239
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.050
to get, uh, uh, can hunting or whatever that stuff is,

240
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:18.610
where they just put it hunt tigers, they put a tiger or a lion.

241
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.450
That's never been in the wild. That's only been held by humans. Definitely do.

242
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.350
<v 0>That with lions in.</v>

243
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.380
<v 1>Africa and these canned hunting facilities and the lions,</v>

244
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.570
he's a person who's like, Hey, what's up? And then someone shoots it.

245
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.820
And you're like, well, that's not hunting. That's not.

246
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.630
<v 0>Not only that, the, the lion doesn't go very far from where they release it.</v>

247
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.850
Cause it doesn't have a territory. So it doesn't know where to go.

248
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.380
<v 1>And was like, oh, I'm about to get a big Mac from this human or sorry. They go,</v>

249
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.333
that's a big Mac.

250
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.820
<v 0>Immediately. If they see a person, they want to kill it. But the point is,</v>

251
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.140
it's like, it's not really hunting.

252
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.940
It's not like you're going into the wild animals.

253
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.190
They literally let it go a day or two before the.

254
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.410
<v 1>But you've seen Tippi Hedren and these things where they,</v>

255
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.730
they bottle raised them.

256
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.310
So they're not going to attack someone that bottle raised them or.

257
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.920
<v 0>And on those farms, have you ever seen, um, uh, Louie through his documentary?</v>

258
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.260
I love him to have Adam on a couple of times and.

259
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.400
<v 1>Look twice Scientology when no, he's been a couple of times. I.</v>

260
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.030
<v 0>Love him,</v>

261
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:14.770
but he had a great special that he did about going to these

262
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:16.090
hunting camps in Africa,

263
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.830
where they raise these animals specifically to be released and hunted. And, uh,

264
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.010
he stayed there for a long time. Like he's so thorough. He,

265
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.580
he got in with this guy and got very close with this guy that was running this.

266
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:31.840
And he got him irritated to the point where the guy was like, Africa is.

267
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.460
And this, this guy was talking about why he did it. And he's like, it's.

268
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.070
And he's like, you know, these animals have.

269
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.930
And that he was basically explaining the only way these animals have any value

270
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.240
is if they're worth money to kill, right.

271
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.160
That's why there's high populations of them,

272
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.100
which is really wild because they used to be on the verge of extinction.

273
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.173
A lot of them,

274
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.230
and they've regrown their numbers substantially just because there's businesses

275
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.990
that are designed so that people know that's the guy.

276
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.940
So people can go over there and hunt.

277
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:04.840
