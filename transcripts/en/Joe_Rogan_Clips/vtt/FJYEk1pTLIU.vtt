00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.633
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.360
I read a really disturbing thing today and I'm not even sure if it's true.

4
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.080
So we should find out right now, click click.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.160
Did the CDC stop tracking flu deaths for this year?

6
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.800
Because this is what I read.

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.920
And it might have been some wacko right wing website that I was on &lt;laugh&gt; so

8
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:20.440
you never know, but, um, I was like, the,

9
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.950
this can't be true because the real concern is that the CDC tracks flu and they

10
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:29.670
find out that flu is lower or the same as COVID and why we're making a big deal

11
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.350
outta COVID. And then, you know, people right in the streets. That's why people.

12
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.390
<v 0>Can't, it's hard to tell who to trust. It's hard. You see? Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.830
To politicians and you see, uh, you don't trust either side and you,

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.540
everyone trying to make a power grab and use this as a way to make power or hurt

15
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.540
an opponent or whatever it is. Exactly. And even with, uh, yes, CDC,

16
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.420
you don't know there world health organization, you obviously can't tell there.

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.700
You can't trust information coming out of other countries.

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.660
So people at home are just like, what do I, what do I do safest thing to do?

19
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:00.260
It's just to stay where I am, but you don't know who to trust. That's.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.170
<v 1>It's very hard.</v>

21
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770
It's very hard to figure out who to trust and doctors are giving dispar.

22
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.010
What do we got on their website?

23
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.410
<v 2>I'm seeing information, uh, updated as of last week.</v>

24
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.490
<v 1>April 18th for flu deaths.</v>

25
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.650
<v 2>For like it's on the CDC, weekly flu surveillance. I mean, it's all the flu.</v>

26
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.730
<v 1>Information I could. So how many people have died this year from the flu? Um.</v>

27
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.400
<v 2>I have to dig three here to find that information on.</v>

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.400
<v 1>A second, because, um, the COVID deaths or what is it at now?</v>

29
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.600
55,000. I think something like that for this country. Yeah.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.320
I think it's more right. Maybe 60,000 now closing in on that. Yeah.

31
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.600
Which is not a small number. It's a lot of people, but then you find out that,

32
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.000
that that's a bad year for the flu that's normal,

33
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.830
but obviously this year we've locked everybody down worldwide

34
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.830
even. And you know, there's, there's,

35
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.510
there has to be a slower spread because of this quarantining and because this

36
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.990
social distancing, so you're, I would, uh,

37
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:57.830
imagine you're getting far lower numbers than they would've gotten if everybody

38
00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:59.870
had just gone out into the streets. Oh.

39
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.910
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, no doubt about that, but no doubt for, for flu. Uh,</v>

40
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.900
this is my understanding because in that fourth novel that I'm writing right

41
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.300
now, I was deep into the study of infectious diseases. Perfect.

42
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.380
<v 1>You perfect timing.</v>

43
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.580
<v 0>Right? It's crazy. Uh, and then how you weaponize those infectious diseases, uh,</v>

44
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.580
what the Japanese did prior to world war II in that space,

45
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.700
how they used them in world war II against the Chinese.

46
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.740
What happened to that data afterward after the war? Uh,

47
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.930
the Soviet pro from the end of world war II, up to the collapse,

48
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.530
what happened to that information?

49
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.730
And then our programs today from the end of world war II up to and continuing

50
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:34.810
through today. So I was, I was keyed to all that ahead of time.

51
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.570
And so it made me a little kind of hypersensitive to this.

52
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.451
I'd been talking to doctors,

53
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.170
people that had worked in that space doing my research. Uh,

54
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.890
but from obviously I'm not a doctor, uh,

55
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.320
but from what I've studied,

56
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.960
the difference here is that the incubation period. So for us,

57
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.280
so in the military, we go overseas and now we're fighting in surgeons.

58
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.030
And what do they look like?

59
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.360
Will they look like the people that aren't in surgeons? Uh,

60
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:59.120
what does that car look like? That's pulling up to this, uh, this checkpoint.

61
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.280
It looks like the one that didn't have a V B I D in it,

62
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.560
or is that one looking a little low on the suspension?

63
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.360
So they're not in a uniform. They're not driving a military type vehicle.

64
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.960
So same with this. It's,

65
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.600
it's like an insurgent that's adapted and it's adapted to those other diseases

66
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.361
and how we fought them.

67
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:19.150
And it's adapted by the incubation period by that nine is so the flu,

68
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:21.630
you get the flu you're down, you know, you shouldn't go into work.

69
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.150
If you show up at work, someone's like, bro, go home.

70
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:27.310
You look like you look horrible, get outta here. You're gonna infect everybody.

71
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.430
You don't know that with COVID 19. So you go out there for this nine days,

72
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.710
whatever it is. And you're infecting people during that timeframe.

73
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.830
So it's like that insurgent, that hides amongst, amongst the populace,

74
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.300
it's the same type of thing. Like if adapt to it, SARS was different.

75
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.900
Flu is different. All these other ones have been different.

76
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:46.980
And that's the adaptation of this one is that you go out and you infect other

77
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:50.700
people without knowing it. So that's the difference between it and the flu.

78
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.100
So it, it's a hard thing to wrap your head around when you just look at numbers.

79
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.540
Um, but it, but there is a difference in that, uh, flu, you're staying home,

80
00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:58.240
you're sick.

81
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.730
<v 1>You know, it's, it's really in a lot of ways,</v>

82
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.450
it's a perfect way to spread a virus because there's a,

83
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.730
there's a video game that my wife plays. She used to play. Doesn't play anymore.

84
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.850
Now that this is going down, but it was a, a virus video game. Really.

85
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.210
You send a virus throughout the world. And the,

86
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.370
the key is if you make your virus too strong, it's a video game.

87
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:22.800
You play in your, I iPad outta your phone. If you make the virus too strong,

88
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.680
it kills people too quickly. And then it doesn't spread.

89
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.240
So the way you get a virus everywhere is you have one that sits in your system

90
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:31.860
for a little bit,

91
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.560
and it's just weak in the beginning and slowly spreads its way across the world.

92
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.280
And that's essentially what, this is in a lot of ways, but this is this one.

93
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.590
So weird, man. I mean,

94
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.110
the Newsweek actually had a story yesterday saying that they think it came from

95
00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:49.350
a lab. So now that, that theory of whether or not it came from a laboratory,

96
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.190
I think I tweeted it. I think I tweeted it. So you could find it on,

97
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:56.150
on my Twitter page, but I was reading it yesterday. I'm like, okay, Newsweek,

98
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.070
not really, uh, sensationalistic publication, right?

99
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.220
When they're publishing some like that, you gotta go, Hmm.

100
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.900
Probably something to this. And there's a lot of speculation. I mean,

101
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:08.140
it's not so hard to imagine. I mean, you're,

102
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.100
you're talking about something that literally was a few blocks from the

103
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:14.020
epicenter in Wuhan where they had that level four lab.

104
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.300
<v 0>Right? So the deal is with, uh, like the video game your wife was playing. Um,</v>

105
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.500
and that, that the goal of that game, it sounds like was to infect the world to,

106
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.890
to kill the world. But if that's not your goal, game game. If you have &lt;laugh&gt;,

107
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.330
if you have a goal and you want your country to survive,

108
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.090
then you don't want it to become exactly a global pandemic. Yeah.

109
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:31.650
You want it to hit the city, the country,

110
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.490
whatever geographic area you want to hit with a weaponized, uh,

111
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:37.890
infectious disease. You want it to burn out in that city.

112
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.330
So instead of going over and dropping bombs on it, like, uh, like world war II,

113
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.160
uh, like fire bombing dressed in, or, or whatever else or Tokyo, uh,

114
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:48.800
and just destroying those cities. Well, you know what, after the war,

115
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:50.880
you can go in with an infectious disease and you know,

116
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.280
it's burned out and there's no damage. Yeah. Um,

117
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.520
but you don't want it to spread throughout the whole world and come back to your

118
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.720
own country. Uh,

119
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.240
so when I first looked at this and I heard about Wuhan and I heard that there

120
00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:04.440
was a, I don't say, not a weapons lab maybe, but maybe it's a weapons lab. Um,

121
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.080
but at least a lab doing research in infectious diseases,

122
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.520
a couple miles from these wet markets where they're saying that this thing broke

123
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.400
out, um,

124
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.510
there are cases in the former Soviet union of them doing these,

125
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.110
this research into infectious diseases and weaponizing it,

126
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.750
and then having it get out because of protocols weren't followed or whatever

127
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:26.470
else, and kills a few people. And they hush hush it cuz it's, uh,

128
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.990
in 1960 something or 1970 something. Uh,

129
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:31.710
so there is precedent and it wouldn't be beyond the,

130
00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:33.310
beyond the pale to think that, oh,

131
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:36.110
someone was doing some sort of research and it doesn't even have to be

132
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:39.900
weaponization. It can just be, they're just studying this infectious disease,

133
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.220
not even weaponizing it.

134
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.260
And someone contracts it somehow in that lab and then brings it outside.

135
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.780
<v 1>Yeah. That's the controversial theory. So here's the thing,</v>

136
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.020
the controversial experiments in Wuhan lab suspected of starting the coronavirus

137
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.100
pandemic and says the case against a Wuhan lab. And so, uh,

138
00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:01.650
it says why the Wuhan lab remains a suspect in the coronavirus investigation.

139
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.970
I mean, it's really likely that we never really will know. Right.

140
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.370
But they most certainly were working on viruses similar to this one,

141
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.690
right there. Yeah. The end.

142
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.570
<v 2>Of this article says there's another one called, uh,</v>

143
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.720
rat R ATG 13, which is very, very similar it to the SARS.

144
00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:21.600
COVID two one that we're experiencing now. Oh, terrific.

145
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.640
They share 96% of the same genetic material.

146
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.720
<v 1>Yeah. Wow. It's not to be the most similar to SARS. COVID two, uh,</v>

147
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.840
of any known virus, the two share 96% of their genetic material.

148
00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:36.800
That 4% gap would still be a formidable gap for animal passage.

149
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.870
Research says round of Barrack virologists, university of North Carolina,

150
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.390
probably in bed with the Russians mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who collaborated with,

151
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.830
like, when you found out that a Harvard guy got arrested that, uh,

152
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.830
cuz he was, uh, taking money from Russia or excuse me,

153
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:55.590
taking money from China cuz he was uh, doing something with them. Yeah.

154
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.150
I mean it's real spooky.

155
00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:00.420
What's really spooky is the world health organization is essentially in bed

156
00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:01.860
with, with China. Yeah.

157
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.020
And they're not giving us a hundred percent clear detailed information.

158
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:09.700
Everything gets filtered down through the Chinese propaganda system. Oh sure,

159
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:10.140
sure. Very.

160
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.140
<v 0>Dangerous. And they also were exceedingly, we, we don't know the numbers. Right.</v>

161
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:14.974
And we can't trust China,

162
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.770
but it seems like they were a little more prepared for this than we were a uh,

163
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:21.530
with so far as testing kids goes and all that.

164
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.250
So if you're doing re if there's a lab where you're doing research similar to

165
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:29.570
this close by there there's a history, uh, of other countries,

166
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:32.730
maybe even China too, of doing research into infectious diseases,

167
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.330
not following protocols that we would here in the United States or not all as,

168
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.770
as safe as they are shocker here in the United States where we're doing the same

169
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.040
type of research, then it gets out and then they just happen to have, uh,

170
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.520
a lot of these kits ready to go for testing. Um, I don't know.

171
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.121
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:51.840
Well in 2018 they were actually cited for violating safety protocols at that

173
00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:54.240
same lab in 2018. So they were, there were,

174
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.440
there were concerns about that area long before,

175
00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:02.040
but what's really up is the world health organization posted in January that

176
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:02.920
according to China,

177
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.960
there is no evidence of person to person transmission of this disease.

178
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:12.160
This is days after they knew for sure it was

179
00:09:12.161 --> 00:09:13.520
being transmitted from person to person.

180
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.150
So China has been deceptive about this from the very beginning.

181
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.070
And they think that if they were honest about it and that they,

182
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.550
they stopped everybody from leaving, it could have covered,

183
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.910
they could have covered this in the point where it would've been 95% less.

184
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.110
I saw that. Yeah. 95% less people would've gotten infected. Yeah.

185
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.030
<v 0>Just lock down Wuhan to deal with it there as much as you can. Anyway,</v>

186
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.260
let the rest of the world know. I mean, looking back that seems like,

187
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.540
but you're dealing with China, same thing. You're dealing with Russia.

188
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:39.620
You're dealing with some of these other.

189
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.260
<v 1>Countries like that. China seems the worst. It seems like the worst.</v>

190
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.620
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; it does seem that way. It's a perfect storm. It.</v>

191
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:45.981
<v 1>Seems like.</v>

192
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:48.500
But the way they handle their own citizens when their citizens are testing

193
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.860
positive, is this horrible video.

194
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.500
This family being dragged out by these people in hazmat suits and they're trying

195
00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:57.050
to resist these people are dragging them away cuz they tested positive. Oh.

196
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.050
<v 0>Yeah. Once again, that government taking a little more control, more control,</v>

197
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:00.970
little more control. Exactly.

198
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.890
And we're just giving it up and we give up so much. And even before this,

199
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:07.890
obviously we gave up so much information about ourselves voluntarily. Uh,

200
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.330
we would, let's say in the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties,

201
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.250
we never would've given up and now we're like, oh click accept. And now bam,

202
00:10:15.251 --> 00:10:18.360
there you go. I awesome. I can post a picture or whatever it is, you know,

203
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.840
this is fun. I can communicate with my friend.
