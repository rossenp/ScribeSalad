1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, but so, so Josh is now,</v>

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.000
um, hosting a podcast called junk science.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.140
<v 1>Well, we started talking about at the beginning,</v>

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.180
then I made you stop and redirect it. So let's come back to it.

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.060
So explain like what, what is the junk science? What,

6
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:21.560
what are the issues with wrongful convictions and junk science?

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.453
So.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.470
<v 2>The all various disciplines of forensic science are</v>

9
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:31.010
used to convict people. And in fact, wrongfully convicted people,

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.270
polygon does a polygraph work. Polygraph is not admissible. It's not so no,

11
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:38.260
it doesn't work. It's not reliable. Is.

12
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.660
<v 1>It because you could beat it? If you're a psychopath.</v>

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.370
<v 2>Beat it, there's all different factors that cause your blood pressure to rise.</v>

14
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.580
You know, you may just have a high blood pressure. You may,

15
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.570
your heart may beat faster and you get anxious in different situations.

16
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:56.320
So it just doesn't work. Um, and it's not admissible in any courts,

17
00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:01.300
but I'm talking about things that you would probably think it just based on pop

18
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:05.140
media, even if you're very well-read, which you are, you would say, oh,

19
00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:09.220
well that's reliable, like bite mark evidence, right?

20
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.840
It's complete junk sign. So the national academy of sciences is a, um,

21
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.070
the gold standard.

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.200
It's got the finest scientists in the country that did a review of

23
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:25.180
all of the forensic disciplines that are used in courts and found that

24
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.160
with the exception of DNA, all of these are fraught with problems,

25
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.950
bite mark evidence, blood spatter,

26
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.210
arson coercion in chorus confession.

27
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.890
So what the podcast does is it examines all of these from episode by

28
00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:42.724
episode,

29
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.590
it examines all of these forensic disciplines and it goes through to explain

30
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.330
how and why a they're total and B

31
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.440
they are in the face of it being total,

32
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.420
still accepted.

33
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.670
Now like the fact that you got emotional made me want to hug you

34
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.010
because it was like, I, you know, it's like,

35
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:09.250
it takes a special person to be able to get there on that level.

36
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.700
But now I want to try to make you angry because I think it it's,

37
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.100
it's the anger that should drive people to.

38
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.040
<v 3>Take back tape about this. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.910
Take the bit about all this bite mark evidence for.

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.760
<v 1>Bite mark. We'll give you an example. I have crooked teeth like the bottom.</v>

41
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:28.980
My bottom teeth are crooked. If I bite into a mouthpiece,

42
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.980
like if I get a mouthpiece form, you can clearly see,

43
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.270
I could see that it's my teeth.

44
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.230
<v 2>You want to know the debt.</v>

45
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.440
You want to know the difference between a mouthpiece and human skin,

46
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.750
everything humans,

47
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.010
your skin is different than my skin in thickness and

48
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.920
consistency. If you're flexing, when I bite you,

49
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.900
if it's during a struggle or not,

50
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.910
and you have to follow the science and what the science tells us is that bite

51
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:57.960
marks on human skin are not only unreliable,

52
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.020
but there has been study after study that the so-called experts that they call

53
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.370
otologist. Can't tell the difference between a bite mark and an insect bite.

54
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.300
They can't even agree. They were all shown. The self-professed finest.

55
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:14.950
Otologist in the country are all shown pictures of marks on

56
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.360
human skin. They can't even agree as a threshold matter. What's a bite mark.

57
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.350
And what isn't is that.

58
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.510
<v 1>A that's a medical term odontology.</v>

59
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.040
<v 2>So otologist is as a forensic Denton dentists that</v>

60
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.780
fancies themself an expert in bite marks, but it's. Not only is it,

61
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.420
but the origin story of all these forensic sciences sciences,

62
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:40.870
you end up down a rabbit hole to some

63
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.630
up story. That sounds like a wacky religion take bite marks. For instance,

64
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.150
there's a guy named George Burroughs is a Reverend in the late 1690s.

65
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.290
He's accused of torturing young girls. Okay.

66
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.060
And one of the forms of torture is biting them and

67
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.520
he's tried and convicted and they take them around the courtroom and pull

68
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:10.390
his mouth open. And they point to the crookedness of his teeth,

69
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:11.800
the ridges in his molars,

70
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.870
and they compare it to the bite mark and he's hanged publicly.

71
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.360
And he cites the Lord's prayer at his hanging. And you know,

72
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.540
everybody in the crowd was like, that's kind of up because

73
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.720
witches aren't supposed to be able to cite the Lord's prayer

74
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.340
because this was a trial during the Salem witch trials.

75
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.610
He's the first, um, posthumous, um,

76
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.610
exoneration I'm aware of 20 years after this.

77
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.640
They ended up finding out that George Burroughs was in a different town

78
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.550
altogether. Not only didn't bite these people,

79
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.720
but that the marks weren't even bites as a part of the seal and the Salem witch

80
00:04:55.721 --> 00:05:00.580
trials. And they put, they paused humorously, exonerate him.

81
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.390
The colony of Massachusetts pays his family compensation.

82
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.000
So watch this in the 1970s,

83
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.040
there's a guy named Walter Marx that is accused of biting a victim in a murder.

84
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.600
And the court in that case says, you know what?

85
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.860
There is no established science here. It can't be replicated,

86
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.000
but bite marks are associated with, you know,

87
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:28.900
identifying accident, victims, burn victims, and admits it.

88
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.000
And it gets admitted into evidence. The appellate court says, well, if the,

89
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.390
if the judge found it credible, who are we to overturn it?

90
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.800
And so Joe watched this, it now infects,

91
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.400
and it's probably an unpopular analogy to use now,

92
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.180
but it spreads across the criminal justice system. Like a virus.

93
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.900
Every court just starts citing this Mark's case.

94
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.270
And judges just start admitting it.

95
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.030
The national academy of forensic scientists found that there's no way to

96
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.960
replicate it. That it's unreliable that the there's this

97
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.450
crackpot named west,

98
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.190
who is an otologist that claimed to use 3d pictures and

99
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.050
ultra violet. He said they set them up. They sent him,

100
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.540
um, you know, uh,

101
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.310
bite marks and the mold of the teeth from someone other than the

102
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:24.800
defendant and said, we think this is the defendant.

103
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.350
Can you match it to this bite mark? And he said, yes,

104
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.250
they had sent him the bite mark of someone other than the defendant. I mean,

105
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.640
it is that it is that bad of a junk science.

106
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.560
So what we're hoping to do is through the podcast to

107
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.900
educate people because it you're right.

108
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.040
It is how do you overhaul a system? It's a monster.

109
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.670
And one of the ways that you can overhaul the system is, you know,

110
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:53.390
everybody says, how do you, they ask me a lot? How do I get out of jury service?

111
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.190
And I say, you know what?

112
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.940
You should want to be there because God forbid you were accused of something you

113
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:00.980
didn't do. Wouldn't you want you on your jury.

114
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.060
So one of the ways we want to do it is to get people thinking, you know what?

115
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:09.260
I can make a difference here because there's no presumption of innocence. We,

116
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.990
we throw that around. Like it exists. It doesn't exist.

117
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.370
There have been studies done. My firm has done one where, well,

118
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:21.170
over 90% of people feel like if you've been accused of a crime,

119
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.730
um, you probably did it. Look, I represented how I met Lennox.

120
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.470
I represented Lennox in a case, Lennox Lewis. We should tell people, oh, okay.

121
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.660
So I managed Lennox Lewis and I represented him.

122
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:40.160
How I met him was I represented him in a case. And, um,

123
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.410
it's an interesting, most people say to me, when I say that, what did he do?

124
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.840
Right. Of course, instead of what, what was he accused.

125
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.600
<v 3>Of? He actually wasn't accused.</v>

126
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.433
<v 2>Of anything.</v>

127
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.850
Lennox was suing a boxing manager and a promoter from ripping him off and for

128
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:59.860
stealing from him. Um,

129
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.040
but if you ask people during jury selection,

130
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.060
how many of you in a criminal case? And when I was, you know,

131
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.080
a lot of jurors were asking, well, what did he do? He didn't do anything.

132
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:14.680
But if you asked jurors in a criminal case, if a judge will let you ask it,

133
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.760
what you should be able to ask, how many of you think my client,

134
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.730
he was arrested, indicted, must've done something wrong. All hands,

135
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:29.320
go flying up and down. You know, it should be a basis to get rid of people.

136
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:32.290
That's not the presumption meniscus. That's the assumption of guilt.

137
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.860
It doesn't exist in this country and it takes more people to be conscientious.

138
00:08:35.861 --> 00:08:40.180
And one of the things that we're trying to do on the podcast is educate them

139
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.220
about these junk sciences, so that if you're ever on a jury and you hear well,

140
00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:48.760
the trajectory of the blood mark on the wall shows you that the person must have

141
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:53.050
grabbed the knife from this angle. It's total. Okay. One more time.

142
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:56.580
What's the name of the podcast? The name of the is wrongful conviction,

143
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.590
junk science. Okay.

144
00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.360
<v 1>So that blood splatter,</v>

145
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.640
I'd watched a whole thing online about how w how these people

146
00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:08.240
figure out like how someone must've hit him this way.

147
00:09:08.241 --> 00:09:11.180
And I've seen it in movies. That's all. Total.

148
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.000
<v 2>So the second episode of the podcast,</v>

149
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.560
I have a guest by the name of Pamela Colloff, who's an award winning writer.

150
00:09:18.561 --> 00:09:21.080
She just won every award.

151
00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:24.050
You could win for writing an article about, uh,

152
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.590
an informant in a case of mine. And I got to know her,

153
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:31.640
and she wrote an amazing investigative piece about blood spatter,

154
00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:35.900
evidence for public or Texas monthly, or the New York times. One of those three,

155
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:40.730
I should know. And she went under cover deep,

156
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.900
and she became a certified blood spatter analyst.

157
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.340
As part of her research.

158
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.950
This is a discipline that was born in the basement of some

159
00:09:51.951 --> 00:09:53.990
whack job up in New York.

160
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:58.310
He called it the national forensic laboratory or some like that.

161
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:01.940
And it was his basement in his house. And he would do things like,

162
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.540
like recreate crimes by like, you know,

163
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:10.490
hitting cadavers and watching the blood spatter and, and just like,

164
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.430
think about it. There's so many things wrong with that.

165
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.050
The way the blood travels out of the body from a static,

166
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.210
um, you know, a static body versus one where blood is slow,

167
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.470
is circulating already changes it. The temperature of the blood is different.

168
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.450
If you're struggling and I hit you with a blunt force object, a hammer,

169
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:36.650
a bat, and your arm is coming up this way. Depends on the speed.

170
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:41.600
Your arm is traveling. It is total and utter, but it's admissible,

171
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.703
it's admissible.

172
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.910
<v 0>As his bite mark evidence, even though in all 50 states, um,</v>

173
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.030
as is even though the, the highest court in Texas, um,

174
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.720
faced in work at the innocence project. I mean the highest authority in Texas,

175
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.130
uh, strongly admonished the courts, not to consider blood, uh,

176
00:10:58.131 --> 00:10:59.390
to consider bite mark evidence,

177
00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:02.750
but they still do in spite of the fact that there's case after case,

178
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.680
that proves that these guys who make themselves out to be these experts don't

179
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.010
know anything about what they're talking about. I mean, it's, it's,

180
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.930
we should all be embarrassed and ashamed that this is allowed to go

181
00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:16.550
on in our courts. And you think about it,

182
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:19.940
Joe forensic odontology was created as a practice,

183
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.090
so that if there's a disaster, if there's a plane crash, right,

184
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:24.320
and bodies are obliterated,

185
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:26.720
they can take a full set of teeth and they can compare it to your dental

186
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:27.440
records.

187
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.010
Now you take the idea that someone's going to bite an imperfect surface, right?

188
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:34.370
Like a finger or, or, you know, your neck or whatever it is. Right.

189
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.260
And now you're going to go with a couple of teeth on an imperfect surface days

190
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:42.230
or weeks later, and you're going to go, this must be Joe's teeth.

191
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.960
Cause sometimes I don't really know if you have teeth or not. Joe.

192
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.730
<v 2>Check this out in the national academy of sciences report, they were a,</v>

193
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.490
they did a study and they cite to it in the report and you can get it it's.

194
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.220
They did a study where they would have people with no teeth,

195
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.930
bite human skin and the people with no missing their two front

196
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:05.110
teeth. The bite mark appears as if they have two front teeth,

197
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.920
people that have two front teeth can bite down.

198
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.470
And if their incisors are too long,

199
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.850
it can make it appear that they're missing two front teeth. So it's just,

200
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:19.750
you know, as far as blood spatter is concerned, there is a case.

201
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:24.040
I think it's the Peterson case that my friend David Rudolph did know the

202
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:26.290
staircase that show on Netflix.

203
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.420
<v 3>Where the guy was, the guy was accused.</v>

204
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.860
<v 2>Of pushing downstairs. I think it was in this case, um,</v>

205
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.960
where they were trying to recreate the blood spatter analysts were trying

206
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:42.820
to recreate the spatter in the staircase and there's video of them doing it.

207
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.930
And they keep on hitting this, um,

208
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.090
this receptacle full of blood and they can't recreate it and they keep on

209
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:56.170
doing it and doing it. And finally on the whatever 15th try,

210
00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.040
they get it and they all start celebrating and high-fiving,

211
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.450
you're supposed to be able to replicate this. And the reason why DNA,

212
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.310
um, is,

213
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.200
is so reliable is that it's going to be the

214
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:15.760
same every time it is, um, the gold standard.

215
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.920
Now there are ways to manipulate it.

216
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:21.970
There are certain people out there that are trying to with it right now. Um,

217
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.380
you know, like for instance,

218
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:28.300
there's this guy who runs this computer algorithm and

219
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.770
he claims to be able to take a mixture of a bunch of different people's DNA and

220
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:37.510
untangle it, right. And basically be able to say whose DNA is what,

221
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.860
and, you know,

222
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.090
he won't give the source code for his data

223
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.840
and you know, this shouldn't be a black box. So there's,

224
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.110
there's some things going on like that. But for the most part,

225
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:53.290
when it's done correctly and the right standards are applied,

226
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:57.040
you can bet on DNA. But a lot of these pattern matching disciplines,

227
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.880
blood spatter fingerprints, in some instances, um,

228
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.410
bite mark evidence, you know, and what are the other ones, um,

229
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.110
tread, tracking on choose.

230
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.590
<v 4>Arson, arson.</v>

231
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.490
<v 1>Arson side, when they can figure out like where a fire was started.</v>

232
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:15.930
I always wondered about that. So.

233
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.440
<v 0>Our, oh, sorry to interrupt you please. Uh, so arson, I thought you were done.</v>

234
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.760
Arson science is not science whatsoever. Arson. Uh,

235
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.930
you can become a licensed arson investigator with a 40 hour correspondence.

236
00:14:27.931 --> 00:14:29.850
Course. I know it sounds like a joke, but it's true.

237
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.060
<v 2>Same thing with blood spatter. It's a 40 hour course at the end of the week,</v>

238
00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:35.940
you can go into any court in the country, in San well, blood bad. Right? I.

239
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.140
<v 1>Was wonder because I would see a house burnt to the ground. Then they would say,</v>

240
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.800
oh, they determined it was started by a fire.

241
00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:47.100
And this is how they determined it. And I'm like, but everything's burnt out.

242
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.140
Like, how do you know? There are countless.

243
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.960
<v 0>People serving hard time, um, in, in prisons in America, um, Joanne parks,</v>

244
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.540
I'm Christine bunch who I just interviewed on my product as she brought me to

245
00:14:56.541 --> 00:15:00.650
tears who was convicted of setting a fire. I mean her, her case in Indiana,

246
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.230
how insane is this jail? We're about to release this episode,

247
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:07.670
but she was a 21 year old mother of a three-year-old boy and her trailer caught

248
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:10.460
fire. She was asleep. She woke up, she couldn't get into the son's room.

249
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:14.090
It was to, the fire was too out of control already. And the little boy died.

250
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.900
And the fact is that she, they, they went,

251
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.450
they arrested her six days later in charge of with arson and murder.

252
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.990
And the prosecutor said to the jury, w we admit, we don't have a motive.

253
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.490
We don't have a motive. She was a loving mother with no mental issues with no,

254
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.040
I asked her, do you have any other history of the law enforcement? She goes,

255
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.860
yeah. Once I got a warning for going five miles an hour over the speed limit.

256
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.130
And she, everybody said she was a doting, loving mother.

257
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:41.240
She was working and going to school and she lost everything. She owned.

258
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.140
She didn't have insurance. She didn't have a shirt to wear at the end of this.

259
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:48.770
Right. Because she was in her pajamas. It's like, w I mean,

260
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.190
and it was an electrical fire was proved 17 years later by actual X.

261
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.150
<v 2>Use as the arson evidence against her in the case.</v>

262
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.800
<v 0>Claim that there was a certain type of accelerant, which there wasn't, um,</v>

263
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.910
they withheld evidence that there was a kerosene that had been, uh,

264
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.600
present in the house from previous, uh, owners who had,

265
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.950
who had come forward and said that there was, you know, and that there was, you.

266
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.670
<v 1>Know, there was a lot just decided that she was guilty and they were going to.</v>

267
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.570
<v 0>Try to win. And they,</v>

268
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.020
and that's the sick thing about it is that these arson cases, there is no,

269
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.890
there was no crime. There was a tragedy, but no crime, nobody.

270
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.280
How long had she went away for, she was in for 17 years.

271
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.870
And she's such a beautiful human. I mean, you would, you would meet her even,

272
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:32.950
and you just want to hug her.

273
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:37.330
She's just a magnificent human who in prison did most

274
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.800
phenomenal things. And now she's helping others. She has an organization.

275
00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:44.260
Maybe you could look it up. Jamie. She has a wonderful organization.

276
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:47.830
I'd like to shout out. Um, and she's making a real difference. And she,

277
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.650
I think helped pass a compensation statute in.

278
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.720
<v 2>Sorry, I didn't mean to step on your words.</v>

279
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.780
I was just going to say that what happens with a lot of these forensic sciences

280
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.090
is they work. They reverse engineer an outcome,

281
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.690
so they decide that the person did it. And there's all this,

282
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:04.920
this confirmation bias. I know that I've heard you talk about it.

283
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.530
You're familiar with it. You know, you know, the desired outcome.

284
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.190
So you confirm that bias. So, you know,

285
00:17:12.191 --> 00:17:17.110
they then start looking at a streak from

286
00:17:17.111 --> 00:17:18.970
a smoke stain on the wall.

287
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.250
And knowing that the theory is that there was a match

288
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:28.150
struck and placed against the wall, right?

289
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.080
They will say, well, that's why you see it.

290
00:17:32.081 --> 00:17:36.190
The pattern that you do have that stain on the wall of smoke,

291
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.170
where the reality is is that there are a lot of different explanations for how

292
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.430
something can look.

293
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.680
The scientific analysis of ch of charred remains not remains of people,

294
00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:50.850
but remains of different things, compounds and things.

295
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.780
And if you're working to reverse engineer an outcome, you know, it's,

296
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.080
and it's easy to make this stuff sound reliable,

297
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.160
because if you don't have experience with it, I mean, look, this is a big,

298
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.510
I hadn't done any bite mark cases and all of my cases. So I,

299
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:10.130
I actually tried to approach it with an open mind. Um,

300
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:14.940
I'm literally stunned at what I'm finding out, doing research for the episodes,

301
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:18.960
because it sounds like some wacky religion, you know,

302
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.690
that somebody invented in their house and people buy.

303
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.130
<v 1>It.</v>

304
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.810
So it's all this stuff still in use because no one has

305
00:18:26.811 --> 00:18:31.460
exposed the fact that it's all junk science or is it because it's established

306
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.730
as a part of what they accept in trials.

307
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.150
And they just haven't made the corrections yet, because if they did,

308
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.270
then they would have to accept the fact that all these other convictions that

309
00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:46.100
were based on this junk science would be open to re-interpretation.

310
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.820
<v 0>In the trailer for junk science. Josh addresses exactly that.</v>

311
00:18:49.821 --> 00:18:54.200
And he does it very eloquently, which is that along with Chris Fabricant,

312
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:59.030
who is a strategic litigation director at the innocence project, um,

313
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.960
it was actually a post I created in honor of my dad. Who's not with us anymore.

314
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.220
Um, well I helped to create, I should say, and he does an incredible job,

315
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.420
but basically they keep using it because the precedent is there, right.

316
00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:14.570
Once it's, uh, Josh talks about this and maybe we could even play the trailer,

317
00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:18.270
but I'm sure he talked, play the trailer. Yeah. Can we sure.

318
00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:20.180
Can we pull it up on a, on a.

319
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.790
<v 1>On a podcast app, as soon as he finds it.</v>

320
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.050
<v 0>And then that'll,</v>

321
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.210
that'll say it more eloquently than I possibly so hard to listen to.

322
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.520
And then there's shaken baby syndrome, which we'll be covering on junk science,

323
00:19:31.521 --> 00:19:35.240
which is, which is like, everyone's heard those words. It's a,

324
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.550
it's a ridiculous idea that you can shake a baby hard enough to rattle its

325
00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:42.980
brain without injuring it in any other way. Right.

326
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:47.270
So we're supposed to believe that a woman who is a mother, right. First of all,

327
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.180
it's hard to believe that they would kill their kid, but okay. Let's, let's,

328
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.210
let's suspend that this belief, how do you get to shake a baby? Right?

329
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:54.800
You're this, you're a strong guy. Okay.

330
00:19:54.801 --> 00:19:58.430
But let's say you don't have a big muscle mass and you have a baby.

331
00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:00.880
Sometimes they're toddlers. It could be a 15, 20 pound kid.

332
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.130
You're going to hold it out at arms length and shake it. No,

333
00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:08.060
your arms aren't going to do. And by the way, unless I'm mistaken people,

334
00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:10.910
most people, they get mad at something, they don't shake it. They hit it,

335
00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:13.580
they kick it or they throw it right. You get mad at your golf club.

336
00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:17.690
You don't shake it. It hit a bad shot, whatever. I mean, it's, you know,

337
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.830
it's madness.

338
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.880
And yet it's accepted in courts and they're countless people serving time.

339
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.030
You know, uh, Melissa [inaudible] is one. I can't leave her out.

340
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.040
Jon Jones in Ohio innocent as could be just misdiagnosed. Okay.
