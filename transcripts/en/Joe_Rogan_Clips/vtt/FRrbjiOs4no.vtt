00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.740
<v 1>So I'm in my underwear and I'm living on top of a rock in this cave.</v>

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.570
And the oldest guy in the village is, you know, when he starts talking,

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.830
it's like, uh, I'm in like lion king. And he's like, when I was young on all,

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.450
you know, I have a translator with me,

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.080
he's translating [inaudible] to so Healy to English.

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.030
He's like elephants lions, hippos,

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.230
like everywhere. And like, it was like a buffet. We just wake up,

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.060
we could kill anything. And in my lifetime that has been gone. It's gone.

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.740
It's like the there's very few animals left to hunt. And the ones that are like,

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.240
they're endangered, you can't kill them. So life there is very,

12
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:50.070
very hard and they go, you want to hunt with us? And I'm like, dude,

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.490
look at my body. Do I look like, and um,

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.540
there was like a Catholic priest that set up a mission in that area.

15
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.860
And he's been, I met him.

16
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:03.600
He's been trying to convert the Hadza to a Catholic Catholicism for 20

17
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.190
years. And he's like, they use the, the Bible pages to smoke weed.

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.730
So what do they hunt with bow and arrow, like homemade bow and arrow,

19
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.940
homemade bow and arrow. Like, like just, they,

20
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:22.410
they take this wood and they spent all day making the arrows. Yup.

21
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.600
[inaudible] yeah. I'll show you how they did learn that, make it,

22
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:30.770
and then they use their teeth to think. I know that guy

23
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.950
that might be Rasuli. Um, and then they, um,

24
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.430
there's a plant that they, um,

25
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.700
they harvest and they, they do all this stuff to it.

26
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.350
And then that's the poison that they put on the tip of the arrow and these

27
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.600
guys. Yup. There it is.

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.190
<v 2>How crazy it is. I think that this is how people hunted, dude.</v>

29
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.500
<v 1>I live longest time, dude. I live in a state of the art.</v>

30
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.720
I lived like this for months, man. It was like.

31
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.190
<v 2>So you did this as well.</v>

32
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.630
<v 1>Dude. So first, first day of the hunt they're like,</v>

33
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.890
did they teach you how to shoot a bow? First through my bow shooting is so off.

34
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.630
And um, yeah, so we practice had, you had shot a bow in the path,

35
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.220
never shot a bow in it in my life. There's one of these, one of these guys.

36
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.100
See it, it almost looks like a toy. Like you think it wouldn't work.

37
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.960
There's one guy in the village Shawnee that's so strong that he could shoot the

38
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:30.260
arrow through the kudu. It was up. And I was like,

39
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.570
you're back muscles in that mother. Oh my God. They're ripped, dude. My God,

40
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:40.080
that guy is Jack. The ripper really strong. He's a very strong, so.

41
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.330
<v 2>Pulling them back is probably tremendous. Like back muscle.</v>

42
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.610
<v 1>Everyone knows how to hunt. The kids know how to hunt.</v>

43
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.800
They use it for the feathers at the end of.

44
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.770
<v 0>The one that's uh, which guy? No doubt.</v>

45
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.620
<v 1>Yeah, that guy. Yup. I stayed with that guy. Well, yeah,</v>

46
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.390
he's older now. See the cuts on his face. Yeah, I have that.

47
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.280
They cut my face. So yeah. I asked them too, cause I like pain for real.

48
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.960
But look at that guy. It's almost gone now. This was a dude,

49
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.270
but don't don't they look like supermodels. Like they're like really? Yeah.

50
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.104
I'm like just.

51
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.480
<v 2>And also you got to think of the amount of effort that they're doing CrossFit</v>

52
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:28.830
classes every day. Right? I mean, think about just getting by,

53
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:31.710
as a hunter gatherer with their crazy bow that you have to pull back and you're

54
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.910
running through the woods all the time.

55
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:36.990
Like you have to be fit it's it's unbelievable.

56
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.110
What a crazy way to live. Yeah. Look at that.

57
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.160
I mean, what's, he's in for the feathers for the fletching. Do you know.

58
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.050
<v 1>Dude,</v>

59
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.790
these are so in tune with nature that they'll go,

60
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.810
they'll make a bird sound and they're talking to the bird and the bird will show

61
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.760
you where the honey is like,

62
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.560
and then there's a pack of 50 dogs following us and the dogs aren't pets,

63
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:07.060
they're hunting tools. Right? So the dogs are the first line of defense.

64
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.720
They've sniff it out. And I'm like, this is,

65
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.210
this is mental, right? It's like, oh,

66
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.290
like I'm on a insane experience right now. Never did.

67
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.960
I thought I would just wait, why? Why am I going home?

68
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.730
So if I walk with one of the kids, una amazing,

69
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.820
it's a clicking language. It's like, like that kind of language.

70
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.220
Did you learn any of it? Tiny bit.

71
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.560
And I didn't of course I did a podcast where I speak. [inaudible]

72
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.700
imagine if they take that out of context,

73
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.350
it turns out you're saying some really up.

74
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.770
<v 2>I try, you gotta be careful. Right? If you're making up a language,</v>

75
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.770
like you might accidentally hit on some real there. I tried,

76
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:50.650
I tried just say one or two forbidden words.

77
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.780
<v 1>So if I walk with one of the kids and it's like him giving me a tour of his</v>

78
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:58.600
house, like, oh, come to Joe's warehouse and he's showing me right.

79
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:02.080
He's like grabbing a snake, biting his head off. He's like, he's like,

80
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.500
you want some thing climbing a tree with.

81
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.900
<v 2>Just grabbed a snake, just grab it off. He takes.</v>

82
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.790
<v 1>Out his Slingshot, the rock, a pebble,</v>

83
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:14.770
this big bam hits a Bush baby out of the tree breaks

84
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.740
his leg breaks. His legs puts it here. It's like snack for later,

85
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.370
everything is talking there. It's like,

86
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.850
it looks like they're just goofing off and playing. But there they have like,

87
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.870
must they have, um, some, uh, what do you call it?

88
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.590
Microbes and gut biome kind of things in their stomach that no one else on the

89
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:35.260
planet has. So the translators explaining to me,

90
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.460
Canadian scientists like scientists come and literally steal their.

91
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.510
They find them in the Steelers. And I'm like, they're factual poop.

92
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.420
They're actually just to get their bio because there's biomes in there that

93
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:49.270
don't exist anywhere. Secret to a healthier,

94
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.640
they might have eaten in the Hadza diet.

95
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.300
I, if you Google steel African, I bet you it'll come up. See, look,

96
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.200
there it is. So this, see the bees on his head.

97
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.410
They're lightened them up and he's eating the honey and it does nothing to him

98
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.610
really? So we go climbing, Hey, come on.

99
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.310
Columbia tree guy sticks his hand in the tree, scoops that out,

100
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.260
starts eating it. Like it's a hamburger bees. And I'm like, bro, I'm cool.

101
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.740
No, no, no. Come on, come on. Like, we've been doing this, a kid doing this,

102
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:24.350
right. The kids I go in one stink.

103
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.370
<v 3>My hand inflates to like a Mickey mouse.</v>

104
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.460
<v 4>Like I'm like.</v>

105
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.130
<v 1>You've been getting stung since you were a kid.</v>

106
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:37.250
So you're like immune to it and they're just.

107
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.820
<v 2>Doesn't bother them. It doesn't bother them. Yeah. They're,</v>

108
00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:43.120
they're fine with it. And their body has also gotten immune to it. Right.

109
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.910
That's crazy to bite in that honeycomb.

110
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:49.600
Like it's a snack and all those bees around his head, his hands.

111
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.190
<v 1>And the thing you never see in all the national geographics and all the nature</v>

112
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:58.030
documentaries is that it's always serious.

113
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.480
And here's the Hahn Hadza warrior. And here's, you know, whatever Nate,

114
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.620
these guys crack, you know, they're like, do you want,

115
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.740
do you want to come with us tomorrow?

116
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:08.410
Like none of your eating cliff bars and hanging back, like, do you want it?

117
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.920
I'm like, yeah, I'm in, okay. We leave at first, you know the second,

118
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:14.140
how are they saying this all to you? I have the translator with me.

119
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.800
He like works with them in the, you know,

120
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.960
it's like worst case scenario when they D they don't do food. This,

121
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:26.350
this is the sad part. They do the fake show for the tourists.

122
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.190
Like the tourists come in, usually European. And then they put on the fake.

123
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.390
It's not fake. It's real.

124
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:35.740
But they dress up and do like dances and stuff and they give them money. Um,

125
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.090
so I wake up at 5, 5 30 first noise,

126
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.550
and then laughter, I'm like, are these doing fart jokes at five in the morning?

127
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.530
And that's the thing that people don't realize is when you don't have TV,

128
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.150
internet entertainment,

129
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:55.870
and you're just with your family and your homeys all day, you're bored as.

130
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.950
So they joke morning till night. Like, I don't know what they're saying.

131
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.810
Laughter laughter someone cuts a fart joke and I'm like, all right,

132
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:09.610
let's go. So you saw the pictures, they're ripped back muscles, six packs.

133
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:13.450
The kids have six packs. I was very out of shape. I'm still out of shape,

134
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.740
but that was the most out of shape.

135
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.770
And think about waking up at five 30 in the morning and the thing

136
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:25.480
that's the final animal that's like kind of left is baboons. They call it,

137
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:29.020
they almost call them in, in that part of Africa. Like the baboon men,

138
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.360
because that's what they eat. Tastes horrible to me. Baboons look human.

139
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:40.030
So we're in a cave, men sleeping on the top bed, women on the bottom,

140
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.500
we wake up, there's another cave. And you see, oh there's people in that cave.

141
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.400
No they're baboons. And they're pointing at us. They're pointing. They're like,

142
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:52.420
look, they're coming. So I'm like, this is crazy. We're hunting baboons.

143
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.620
They're like, there's tons of meat on them.

144
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:55.470
We're gonna it's enough to feed our family.

145
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.340
Think about like running again.

146
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.390
I was pretty run fast in high school. I could do the 50 pretty quick.

147
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.740
I can't run at top speed for hours. And I, and I got these

148
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.210
I'm drinking water. And in this environment,

149
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:15.120
it's an advantage to have black skin. Cause it's cooling.

150
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.360
These guys aren't sweating. I'm like, what's going on?

151
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:19.740
We've been running for five hours.

152
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:22.920
You guys aren't sweating the and they don't get tired.

153
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.580
And then they'll just start digging a hole and drink like re like a handful of

154
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:31.170
brown water and that's enough for them. And I'm like, dude, what the?

155
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.500
Like I, and they're telling the translator,

156
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.590
this looks like he's never caught anything in his life. And he's like,

157
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:41.910
he hasn't. And to me, I'm an alien, right? They go,

158
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:44.670
he gets his food from supermarkets. What's that?

159
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.730
<v 0>They hunt the food for him.</v>

160
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.660
<v 1>They cut it up and package it and sell it. Like they don't believe it. Right.</v>

161
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.220
The I tell them, they're like, Hey, you guys, you look like a supermodel.

162
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.510
Can I bring you to America and do a fashion thing and get you guys paid and why

163
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:03.420
would we want to go to America? What w tell me what you know about America.

164
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.910
Isn't that the place where people jump off buildings to kill themselves.

165
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.650
Like that concept is so foreign that when someone explained suicide to them,

166
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.430
I was like, oh.

167
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.300
<v 0>My God, they don't. And in, in the time that I'm there.</v>

168
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.030
<v 1>Like I said, that first week is withdrawal.</v>

169
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.290
<v 0>I'm like, where's my phone.</v>

170
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.920
<v 1>And then all of it goes away, right?</v>

171
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.840
I'm not thinking about any of my addictions. I'm not thinking about like,

172
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.290
I feel peace. I'm not, I'm not miserable.

173
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:39.150
My depression goes away and I go morning till night,

174
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.310
you wake up, you hunt for food, you get home celebration.

175
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.340
Everyone's happy that the men brought the food back. The women, you know,

176
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.080
gathered the berries. We have a big dinner celebration. Cause every meal,

177
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:54.810
you gotta be grateful for dance party by the fire.

178
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.840
And you're out couple of fart jokes and you're out repeat the next day.

179
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:01.920
There's no time to be like bored and sad and upset

180
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.290
and worried about some. And so I'm trying to keep up with these guys,

181
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.860
you know, they're, they're running at top speed. Like say this is, um,

182
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.400
say these are the baboons on top of the bed. They're doing a perimeter.

183
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.450
They're doing okay. We're going to come up all the sides. And the, and the,

184
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.820
and the dogs are on the forefront. Right? They're running faster.

185
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.560
There's a guy named Allah, Allah on a, he's got some dreads. He's uh,

186
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.070
he's the village, the tribe we pothead.

187
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.130
He's got the Bible. He's rolling joints for everyone.

188
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.290
He's about 50 feet behind, you know, he's running at like, uh,

189
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.960
he's not doing this. He's like, he's got,

190
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.730
I'm maybe like two, 300 feet behind this guy.

191
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.270
So they're, they're trying to like, you know, come on.

192
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:51.660
So he's running and rolling joints. He's writing rolling joints. And

193
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.290
had you done any running before this? Not really, man. I'm a sprinter. I,

194
00:11:57.291 --> 00:12:00.370
I don't, I can't, I don't have any sense that you're doing this for our, my God.

195
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:03.670
I almost blacked out. How many miles you think you were running, dude?

196
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.660
Cause they're, they're like going back and forth. We're like, I'm like, dude,

197
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:10.780
I'm just going to chill here. They just run everywhere, run everywhere,

198
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.320
just running. And you know, they don't, some of them have shoes.

199
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:15.700
Like they make homemade shoes,

200
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:19.840
but some of them don't so that it's just barefoot and I'm there run. It's the,

201
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.980
it's the dry Bush. Right? So there's like plants that have like thorns and like,

202
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.090
it looks like this on them. Just like that. White scratch to me.

203
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:32.620
I'm getting cut open. I'm like bleeding everywhere. They're skin's tough.

204
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.130
And they're just, they're just clowning me. They're clowning me.

205
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:40.750
<v 4>They're like, bro, how did you ever survive? And I'm like, I'm like,</v>

206
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:44.170
come on, come on guys. I put a GoPro on the dog.

207
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.900
<v 1>So I go back and I watch it. The baboons is like a human,</v>

208
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.070
like it's talking, get.

209
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.840
<v 4>The away from me. away. The bathroom's running the dog. [inaudible] he's like,</v>

210
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.060
you. They hunt them with dogs.

211
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.840
<v 1>He gets hit right here. Just bleeding. So he's leaving a trail of blood,</v>

212
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.250
hypes up the tribe. Let's call it where we got him. He's hit. The dog,

213
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:11.080
gets his nut sack, rips his Dick off. I'm running. The guy holds up his nuts.

214
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.600
He's like, look, we got the nuts. And I'm like, why are you showing me that?

215
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:15.250
He's like, he's, we're getting close.

216
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.480
They finally hit the guy, like sort of here. And in the end you're saying the.

217
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.620
<v 2>Guy too, you're not just saying the baboons.</v>

218
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.310
You're saying it hit the guy. It looks human, man. God, it does. Right.

219
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.600
It looks real close. He backs into a tree like a dog human though. Yeah.

220
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.380
<v 1>And all the dogs, the dogs are dope. I love these dogs so much.</v>

221
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.140
They're all hunting dogs.

222
00:13:39.141 --> 00:13:42.900
So they all have scars and tales missing. Like,

223
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.160
cause the baboons have fangs. They pick the dogs up and they rip a chunk off.

224
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.880
Oh my God.

225
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.660
And these dogs are so hardcore that there's a dog that had one leg missing.

226
00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:54.540
There's a dog that you could see his ribs and they're still down to hunt.

227
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.420
I'm like, like they're in the back with me. But there's still like, I,

228
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.810
I want to show value that, you know, cause I, I talked,

229
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.970
I interviewed each person in the tribe and I said,

230
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.350
what is the happiest day of your life? And they all had the same answer.

231
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.890
The day that I haunted the biggest animal and I got to feed everyone and I was

232
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:13.340
the hero. And so I'm like.

233
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.070
<v 2>All baboons for how long, how long have they been only hunting baboons.</v>

234
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.550
<v 1>I mean, it's been for a few years now. I mean, they they'll hunt anything.</v>

235
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.530
They'll kill anything. Right. There's nothing.

236
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.450
<v 2>Left. But baboons just recently.</v>

237
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.800
<v 1>It's getting to just that. And even, even then, cause this day, that,</v>

238
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.280
that day that I was on the first hunt, cause there was many days we hunted,

239
00:14:32.281 --> 00:14:35.610
where were, we didn't catch anything. And that's like super downer for them.

240
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.170
But this is my first hunt. I had the GoPro, the guy's shot.

241
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.840
He backs into a tree like his last stand and the dogs just start ripping his

242
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:50.760
guts out and start, you know, and I'm watching this and he's like,

243
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.860
and it's like, he's going.

244
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.710
<v 4>You. you. And he's just like, he's like.</v>

245
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.500
<v 1>Picking dogs up, throwing them. Oh my God.</v>

246
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:01.250
And then you just come up and they go right in his chest. He's dead.

247
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.190
This is all on GoPro. I wasn't even close.

248
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.710
<v 4>I was like, I was like, wait up guys.</v>

249
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.650
<v 1>They tie the, the foot and the leg and they make a backpack.</v>

250
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.500
That's how they carry it. So they caught for that day.

251
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.190
So they bring it back to the village. I don't know if you saw in that picture,

252
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:21.470
I brought my top ramen with me. So I was like,

253
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.900
they don't waste a part of this thing.

254
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.370
The person that killed it gets to eat the Dick in the balls. They eat the head,

255
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:32.600
they eat the brains, they turn the fur into like jackets and um.

256
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.330
<v 0>They just eat the brains dude.</v>

257
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.430
<v 1>So at night I thought, I thought dinner time was over. But think about it,</v>

258
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:44.570
how much protein and nutrition is in the brain. Right. And it's the final thing.

259
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:46.850
Right? They stew the head and it's in that pot.

260
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.280
And so the brain gets cooked and then it's like a delicacy at the end.

261
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.910
They like tap a hole in and it's, you know, they have black skin.

262
00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.020
Like I remember like it was fire. It was in the cave. It's nighttime.

263
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.920
And I hear, are you just here eating?

264
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:08.300
And I turned my flashlight on and I see like the whole tribe,

265
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.780
just showing the brains at the end. They're like, this is our favorite part.

266
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.320
And then for the end. Yeah. And they're just like split. And then,

267
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:19.490
so it's all this white brains like streaked on their face and I'm like, yo,

268
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.680
you want to get on this? Give me some of that brain.

269
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.050
So I had some brain and I eat everything. I mean it's there it is.

270
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.570
Doesn't that look like a person that's so intense. So once the first is,

271
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.710
but not on the screen just no. Yeah, good. Uh, the,

272
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.140
the fur look, so this is

273
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.040
look, I have some trouble. This I'm just not going to for this. Okay.

274
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.370
Well let me just say this. If that's how hardcore this picture is, right.

275
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.100
You can find it. You can find it easily. Look for like, like you want to talk.

276
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.260
This is life or death. I understand. So when, when.

277
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.600
<v 2>But I'm saying, um, it is intense and there is a thing about primate brains,</v>

278
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.230
right? Um, prion, prion diseases. So you get, uh,

279
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.850
they find them in cannibals.

280
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.510
So there's something about eating a human smoking,

281
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:14.980
the way humans eating human brains. Oh, so they did get a bird there. Yeah.

282
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.900
So sometimes they get birds too. So I am, but they're eating mostly baboons.

283
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.060
<v 1>I tasted it. I wasn't eating it.</v>

284
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:26.770
I'm like I have a million Clif bars in my backpack. I know that is so intense.

285
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.633
There's the dogs.

286
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.780
<v 2>That guy carry a, a baboon on his back. Like the way you were describing,</v>

287
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.830
it's so intense.

288
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.410
<v 0>Or they got a, some.</v>

289
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:36.730
<v 2>Sort of an antelope or something there.</v>

290
00:17:36.731 --> 00:17:40.840
And then they drink and all of that water. But how can we with the Bible dude?

291
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.220
<v 4>We could just go.</v>

292
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.670
<v 1>Um, so I'm, I, I pass out,</v>

293
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.030
there's nothing left in the gas tank I pass out and the next day I'm like, okay,

294
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.010
like, like I'm becoming a man. They're like, did.

295
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.290
<v 2>You eat the actual Baboo in meters?</v>

296
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.430
<v 1>Yeah. I hate the bamboo and meat. It's not for me. It's and I eat everything.</v>

297
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.930
What it tastes like. I've never eaten a human,

298
00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:05.780
but I'm imagining that's what a human would taste like. It was just,

299
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.940
I don't know, gamey that's the only it's it was just, it was strong.

300
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.220
But uh, um, well you.

301
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.090
<v 2>Got to think of the physical strength of those animals to help their.</v>

302
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.690
<v 1>Maintenance and all the testosterone and everything is being released though.</v>

303
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.210
It didn't taste good, but loved it.
