00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 1>Experience. People don't remember bill gates, the old bill gates, right.</v>

3
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.680
People see bill gates. Now I see bill gates now.

4
00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:12.640
And I see a guy who's wearing an outfit. He wears a outfit. Yeah. It's like,

5
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:16.200
he's got a, a it's like Spiderman. Like he puts on a Spiderman.

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.680
Like this is my really nice rich guy thing. I've got a sweater.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.070
It's a hundred degree outside.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.830
Why you got that sweater with a shirt underneath it.

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.750
<v 0>It's secretly ventilated and yeah.</v>

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.230
<v 1>Does he ever have a t-shirt on, does bill gates ever rock a tshirt?</v>

11
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.790
<v 0>I heard he had a house where when you walk into a room,</v>

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.470
it recognizes like how you like the temperature. Like you wear a band. Yes.

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.170
You a clip.

14
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.150
<v 1>You wear a clip.</v>

15
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.220
<v 0>A pin. It would change the temperature. It would make coffee that you like, da,</v>

16
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:46.180
da, da, da mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And I was like, my, I was single.

17
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:47.820
When I heard about this, I was like, I wish I had that.

18
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.700
Cause that's how the girl would know it was over. Like she &lt;laugh&gt; it's cold.

19
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.180
Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; change the settings.

20
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.460
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. You walk in changes. The artwork flips over. Right.</v>

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.850
<v 0>Right. But uh, I mean, yeah. I, he called this though.</v>

22
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:07.050
He called I, we weren't ready for pandemic like years ago. So 15.

23
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.170
<v 1>2015. Yeah. Yeah. So, well he set it up. He's he's the mastermind behind all.</v>

24
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:15.650
He he's like one of the Incredibles, like the, the bad guy and then grab, I, I,

25
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.570
I'm just confused by his outfit. Cause it's like,

26
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.130
he's dressing up like Mr. Rogers on purpose.

27
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.440
He wants you to think of him in a different way. He's a Savage.

28
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.440
<v 0>Man. He's.</v>

29
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.640
<v 1>Savage. Most ruthless when he was running Microsoft.</v>

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.200
That's why Microsoft got so huge. Right? They would take no prisoners.

31
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720
Businessmen. Yes. Take no prisoners. Yeah.

32
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.520
<v 0>He's he's but he's pretending like he's, you know, I kind of love that though.</v>

33
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.390
Like when people, um, cuz you just have to know how to look for it, right? Yeah.

34
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.550
Like, like I don't, I don't trust anybody that doesn't cuss on stage. You know,

35
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.110
those is like, something's going on? Right?

36
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.430
<v 1>Like those, the ones who do freaky. Oh yeah. Ball gags and stuff. Yes. Oh,</v>

37
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:57.870
look at that. Got a t-shirt there. Come on man. That's a,

38
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.230
a button up t-shirt with a collar. Everything has a collar though,

39
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.820
but that's a long time ago that looks like about 15 years old.

40
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.740
That's a nice crew.

41
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.020
<v 0>Though. Look at that crew. Why? And it's like, why is Lu Luta?</v>

42
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:10.580
Like the forest G of uh, he photos.

43
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.340
<v 1>This factor Luda took a factor after me. Like.</v>

44
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.300
<v 0>Where's that connection? Like.</v>

45
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.300
<v 1>They offered him a lot of money and he was like, I'll take it.</v>

46
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
They're teaching you about life because there's selling paper. Towels, woman.

47
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.450
<v 0>Is an engineer. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

48
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.770
<v 1>But that picture go back to that picture.</v>

49
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.090
I would feel so sold out if I was a guy and I was really into Brony.

50
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:36.010
Cause I kind of looked like the Brony guy and then I go and buy my Brony towels.

51
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.970
And there's three chicks. If you were still position,

52
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.240
if you felt like the Brony guy, but literally it's like didn't men. Okay.

53
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.280
The Brony guys at lumberjack,

54
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.840
I would assume most lumberjacks are, are,

55
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.640
are probably big strong men. You don't think he became a gay kind of icon.

56
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.073
I mean, I understand the,

57
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.600
the idea that they have three female lumberjacks three.

58
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.800
<v 2>Well you do the job of one man. &lt;laugh&gt; that was a lo you've.</v>

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.520
<v 1>Got a lo for.</v>

60
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.840
<v 2>The grand slam. He has to Jack the lumber of one full man.</v>

61
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.360
This is gonna take three of the strong ladies. It's just, what.

62
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.400
<v 1>Are the percentages of women that are lumberjacks?</v>

63
00:03:16.401 --> 00:03:18.280
And what's the likelihood of three of them being on a team.

64
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.390
<v 2>It looks in, in that picture, he looks like a guy who's about to take a along.</v>

65
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:22.790
And by the.

66
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.870
<v 1>Way, this is an ignorant question.</v>

67
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
I I'm aware if you're a female lumberjack and you're mad at me right now.

68
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.310
I'm sorry. I don't know anybody. That's a female lumberjack. I'm just ask,

69
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.950
just asking questions. They mean they're wearing lumberjack clothes.

70
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.630
That's what a lumber Jack wear. Assuming are you posing shirt? What is this?

71
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.100
<v 2>It's if you have it is stolen. It's.</v>

72
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.580
<v 1>Stolen valor. Is it stolen? Valor?</v>

73
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.780
Are you pretending you're out there carrying trees? You.

74
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.740
<v 2>Wearing a lumberjack shirt is stolen. Valor.</v>

75
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.140
<v 1>It's stolen valor. These aren't lumberjacks. These are models.</v>

76
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.940
These are hot chicks with nice nails.

77
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.300
They're not out there carrying trees and. You know.

78
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.220
<v 2>They could, by the way, they're not.</v>

79
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.650
You I'll tell you what the women that do do that job.

80
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.010
I promise they're not gonna put on the paper towel.

81
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.970
&lt;laugh&gt; there's you're right. They're gonna look like you. There's yeah.

82
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.930
Just put a wig on the guy. Look.

83
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.770
<v 1>At that one. Lady with her sleeves rolled up. Are you about to go to work?</v>

84
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.370
Look at her, go to that picture, click on that. She's got this really thin body.

85
00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:21.200
These really thin arms. And she's got her sleeves rolled up with a flan shirt,

86
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:24.480
flannel shirt on in front of a bunch of trees. Are you about to chop trees down?

87
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:28.160
Ma'am because you weigh 90 pounds. Even if the.

88
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.841
<v 2>Outta the way of those, those trees.</v>

89
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.360
I think the idea is to make you think that you feel like a lumberjack while

90
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.720
you're wiping your counter down is the, is what they're.

91
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.080
<v 1>Trying to do.</v>

92
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.680
I think we need to be more respectful about what the it means to be a

93
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:39.600
lumberjack. I would think you would,

94
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.350
you would think that that I would be romantic until you did that job.

95
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.390
Eight hours a day, five days a week.

96
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.870
And your body's broken down cuz you're carrying logs on your shoulder and.

97
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.110
You're chopping at trees. Oh.

98
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.190
<v 2>My God. Was your father a lumberjack? Cause I was very, this.</v>

99
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.030
<v 1>Is what I feel. You can't pretend you're a lumberjack.</v>

100
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.740
You can't take a hot model and cover a face with little bit of coal powder and

101
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.460
pretend she's a coal miner in West Virginia getting black lung.

102
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.460
You can't cuz she's not.

103
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.500
I'm thrilled by the fact that this whole system gets thrown into a,

104
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.780
just a, a blender and spun around and no one knows what's gonna get spit out.

105
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.740
And a lot of these people they're getting,

106
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:24.690
you're getting really clear reveal that they're frauds these people

107
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:29.290
that are in positions of leadership or bizarre human beings that don't even

108
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.570
live in reality.

109
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.610
Like I was watching Nancy Pelosi trying to dance her way outta saying that in

110
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.770
February, she was telling people to go to Chinatown, hang out, have a good time.

111
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:41.570
Don't worry about it. Like, like you were doing the same thing.

112
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:46.080
You're accused the president of doing you're accusing Trump of not warning

113
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.280
people. Well you didn't warn anybody either.

114
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.120
Everyone's playing gotcha with this. Nobody saw what the was coming.

115
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.320
Like I said, the world health organization in a tweet was saying,

116
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.320
it can't be transmitted from person to person mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that?

117
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.480
No one knew mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so this is all this chaos of all these people

118
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:09.040
getting revealed. I like it. Yeah. I like it.

119
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:11.200
There's part of it that I like. I enjoy because I understand,

120
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:12.120
understand that one,

121
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.310
one thing that we have above all the people that live before us is that

122
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:19.590
we have more access to information. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we,

123
00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:22.590
we see the flaws better. We see the flaws better.

124
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.470
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whereas before we were lied to and,

125
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.030
now you can see it better. It doesn't mean those flaws aren't gonna exist,

126
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.030
but those people are gonna have to be, they're gonna have to be authentic.

127
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.150
They're not authentic right now. Like when you see someone,

128
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.180
the record will show that I was there in Chinatown to tell people to not

129
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:43.900
be racist, the record will show you can't do that anymore.

130
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.020
You can't do that anymore. We demand you be authentic.

131
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.260
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and if you made a mistake like that, like in February,

132
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.861
look, man,

133
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.580
if you were hanging out with me in February and we were barbecuing and I'd be

134
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.020
like, it's probably like the flu people are gonna get sick. They're gonna die.

135
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.450
I'm not a expert. Okay. I'm not a politician. And if I said that, I'd be like,

136
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.650
man, was I wrong? Here's why I thought that. Here's what I wouldn't say.

137
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.850
The record will show the reason why I said that is I wanted you to not be racist

138
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.810
to Chinese people. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, if you believe that,

139
00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:15.610
like this is like some intricate plot to that.

140
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.880
Nancy Pelosi had to sort of stop against Chinese people like

141
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.520
nonsense. Right? You were talking and the world changed.

142
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.080
And it was the same as like, was it the secretary of health in New York city?

143
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.600
Who was it that was telling people to go out, take the subway.

144
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.160
I forget who it was. But there was this lady, like she made a bad call. Right?

145
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.320
But nobody knew the world health.

146
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:39.350
Organization's telling people it can't be transmitted from her a person at one

147
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.910
point in time, no one knew it's a new thing. You know, were mistakes made.

148
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.590
Of course they're made, this is in who's the perfect person in real time,

149
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.270
in the middle of a pandemic crisis, that person doesn't exist.

150
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.990
They don't have access to the information to make perfect decisions.

151
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:55.830
You have to have all the information was some of it ignored. Yeah.

152
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.390
Because it was conflicting information.

153
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.740
So it has to be sifted through his hydroxychloroquine turns out that stuff kills

154
00:08:01.741 --> 00:08:04.700
more people than not using it. Yeah. Oops. Yeah. Whoops. That's.

155
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.980
<v 3>Not good. And so the whole pandemic, this is a conspiracy theory. Not real.</v>

156
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.060
The whole pandemic was a plan to get people to go

157
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.860
inside, store up foods,

158
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.170
get 'em off the roads and like wait for this, whatever this event is to pass.

159
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.250
And as soon as the event passes, you'll, you'll find that it's,

160
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.210
it's all of a sudden, it's like, what do you know? The,

161
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.930
the curves are all dropping off. What do you know? And then we'll all be back.

162
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.210
Because the thing that we're worried about didn't happen also could be a test

163
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.010
for, for that. So that.

164
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.250
<v 1>Can I just stop you? Cause it's so dumb. It's hard to believe. Thank you.</v>

165
00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:44.080
There's a real old virus. They can, they can cute. I know they can image it.

166
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.840
I, I, but I, you know what? It looks like they they've,

167
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:49.560
they've been able to test for it. Antibodies. I.

168
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.560
<v 3>Feel like a virus. I feel like I'm talking to my wife. It's.</v>

169
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.480
<v 1>A real virus. It's a confusing virus. It's.</v>

170
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.680
<v 3>So good that I married the person I'm married because if not,</v>

171
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.840
like I would probably be like digging a hole to like crawl into,

172
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.120
out of pure paranoia. Cuz she does do this to me. She's like Duncan.

173
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.920
Do you think there isn't a COVID virus?

174
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.240
Like you think there's no virus out there. Do you think that like maybe like,

175
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.470
so all the scientists that have identify COVID are all part of this thing to

176
00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:21.510
keep us from the meteor thing. And then I'm like, yeah, yeah you're thank you.

177
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.790
Because like I'll start getting freaked out from it.

178
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.670
But I'll answer your question. Like if I had to answer that, I would say, oh no,

179
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.350
it's real. I.

180
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.350
<v 1>Mean that many people died from it. No. What is the, uh,</v>

181
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:36.260
current COVID death count 50,000 today this morning, 50,000.

182
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.180
Here's something that I found out.

183
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:42.860
That's kind of odd if you die of something else. So people are still dying,

184
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:47.020
right? They're still dying of high blood pressure, strokes, heart attacks,

185
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:48.580
still kill, killing more people than anything. Right?

186
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.660
If you die of a heart attack and you have COVID you get listed as a COVID death.

187
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.450
So even if you're gonna die of a heart attack, I mean, people are still dying.

188
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:59.810
Right? Same, same amount of people other than traffic accidents,

189
00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:02.570
which I think have, has diminished quite a bit. Cuz no one's driving. Yep.

190
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.850
But the, uh, same, those people are gonna die still.

191
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.450
It's not like they live forever without the COVID right.

192
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.690
It's not like they don't get the flu. It's not like they don't get a cold.

193
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.970
It's not like they don't get pneumonia.

194
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.970
All these things exist with or without COVID there's still people,

195
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.160
people are still dying from 'em.

196
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.000
But if you die of one of those things and you have COVID you're,

197
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:22.280
it's a COVID death. Yeah.

198
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.030
So for some that's why it's so crazy. It's like,

199
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.510
you don't really know what, how many people are actually getting this thing,

200
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.620
this COVID and having a mild reaction. How many people are having no reaction,

201
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.060
how many people are dying, right?

202
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:42.900
Like what is the that's when they did that new UCLA study that came out that

203
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:45.460
showed they think there's way more people that have been,

204
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.180
they think California alone is somewhere around 400,000 people being infected.

205
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.580
And so the fatality rate is still pretty low, but if that's the case,

206
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.290
like, so what do we do? We just let, let people die.

207
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.890
Or do we do this every time the flu comes around too now?

208
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:05.770
Like what if we get a particularly rough flu or is this a practice run for what

209
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:07.290
we're gonna do every time colds come through.
