00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.511
<v 2>It's a,</v>

3
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:08.070
it's a strange time when it comes to the reality of the differences between

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.900
genders. It's a very strange time because it doesn't, it doesn't like,

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.740
no one's ever said like men are better than women or women are better than men.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.670
We're just different things. And transgender people are different as well.

7
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:21.840
It's all, we're all just different.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.960
We should be accepting of each other and loving of each other and give each

9
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.600
other equal rights and laws and, and respect.

10
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.770
But when it comes to athletics is a reason why men don't compete against women.

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.780
And I had this bizarre conversation with this guy once who has this TV show,

12
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:37.980
where he kind of debunks things.

13
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:42.420
But when I got them alone to talk about these things without a team of writers,

14
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:47.250
when you leave someone to just their opinions and he had

15
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.450
these sort of very progressive talking points that he would kind of blurred out.

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530
But then when I started challenging him on these and going deep,

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.810
you realize like he didn't really think about this.

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.350
He just wanted a peer that he was progressive, which I am.

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.350
I am a progressive person. I know I look like a meathead,

20
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.070
but I'm very progressive. I just look at reality though.

21
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.250
I grew up with martial arts and with fighting,

22
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.350
and I know there's a radical difference between males and females. It's radical.

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.300
It's not, it's not small. It's not subtle. It's radical.

24
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.150
<v 1>When your physical strength, physical.</v>

25
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.590
<v 0>Strength in violence and psychology and attitude.</v>

26
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.950
And in competitiveness, it's radical.

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.840
There's a radical difference.

28
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.970
And also there's a spectrum and some people are far more feminine

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.340
than they are masculine and they happen to have penises.

30
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.310
And some women are far more masculine than there are feminine.

31
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.610
They have to have vaginas, but it doesn't change the norm.

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.870
<v 2>It doesn't change.</v>

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.230
And it certainly doesn't change on the high ends of the spectrums.

34
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.060
That's really the high ends of the spectrum.

35
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.430
So it's ultra female versus ultra male.

36
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.770
You're looking at two radically different things.

37
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.690
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And I like really like what you said about,</v>

38
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.960
I am getting emotional again. Um,

39
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.540
I like what you said about just accepting and understanding each other.

40
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.910
That to me, you don't have to accept bad behavior.

41
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:19.980
You don't have to accept hurtful behavior,

42
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.850
but it does help us to really work hard to understand it. So,

43
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:28.350
and those are the extremes of behavior. Um, but you're right. We're different.

44
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.130
<v 2>And I think it's interesting and it's exciting the way that we're different,</v>

45
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:36.450
the ways that we're different and testosterone really does help to explain so

46
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.680
many of those differences.

47
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:41.820
So understanding that hormone helps us understand each other. And I wanted,

48
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.990
it helped me,

49
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.560
even though I have been teaching about this stuff for ages writing the book and

50
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:51.540
especially reading about the transgender experience has helped me to

51
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.160
have sort of this apifany so you can see how emotional I am, right?

52
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.200
<v 1>I'm like ultra emotional.</v>

53
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.160
My husband is a British philosopher and he is

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.370
not, uh, he doesn't get angry.

55
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.530
He doesn't really express a lot,

56
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.690
a huge range of emotion. He's a wonderful guy and I love him,

57
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.770
but I've always kind of picked on him and thought there was something wrong with

58
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.560
him for not being more emotional,

59
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.580
not being able to have these long conversations about emotions and

60
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.330
psychology and what, and what happened in his childhood to make him like that.

61
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.530
<v 2>And I have a temper, he doesn't have a temper,</v>

62
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.980
I can cry during lecture and can't even, and cry at home. And, you know,

63
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.650
can barely control that my epiphany was,

64
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.910
I'm not better than he is because I'm so in touch with my emotions.

65
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:46.870
I have issues like he probably has issues too,

66
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:51.580
but he doesn't have to come to be closer to me in my way of being in the

67
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:52.360
world.

68
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.840
<v 1>I need to work on accepting who he is. He's an awesome guy.</v>

69
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.810
And I was always trying to get him to be more like me.

70
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.340
And I think women really want men if they're in

71
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.290
heterosexual relationships, um, to be more like them emotionally,

72
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.260
but I had this epiphany, like no it's working out and,

73
00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:16.720
and our marriage would be better if I just shut up about some of the,

74
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.150
getting him to be more emotional all the time.

75
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.310
I need to take the gifts that he's giving me.

76
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.750
And I have to look at myself and where my emotionality, which I'm, you know,

77
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.800
getting emotional again. Um, but that was all through learning about like,

78
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.270
learning more about this hormone and what it does. It's just who he is as a man.

79
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.390
It's not that all men are that way. Right. But it did help me.

80
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.960
Just the understanding helps us to accept each other.

81
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.830
And that's sort of one larger point in the book that I don't try to make so

82
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:48.040
explicitly, but I hope that, um, and again,

83
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.560
I don't mean we have to accept bad behavior,

84
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.970
but we can try to understand these extremes of male behavior that are disturbing

85
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.670
and more disturbing than extremes of female behavior. You know,

86
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:02.590
I can cry and have a fit, but I'm not raping anybody. Um,

87
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.370
well, because that's an extreme of,

88
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.240
that's a bad extreme of male behavior that we need to understand,

89
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.890
but let's understand where that's coming from.

90
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:13.180
Instead of shutting down the conversation or shaming men for just being men who

91
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:15.910
are all men are being blamed for the extremes of male behavior,

92
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.090
they that's ridiculous. In my view.
