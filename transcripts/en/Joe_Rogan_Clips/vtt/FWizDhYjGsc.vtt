1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But, but I think what's interesting is like,</v>

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.160
that kind of stuff is so much less

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.640
satisfying that to bring it back to like what you do than like something that

4
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.520
you have to really work for. And it's really difficult.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.320
And it's a very visceral,

6
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.070
real feel like the feeling of accomplishment you get when you do something

7
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:26.390
virtual will never be able to compare right. With the,

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
the feeling that you do when you do a, a physical visceral thing. Right.

9
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:32.590
When it, you feel it in your bones.

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 1>Yeah. You feel it, you live it. Yeah. I, I, uh,</v>

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.950
when I was doing world strongest, man, in botswan Africa,

12
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.220
I tore my bicep and, um, I, I just was getting beat up over and over again.

13
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.540
I was just so wrecked. My body wasn't accepting. Cause I,

14
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.940
I went from football to strong men and in football, we'd never done deadlifts.

15
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.180
It was all hand cleans and power cleans, which by the way,

16
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:57.180
just quick little tip deadlifts. If you're, if you're deadlift to be a better,

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.260
deadlifter fine. If you're not doing that for deadlifts sake, then don't do it.

18
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.850
The risk to reward ratio is a joke for deadlifts, for deadlifts, really.

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.970
And a lot of people aren't gonna like that. I'm saying that,

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.730
but if you go into any NFL, uh, gym in any division,

21
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.890
one college football gym in any athletics where people are actually getting paid

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.610
and it matters what they're doing, they're not,

23
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:19.450
deadlifting really they're hand cleaning and power cleaning. Why is that?

24
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:22.520
Because the, the risk to reward ratio, like we there's,

25
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.360
it's so hard to be a great deadlifter and to not risk your low back and oh,

26
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.840
to, to be using your upper back properly. And you know, just,

27
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:35.160
there's so many little, uh, um, chances for you to get hurt. You know,

28
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.720
hamsting's deadlift. That was, that was me. Uh, my first world strongest, man,

29
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.480
uh, I was the only rookie in the finals, bro. She.

30
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.630
<v 0>How much.</v>

31
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.190
<v 1>Weight is that? That was 880 pounds, 400 kids.</v>

32
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.830
Me and my pink chucks. And you're, I weigh less than that.

33
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:54.350
Now I'm less of a bowling ball though. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.870
<v 0>Wow. That, well, they made those weights ridiculous looking too.</v>

35
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.790
<v 1>Right? Well, none that right there is, uh, something we overhead pressed too.</v>

36
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.140
So they'll take some of the weights out of it and it's so flimsy when you clean

37
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:07.450
it,

38
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.580
it's like basically like holding that earthquake bar that you have out there.

39
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.340
Oh really? It's just like that. And it's, it's brutal.

40
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.900
<v 0>So they take weight out of that round thing. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:17.460
Like what is in that round thing? There's.

42
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.260
<v 1>Well, there's several different attachments to it.</v>

43
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.100
So maybe some of them way different. I've never like been a part of that,

44
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:23.970
but uh, like even to that,

45
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:26.650
or it unscrews at the end and they take weights out of it and I'm not.

46
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.290
<v 0>Positive. Exactly. What, so you leave the NFL or you leave playing football.</v>

47
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.450
Yeah. And you, were you in the.

48
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.650
<v 1>NFL? No, I had a brief shot at it. Never, never actually got to do it. No,</v>

49
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.550
it was.

50
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.250
<v 0>So what, what kind of transition,</v>

51
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.130
like what is the transition to getting the strong.

52
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.000
<v 1>Man went from that to, uh, I was a security guard at, in Santa Cruz.</v>

53
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.000
There's this place called the catalyst,

54
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.160
which is where I worked for like six years.

55
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.360
It's a really cool bar slash concert venue. So I was like, spoiled.

56
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:56.160
I got to hang out with Rob zombie and Willie Wilson and. Yeah. It was cool, man.

57
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.720
Wow. I was spoiled. Rob zombie. I geeked out really hard for that's dope. It.

58
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.720
<v 0>Was fun. Yeah. We're working on.</v>

59
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.760
<v 1>Getting him here, dude. He'd be awesome. He'd be awesome. Sure. Yeah, sure.</v>

60
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.600
He would be yeah. Yeah. He was really cool.

61
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.560
<v 0>I'm I'm sure he is like, he's really in horror movies.</v>

62
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.160
<v 1>Man, dude. And he does the best ones. Yeah. I love his horror movies, man.</v>

63
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.120
They're wild. I'm a huge fan. Huge fan.

64
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.960
He's like the quinin Tarantino of horror. Yeah. It's awesome.

65
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.550
<v 0>But it's such a weird transit, you know? Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.830
Guy going from being a rockstar to a horror film director, he's.

67
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.630
<v 1>Just crazy in the head and his brother is actually the lead singer of Powerman</v>

68
00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:28.670
5,000. Really? Yeah. Oh wow.

69
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.510
<v 0>So in the.</v>

70
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.343
<v 1>Family,</v>

71
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.150
so did I went to security and I was working there and a buddy of mine who I'd

72
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.230
played junior college ball with was just obsessed with strong men.

73
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.500
And I I'd never heard of it. I never wore watched it.

74
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:41.060
Like when I was growing up, we were poor.

75
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:44.860
Like there was 10 of us in a three bedroom house and from high school on like,

76
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.780
we didn't have electricity. So like, like we didn't watch TV. We,

77
00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:50.420
we would play outside. We had a trampoline.

78
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.700
<v 0>You didn't have electricity.</v>

79
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.020
<v 1>In high school. On the weekends.</v>

80
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.940
My dad worked for caterpillar Cashman equipment.

81
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.380
So on the weekends he'd bring home a little generator and he'd plug that in and

82
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:01.290
we'd have like three things we could use, but that was it. Wow.

83
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.250
Like the hot water heater would work for the weekend.

84
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.770
And then like maybe the TV on Saturday night or something like T G I F or

85
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:11.450
something. But I mean, it wasn't, I mean, as a kid, it's not that big of a deal,

86
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.730
you know? Like you just go play with your brothers outside. Right. So,

87
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.010
but like I never knew what strong man was because of that. I mean,

88
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.080
I had no idea, so he was obsessed with it and he kept trying to get me to do it.

89
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.840
And then, uh, went, went home and Googled it, checked it out. Actually,

90
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:29.680
I don't know if it was Google. I'm not a YouTube dude back then, who was,

91
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.920
who knows what we had. But um, you know, I,

92
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.840
I was excited and went and tried it out.

93
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:39.800
And first day the amateur world record at log

94
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:44.470
press was like 320 pounds at the time. And I, I had no idea,

95
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.550
but the first day I hit 330 pounds and just put it down.

96
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.070
And I looked over my buddy and I was like, you know, how'd that look?

97
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:53.990
And he's like, get the outta here. &lt;laugh&gt; and like,

98
00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:58.230
he's been trying his whole life to do this. &lt;laugh&gt; just came in and took it.

99
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.390
And then, uh, eight months later, I mean,

100
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.940
six months that I was competing in England and I had my pro card two months

101
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:08.140
after that, I was in China at that photo right there, world strongest, man.

102
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.540
I was the only rookie in the finals.

103
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.300
<v 0>So is it the log thing? Is it the,</v>

104
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.220
the awkwardness of like holding onto a log and getting it under your hands.

105
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.900
<v 1>And yeah. And it's, it's actually,</v>

106
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.620
it's a lot healthier for your shoulders instead of being, uh,

107
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.770
how would you call that with your hands right there? The proneated.

108
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.170
<v 0>Or sonated yeah. Yeah. I dunno if, forget which one is which we, the worst,</v>

109
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.490
I like it when trainers use that though, like, oh, you.

110
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.330
<v 1>Know what? You're talking about this guy's got his together,</v>

111
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.610
this fat dude eating French fries. &lt;laugh&gt; so, um, yeah. I mean, um,

112
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.450
so it's better for you to do it.

113
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.210
It's much better for your wrist and your shoulders makes sense. And,

114
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.970
and also like that's what my Eric.

115
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.280
<v 0>Coast, Jamie show us proated grip, grip. Sonated grip.</v>

116
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.160
<v 1>Yeah. Neutral grip is much better for your wrists than shoulders. Mm.</v>

117
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.480
<v 0>Okay. Like, so handles like this. They say that with bench press as well. Yeah.</v>

118
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.400
Like those, uh, benches, they have new bars that have handle.

119
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 1>The bars from rogue. Yeah. Yeah. Those.</v>

120
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 0>Are dope. Awesome. Awesome. Rogue makes good equipment. Yeah. I use all their,</v>

121
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.373
my house. And here,

122
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.160
I know I was looking and then they don't pay me and it's not free.

123
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.480
I buy all of it. Same.

124
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.880
<v 1>Here. I don't work with 'em either, but they're the best. Yeah. It's the best.</v>

125
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.440
So, um, I, we went to worlds and then, oh yeah, I was,

126
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.000
I totally lost the whole getting. And.

127
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.590
<v 0>So you won, first of all, you beat the world record log, press the.</v>

128
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.270
<v 1>World record amateur amateur record ever. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

129
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.790
<v 0>Your first attempt.</v>

130
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.190
<v 1>That's hilarious. Yeah. So it was good. My,</v>

131
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.550
and then what's the pro record right now. The,

132
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.470
the American record's been mine for four years and that was 211 kilos.

133
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.060
And that's what is that four 60 something like that?

134
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.780
Is this you here? This is me. Yeah. This is in Australia. In front of Arnold.

135
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.103
Jesus Christ.

136
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.700
<v 0>That's.</v>

137
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700
<v 1>Arnold was there. Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.533
<v 0>That's his show.</v>

139
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.820
<v 1>That's his competition. This is my competition.</v>

140
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.420
<v 0>This is, so this is a log press.</v>

141
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.780
<v 1>Right here. Yep. That's a skinny log too. This was a hard log to use. But, uh,</v>

142
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:00.810
this was a buddy of mine had that record and he passed away and I wanted to be

143
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:04.210
the one to take it from him after he had dead. And that, that was this moment.

144
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.890
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

145
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.410
<v 1>That looks heavy. You show me, show off a little bit too.</v>

146
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.130
I like to do this after I get it up.

147
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.250
<v 0>Wow. So that's the world record?</v>

148
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.810
<v 1>Myamerican record. Who's the world record the world record.</v>

149
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.240
I like to hold it up there and talk. &lt;laugh&gt; every time you see a record broken,

150
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.680
the guy gets it to here and then he just throws it down. Right? I don't count.

151
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.440
It doesn't count. So the world record is, uh,

152
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.680
219 kilos. I believe something like that. Something,

153
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:36.200
something right around there. It might have been 2, 2 20.

154
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.910
How close are are you to that? I can, I can break right now. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,

155
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.830
in January break that. Robert, I'm going to London.

156
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.870
&lt;laugh&gt; I'm gonna give London a little introduction to Texas. Uh, uh,

157
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.630
what do you call Texas pride and Texas powerlifton for sure. Wow. I'm excited.

158
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.630
<v 0>So you go and you break the American amateur record right away. Right? First,</v>

159
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.420
first attempt out. And is that when you've felt like, I could do this. Yeah.

160
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.700
<v 1>I went home and uh, I told my, my, my fiance at the time we,</v>

161
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:09.300
we were living in a studio and we were just broke and I was volunteer coaching.

162
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.020
And I was, uh, for high school, which is my passion in high school football.

163
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.460
And then I was working at that club at night. So I didn't have a lot of time,

164
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.570
but I was like, I can make this. And like, with,

165
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.970
with my personality and this is a platform I can do this.

166
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.890
And everybody kept telling me there's no money in strong man. There isn't any,

167
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.570
and there really wasn't. There wasn't like,

168
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.130
there was no money in strong man until I made money in strong man,

169
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:36.370
like really brought it into, there was several other people. But like,

170
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:39.770
what we did was we cultivated a whole new era of strong man.

171
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.640
Whereas before like, even like pugenowski was a guy who got a lot of attention,

172
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.720
cuz he looked just shreded yeah. You know, jacked. But I mean, if you,

173
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.480
if you he's got like a cribs episode that they did in Poland and he's got this

174
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:55.560
tiny little house with like little knickknacks and stuff, he's so proud of.

175
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.200
It's really weird. It's crazy. But like, like even then he's five time world,

176
00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:03.360
strongest man winner. There there's really no money in that. I would've.

177
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.520
<v 0>Thought he would've been balling outta control. You would think so.</v>

178
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:06.400
Cause I know who he is.

179
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.480
I feel like if I know who you are and you do something on TV, you must be rich.

180
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.383
Yeah, exactly.

181
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.760
<v 1>That's that's the Rapper's uh, display &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, exactly.</v>

182
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.870
I'm flying in first class and then you catch little bawow in the.

183
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.271
<v 0>Back. Well,</v>

184
00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:19.630
I remember one of the weird things that I read about pugennowski is how much

185
00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:23.230
candy he eats. Huh? Yeah. And that he really likes, uh,

186
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.670
candy in between workouts because he's blowing out so much sugar that he would

187
00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:28.504
eat chocolate bars.

188
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.510
<v 1>That makes sense. Yeah.</v>

189
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.950
We do a lot of like I do peanut butter and honey stuff like that during

190
00:09:32.951 --> 00:09:36.020
competition, peanut butter and honey, or schsnicers really? Yeah.

191
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.100
<v 0>When you eat peanut and butter and honey, you eat it with a spoon,</v>

192
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:38.900
like what do you, how.

193
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.180
<v 1>Do you, I usually make the sandwiches.</v>

194
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.220
I see guys just pouring honey in their mouth. Like the Russian guys.

195
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.940
There's a Russian guy who was a Russian secret service for a while. And this no.

196
00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:52.540
Yeah. Like you look in his eyes, you're like this has done some bad things.

197
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.900
&lt;laugh&gt; and, but he's the nicest dude in the world.

198
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.050
He's he's like the sweetest guy.

199
00:09:57.051 --> 00:10:00.090
He comes like he always comes over and talks to me and my family and he is,

200
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.290
he doesn't speak good English,

201
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:04.250
but he's really nice about trying to get his point across and everything. And,

202
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.010
but um, yeah, that, that guy's done probably scary. Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.370
I'm sure there's a lot of that.

204
00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:14.210
Cuz we compete with people from all around the world, you know, and you know,

205
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.320
we, uh, we tend to of forget that everywhere else.

206
00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:21.200
There's a lot of it's it's normal almost to be like that in some places right.

207
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.520
<v 0>To survive. Right. And if you're a giant dude,</v>

208
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.880
it's probably the best way to make a living. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

209
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.960
And so they just squirt honey in their mouth. Yeah.

210
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.400
<v 1>They'll just pour like,</v>

211
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.440
like a whole little canister of honey and just take that.

212
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.710
You see guys do that right before they go lift and stuff. I'm I, uh, the,

213
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.470
the way I grew up and the, the, the way I did things,

214
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.790
like I was always taught and it kind of worked with being broke,

215
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.790
but like a warrior goes to war hungry. Mm that's. Like in football,

216
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.230
I would never eat before a game ever. And then, um, got into strong man.

217
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.910
And I did that for a long time and I got up to 440 pounds and I

218
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.500
would, I would do an entire show like five, six hours without eating.

219
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.140
But then during it, I would snack a little bit, but I would never eat a meal.

220
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.260
Right. But.

221
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.380
<v 0>Then to eat the resources, it eats up your resources.</v>

222
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.740
<v 1>Right. Right. And, and, and see,</v>

223
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.780
for me it felt like anything in my stomach just made me feel like slow.

224
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 0>Mm. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, too. That's the same with comedy too.</v>

225
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.650
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I learned that from KA Williams,

226
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.290
watching an interview with them to don't eat before you go on stage. I'm like,

227
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:27.210
that makes sense. Yeah. You better off being hungry. Right. Hunter,

228
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:30.050
hunter hunters do that too. The best hunters they hunt hungry. Yeah.

229
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.490
<v 1>See. And then, but what happened to me was I lost 80 pounds. That was four 40.</v>

230
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.403
I lost 80 pounds.

231
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.640
And when I got hurt in Botana I lost all that weight.

232
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.160
And just because of the bicep tear, no, I, I chose to do that. See,

233
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.240
I'm when I graduated high school, I was 370 pounds.

234
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.600
So I've always been a big dude,

235
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.560
but I got up to four 40 and just walking around was laborist you know, just,

236
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.320
I felt like horrible being, how big were you when you did that log? Press,

237
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.040
that log press. That was like, like 4 25 ish,

238
00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:05.280
four 30 around that. So like I gained a little bit more after that. I just,

239
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.080
everyone tells you in the sport, the bigger you are, the stronger you are.

240
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.680
And that kind of holds true to static lifting,

241
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.750
like end of it's not necessary all the time, but it kind of holds true,

242
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.550
but we gotta move, man. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

243
00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:21.030
we're talking about pulling a truck and doing load events and all that stuff.

244
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.270
When, when you're four 40 and your body's not agreeing with that four 40,

245
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.150
it just, it holds you back. You wanna imagine the load on your joints too? Yeah.

246
00:12:29.151 --> 00:12:32.670
It's particularly lower back. Yeah. My low back was bad. Yeah.

247
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.380
So that's what happened. I I'd got hurt and I felt like I was done.

248
00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:37.214
Cause my low back,

249
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.860
I I'd have to take me like 45 minutes to get outta bed in the morning. Really?

250
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.980
Oh yeah. I was messed up man. Really bad. And then did you get an MRI?

251
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.300
I never got an MRI and didn't, I'm scared to suck it up. Exactly.

252
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.140
Just roll. How'd you fix it? Uh, I, when I lost weight,

253
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.650
I got the better and it's core strength for me now. Oh,

254
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.210
core strength and stretching. And also I smoke weed. Like a lot of,

255
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.130
a lot of athletes are against it.

256
00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:05.330
And a lot of people think that there's some like negative connotation with being

257
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.930
like someone who smokes weed. But I mean, I'm watching guys take,

258
00:13:08.931 --> 00:13:11.090
vicanin like its Skittles. I'm watching guys.

259
00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.250
I've seen guys throw away their lives, their families,

260
00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:18.160
their career over a bunch of pills because they didn't want to smoke. And it's,

261
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:19.480
it's crazy. It, you know, it is crazy.
