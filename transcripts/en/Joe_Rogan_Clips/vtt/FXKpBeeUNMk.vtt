1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. This virus. I've been saying this about all viruses,</v>

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:09.690
that diseases are like demons, you know, and we, we just,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
if we were losing, like, have you seen the numbers too? This is something that,

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
uh, my friends, Steve who's a doctor sent me, and this is a

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.860
a series of crazy statistics, but, um,

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.730
the craziest statistics about how many people die,

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
like it puts it into perspective. I mean, and all life lost is valuable.

8
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:35.010
All I've lost is a tragedy. I'm not saying anything other than that,

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.850
but what I'm just, I'm not diminishing anyone's loss of life.

10
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.720
But what I am saying is I was stunned when I saw the actual numbers.

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.150
So 2017 to two to 2018,

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.333
uh,

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
H two N three pandemic killed 61,000

14
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.770
Americans. Did you know that? I didn't know that.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.770
Did you know that Jamie I've heard numbers like that recently? Yeah,

16
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.450
but not before 2017 to 2018 hospitalized,

17
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.310
30,453,

18
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.290
an estimated effected was 894,700 people by that flu

19
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.700
that's crazy.

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.920
Overall death rate was 7.5 with a peak in

21
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:23.490
January, 2018 of 10.8. Again, I'm a moron,

22
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.300
not a doctor reading you a text message. Maybe I shouldn't be doing that.

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.290
Maybe someone should look into this 2009 pandemic. No,

24
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.230
this is the one that Bert said he had. He said the H one N one,

25
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.520
it killed 83,300 Americans.

26
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.370
Death rates range from 4% to 33% for pediatric

27
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.510
zero to 22%, uh,

28
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.370
for 18 and 64 for zero to 4%. For those over 65,

29
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.580
man, this is crazy.

30
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:01.560
U S case is 60.8 million 274,000 hospitalized,

31
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.420
12,469 deaths in the U S like,

32
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.200
I'm just going over all these different ones that happened flu of the year of

33
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:14.910
2020 cases reported 45 million hospitals hospitalizations

34
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.760
415,000 deaths, 48,000.

35
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.510
That's for the 2020 flu this flu season.

36
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.430
There's so many people that die of the flu, but obviously this week,

37
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.580
when you see healthcare workers freaking out, you know, this is different.

38
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.690
So what is different about it? That's all at the same time. Yeah.

39
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.620
It's all at the same time. It's new, it's a new virus. People don't have,

40
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.050
they don't have immunity for it. They don't really know how to cure it.

41
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.360
And it attacks the respiratory system.

42
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.510
And it seems to have a real quick turnaround from,

43
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:49.440
I'm not feeling so good to I'm dead. You know, it's a,

44
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.650
it happens very quickly for some people shockingly. So some of these,

45
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.920
and it seems to affect different people in different ways.

46
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.320
Like there's a lot going on with this one that has smart people going.

47
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.570
We need to stay home for a bit. Just everybody chill, no large gatherings.

48
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.710
Yeah.

49
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.290
<v 1>Do you ever get the flu shot every year? I mean, like,</v>

50
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.180
I feel like I get the flu almost every year, but I never do the flu shot.

51
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.460
Like, it seems like it should do the other thing. I don't know.

52
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.050
Like I didn't get last year. I don't.

53
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.850
<v 0>Get the flu shot. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.700
<v 1>Isn't that a bad idea? It seems like.</v>

55
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.190
<v 0>I've survived and been healthy, but just, uh,</v>

56
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.850
eating well and not getting the flu shot and then making sure I'm in the sauna

57
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:32.560
and I exercise well and sleep well, and I've been able to shake it off, but, uh,

58
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.090
it's a good move. It's probably, I probably should get the flu shot.

59
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.600
And if I got the flu again, maybe I'd be like, man,

60
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.590
I should have got the flu shot. Let me just get that flu shot. But I mean,

61
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.010
whether it's diet or whether it's, um, all this,

62
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.820
I'm on all the different vitamins and hormones and the fact that I'm in the

63
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.630
sauna for 25 minutes everyday, but I rarely get sick.

64
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.110
<v 1>Like you would get it more just because you're around like, you know,</v>

65
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.080
gyms and saunas and my places where there's a lot of sweat.

66
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.040
<v 0>The only cooties I've gotten in the gym and scare me is staff. Yeah.</v>

67
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.820
I've gotten staff a couple of times that scares me. Jared, get ringworm. Yeah.

68
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.360
I got that. A bunch of times. I got that twice. At least maybe three times,

69
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.420
which is not that bad. You put Lamisil on it. Stay off the mat for a little bit.

70
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.030
And then the products that I started using, um,

71
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.480
prevented or saved me from that a company called defense soap. Yeah.

72
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.190
Use that's the because it's all natural stuff. It's all tea,

73
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:31.750
tree oil and eucalyptus soil. And it's, it's not antibiotic in that.

74
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:33.880
It doesn't kill off all the good bacteria.

75
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.830
It just coats your body with this soap. And it's all like natural. It,

76
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.640
it kills the bad bacteria, but it doesn't kill good bacteria.

77
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.760
I don't understand how that works folks. But people have known that forever,

78
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:46.451
the tea tree oil,

79
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.090
and you can lift the soil are good for infections and presenters.

80
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.420
<v 1>Infection. I use it cause I'm like a yeasty boy, very yeasty.</v>

81
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.480
<v 0>Yeah. Used infection.</v>

82
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.810
<v 1>Now I give it, I give them that. Give them that.</v>

83
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.640
You're lucky if you get one from me.

84
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.940
<v 0>Like awards. Yeah. I've been, I've been lucky with diseases,</v>

85
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.140
knock on wood. Um, but it's, uh, you know,

86
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.000
this is a weird one. If you're, if you're compromised, you know,

87
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:20.200
people that have, uh, lung issues or people that have had a, like,

88
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.170
I hate to say it, Brian, but vaping.

89
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.580
<v 1>Vaping. Yeah. I think cigarettes and vaping. And I want weed smokers though.</v>

90
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.650
Cause I know it's always like what, you know.

91
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.040
<v 0>The things that also are deadly that also affects so many people like that</v>

92
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:39.490
list that I read off. Is that right? Saying that I read. Right?

93
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.683
What do you think?

94
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.870
<v 1>It seems like it would be, but I mean nowadays,</v>

95
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:45.880
like you get all these like doctor lists on Facebook,

96
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:47.440
you never know what's real and what's not.

97
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.240
<v 0>A friend of mine is a legitimate doctor. Is that correct?</v>

98
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.900
Are those numbers correct? We should probably say let's uh,

99
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.430
let's Google the again.

100
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.170
So what did I say was start off with the first one. The first one was, um,

101
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.680
Michael yell, apparently put out a video today. Oh, JT. Yeah,

102
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.500
he's back. Okay.

103
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:13.790
Let's look at this one to 2017 to 2018,

104
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.840
H two N three virus pandemic that killed 61,000.

105
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.591
<v 2>I wasn't making that up.</v>

106
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:23.120
The hardest part with that right now is those numbers have been accumulated over

107
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.070
a year plus. And we were only have had a month.

108
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.350
<v 0>It's like these numbers, right? I mean even says 2017, 2018.</v>

109
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.370
But over a year it killed 61,000 people.

110
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.850
Now the other one was the big one at the end.

111
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.000
The flu for this year for 2020,

112
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.990
the flu cases reported 45 million

113
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.670
hospitalizations. 415,000 deaths.

114
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.430
48,000. Hm that's.

115
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.263
<v 1>Worldwide.</v>

116
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.190
<v 0>No, it's the United States. Oh really? Yeah. Wow. I know. That's what I'm.</v>

117
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.110
<v 1>Saying. Have you even heard about the flu this year?</v>

118
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.790
<v 0>Well, that's the thing it's like, it's not sexy. Cause it happens every year.</v>

119
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.590
Right. You know, it's like the sky monster.

120
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.300
If this guy monster never appeared before and then one day the first tornado hit

121
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:16.130
and tore apart, Nashville, we'd be like, what in the has God's mad at us. Right.

122
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.330
That's how they used to feel back in that.

123
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.560
<v 2>It's just one person's case.</v>

124
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:23.060
I remember last week I read someone that got tested for the flu and they tested

125
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:26.780
positive and then weeks later got tested for the COVID-19 and then tested

126
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:27.501
positive for that.

127
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.440
But they weren't tested for COVID at the time they're tested for the flu because

128
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.730
they didn't have a test. Right.

129
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.190
So there could be a lot of people that tested positive for the flu.

130
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:37.490
Maybe that never had a COVID-19 test.

131
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.250
<v 0>Yeah. Could be. Yeah. I mean,</v>

132
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.310
do they mean it?

133
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.460
I guess it depends on whether or not they have the test available in different

134
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:47.294
places too. Right.

135
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.890
<v 2>I'm just not reading too. There's a new new test that just got made today.</v>

136
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.753
That's faster.

137
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.980
<v 1>Oh yeah. Yeah. There's a five minute test.</v>

138
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:57.740
Like it's like an easy bake oven of testing. Jamie.

139
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.930
<v 0>What are we going to do? If you test positive? Oh yeah.</v>

140
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.793
<v 2>I don't know.</v>

141
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.270
<v 0>Yeah. You're in contact bro.</v>

142
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.110
<v 2>I already have it. Then I could be. Cause I'm testing positive.</v>

143
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.440
Doesn't mean it could be. I mean you're out there spreading.

144
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.550
<v 0>It. Carrier.</v>

145
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.120
<v 1>Get out of.</v>

146
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.580
<v 0>Here. Son of a pet my dog.</v>

147
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.520
<v 1>Oh, that's too late. I didn't even think of that.</v>

148
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.690
<v 2>Did they send the email out? What was yesterday? Saturday, I guess.</v>

149
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.240
So like it's too late. When the did they get it?

150
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.180
That's when they got it to the hospital and called the apartment building and

151
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:27.320
said, Hey, you might wanna let everybody know.

152
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.720
<v 0>Washing your hands a lot. You guys doing the whole thing?</v>

153
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.840
I'm washing the out of my hands. My hands are annoyed at me.

154
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.600
<v 1>I'm lucky I got some, uh, hand sanitizer like, oh, before the, yeah,</v>

155
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.510
right before it happened, the crash, uh, I was, uh,

156
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.980
opening up for Tom green in San Diego and Tom green was the first person that I

157
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:48.920
knew that was kind of like panicking a little, like he he's like,

158
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:52.850
I just bought a crate of Lysol mini Lysols and he was spraying the microphone

159
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:57.090
down on stage. And like, and I was like, he's a little, uh, overboard,

160
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.440
literally like a week later, everyone.

161
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.190
<v 0>Tom green ahead of the curve. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.450
It's a it's spooky dude. Who was it that had a friend?

163
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.800
Was it Tom Papa? Whose friend was warning him long in advance? No,

164
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.990
it wasn't Tom Papa. It was Bert Kreischer.

165
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.860
Bert Kreischer had a friend who was warning him. Wayne advanced, listen,

166
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.990
you need to isolate. You need to get your family out. And he was like,

167
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:24.420
what was Bert? Right? Yeah. Her shirt off. Yeah.

168
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.590
Take your shirt on like your shirt back on your, uh, just,

169
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:31.260
you need to isolate quickly. Get away from everybody.

170
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.810
Cause it's gonna spread right through America. And he was like, what?

171
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:37.020
And this was apparently in February and he was like, this lady's crazy. Wow.

172
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.720
And then he texted her like at the beginning of March when it was on and popping

173
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:42.643
and he's like, you're right.

174
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.420
My point about showing those numbers is not to diminish the impact of, uh,

175
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.070
this current pandemic. It was just to highlight the fact that, uh,

176
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.530
we live in a war zone.

177
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.780
We live in a virus war zone that takes out thousands of people every

178
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:01.800
year in this country.

179
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.780
And I don't think most of us are really keeping our eye on that. You know,

180
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.350
like you hear about deaths by the flu and you know, they're never,

181
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.520
they're never shocking deaths by some new thing. For some reason,

182
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:17.850
even if it's the same number of deaths or less even right.

183
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.030
So far less freak us the out.

184
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.300
<v 1>It seems like it's happening more though. Like if you go on TMZ,</v>

185
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.030
it's like somebody dies every day. Like this old, you know,

186
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.330
philosopher or this old poet or this old musician. And he's like,

187
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.600
you never hear that in the past, like, oh, he died at the flu. That guy died.

188
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.733
That guy died.

189
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.290
<v 0>W here we go, Jimmy just pulled something up. A total of</v>

190
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.830
19,543 laboratory confirmed influenza associated hospitalizations were reported

191
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.580
block by flu serve dash net, uh,

192
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.580
sites between October,

193
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.010
2019 and March 21st,

194
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.990
2020 41172.1% were associated with influenza.

195
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.880
A virus. What's that? 14,000, 14,000. What did I say? 41. Oh,

196
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.900
whoops. What am I dyslectic um, influence, uh, okay.

197
00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:11.160
A 5,000 335, 27 0.3% with influence of B.

198
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.390
That's true too. Right?

199
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:15.810
If you get an influence at a shot and it's influenced a B,

200
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:20.040
you might catch it anyway. That's annoying. Um,

201
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.960
so that's a lot of people, right? So we got

202
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:26.961
nineteen

203
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:27.600
thousand five hundred and five thousand three hundred and four thousand fourteen

204
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.060
thousand one hundred. Yeah.

205
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.140
<v 1>My theory is that you're, you are born sucking your thumb.</v>

206
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.760
You were supposed to suck your thumb your whole life.

207
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:39.630
And it was supposed to keep your immune system strong so that it would fight all

208
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:39.960
of this.

209
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.850
<v 0>Okay. The hospitalization rate was 67.3% per oh no.</v>

210
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:48.420
67.3 per 100,000 population,

211
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:52.800
which is higher than all recent seasons, except for the 2017,

212
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.690
2018 season rates and children,

213
00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.610
zero to four years old and adults 18 to 49 are now the highest CDC has on

214
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:05.470
record for these age groups of passing the rate reported during the 2009

215
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.180
H one N one pandemic hospitalization rates for school aged

216
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.970
children are higher than any recent regular season,

217
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.660
but lower than rates during the pandemic. What, so what happened in 2009?

218
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.420
When the H one N one kicked in and killed all those people,

219
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:20.560
they didn't shut anything down.

220
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.120
<v 2>I've been hearing her.</v>

221
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.750
It was like after a thousand people died is when things started changing.

222
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:28.210
And I don't, I don't really remember what was changing back then.

223
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.970
<v 0>I don't remember. I don't either. Do you remember? No,</v>

224
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.590
we just talked to Burt again. Bird had it. He had the H one N one. He did. Yeah,

225
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:39.850
he did. Yeah. He said there's was the sickest he's ever been in his life. Um,

226
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.170
and it was 2009 when it was all going down and he said he couldn't sleep.

227
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.580
He was so uncomfortable. He was in just constant pain and aching said never,

228
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.540
never felt sicker ever in his life. And that killed a lot of people.

229
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.610
<v 1>Like that before where, you know,</v>

230
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:58.720
you're just puking and you can't hold anything in you're sweating.

231
00:12:58.721 --> 00:12:59.920
You're waking up, you.

232
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.080
<v 0>Know, does that 2009? I don't think it was.</v>

233
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.460
<v 1>I felt like it was like five years ago or something like that.</v>

234
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.790
<v 0>Get you. They can get you.</v>

235
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.050
I hope another thing that comes out of here is people take their immune system

236
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:15.010
more seriously. Yeah. Support your immune system. You know, I mean,

237
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:15.844
if this makes a bit,

238
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.020
just a little shift in the number of people that get healthy little shift in the

239
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:23.890
number of number of people that start taking vitamins and exercising and,

240
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.930
you know, just do something, man, something put a heavy backpack on,

241
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.910
go for a walk, do something, listen to a podcast.
