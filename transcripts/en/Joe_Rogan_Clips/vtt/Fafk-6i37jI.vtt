00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.280
<v 2>Just to give you an example in my book, I talk about Winston Churchill,</v>

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.920
Winston church, a little, 1939,

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.920
wrote an essay about the fact that there could be life around other, in,

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.880
on other planets, around other stars. And we, we should search for it. Now,

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.440
he didn't have a chance to publish it cause he became prime and,

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.310
and then had to fight the, the second world war against the Nazi regime.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.910
So much money was wasted in that war.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.990
If that money was allocated to the search for extraterrestrial life,

10
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.950
the way the Churchill envisioned it before the war we might have,

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.910
we might have known the answer by now. And what I'm saying is this is just an,

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.460
an example for how non-intelligent we are.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.580
We are not working together towards a better future. We're fighting each other.

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.180
And that's the answer to your question that we might not live very long.

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.620
<v 1>But you're saying this as you work at Harvard and as you are writing books on</v>

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
extra terrestrial objects, right? I don't necessarily agree with, with you.

17
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.810
I think there are massive problems with people,

18
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.970
but I think we are far better than the human beings that live 2000 years ago in

19
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:09.710
that regard.

20
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.610
And I think that we will probably be looking back on this day and age and

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.490
mocking how stupid we are when we are more advanced 2000 years. I really.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.930
<v 0>Hope so. And that's what I'm trying to do.</v>

23
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:22.720
I think we're moving in that direction. Well, that's what I'm trying to promote,

24
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.520
but I'm not necessarily as optimistic.

25
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.120
<v 1>As you are. Think, I think our cake is still in the oven. Let's.</v>

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.400
<v 0>Hope so. I think that's, I, I really want that future, but you know,</v>

27
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.840
I'm doing my best, but you can see from the pushback yes.

28
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.840
To which I don't have access because I, I'm not, you know,

29
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.680
I don't have an account on the social media.

30
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.430
<v 1>Congratulations again for now. I think that's, I, I,</v>

31
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.830
I think we are moving. I think there's conflict,

32
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.950
but I think for whatever reason, the way human beings operate,

33
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.990
we oftentimes need conflict in order to make improvements, right?

34
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.150
We need a yin and a yang. We needed a given a poll. If we don't have that,

35
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.750
we get, we get complacent. Why.

36
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.580
<v 0>Can't you understand the, the, the best path forward without, you know,</v>

37
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:08.420
it's just like using a GPS system. And it says recalculating, yes,

38
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.500
every time we have a crisis recalculating.

39
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.540
So we recalculate our next move based on all the mistakes we've made.

40
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.020
Why can't we be smart in the.

41
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.380
<v 1>First place?</v>

42
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.180
I think we have biological limitations that are based on our ancestry and our

43
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.970
ancestry is filled with tribalism and chaos and we're primates. I mean, that's,

44
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.170
that's part of the problem. And I think that our,

45
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.290
our issue with racism is the same issue that we have when we have religious

46
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:36.290
discrimination or cultural discrimination. It's tribalism. I agree. And we are,

47
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.210
you know, we are just, it's wired into our DNA. Now.

48
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.410
<v 0>My problem is why couldn't science given that,</v>

49
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.280
you know, there are billions of earth sun systems within just the Milky way,

50
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.760
galaxy mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then a trillion galaxies,

51
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:55.920
like the Milky way in the observable volume of the universe. You know,

52
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.400
why can't the mainstream of astronomy simply say

53
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.320
conservatively, you know, just assuming the most conservative,

54
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.600
not speculative assumption conservatively,

55
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.320
we are the middle of the road, you know, kind of life. Uh,

56
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:15.560
it's very likely that we're not unique and special,

57
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.070
and let's just look for evidence, you know, so much for it.

58
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.750
Why should that there be a taboo on discussing this subject?

59
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.910
That makes no sense. For example,

60
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.910
astronomers are now thinking contemplating new telescopes of the future

61
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.670
that will cost billions of dollars to taxpayers. Okay.

62
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.750
That would search for oxygen in the atmospheres of other planets,

63
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:39.700
around other stars,

64
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.140
because oxygen could be indicative of life microbial life.

65
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.460
I say it will never be conclusive, such a search,

66
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.180
even if it costs billions of dollars because the earth for 2 billion years,

67
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.860
the first two billionaires of the earth history didn't have much oxygen aids in

68
00:03:57.861 --> 00:04:02.050
its atmosphere. There were micro robs, but the oxygen level was quite low.

69
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.930
And then it suddenly rose after 2 billion years, half of its life.

70
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.330
So not finding oxygen doesn't mean there is no life.

71
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.650
And then if you find oxygen,

72
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.570
it can be produced by many natural processes like breaking water

73
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.570
molecules or other things. So it will never be conclusive.

74
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.680
How can you make a co statement?

75
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.320
If you find industrial pollution in the same atmosphere,

76
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.040
you just search for CFCs.

77
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.560
These are the molecules produced by refrigerating systems by industries.

78
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.400
If you find evidence for that,

79
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.160
there is no way that nature can make these very complex molecules naturally.

80
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.310
So I say to the mainstream of astronomy,

81
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.750
use the same instruments and motivate them by this question of,

82
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:50.230
can we detect industrial pollution? And I wrote a paper about it.

83
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.230
And the thing is, the public is extremely interested in this question

84
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.670
and the public funds science.

85
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.060
So how can this scientific community shy away from a question that it can

86
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.460
address with existing technology? You know,

87
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.660
when the public is very interested in that,

88
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.820
how can there be a taboo on this question?

89
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.500
That's the thing that really passes me now. You know,

90
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.340
I wasn't working in this area until the last five years or so.

91
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.930
I was working in studying black holes, studying the universe,

92
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.290
and I came across, uh, a number of ideas that led me in, into this,

93
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.410
uh, rabbit hole into this, uh, subject.

94
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.410
Now I'm about to publish this book at a popular level,

95
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.410
but also a textbook six months later that describes all the signs that we

96
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:45.800
have related to the search for life outside earth, far from earth.

97
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.400
And I'm just amazed that, um, it's not part of the mainstream, you know,

98
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.000
it's really surprising to me.

99
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:57.560
And I think it's inappropriate because you look at physics, theoretical physics,

100
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.680
there are lots of speculative ideas in it.

101
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.600
Like people talk about extra dimensions, the multiverse, you know,

102
00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:07.160
super symmetry, super string theory,

103
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.960
all of these have no evidence to their credit. You know,

104
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:16.830
there is no experimental test, not even thought about, you know,

105
00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:18.630
like in the next decade, the next two decades,

106
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.430
but these ideas are part of the mainstream.

107
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.230
So you see physicists giving each other awards and doing

108
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:29.550
intellectual gymnastics, you know, just demonstrating that they're smart.

109
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.270
And to me, that's an unhealthy situation in physics. You know,

110
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:38.100
you can do it in mathematics where it's completely detached from, uh,

111
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.140
any application to reality, but in physics, we are supposed to describe reality.

112
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.180
And yet you have these intellectual. So it's as if the physics community,

113
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.340
some parts of it decided that the most important task is to demonstrate

114
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:56.540
that you are smart. And that is really strange to me because, you know,

115
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.970
we are supposed to understand nature, not sure that we are smart.
