00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 2>In a young life,</v>

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.390
you have accomplished incredible things like for people that don't know you want

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:13.950
an Olympic gold medalist at 17, and then you wanted again, four years later.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.400
Yup. The only American boxer ever,

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
I think like only another sport, like no boxers ever done that right in.

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.820
<v 1>America, not from America, just.</v>

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.670
<v 0>Me. And uh, I mean,</v>

9
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.340
you've gone multiple weight classes and now you consider in fighting in MMA.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.490
I mean, you, you kind of cleared out boxing in a lot of ways.

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.170
<v 1>It's always something more to be accomplished in boxing,</v>

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
but I'm venturing off into MMA because I really want to see

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.510
am I as good as I think I am? And I think I am.

14
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:53.280
So I'm excited to be fighting with the PFL later on this year and just

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.340
taking it from there and seeing what happens.

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.150
<v 0>Well, I think when someone is as good as you are at boxing,</v>

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.160
you could basically do anything you want in life.

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.810
You just have to put the same amount of focus that you put on boxing to whatever

19
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:07.644
it is,

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.810
but you apply yourself to rare human beings that can do what you've been able to

21
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:14.160
do. It's a rare person.

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.450
<v 1>Peace, proper preparation prevents poor performance.</v>

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.350
So in MMA, I'm not coming over like, Hey, I'm in boxing, gym box,

24
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.280
all you girls up. It's like, I'm at Jackson wink gym, you know,

25
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.720
with coach Jackson, coach.

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.620
<v 0>I've seen you throw kegs. I was very impressed.</v>

27
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.830
I can't believe you're already that good. It's real. I was like, wow,

28
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.410
maybe she put, you were throwing high kicks. Yeah.

29
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.590
<v 1>And I can go up that high today, showed me the technique up. And I was like,</v>

30
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.300
whoa, this is insane.

31
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.460
<v 0>Do you stretch all the time? Are you a person who like when you were boxing?</v>

32
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.830
I mean, I know most athletes stretch,

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.250
but having a full split is not really,

34
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.720
it's not really required to punch people, but you obviously have very flexible.

35
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.030
<v 1>I've been doing yoga for the past few months. So I was able to kick high.</v>

36
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:07.260
When I first went to Jackson, wink gym in December, I was able to kick high,

37
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.710
but not for very long, I probably would get two or three good high case.

38
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.550
Now my yo let's bring it down a level now from all the stretching,

39
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.400
when they got that pad up there and they like kick it,

40
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.320
I just do the form in my leg and go up there over and over and over again,

41
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:26.580
just from the stretching and actually being a bit more flexible than what I was

42
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:29.550
before. So I stretched, but I stretch more serious. Now what.

43
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.530
<v 0>Brought you into yoga? Um.</v>

44
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.280
<v 1>Really, it was the MMA fans, to be honest, they're like,</v>

45
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.310
you're going to have to stretch and you know, people that are on there,

46
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:41.670
you know, talking trash or whatever trolls, but they were saying like,

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.850
I read a lot of comments and I'm like, they're like, you know,

48
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.570
she's going to have a problem with kicking. She's not flexible.

49
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:50.100
Her legs are big, blah, blah, blah.

50
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.760
So I would read some of that stuff and do my own research. And I'm like,

51
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.163
they're right.

52
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.490
So my goal for one of my new year's resolutions was to be able to do the splits

53
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:04.180
by the end of the year. So I have a yoga teacher, um,

54
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.230
and me and her go like upon, upon zoom twice a week.

55
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.510
And she's like having me do these stretches and I'm like, girl,

56
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.670
you is something else. Her name is Sakina.

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.240
<v 0>Have you done a hot yoga ever? No.</v>

58
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.370
<v 1>Not yet. I heard it's brutal though.</v>

59
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.370
<v 0>It is brutal for sure.</v>

60
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.790
But one good thing about it is when you get that hot and sweaty,

61
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.630
your muscles become really pliable and you can make really good gains that way.

62
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:29.980
Like in terms of flexibility.

63
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.290
<v 1>Oh, maybe. Yeah. Maybe I should try it with.</v>

64
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.191
<v 0>Stickiness. Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:37.810
I always find that I'm way more flexible in a hot yoga class than I am anywhere

66
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:39.940
else you can do it. The splits. Yeah. I can do the splits.

67
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.333
<v 1>Academy.</v>

68
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.400
<v 0>I'm old. I started when I was 15, you know.</v>

69
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.090
<v 1>And you still do splits. Your body is like jacked up.</v>

70
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.560
You should not be able to do this place.

71
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.550
<v 0>Oh,</v>

72
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.170
there's a guy who fights for one FC that makes me look like a twig.

73
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.730
His name is Elaine and golly, he's super jacked.

74
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.210
And he's one of the most flexible guys I've ever seen in my life. Oh,

75
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.130
insanely flexible, but flexible everywhere. His spine is flexible. He can,

76
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.450
he can bend over backwards, standing and touch the back of his, like his touch,

77
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.480
his palms to the ground and then flip his feet over the top.

78
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.110
His Instagram's incredible. Cause he's built like a superhero.

79
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.430
See if he can find his, uh, his Instagram he's built like a super,

80
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.230
I mean like a freak of nature, but incredibly flexible.

81
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.910
Wow. Yeah. He just puts a lot of time and dedication to flexibility.

82
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.590
You can, it can be done. It's just there he is. Look at him. I mean,

83
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.780
come on. And when you see this guy,

84
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.450
when you see this guy move and you see him fight, I mean,

85
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.930
do the video once so you could see him. Oh no, no,

86
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.210
go that one right there with the dude,

87
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.680
the blue shorts right in front where he had kicks his dude, watch this guy.

88
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.580
I mean, you see his, his flexibility is incredible.

89
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.760
<v 1>But that's one thing about the kids though.</v>

90
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:00.310
You really have to condition or shins for that. Oh yeah.

91
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.780
Remember when I first started,

92
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.300
I was like probably like five kicks in and I'm like, yeah.

93
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.610
<v 0>Right.</v>

94
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.190
<v 1>Yeah. Just the bag itself. Then when we went up to the pads, I'm like, coach,</v>

95
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.890
you got softer pads series. He's like champ. These are my Sophos ones.

96
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:15.724
I'm like.

97
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.150
<v 0>It takes a while. It takes, while you see some people,</v>

98
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:22.990
they start whacking their shins with like a Coke bottles and stuff like that.

99
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:25.560
Just trying to toughen them up to do all kinds of things.

100
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.770
They're shooting really hard.

101
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.603
<v 1>Now.</v>

102
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.650
<v 0>Oh, there you are. Look at this seriously. Superman punches, everything,</v>

103
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:33.484
head kicks.

104
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.160
<v 1>The thing is some of the stuff I learned.</v>

105
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.050
I liked Superman punch that same day. So when he showed me at one time,

106
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.870
we just started doing it and he was like, you're doing good.

107
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.260
Like I can look at it now and tell you my mistakes right now.

108
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.930
But I'm not going to say too much. Cause I fixed them already.

109
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.370
But sometime when I throw like the head kicks, my kicks would, my,

110
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.560
my hands would go down at the same time. How did you get.

111
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.510
<v 0>To Jackson? Winkle John? Because first of all,</v>

112
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:02.960
you couldn't have picked a better gym to train out the one of the best gyms in

113
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:04.730
the world, but what, what brought you there?

114
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.040
<v 1>Um, actually I've always had like,</v>

115
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.540
I believe in technique and training, people may look at me boxing me, but oh,

116
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.910
she just naturally fast. She naturally strongly like, no,

117
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.950
I am strategically smart in boxing and I have a lot of skill.

118
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.840
I may look like I'm a beast out there,

119
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:28.640
but it takes a lot of skill to land those punches, body work defense, which is,

120
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.980
I probably got hit three times in my last fight.

121
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.210
<v 0>When one of your fights, what was that woman from God?</v>

122
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:39.440
What was her name was your first world title fight. She was a blonde lady.

123
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.520
Nikki Atler yeah. She went a whole round without landing a single punch on you.

124
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.700
<v 1>And I, not in that fight in the fifth round. Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.150
<v 0>You, anybody that doesn't think that you have technique?</v>

126
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.680
Just doesn't understand boxing.

127
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.330
<v 1>Oh, she's a.</v>

128
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.390
<v 0>Woman. You can't respond to those people. You can't even, no,</v>

129
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:59.870
you clearly have superior technique.

130
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.690
<v 1>I agree. No, so far MMA. I was just like,</v>

131
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.340
I already had signed a contract with the PFL and now I'm like, okay, how,

132
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.510
what do you have to do for the five piece to play in effect? And I was like,

133
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.900
I need to get the best trainer. And I just remember like in 2016,

134
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.290
me and Johnny bones, we were talking at the ESPYs and he was like, yo,

135
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.890
you be the perfect boxer to come over to MMA. And I was like.

136
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.930
<v 0>It's true. Cause you're really young. You wouldn't be 25.</v>

137
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.710
<v 1>Yeah. I turned 26 in two days. Yeah. Super. Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.350
<v 0>Well an early happy birthday to you. Thank you.</v>

139
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.120
So that's a perfect age because you're you still are capable of getting elite at

140
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:42.020
all the arts. You're still, you could get a lead at Brazilian jujitsu.

141
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.790
You can get a lead at striking with kicking and tie. You can. I mean,

142
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:47.990
you're young enough that you could do all that.

143
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:48.711
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:53.420
I think you're just all about like one having the right teachers and also

145
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.290
getting in there and doing it. But I mean, having a, having a buddy to do it,

146
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:01.370
like, I'm glad that I didn't wait till I was like 35, you know, 36,

147
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.540
because then I would just be starting. It sent me back and it'd be like,

148
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.840
I'm going to here starting new. And my body isn't even in his prime,

149
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.020
like right now, I don't think that my body has, has, has peaked yet.

150
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.200
Like where I've been as strong as I can be as fast as I can be.

151
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.750
I still think like I'm like right there.

152
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.660
I just haven't I haven't touched my, my, okay.

153
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:24.080
This is the best my body can be at. I haven't, I haven't touched that yet.

154
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.850
<v 0>Pro athlete there, your prime is somewhere between 28 and 32. I think they say,</v>

155
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.390
cause that's when your body lines up with your brain.

156
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.250
<v 1>I was hoping it was 26. Maybe.</v>

157
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.690
<v 0>It was 26. I was hoping ice and won the world title at 20, you know,</v>

158
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.730
it's like John Jones won the world title at 22. It's like you can, it was 23.

159
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.160
It was John Jones, 22 or 23. He's the youngest ever UFC champion.

160
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.920
He was 21. No, no he wasn't 21.

161
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.150
He was either 22 or 23 because 23. Okay. Cause before that,

162
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:02.100
I think it was Josh Barnett and he won the heavyweight title. I think it was 24,

163
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.860
you know, but there's, it's, you know, it's different for everybody.

164
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:11.760
Like some people peak young. Some people, they, as they get older,

165
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:14.430
they get smarter. So they understand their body better.

166
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.940
And so maybe their body doesn't quite work as well as it did when they were 24.

167
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:22.860
But they're a better athlete at 30 or 32 just because they know what to do and

168
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:23.700
how to do it better.

169
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.490
They understand they have a better communication with their body,

170
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.480
but that's like what you're doing by doing yoga.

171
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.480
And even by expanding into martial arts, that's the key.

172
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:36.300
It's like keeping your body doing different things.

173
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.550
And then you go understand your body more,

174
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.200
the more different stuff you do with it.

175
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.480
So when did you start training in MMA? December. Just December.

176
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.070
And how often are you doing it?

177
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.670
<v 1>Um, I was at Jackson when Jim three weeks at a time.</v>

178
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:53.100
So I'll be there three weeks, go home a week, come back, three weeks,

179
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.590
go home a week, come back three weeks. Um,

180
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.330
I was doing that because I really just,

181
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.770
I like to just have my time when I'm at home, my family and my boyfriend.

182
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.830
I don't like just train and train and train and train and it shouldn't drive you

183
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:08.400
crazy. So I'm like, I gotta leave. So now, uh,

184
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.730
starting back in, after my birthday in April,

185
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.960
I'll be up in Jackson wink for three weeks, but I only go home weekend.

186
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.230
So I'll be there three weeks and then go home for Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

187
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.970
fly back Sunday, be there three weeks again until I have my actual fight.

188
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.710
<v 0>So is the plan to continue boxing as well as fighting in MMA?</v>

189
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.311
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:33.600
The overall goal for me is to be champion in boxing and be a champion in may at

191
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:35.670
the same time, once that's done,

192
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.240
then I don't know what else I could possibly do.

193
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.880
Like that'd be like the end game for me, that's it.

194
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.000
So I know I can be tempting in boxing,

195
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:49.920
which is very easy to do because I already accomplished so much

196
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:53.220
in boxing and the girl just can't with me in boxing. Let's keep it real.

197
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.990
But even it may.

198
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.370
