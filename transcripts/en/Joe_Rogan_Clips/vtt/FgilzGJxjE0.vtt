00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.750
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 1>Experience. I agree with the principle communicate battle of ideas,</v>

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.070
marketplace of ideas, very,

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.370
very big ideas we all want to hear about and what are the best ideas and let's

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.204
rank the ideas.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.820
There are people whose views are so extreme that you can't really bring them

7
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.140
to the table as reasonable negotiating partners for figuring something out,

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.980
right? Like.

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.690
<v 0>Richard Spencer. Sure.</v>

10
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.250
<v 1>Or, or even, I mean, okay. Imagine Farrah Khan, uh, Louis Farrakhan,</v>

11
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.140
who I've spoken out about, uh, many times,

12
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:33.660
imagine that we want to figure out what the tax rate should be.

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.720
Something that politicians have to do all the time.

14
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.030
If you have a group of people who believe that we need a 25% flat tax and a

15
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.290
group of people who want, you know,

16
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.980
like an escalating progressive tax that gets as high as 70% on income,

17
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.200
over 10 million, whatever, right? Like Philadel all,

18
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.200
then all those people are going to be able to have a conversation.

19
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.600
If someone comes in who says any taxes that the government collects are a

20
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.590
form of slavery,

21
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.210
how do you integrate that into the conversation about how to set tax rates?

22
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.850
<v 0>Hmm. You can't right. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.690
<v 1>So all of this stuff, you know, there's this new movement now,</v>

24
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:17.250
which I think is great about long form conversations going in

25
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:21.060
depth, figuring out what our disagreements are like I'm for all of it.

26
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.940
I'm absolutely for all of it. I think you could do it. I do it.

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.260
I do it in short. Okay. But where I do think that there's like a lack of,

28
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.750
of pragmatic reality to it is some people's ideas are so extreme that

29
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:35.520
they can't in any sensible way,

30
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.570
be incorporated into an actual good faith discussion of how society should be

31
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:40.404
organized.

32
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.620
<v 0>The problem with having conversations and scale. Right?</v>

33
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.170
And that's the problem with Twitter and with YouTube that you're dealing with

34
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.660
millions and millions and millions of human beings.

35
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.360
And when you have that broad spectrum of humans,

36
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.880
you're going to have people on the far ends of both sides.

37
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.500
<v 1>And at a certain point there,</v>

38
00:01:55.501 --> 00:02:00.120
a decision has to be made about who actually gets to participate in the

39
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.590
decision-making conversations. Right.

40
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.290
It's great for everybody to have a voice on taxation on Twitter.

41
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.830
But imagine if there was a significant portion of the,

42
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.280
of our elected officials who straight up think taxes are slavery,

43
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.820
like I just don't know how that becomes integrated into a decision about tax

44
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:15.654
policy.

45
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.500
<v 0>Right. Um,</v>

46
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.300
I think that the argument would be that bad ideas should be

47
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.090
combated with good ideas, not with silencing someone.

48
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.100
And that when you do silence, someone,

49
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:30.270
you just sort of create this blockade where the idea of builds up behind it.

50
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.060
And then the opposition to your perspective builds up.

51
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.210
And then people start picking teams and picking sides. And,

52
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.840
and I honestly think that that's something that's going to be going on right now

53
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.270
with the soul Crowder Crowder Vox thing.

54
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.630
I think people are going to pick sides and they love it.

55
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.030
People love a good conflict to get into.

56
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.270
There's a lot of people in the cubicles right now that are weighing in and

57
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.990
firing up and there's people that want to dox them again.

58
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.810
And these people want to infiltrate his Facebook and his Twitter.

59
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.400
That's what people do. Yeah. And you're dealing with, I mean,

60
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.150
what does Crowder have 3.5, 3.8 million, something like that.

61
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.860
<v 1>And I think what you have to also remember is it's not just the reactions that</v>

62
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.750
are, uh, sort of like tailored to continue the escalation. I mean,

63
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.490
in the end, maybe Crowder personally in his personal life does refer to people.

64
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.580
He perceives to be gay or who are gay as queers. I don't know. I don't,

65
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.690
or he uses the word. I have no idea. Well, he didn't use.

66
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.620
<v 0>That word. The.</v>

67
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.490
<v 1>T-shirt has yet.</v>

68
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.740
<v 0>It's a goof. It's actually, as a fig, it doesn't have an asterisk.</v>

69
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.080
The O the a, a is a fig it's for figs. It's the idea.

70
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:41.890
It's an, I got it. But it's a goofy joke. Fair.

71
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.030
<v 1>My point is, um, I don't know, you know,</v>

72
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.960
any sensible person who lives in the west and has access to media like Steven

73
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:54.700
Crowder or whoever knows that the use of that language

74
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.790
has a very specific path that,

75
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.220
and set of reactions that it's going to trigger.

76
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.370
<v 0>So specifically the, that shirt, the shirt.</v>

77
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.810
<v 1>And referring to Carlos Mazda as a Mexican or whatever,</v>

78
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.033
whatever the phrase.

79
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.520
<v 0>See that, that's a weird one. W the one is a weird one,</v>

80
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.230
because it's what it's with LBGTQ. Like what is like, here's a good one,

81
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.820
right? National association for the advancement of colored people. Okay. NAACP,

82
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.110
you can't call people.

83
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.830
<v 1>Sure. But that organization was named a long time ago, and it's,</v>

84
00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:29.890
it's more acronyms than anything else at this point.

85
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.260
<v 0>You Sam, but it's not right. You both,</v>

86
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.700
we both know what the acronym with the individual letters or, um,

87
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.430
words in that acronym are.

88
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.020
I think the word is not a derogatory word.

89
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.290
<v 1>But it is, or it can not be depending on how you go.</v>

90
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.060
<v 0>You. Yeah. Right.</v>

91
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.520
<v 1>Sure. I mean, listen, it's the same way with Jew, right?</v>

92
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.440
If I'm at a family thing and it's a bunch of Jews or whatever,

93
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.090
that's a word that can be used in a way that if someone shows up,

94
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.830
if Richard Spencer shows up or one of his followers and goes to a bar mitzvah

95
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.300
and talks about this room full of Jews, the word is the same word.

96
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.090
Yes. We're talking about two very different things.

97
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.811
<v 0>That's a good point.</v>

98
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:17.260
But should he be allowed to say this room full of Jews allowed?

99
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.160
<v 1>I mean, it's not illegal.</v>

100
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.100
<v 0>No, it's not illegal. It's allowed. Right. He is allowed,</v>

101
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:25.060
but where does it like this room full of w where does he get toxic?

102
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.260
<v 1>Well,</v>

103
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.830
if Richard Spencer shows up at a bar mitzvah and yells about this room full of

104
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:32.260
Jews, I think it's gotten toxic. Yeah.

105
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.940
<v 0>That's a good subject to break this stalemate of this subject, not stalemate,</v>

106
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.690
but just, you know, sorta end this antisemitism. Right.

107
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.510
It seems to be ridiculously on the rise. And that that's stunning to me,

108
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.530
that shocked me when I lie because of the internet,

109
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.460
the internet sort of expose anti-Semitism that I didn't necessarily know existed

110
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.740
at the levels that it existed at. I knew there was antisemites,

111
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:00.020
but I didn't even know there were so brazen and over.

112
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.600
<v 1>They've gotten brazen since January of 2017. Oh, okay.</v>

113
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.160
I don't know that Donald Trump has created antisemites.

114
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.240
In fact, he probably hasn't, well, his son-in-law's Jewish, son-in-law's Jewish,

115
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.120
his daughter converted to Judaism, et cetera. Uh,

116
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.210
but I think that Richard Spencer told me,

117
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.980
we know that Trump is not literally a white nationalist who is going to talk

118
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:27.020
about let's take control back from the Jews,

119
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.370
but we see him as the closest thing to what we would like.

120
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.430
He talks about people from Mexico.

121
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.240
He talks about countries, et cetera. Um,

122
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.800
so it's just emboldened the movement. It doesn't necessarily create.

123
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.341
<v 0>Right.</v>

124
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:48.290
But people from Mexico and countries that doesn't necessarily really equate with

125
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.124
Israel.

126
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.670
<v 1>No. Well, antisemitism in Israel also are two totally separate things. I mean,</v>

127
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.590
used to be against,

128
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.130
you could be against the current Israeli administration as I am like Benjamin

129
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:02.360
Netanyahu and still call out anti-Semitism against Jews in the United States,

130
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:04.400
for example, or whatever. I see what you're saying.

131
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.310
It doesn't one is not directly linked to the other,

132
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.330
but if you're a group that already has these views,

133
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.190
and then you see a guy who opens his campaign, talking about, um,

134
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.160
they're sending rapists and criminals, but some I'm sure are good people.

135
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.700
And I don't want people coming here from countries. What about Norwegians?

136
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.220
Whatever. Right. It's a signal, it's a signal.

137
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:27.200
And I've spoken to former KKK people.

138
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.900
Some of whom are really interesting people to talk to.

139
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.850
And they know exactly why it's appealing because they see the

140
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:37.280
signals and the vocabulary and the dog whistling.

141
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.400
So I think it's just brought it out into the forefront.

142
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.210
I don't know that new anti-Semitism has necessarily been generated.

143
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.260
Although it being in the forefront probably does start to get some people kind

144
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:50.690
of curious, like, oh, maybe all the problems are because of the Jews.

145
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:51.860
I don't know. Hmm.

146
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.360
<v 0>It's just a, I guess they find groups of like-minded folks and they,</v>

147
00:07:57.361 --> 00:07:59.090
they join along. Right. Is that.

148
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.580
<v 1>The antisemites? Yeah. They.</v>

149
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.260
<v 0>Find them online and then you can stumble into it where you ordinarily wouldn't</v>

150
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:08.210
be around people that are having those discussions.

151
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.081
<v 1>That can happen.</v>

152
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:12.680
And a lot of the people that I've talked to that got into those beliefs,

153
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.680
and then out of them said that they got in,

154
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.960
usually on a community level,

155
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:22.160
there was something about the community that was appealing to the gangs gangs,

156
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.720
or in the case of, you know, KKK and white supremacy, people that, um,

157
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.520
had a bad home situation.

158
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.010
And they found a group that would accept them partially.

159
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.100
They would accept them because they were white. Right. Um,

160
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.810
and then they got pulled into the beliefs and eventually they,

161
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.260
they sorta got out of them. Yeah.

162
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.810
<v 0>It's just, uh, so you think the rise of it in 2017,</v>

163
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.530
there's more anti-Semitism or you think it's more or overt?

164
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.380
I believe it's moreover, because Trump was the president. Yeah.

165
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.650
<v 1>Hmm. And, you know, groups that track these, uh,</v>

166
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.970
incidents like the Anti-Defamation league and others,

167
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.420
they have the data and there have been increases. Mm.

168
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.040
<v 0>Yeah. It's, it's stunning to me, you know, you, you see it online,</v>

169
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.420
so many different places now,

170
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.320
and I just don't remember seeing it before or not like that.

171
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.790
Not that you'd run into it so often are people calling people design is shells.

172
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.060
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, that's an important thing to talk about. I mean,</v>

173
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:22.440
people call me that all the time and, um, you know,

174
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:26.730
I feel like that is an issue where I try to speak. I mean,

175
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.930
she'll, to me suggests that you're saying one thing,

176
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.480
but with some kind of other agenda that you're trying to push in some way,

177
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.520
in other words, you are,

178
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.020
you are being in some way deceptive about your actual intentions in what you

179
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:45.450
say. So I think when people call me design is shell.

180
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:49.410
What they mean is I'm talking about one thing with the

181
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.570
secret goal or below the surface goal of actually promoting some

182
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.830
action by the state of Israel. I think that's the idea of a shill.

183
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.990
Um, but you know, I mean, I,

184
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.280
I I'm opposed to the current prime minister in Israel, uh,

185
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.670
I've made clear that is in trouble right now. Uh, yeah. I mean,

186
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:13.500
he's been in tentative trouble for a long time. His wife is in trouble as well,

187
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:16.950
I believe. Um, but that, I mean, the problem is,

188
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.590
and I know that there are people on the left and right.

189
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.760
That when I say this will, I mean,

190
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.580
I'm going to get crushed from what I'm about to say.

191
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.360
Sometimes when someone says Zionist shill,

192
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.410
it's related to your view on the Israeli Palestinian conflict.

193
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.270
Sometimes when someone's has sinus shell,

194
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.620
it's cover for just wanting to insult someone for being Jewish or antisemitism,

195
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.750
you got to look at every instance one by one.

196
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.840
<v 0>And sometimes people just like saying things too.</v>

197
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.230
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It's a popular thing to say, especially if they find.</v>

198
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.480
<v 0>Out that you're Jewish. Absolutely. It's like a thing.</v>
