00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.890
There was some people that got sick and died from the plague really recently,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.750
like within the last couple of months,

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.350
because they had eaten a raw Marmot liver.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.140
A Marmot is like some kind of a rodent and they had killed this Marmot and ate

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.890
its liver. And this is here in the states.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.810
It was in Mongolia. I thought it was in America.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.320
<v 1>Mongolian, Mongolian, a couple died. Right.</v>

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.860
<v 0>But they didn't die doing it in America. Thank God.</v>

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.870
<v 1>To make sure that they didn't come here and get it. But it says.</v>

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.710
<v 0>I thought it, I thought the story was, they died over here and like,</v>

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:44.310
they'd come over here and try to, re-enact some sort of, uh, um,

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.990
a ritualistic meal where they eat this raw liver

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.170
and the ate this raw liver and got the plague sun.

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.050
Does it say where it happened? I think it was there. Okay. Um, yeah.

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.560
It's like certain.

17
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.160
<v 2>Countries in Africa, too. There's like a, you can like eat human, right? Like,</v>

18
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.180
like cannibal, like, uh, legally, I don't know if it's legal.

19
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:10.430
I know there was like a story I read on it or something like that about, uh,

20
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.310
these like places in like Africa. You can like eat human,

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.280
this ultimate stoner talk. It really is. Sorry about that place. I know.

22
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.060
I read about it. I'd be read well.

23
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080
<v 0>Do you remember the, I don't know if you ever saw this vice piece on Liberia.</v>

24
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.160
Yeah. Vice guide to travel Liberia where they were saying this guy who was his

25
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:36.110
name was general butt-naked and, uh, general butt-naked,

26
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.700
uh, he'd become a preacher later in life, but when he was young but naked. Yeah.

27
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:43.460
When he was younger, he would go to war totally naked.

28
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.630
And he would shoot people. Oh, that was in beast of no nation. Was it?

29
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.380
<v 2>Yeah. Usually based in donation now. Okay. Uh, EGIS Elba.</v>

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.550
He plays like an EDM mean or a, um, uh, what's that thing called Kony,

31
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.600
whatever it was. Anyway, he's got these child soldiers basically. And uh, yeah,

32
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:01.250
they just go from my tribe to tribe and just kill it. They're like,

33
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.450
and they just genocide.

34
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.200
<v 0>Still a bunch of tribes. Whatever happened with that Kony.</v>

35
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.870
<v 2>Remember that? I think he's still like a, like a warlord, but.</v>

36
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.170
<v 0>Do you remember how it was like this gigantic movement?</v>

37
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.390
And it was this big thing and everybody was talking about it.

38
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.540
And then this one guy in San Diego that was a part of starting it.

39
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.960
He wound up being naked, wandering around the street,

40
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:24.500
masturbating in front of people and some crazy that made him credible.

41
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.190
Then I make that up. He was doing something along those lines. Right. And he,

42
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.540
he basically had a schizophrenia break or a psychotic breaker. I'm not a doctor.

43
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.860
Something went wrong, something went wrong.

44
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.570
<v 2>Yeah. He blew a foot. That's the cat. Yeah. Uh, they called him tripod in that.</v>

45
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.790
But I think you're talking about the same guy, like when he went to war,

46
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.340
like as a child soldier. Yeah. He was, yeah.

47
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.150
<v 0>The thing is a different guy because this guy,</v>

48
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:46.100
his name literally was general butt-naked.

49
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:48.440
But I think there's a bunch of them that did that. But anyway,

50
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.670
on the Liberia show, he said that he busted these street cart,

51
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.230
guys selling human meat.

52
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.630
And he said he knew because he knew what meat tastes like,

53
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.250
because he had eaten it. What the? So he, that it was human meat.

54
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.560
He knew it wasn't the work. He knew it wasn't beef.

55
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.390
<v 2>He is crazy by the way, bro. I mean, like they stay self snail.</v>

56
00:03:06.391 --> 00:03:07.350
They have slaves out there.

57
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.160
<v 0>Just imagine the, the,</v>

58
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.980
the gall of going to the cops and saying that man is selling human meat.

59
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.600
Well, how do you know? I kind of know. Well, because I've eat.

60
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.373
<v 2>What'd you eat human.</v>

61
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.200
<v 0>Um, it depends on what you have to do to stay alive. Right. Right.</v>

62
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.650
Like where are you? What's app? Like if you were in that movie alive,

63
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.240
when they're scooping the broken spoke, Donner pass or something like that,

64
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.980
what are you going to do? But then the.

65
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.300
<v 2>I'm saying like, as a food, like, you know,</v>

66
00:03:36.301 --> 00:03:39.180
you go to like a restaurant as a food. That's what I'm saying. Like,

67
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:40.620
if they cook it up nice. You know what I mean?

68
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.740
<v 0>Felt like eaten a dude's foot. You got foot soup.</v>

69
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.800
<v 2>Or Dick soup, but a Dick burger. Well.</v>

70
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.250
<v 0>There was one guy. Okay. Was another, there was one guy story,</v>

71
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.910
but there was one guy that I had read about where, uh, online,

72
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.940
he requested that someone kill him and eat him.

73
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.580
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.060
<v 0>And I think it was in Germany. Of course they met together,</v>

75
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.110
got together with the guy,

76
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.360
the guy cut his Dick off and they cooked it and they ate it together.

77
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.300
He ate part of his Dick and then the guy wound up killing him. And um, wait,

78
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.580
wait, wait.

79
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.860
<v 2>So this guy was alive and they cooked natives Dick. Oh,</v>

80
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.893
he ate his Dick together.

81
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.560
<v 0>They did. They did it together. So did it was, it was this guy's idea.</v>

82
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.000
He requested it on like Craigslist or one of those things.

83
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.480
Let's cut my Dick off and then we're going to eat it and then you're going to

84
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:37.050
kill me. And he wanted it. He wanted the guy to eat him too.

85
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:38.760
And I think the guy did eat some of them.

86
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.260
But there was a question as to whether or not when a person is a lot to eat.

87
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.400
How do you, how do you prosecute that? What do you do? Like if someone said,

88
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:49.170
I want you to cut my Dick off and you cut their Dick off,

89
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.390
I want to cook it and eat it. And then you both cook it and eat it.

90
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.270
I want you to kill me and eat me. Okay. And they got killed them and eats them.

91
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:56.790
Like, what is that?

92
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.070
Is that a regular murder? I think I'm reading the same story.

93
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.500
<v 2>Manslaughter. Oh, they filmed.</v>

94
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.090
<v 0>It. Yeah. Yeah. They filmed it.</v>

95
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.610
<v 2>Like him cutting his Dick off and the eating it. Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.860
I think they filmed the whole murder. What's the threshold.

97
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.053
So it's like a snuff film.

98
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.560
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. But the guy requested it. That's gnarly. Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.020
Is it pull it up so we can, uh, we can read it.

100
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.470
<v 1>This one from 2003. That's what? I'm not sure.</v>

101
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.450
<v 0>Yeah. That's the, that's the one. Yeah. Yeah. Yup.</v>

102
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.860
Dine from my live body. Wow. Yeah.

103
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.800
He posted a personal ad saying seeking well-built man,

104
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.110
18 to 30 years old for slaughter

105
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.860
wo for slaughter. He wrote,

106
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:45.750
I offer myself to you and we'll let you dine from my live body.

107
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.880
Not butchery dining,

108
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.060
whoever really all caps wants to do it.

109
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.360
We'll need a real all caps victim, all caps,

110
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.540
exclamation point there's two started swapping increasingly explicit

111
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.650
emails. And on March 9th, 2001, Braden took a day off work,

112
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.740
never to return. He sold everything. He owned,

113
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.690
including his treasured sports car,

114
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.790
wiped his computer hard drive and bought a one-way ticket to castle near

115
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:17.450
Frankfurt. Arman met him off the train.

116
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.680
They bought painkillers at a chemical shop and headed back to the house.

117
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.550
At first brand has got cold feet and wanted returned to Berlin

118
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.620
muse said,

119
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.510
but he reconsidered swallowed painkillers and medication to

120
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.150
make him sleepy. He said, now do it.

121
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.010
You sit the video camera rolling and went to work with a kitchen knife. Wow,

122
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.480
dude, we went into the bedroom. How did he say talking about use the bathroom?

123
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.800
How do you say his name's muse?

124
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.720
Emmy muse muse told the police brain is lay in the bath.

125
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.550
So the blood could flow away and Brandice slowly began to lose consciousness.

126
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.390
Muse pass the time, reading a star Trek novel.

127
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.990
When the Berliner finally passed out, Mews cut his throat,

128
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.030
zoomed over a number. He was consumed over a number of months,

129
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.990
the 30 kilos of flesh. He had put in his freezer. Wow.

130
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.410
Hughes went on the internet and search of a new victim. Oh.

131
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:18.830
So he became like a tastes frustrated that he could only find people looking for

132
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:22.370
cannibal role-plays muse began boasting about Brandis.

133
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.840
Someone from the chat room,

134
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:27.440
informed the federal police who swooped in on Armand muse house in

135
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:28.940
December 10th.

136
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:33.470
Last surprising the coy cannibal then startling the unsuspecting neighbors.

137
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.050
Ooh, wow. No, that's that a sociopath.

138
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.650
<v 2>Psychopath.</v>

139
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.710
And you were saying earlier because are you a psychopath or you're a sociopath

140
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.500
at that point. I mean, how do you not feel empathy?

141
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:46.810
Even for a guy who's telling you to kill you, but you're just looking, you know,

142
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.450
to kill somebody because you have a taste for blood though. It became.

143
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.830
<v 0>A thing, right? Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.790
I bet whatever he did during the day was boring.

145
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.440
And I bet that as psychotic as it is, was exciting.

146
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.840
And then he became a serial killer chasing that feeling. Yeah.

147
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.370
What is it, Jamie? What's the matter he's got it.

148
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.200
<v 1>I found a website that had seven or something. Interesting facts about this guy.</v>

149
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:14.830
This is the first.

150
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.920
<v 2>One you saw Ted and ate the peanuts with his victim. Yeah.</v>

151
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.060
<v 0>That was, that was the story, right? Yeah. Yeah. They, they cooked together.</v>

152
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.800
Sauteed it. Wow. Look at that image. That's not really how.

153
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.920
<v 1>It went down. Yeah. That's enough though. Does it say like.</v>

154
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.810
<v 0>What, how they saw the penis.</v>

155
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.290
<v 1>[Inaudible] for them, either of them to enjoy.</v>

156
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.020
So they proceeded to fry it up with some of his, uh,

157
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.850
flesh and fat and a bit of garlic.

158
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.460
<v 0>Wow. That's hard. I mean, that's not that's well, I guess it's like,</v>

159
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.250
you're worried about the end, right? And then you just say,

160
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.550
I'm going to take control. I'm going to bring the end on. And here it is,

161
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.090
you got where you were eating my Dick. This is over this doc.

162
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.790
We're eating my day. This is not going to last eat my Dick.

163
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.690
And then he goes into the tub to die out from warm water,

164
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:08.520
with his Dick hole, bleeding out, just really insane stuff. I mean,

165
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:09.354
that's really.

166
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.070
<v 2>It. I mean, to live through that, by the way. Well, you.</v>

167
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.140
<v 0>Got to think that there's just such a wide range</v>

168
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.310
of crazy people.

169
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.000
And there's some crazy people like that that want to be eaten and some crazy

170
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.840
people want to eat you. And if they find each other, no, that's,

171
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.430
that's the beauty.

172
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.740
<v 2>Of the internet. You can do that. Now. You couldn't do that back in, you know,</v>

173
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.140
the Donner era or even the, uh,

174
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.880
the nineties with a Brazilian soccer team each other.

175
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:32.720
<v 0>Well,</v>

176
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.320
how long do you think that guy could could've kept it together if he just ate

177
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:40.610
that one dude before he could find another guy? Yeah. We'll let him eat him.

178
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.840
If that was his thing.

179
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.090
<v 2>What'd he just write exactly.</v>

180
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.330
<v 0>What do you go? What do you go? Dexter. Okay. And that's what I'm saying.</v>

181
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:52.040
Like bad people. Yeah. Ooh, that it's terrifying.

182
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.810
I mean the, I mean.

183
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.290
<v 2>Just to just go there and kill the guy, read a star Trek novel, by the way,</v>

184
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.990
the guy's bleeding out in a tub after.

185
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.520
<v 0>You ate his Dick. That's some psycho picking Dick out of your teeth.</v>

186
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.150
Not.

187
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.280
<v 1>That I'm not sharing with you guys. There are pictures of this.</v>

188
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.810
<v 0>Online. Oh no, no. Don't do this. Yeah. I don't need this. What?</v>

189
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.350
I don't want to say. Yeah. So Dick is to shoot. You're going to say like,

190
00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:18.590
don't do this, whatever you're going to do, don't do this. It said.

191
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.170
<v 1>The jury seek therapy after they watched the video.</v>

192
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.260
<v 2>Oh yeah. I bet there's going to be some PTSD.</v>

193
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.581
<v 0>Of course they did.</v>

194
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:27.860
He imagined being a juror and they force you to watch that video.

195
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.500
<v 2>I don't want to see anybody yet. I don't want to see you eat a Dick. And.</v>

196
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.940
<v 0>You're the only ones watching it. Right.</v>

197
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:34.850
Because you got to think that it's not like they're broadcasting on tele.

198
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:35.770
I mean, not.

199
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:36.920
<v 2>Fear fact. You guys did it like, uh,</v>

200
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.530
like it was always like the big thing of like eating somebody's penis, right.

201
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:41.230
Or something. Something.

202
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.990
<v 0>No one time that eat, right? Yeah. They had to eat like bull Dick,</v>

203
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.440
dear Dick pig, Dick or something like that. I forget what the decor,

204
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.890
but it was a bunch of different kinds of. No,

205
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.510
it's just something so strange.

206
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.740
I had a bit about it that like never in my life that I think that I'd be

207
00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:05.090
standing in front of a girl with a plate full of animal going, you can do it.

208
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.370
Hang in there. Keep going, keep going.

209
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.000
Oh, just you control your mind. Control your mind. Yeah.

210
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.350
Coaching them through it. Right.

211
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.750
<v 2>Through eating, eating pig, pig, penis, ridiculous pig Dick. But.</v>

212
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.600
<v 0>It's like you can't, I mean, it's not legal to kill yourself.</v>

213
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.270
It's illegal. Suicide's illegal.

214
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.970
And it's not legal to eat people.

215
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.260
And even if someone tells you to kill them and eat them, you're not allowed to,

216
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.250
even.

217
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.680
<v 2>In Germany, like even like that because that's assisted suicide. Right.</v>

218
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.543
Technically.

219
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.400
<v 0>Yeah. But it's cannibalism too. Like we don't allow that. No,</v>

220
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:47.870
mostly humanity doesn't allow that. Mostly there's some tribes.

221
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:51.740
There's a few tribes to still practice with them. They that particularly, uh,

222
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.060
I guess I was reading.

223
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.180
<v 2>I'm just not interested in like learning what, like what a human tastes like.</v>

224
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.080
Well.

225
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.910
<v 0>It's probably not good. Right? Trail cannibalism.</v>

226
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.520
There's no laws against cannibalism per se. But in most,

227
00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:09.720
if not all states there've been enacted laws that indirectly make it impossible

228
00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:12.990
to legally obtain and consume the body matter.

229
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.230
<v 2>Well, when you put it that way, yeah. It doesn't sound too appetizer.</v>

230
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.330
If you can get it, the body matters somehow.

231
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.100
<v 0>Wait a minute. Wasn't there a show on CNN or one of their guys.</v>

232
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.150
They, they wanted him to eat charred flash.

233
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.810
Like he was, uh, examining different religions.

234
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.880
Do you remember something along these lines?

235
00:12:32.881 --> 00:12:36.600
It was like some outrageous thing because like Guppta Sondra or the uh, no,

236
00:12:36.601 --> 00:12:39.930
I don't think it was Sanjay Gupta. It was someone else. There was, they were,

237
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.960
he,

238
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.960
he visited all of these different religions and

239
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.110
people that lived their lives. Different, weird ways.

240
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.260
<v 2>I know the show you're talking about. Yeah. I don't remember that episode.</v>

241
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.190
God you're right. It wasn't goop that it was a, a, another correspondent.

242
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.780
<v 0>He eventually got fired for CNN for saying something about Trump,</v>

243
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.430
which is hilarious. Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.900
It was Iceland sparks outrage. After eating human brain in new show,

245
00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:13.440
it takes like charcoal. See the problem with that too,

246
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.470
by eating a human brain. Is that, I mean,

247
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.640
maybe these cults or these tribes or whatever he's involved with does do that.

248
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.790
If the brain has prions,

249
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.800
prions are what gives you mad cow disease. Oh really?

250
00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:29.900
Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.070
<v 2>Can, yeah. You can get sick from that and die.</v>

252
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.980
<v 0>Yucks felled crap. What does that name event? Jake. Chuck Jakub.</v>

253
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.160
Jakub crux. Feld disease. Okay. And it's, um,

254
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.400
it's basically mad cow disease and you get it from prions.

255
00:13:44.401 --> 00:13:46.800
Get it from brain tissue. So any, it takes,

256
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.780
they survive like thousands of degrees. Yeah. Crux, felled,

257
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.973
Yacob disease. That's it.

258
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.790
It's a rare degenerative fatal brain disorder and affects about one person.

259
00:13:56.791 --> 00:14:01.560
So some people get it without cannibalism. Um, but it also does happen.

260
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:02.881
See, one person,

261
00:14:02.881 --> 00:14:06.960
every million worldwide in the United States are about 350 cases per year.

262
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.480
Crazy. So it must be like really charred though. It doesn't matter.

263
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:15.660
I don't think really. Yeah. I don't think it does. He's still, he's still alive.

264
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.440
Yeah.

265
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.880
He might not have had the prions of someone who has a disease.

266
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.170
But if, if that person did, that's why it, like,

267
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.290
it has to be the temperature that it has to be cooked at.

268
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.250
It's supposed to be insane.

269
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.050
I think prions can survive like more than a thousand degrees for a long period

270
00:14:34.051 --> 00:14:37.980
of time. Okay. And that's one of the fears of like mad cow disease.

271
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:41.430
Like you really are not going to be able to cook it well enough to keep that

272
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.080
from getting in your bloodstream. Yeah. I see Google.

273
00:14:46.081 --> 00:14:49.230
How long Jamie Google off the, off the chain today,

274
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.970
you got extra a lot of flesh today. Yeah. How well,

275
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.800
what temperature do PRI on surviving?

276
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.530
Cause uh, I think it's more than a thousand degrees and they can still survive,

277
00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:07.450
which I remember reading that going, oh, this is terrible mad cow disease.

278
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.220
Zombies. Zombies.

279
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.010
<v 2>Yeah, exactly. It depends. I mean, I mean you have.</v>

280
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.560
<v 0>Your food, so you're not worried about that. You have,</v>

281
00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:18.220
but you shouldn't be because there's a thing called chronic wasting disease and

282
00:15:18.221 --> 00:15:22.660
chronic wasting disease is essentially a form of like mad cow

283
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.740
disease. Like very, very similar type of degenerative disease that affects deer,

284
00:15:26.741 --> 00:15:29.020
that it's affecting an increasing number of them.

285
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.370
They're spreading across the country. Now it hasn't made the jump to humans yet,

286
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.663
but it could.

287
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.950
<v 1>I don't want to worry you here, but you can't hunt deer.</v>

288
00:15:38.951 --> 00:15:42.990
No more mans can not be destroyed by boiling alcohol assets,

289
00:15:42.991 --> 00:15:45.220
standard autoclaving methods or radiation.

290
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.100
<v 0>Or radiation. That's what I'm saying.</v>

291
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.610
They're like roaches they'll survive everything. Well, you know what they are.

292
00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:55.780
They're God's poison when God's like E NEF,

293
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.760
like no fire, no flames, no ice, no water. He ain't fixing this.

294
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.770
This is coming in hot.

295
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.500
<v 2>And this is the you can't Dianes.</v>

296
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:06.603
<v 0>Are forever.</v>

297
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:12.100
Proteins are in the hard to kill hall of fame on maybe more common than we

298
00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:15.490
realize, see, this is what I'm talking about. So these things,

299
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.970
this is what affects people when they get mad cow disease.

300
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:24.280
And this is also what it affects. Cannibals crux, Feld, Yakup,

301
00:16:24.281 --> 00:16:25.330
or Jakub Cooksville.

302
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.870
<v 1>Crux, Feld. Okay.</v>

303
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.780
<v 0>Crux, Feld, Yakup disease, but it affects cannibals.</v>

304
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.270
They found out the cannibals in New Zealand, new Guinea animals in new Guinea,

305
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.950
um, exhibited the same sort of, um, symptoms as people with, uh,

306
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.780
Crossfield, Jakub disease,

307
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.300
Google that German cannibals cannibals that get crux, felled,

308
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.110
Jakub disease, those poor cannibals while they they're heat and brain matter.

309
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.130
Okay. Yeah. Just eat, just eat the flesh fry, the flesh sheet, the booty,

310
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.060
just the only park.

311
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.320
<v 1>They evolved their resistance to it because.</v>

312
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.920
<v 0>They were getting so much. Oh my God. That's crazy. Wow.</v>

313
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.990
The cannibalism in one Papa new Guinea tribe led to the spread of a fatal brain
