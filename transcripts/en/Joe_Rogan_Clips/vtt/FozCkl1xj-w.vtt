00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, how about the other prince? So you gotta go to,</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.480
I guess, how about the other prince? The one that's Epstein's friend. Oh.

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.160
<v 1>Oh, Andrew, Andrew. Yeah. Yeah. That was, that was what.</v>

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.440
<v 0>What, first of all,</v>

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.480
how odd is that guy when they're interviewing him and talking to him? Yeah.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.383
It's like what.

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.910
<v 1>McQueen kicked him to the curb very quickly.</v>

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.550
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's very strange. Yeah. That,</v>

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.270
what is your take on this whole Epstein thing? First of all,

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.430
can we justg look at that? So you sure she's 18? &lt;laugh&gt;.

11
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.350
<v 1>You're telling me, you're telling me that. Yeah, she does.</v>

12
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.110
<v 0>Not look 18. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; she looks 16. Are you sure? You.</v>

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.180
<v 1>Sure? What, what up that a show? That.</v>

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.660
<v 0>Is, yeah. What a show. So let me, let me ask you this right off the bat. Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.660
Well, I don't know what I'm gonna ask you. He didn't kill himself, right?

16
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.780
I don't.

17
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.100
<v 1>Believe so. Thank you. No, no. You know the, but you know me, I'm not,</v>

18
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:56.020
I'm not conspiracy guy, right? I'm I don't, dispi on rabbitals very often,

19
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.500
but no, I don't think there's any way in hell. He killed.

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.580
<v 0>Himself. Michael Shermer. Who's the,</v>

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.450
the head of skeptics magazine and who doesn't believe anything found

22
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.970
out that the, the tapes were missing and that the,

23
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.850
the cameras didn't work and that the tapes were deleted from the first

24
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250
accidentally deleted from the first time he attempted suicide and Shermer's

25
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.330
like, oh, this is a conspiracy. Like,

26
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.170
it was enough evidence that one of the biggest skeptic, a professional skeptic.

27
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:23.200
Skeptic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Professional. He doesn't don't believe anything. No.

28
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.720
<v 1>There's no, there's no, there's just, no, I, I,</v>

29
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:30.200
there's no way I could be convinced that, that he, he offed himself, uh, no way.

30
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.060
So.

31
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.600
<v 0>And he knew too much. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.080
<v 1>And you know, it's, it's, it's astounding, but, but yeah. What a, what a,</v>

33
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.560
what a show. But, uh, you know, nobody's gonna get to the bottom of.

34
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.270
<v 0>Anything. Yeah. But that's a crazy one. Like they got him in the jail.</v>

35
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.150
The guards are somehow or another getting in trouble.

36
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.270
So who knows what the guards are gonna say? They might get suicide.

37
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.310
My favorite part was the guy they chose for his cellmate.

38
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.070
Do you see the gorilla? They chose for a sail mate. Yeah.

39
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.590
<v 1>Reminded me of that. Uh, Richard Pryor, that old Richard Pryor movie.</v>

40
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.470
&lt;laugh&gt; I dunno if you remember that one. &lt;laugh&gt;.

41
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.660
<v 0>The guy, Hey, look at this guy. Yeah. This giant.</v>

42
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.620
Gumba this huge Italian ex-cop who's a murderer and a drug runner.

43
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.740
I mean, this guy is built like a brick house.

44
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
And this is Epstein's cellmate. Yeah. It's like what? Like,

45
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.980
you can't even make this stuff up. He.

46
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.780
<v 1>Says he never touched him. They, I.</v>

47
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.733
<v 0>I, of course.</v>

48
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.810
<v 1>Why would I touch Trump? Nicholas targli.</v>

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.610
<v 0>Yeah. What does he, what does it say? Timeline of events in quadruple homicide.</v>

50
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:35.130
Is that what it says? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. So this guy, this giant.

51
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.250
<v 1>Likes dogs though. Yeah. He loves dogs.</v>

52
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.570
<v 0>You keep 'em from all the people that he killed. Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.410
&lt;laugh&gt; they bark when they're coming around, you can grab your gun.

54
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.960
It's a good move. It's it's just crazy.

55
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.080
There's so many pieces to the puzzle that are so ridiculously obvious.

56
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.680
And then when you find out that Clinton flew with him at least 26 times. Yeah.

57
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.600
26 times.

58
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.880
<v 1>Yeah. I had no idea. Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.120
<v 0>Jeff's guy. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.160
<v 1>No, I, it it's, it's, it's just one of those things. And again, I don't, I'm,</v>

61
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm not a buyer on these sort of things, but you, you look at it,

62
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.120
you look at the facts around and you think they just know there's no way in

63
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:11.840
hell. Yeah. What you and that guy must have known you.

64
00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:14.280
What you would've thought that Epstein would've said to myself or said to

65
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:16.760
himself, I'm gonna get killed here. If I'm not careful.

66
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.361
<v 0>Well,</v>

67
00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:19.990
he probably didn't think is ever gonna get to the point where they were actually

68
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.350
jailing him' you know, when they actually that true got,

69
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:25.110
cause remember he had that deal where he was on work release,

70
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.430
so he could just do whatever he want and off for 16 hours of a day.

71
00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:30.430
Then he had to check into the jail at night. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.030
And who even knows what that means.

73
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.590
He might have checked in and just went home again. And it seems like they,

74
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.900
they had set something up for him to make it very easy for him be incarcerated

75
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:43.340
for what should be a, a pretty heinous crime. I mean, he was,

76
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.500
he would think sex with underage girls. Right. And, and sex.

77
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940
<v 1>Traffickingtraffick. I mean, sextraffick not just him doing. Yeah. I mean,</v>

78
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.340
it's just the extent to which, and so, yeah. But then you look at, uh,

79
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.780
I forget what her name is. The sort of the assistant Giselle. Yeah. What name?

80
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.850
Jalaine.

81
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.530
<v 0>Jolaine.</v>

82
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.250
<v 1>Lane. Max. Well, how.</v>

83
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.890
<v 2>He say, what is he say? It has an estimate,</v>

84
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:05.170
but I've heard it pronounced with the S or without, so gala or just lane. Okay.

85
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.410
<v 0>I don't know, gala or just lane, whatever. It's called a G rocker. Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.770
So grocker's out there hiding in the bushes in Columbia or something. Right?

87
00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:13.690
Where is she? Where is she? Yeah.

88
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.290
<v 1>That's what I was gonna say. I mean, she must be,</v>

89
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.530
you would assume they've deposed or at this point.

90
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.330
<v 0>Or, you know, she must have something.</v>

91
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.600
She must have some kill switch where if the goes down,

92
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.440
all the Clinton tapes come piling out onto the floor of, uh, well,

93
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.040
Glen green Walls's house, you were thinking.

94
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.960
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

95
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.880
<v 0>You brought, brought it around.</v>

96
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.753
<v 1>A Glen greenwa.</v>

97
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.280
<v 0>Glen it's bill. Can we talk?</v>

98
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.560
<v 1>Yeah. Maybe, you know what? Maybe I should convince, uh, oh, there she.</v>

99
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 0>Is. That's when she was at, in and out reading a book on, uh, X,</v>

100
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.190
CIA agents who have been murdered. That's literally what she was,

101
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:47.630
write reading a book on. Right. Wasn't that? Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.190
It was about CIA operats been murdered. So the idea was that what they said,

103
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.270
what people believe, and there's many different versions of what people believe,

104
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.270
but look, how many pictures she posed for. It's so strange,

105
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.700
but what many people believe was that &lt;affirmative&gt; what he was doing was

106
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.900
compromising a lot of these wealthy,

107
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.420
powerful people by getting videotapes of them, hooking up with young girls,

108
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.300
including prince Andrew, right? Yeah.

109
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.060
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, for whatever reason, you know, I have you heard of.</v>

110
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 0>Anything like this before? Is this something that's been done in the past? Not.</v>

111
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.930
<v 1>That I've heard of. I mean, not, I mean, I'm sure it's, it's, you know,</v>

112
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:24.970
anytime you see some freak show, it's never, the first time it's happened.

113
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:27.970
Right. Right. I mean it's so you have to assume it's happened. But, uh,

114
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.410
to the degree that it's got this level of, of, of, uh,

115
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.210
celebrities and big time names, I mean, it works so.

116
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.730
<v 0>Well. And I'm gonna tell you something after the show's over,</v>

117
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.130
tell you something after the show's over. But.

118
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.600
<v 1>Um, we can just tell me it just, you want me to talking? Yeah. If you whisper.</v>

119
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.800
<v 0>I hear, I hear you in my ears in.</v>

120
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.960
<v 1>North Koreans really do that. Sorry about the north Koreans used to, uh,</v>

121
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.640
that was their, that was their, uh, phone, uh, uh,

122
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.840
security is they would get on the phone and they,

123
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:57.960
when they had something really classified to talk about did whisper,

124
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.280
they would whisper &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah. So you think, oh,

125
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.200
okay. That's hilarious. We'll never figure that out.

126
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.280
<v 0>That's really funny. Yeah. Really? That's how they did it.</v>

127
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.160
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Well, part of it was, uh, years ago, I, I,</v>

128
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.360
I think they just never believed any, any westerner could understand Korean. I,

129
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.910
I think that was kind of part of it was it, they just, we were,

130
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.110
we were all too stupid or we were just so complicated that they we'd never be

131
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:22.510
able to figure out what they were saying in their own.

132
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.150
<v 0>Language. That's the price you paid for being so insulated, right? Yeah.</v>

133
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:25.970
You never,

134
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.950
you don't really understand what the what's really going on in the outside

135
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.310
world. Cause they don't really have the internet.

136
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.670
<v 1>When was the last time we talked about North Korea a while we just pushed that</v>

137
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:36.030
right off the, the front or, but, but, but, but.

138
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.780
<v 0>To get did to get back, we can talk about North Korea, but to,</v>

139
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:39.980
to get back to this Epstein thing,

140
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.980
is that a common strategy that intelligence agencies would use where they would

141
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:47.260
try to compromise people in order to get, like,

142
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:48.900
what would be the benefit if you had to like,

143
00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:53.300
if the Maad was doing that and they were doing that to and using that was that's

144
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:56.020
the, the theories of epepstein right.

145
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.130
<v 1>Um, yeah, it's a good, it's a good point.</v>

146
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.970
I I'd say from an Intel services perspective. I mean,

147
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.490
one thing I will say is the us, uh,

148
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.130
and people never gonna believe this because I'm saying it they'll say, oh,

149
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:10.930
that's. He just, but the us, uh, the agency doesn't do that. We don't use, um,

150
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.090
honey traps. We don't do that sort of thing because, um,

151
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.330
that sort of leverage always it's, it's always gonna head south on you.

152
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.640
And so we don't, you know, try to coerce somebody in that, uh,

153
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.800
sort of a relationship and then we can take advantage of, um,

154
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.400
and yet other services do Russians being one of 'em. They do that all the time.

155
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.120
Um, Israelis. Yeah. They've, they've had some very successful, uh,

156
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.630
efforts to do that. And if you can, if you get somebody in that position,

157
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.030
what it doesn't really doesn't matter how they're compromising themselves,

158
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.350
whether you're putting themselves in with,

159
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:49.430
with like an Epstein situation where suddenly you you've got them, uh, you know,

160
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:52.550
got video of them with a, with an underage person, uh,

161
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.070
or whether they've provided a document that they shouldn't provide.

162
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.340
It's all this, the concept is always the same, right? It doesn't a minute.

163
00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:03.340
What that, what that action is you are, uh,

164
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.380
you're getting them on the hook. You're, you're,

165
00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:08.980
you're getting something that's, leveragable over them. And if,

166
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.700
if they don't just go forward, immediately say,

167
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.540
and turn around to their boss and say, I'm guilty, did this, um, sorry,

168
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.890
then they're compromised. And then you've got them as an Intel service.

169
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:24.970
You've got them. You can start reeling the hook in because now, you know,

170
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.490
you know, that not only did they do something that provided you with a document,

171
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.610
even if it was an unclassified, if I go to somebody,

172
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:32.290
if I'm developing a relationship with somebody,

173
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.450
some target overseas or whatever, and I'm thinking, all right,

174
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.690
I'm now I'm exploring this. Person's got access.

175
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:39.610
They're in an interesting position. They're an interesting job.

176
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.720
And they've got access to information that,

177
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:45.760
that we want to know that's priority target. And then I want to say, okay,

178
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.000
now I wanna develop a relationship a little bit.

179
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.240
Maybe I bump into the person at a few parties.

180
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.120
Maybe we're in the same parenteacher organization, whatever the is, right.

181
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:55.840
Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; our kids play on the same soccer team.

182
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.440
So then I go and I think, okay, what do I want to do?

183
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.200
I want to test the waters a little bit. I'm not gonna say, Hey, listen,

184
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.080
you know, I understand you work at the foreign ministry here in, in, you know,

185
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.640
whatever country you happen to be in. Uh, how about you give me some documents,

186
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.920
but instead, you know, maybe it's something different.

187
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:14.040
Maybe they work the foreign ministry. Maybe they work at a, uh,

188
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.590
eras space business, you know, that's a target and you say,

189
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.030
but you've developed a bit of a relationship. And then you say, yeah,

190
00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:22.590
my kid's doing this school project. And you know,

191
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.870
it's all about whatever hypersonic flight, you know, and, and, uh,

192
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.150
you know, you know, that they work at some, you know, aerospace company and say,

193
00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:34.390
ah, you know, do you have anything just on hypersonics? You know,

194
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.260
and you're not looking for anything classified. You're just looking for a, a,

195
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.580
a research paper or a study or something, you know?

196
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.900
And if they come back and say, yeah, you know what, here,

197
00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:46.460
this is an interesting, you know, study, you know? And they, they,

198
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.180
now that act alone, they're not giving you something classified,

199
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.820
but that act alone means something big. Right.

200
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.020
It means they were taskable in a sense, right. They,

201
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.610
to your request for information, the suckers, not suckers necessarily,

202
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.250
it could be an enormously smart person, but, you know, and, and, and,

203
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:05.890
and smart people get, yeah, they get, they get suckered into it.

204
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.010
I guess you could put it that way. But, um, yeah. So anyway, then you,

205
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.970
you go from there, then you ratchet it up slowly, you know, bit by bit.

206
00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:15.490
If you've got the timeframe to do it, maybe sometimes, you know,

207
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:18.480
you gotta or timeframe because there's a requirement to get so something mm-hmm

208
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.760
&lt;affirmative&gt; and you gotta, you gotta accelerate the whole process. Anyway. So,

209
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.360
but my point being is it's allleverageable and Epstein was obviously getting

210
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.000
leverage on all these different people for whatever his purpose was.

211
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.040
<v 0>What do you think? That's what the question is? Like, what could he possibly,</v>

212
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.840
a lot of were scientists. He went with a lot of like celebrities. There was,

213
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:36.870
Hey.

214
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.830
<v 1>A state. I don't think he needed money. Right. Well, what, well, what was it?</v>

215
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.510
I dont know. I mean, maybe he, maybe he just, who knows,

216
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.830
maybe he got off on sort of being the, the, the kingpin and this whole thing.

217
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.110
And, and I, it it's a good question to.

218
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.270
<v 0>It had to be funded. Right. So, I mean,</v>

219
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:55.710
there had to be something valuable that they were getting from it. I'm guessing.

220
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.580
<v 1>I don't know. It hasn't been spelled out to me. I, yeah. Yeah.</v>

221
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.900
<v 0>Like I've tried to figure out the angle, but I, I mean,</v>

222
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.540
I get the idea of you would have leverage over these people.

223
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.180
You have't been compromising situations, and then they would do things for you,

224
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.020
but what would they do for you? Yeah. Like what, yeah. What.

225
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.700
<v 1>Is he getting bill clean? It's a good question. And providing him with access,</v>

226
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:18.690
maybe he, he, he liked being close to, you know, this seat of power or maybe,

227
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.131
you know,

228
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:22.050
he liked being close to what he thought was like a Royal family member,

229
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.170
you know, maybe who knows. Cause he had all,

230
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:26.890
it sounds like he had all the money he needed. Right. So maybe it was,

231
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.930
it was that sort of access that, that, uh, blew his skirt up. I don't know. But,

232
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.250
um, it is, yeah, it is interesting. But, um,

233
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.520
I don't think, I mean, look, it's, it's just like been kicked to the curb.

234
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:43.080
Obviously they're doing the trial, I guess, to some degree, but I don't think,

235
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.640
I don't know what, where they stand in that trial nothing's.

236
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.800
<v 0>Gonna happen. Yeah. Nothing's gonna happen.</v>

237
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.120
We've already swept it under the rug.

238
00:11:47.121 --> 00:11:49.480
And there's already new stories out that have got our attention.

239
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.600
We forget about things so quickly today,

240
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.920
the news cycle is so fast when something happens,

241
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.400
even something is ridiculous as the Epstein case where it's so obvious that he

242
00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:01.440
was murdered. And then Michael Badden goes on 60 minutes and says,

243
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.800
this is consistent with someone who has strangled.

244
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.280
I've never in all my years of seeing people hanged,

245
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:07.800
I've never seen him with these kind of fractures.

246
00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:09.920
This is fractures or indicative of strangulation.

247
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.670
<v 1>And that is one serious mind. Itdo too right? Michael. Yeah.</v>

248
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.350
Tremendous amount of experience. And, and you know, he doesn't,

249
00:12:15.351 --> 00:12:18.910
he doesn't blow smoke up anybody's. Right? No, he's, he's very measured. And,

250
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.710
and you know, now obviously he was there on behalf of, of uh Epstein's brother,

251
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.950
I guess. Um, but you know, I, yeah, I, anyway, it's just,

252
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.830
it is, it's one of those things where you think the, maybe I'm gonna put,

253
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.060
ask it' something we should explore. I wanna.

254
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.620
<v 0>Go visit their cop in jail. See what he he's probably got a fur line. Cell tag.</v>

255
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:43.220
Leoni. Yeah. HES got a giant 72 inch TV, right? Dog dogs with him. Yeah.

256
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.940
All the dogs there. What's happening here. &lt;laugh&gt;

257
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.570
wire are marks in his hands. God tighten up on, I mean,

258
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:58.770
if you're gonna get someone to strangle yourel mate, that's the guy too. I mean,

259
00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:01.130
he'd do it in three seconds. He's so big. Yeah.

260
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.930
<v 1>You don't want somebody. Who's gotta take their time because they can't. Right.</v>

261
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.490
<v 0>You want some Kevin Spacey dude strangling. He's gonna take forever.</v>

262
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.530
Can I hold his old? Still want some big gorilla dude? Yeah.

263
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.690
<v 1>Uh, yeah. Well, I tell you what if, uh, if, uh,</v>

264
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:16.320
this new series I'm doing gets picked up for a second season? Well,

265
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.280
I'm gonna recommend to the producers, they, they put the Epstein case on there,

266
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.680
even though it's not quite in line with what we do, but.
