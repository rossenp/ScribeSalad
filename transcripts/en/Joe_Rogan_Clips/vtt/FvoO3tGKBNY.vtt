00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And you're coming back from another crazy trip, right?</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.950
I am indeed. What is that nonsense that you did on a kayak?

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.613
What did you do?

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.190
<v 1>So, uh, after I got back from the impossible first,</v>

5
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.760
the Antarctica crossing rider, by the time I saw you last year, um,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.780
I got a funny phone call actually of all things creep were asked me, you know,

7
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:24.600
what's the next expedition going to be? What are you going to do? And I said,

8
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.540
you know, I just walked 54 days by myself across Antarctica. Gimme,

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.590
gimme a minute, give me a minute to, uh, relax. And, uh,

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.070
I got a phone call via a buddy of mine from college, connects me to this, uh,

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.840
this guy, uh,

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.440
this Icelandic I've never met him before his name's pheon Paul don't know his

13
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.920
story. I do now he's an absolute legend. Um, and he says, Hey man,

14
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.260
you were just an Antarctica. Right. And I was like, yeah. And he's like,

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
I think we should go back to Antarctica. And I was like, all right, well,

16
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:51.900
what do you think? And he's like in a rowboat,

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.430
I think we should row a boat from the Southern tip of south America to the

18
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.970
peninsula of Antarctica across Drake passage. How far is that?

19
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.440
About 700 miles.

20
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.730
<v 0>And see what that looks like on a map.</v>

21
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.600
<v 1>Um, and I said, please delete my phone.</v>

22
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.690
<v 0>700 Miles rowing a boat.</v>

23
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.340
<v 1>Uh, yeah. So Drake passage is known to be, um, you know, in seafaring,</v>

24
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.270
one of the most treacherous,

25
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:18.270
if not the most treacherous kind of passageway in the world, you know,

26
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.051
you've gotten, you know,

27
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.690
the Atlantic and the Pacific and the Southern ocean kind of all converging

28
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.030
between the Antarctic peninsula and the Southern tip of south America.

29
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.130
So you got 40 foot swells,

30
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:30.870
you got crazy waves icebergs as you get close to Antarctica. Um, and the, uh,

31
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.110
the mission or the goal was to see if we could, uh, there it is right there.

32
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
That's it? That whole area, that whole area right there from there to there, um,

33
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:43.230
all the way down. Yeah, the main, the main peninsula TheraBand. So ultimately,

34
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.560
uh, it took us just less than two weeks to do the entire row,

35
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:47.850
but it was a long journey.

36
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.310
And the planning from that phone call all the way through to that year,

37
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:53.000
but it was a, it was a two week or 12, 12 day crossing.

38
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.130
<v 0>So in the two weeks you had to have two weeks worth of food,</v>

39
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.630
two weeks worth of drinking water.

40
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.050
<v 1>Yeah. So, well, water, actually, we have a decelerator. So off of, um, off of,</v>

41
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.100
uh, solar panels, everything's, you know, solar there's no engine, no sale,

42
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.200
nothing like that. It's just completely human powered, rowing.

43
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.170
<v 0>A portable desalinater. Yeah. How big is it?</v>

44
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.320
<v 1>Um, it fits inside one of the tiny looks, so the boat's tiny, the boats,</v>

45
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.060
like 20, 25 feet long,

46
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.290
three guys running at a time for six of us total in the team, ultimately, um,

47
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.690
you know, barely anywhere to sleep in this tiny little compartments,

48
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:26.940
like the size of like, you know, sleeping in the back of a, you know,

49
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.680
hatchback of a Honda civic or something like that. Um, but, uh,

50
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.180
but yeah, so you've got this assassinator,

51
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:35.190
that's basically kind of in one of the central compartment.

52
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.720
So it was probably like, I dunno, maybe two feet by two feet square,

53
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.300
something like that. Um, and mean it doesn't, it doesn't make a water real fast.

54
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:44.790
You can make 10 liters of water in like, you know, an hour or two,

55
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:45.624
depending on the

56
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.813
[inaudible], but I mean, it gets it done. Yeah. It gets it done. Does it taste.

57
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.430
<v 0>Well? What are the water tastes like?</v>

58
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.950
<v 1>It was weird as we got closer to Antarctica,</v>

59
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.010
I think it started messing up because it got real salty.

60
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.550
Like it wasn't doing quite as good of a job.

61
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.890
The water near Antarctica was like one degree Celsius. So 33 Fahrenheit,

62
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.380
practically frozen cold water.

63
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:09.130
And I think that was kind of starting to tweak out the system. Um, but uh,

64
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.400
drinking salt water as we got closer, it was like, it was still potable,

65
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.560
but it was like this isn't working as well, but early on, I mean,

66
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.900
it worked just fine. Like, it was pretty much, you know, cold,

67
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.450
cold drinking water, like bottled water. Yeah, exactly.

68
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.510
But then does it only do it for a certain amount of time?

69
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:26.200
Does the filter get filled up or anything? Um, it worked for the entire, uh,

70
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.260
12 days that we were out there there's guys who have gone on longer, you know,

71
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.200
rowing exhibitions across the Pacific or the Atlantic or longer stretches of

72
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:35.380
ocean, um, that, you know, works the entire time. Um,

73
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.110
but it is one of the things that dead breaks down. So we had extra spare parts.

74
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.440
Fortunately, we don't have to use any of that, but, um, but yeah, no, we had a,

75
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.281
it worked and then, yeah,

76
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:46.450
of course we had to bring food for the entire time as well, um, on, on there.

77
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:51.310
So that was a key part of it. How much food? So there were six of us,

78
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.000
like I said, um, pretty much all the compartments were full. Um, you know,

79
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.840
there's tiny little compartments, but basically ate two things. So we, uh,

80
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.930
we had freeze dried meals, so like mountain house, free stride meals. And we,

81
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.170
this little jet boil that we were kind of as crazy as the water's like it's 40,

82
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.630
you know, 40 foot waves are bouncing around on this,

83
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.750
trying to hold a jet boil to try to boil some water. It was pretty tough, but,

84
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.170
um, some close calls with that, but we also, um, had these bars.

85
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.180
So last time I think we talked about last time I was on here,

86
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:20.590
I had these kind of custom nutrition bars that were made. Um,

87
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.290
and so that worked really well for me in the Antarctica crossing,

88
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.020
we had done all this kind of blood work. Explain that again, like how you made,

89
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.110
how those made. Yeah. So, um, when I was doing my Antarctica crossing,

90
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:32.470
one of the kind of challenges is basically, can you take enough food with you?

91
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.980
Cause what I was doing was called unsupported, so no resupplies of food or fuel,

92
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.710
you know, crossing the land mass of Antarctica 54 days.

93
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.920
And so I wanted to get like the most optimized nutrition. Um,

94
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:44.890
and so I worked with this company called standard process was all like a whole

95
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:48.310
food supplement company. And they've got all these sort of doctors, um,

96
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.300
food scientists and this,

97
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.270
and I went in their lab for a year and they did all this kind of custom blood

98
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:54.700
work on my body. I'm trying to figure out, you know,

99
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.220
basically my exact sort of physiology.

100
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:01.210
And they created these bars based on all of the research that they did, um,

101
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.130
that based where these really high calorie bars,

102
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.490
cause it was the most high calories that I needed to optimize space. Um,

103
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:08.050
and they were kind of, they were all,

104
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:10.300
they're all plant-based and ended up and then I know there's, you know,

105
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.890
what's in them again, you know, coconut oil, nuts seeds, you know, sort of, uh,

106
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.670
different phytonutrients and a particular macronutrient blend that I needed.

107
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:23.230
It was about 45% fat cause I needed the high fat, um, about 40% protein.

108
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.910
Um, and then 15 tomorrow what's the math on that, uh, 15%, uh, carps.

109
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.340
Um, and so, uh, excuse me, sorry.

110
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:33.790
I re alternated the protein carb quotient there, but, um, but yeah,

111
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:36.190
it worked really well for that. And so when I was doing the row,

112
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:38.590
I called up Santa process again, they've been an amazing partner of mine.

113
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.960
And they were like, were like, Hey, I'm doing this row. Um,

114
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.270
those bars weren't so good last time. And like I just said with, you know,

115
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:44.680
trying to boil water and you know,

116
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:46.540
all this stuff is really challenging on the robot.

117
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:49.570
The best would be to have this really kind of high optimized nutrition that we

118
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:52.900
could use again for the project like this. But the parameters are different.

119
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.510
You know, the humidity is different, the temperature is different.

120
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.710
There's six of us now. There's not just one me, you know,

121
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:01.360
can we optimize it for that? So they kind of made a specialty blend, um,

122
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.920
of the bars again. Um, but they've called the column bars.

123
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.090
They'd probably come up with a better name. Um, but it worked really well,

124
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.660
those online anymore, they're, they're not for sale. Um,

125
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.890
we've talked about doing that. So maybe in the future, but, uh, you can,

126
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.240
you can see online on their website,

127
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.100
like all the different supplements and stuff that went into it.

128
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.530
So you can kind of buy the component parts, but yeah, one day we might,

129
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.230
we might make them, but they've been kind of just custom for these two projects,

130
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.310
but they've worked really, really well, particularly in the rowing. So, I mean,

131
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.020
they worked amazing in the Antarctic crossing as well, but in the rowing,

132
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.610
it was 90 minutes of rowing on 90 minutes of rowing off continuous 24 hours a

133
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:33.890
day. So there's, we're kind of in two sets of three, six of us,

134
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:36.620
total three people rowing three people resting.

135
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.100
And in that 90 minutes that you're off. That's also when you got to, you know,

136
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.980
eat, drink, sleep, it's your only time to rest basically.

137
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:46.850
And so as much time as you can kind of optimize eating and stuff meant more

138
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:50.060
sleeping. And so to have these bars get done with a 90 minute rowing shift,

139
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:53.090
be able to eat, you know, a thousand calorie bar, highest, you know,

140
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:56.960
quality nutrition in your body. Um, I mean, standard process. Nailed it again.

141
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.040
It was amazing to, you know,

142
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.130
have these bars and have it work really well for all of us to kind of optimize,

143
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:01.821
not just the food,

144
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:05.720
but also the efficiency of sleep because the sleep got crazy out there.

145
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.770
Like you can imagine. Yeah.

146
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.930
<v 0>So you basically sleeping every 90 minutes for one</v>

147
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.764
hour.

148
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.650
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Ish. Like if you can get it and like when,</v>

149
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.070
once the swell start cranking up, like you're in this tiny compartment, like,

150
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.500
I don't know if we could pull up a picture of the boat for a visual or some on

151
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:25.520
my Instagram, I'm not covered like really not covered at all.

152
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.560
Like so well there's covered in the tiny compartment.

153
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:29.240
So the rowing part's not covered at all.

154
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:32.480
So when you're rowing waves are splashing up, like over top of you, I mean,

155
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.000
you're getting completely soaked. Like you're getting, you know,

156
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.730
complete snug the entire time. And then the tiny compartment, you know,

157
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.620
it's like, it's like lower than this table.

158
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:43.340
Like you'd be like kinda crouched down, like in there. Um, yeah.

159
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.370
So that is the robot right here. So that's us. So.

160
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.040
<v 0>That's the floor. Is that where all.</v>

161
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.290
<v 1>The food is stored underneath the underneath there's compartments.</v>

162
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.810
So you can see that tiny little kind of compartment on either side,

163
00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:56.930
one smaller one's bigger than the back ones with sleep. That's where we'd sleep.

164
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.960
Well, the bigger one has the waves, just like the bleeds that there's 12 people,

165
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:04.670
three, no six people, six people, but still, um,

166
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.360
so you got three people in the three people rowing in three people and then

167
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:11.090
compartments, anytime I'm thinking, if you kind of scroll up to the top,

168
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.490
maybe there's one, I'm just, it shows like the whole boat, um,

169
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.910
or like what it looks like. Maybe there there's kind of a shot of it. Um,

170
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.150
so yeah, so you can see in there, like the back little compartment,

171
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:21.320
that's where I was. Um,

172
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.290
I was alternating with this guy pheon who I mentioned the Icelandic guy who was

173
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.440
the captain, the boat really experienced ocean rower. Um,

174
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.040
and we alternated inside this little cabin and then the other four guys,

175
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:33.710
they alternate two people cause that one's a little bit bigger in the front.

176
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:35.990
That's the bow cabin in the front, but they're like,

177
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:38.660
you're like head to toe in there or you're crouched into a little ball.

178
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:40.370
It's not, it's not glamorous at all.

179
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.870
<v 0>These guys at all four. He.</v>

180
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.770
<v 1>Did this. So, uh, not really, uh, not really, uh, yeah,</v>

181
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:48.560
it was a deep dive into the team. And after doing something solo,

182
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.270
I was pretty excited to do something, you know,

183
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:52.250
as a team and doing something in a completely, you know,

184
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:56.340
exploring a completely different kind of avenue of exploration, the ocean,

185
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:58.140
something I'd never done before. And I had actually,

186
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.140
not only did I not know these guys, um, a couple of them went to college with,

187
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.700
but we like really loosely knew each other.

188
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:05.100
Like I kind of like maybe like a recognize their face a little bit,

189
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:06.960
but it didn't, we weren't like good friends or anything like that.

190
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.870
Three of them I'd never met in my entire life. Um,

191
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.460
and I had also have never wrote a boat in my life ever before.

192
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.140
Um, and so when pheon, uh, he called me up and told me about the project,

193
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.290
he's the one who most world's most renowned ocean rowers. He's got, you know,

194
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.420
30 world records or something like that. Um,

195
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.150
complete legend he's rode boats across every single ocean.

196
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.070
And this was like the kind of a last, you know,

197
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.230
big ocean that he'd never crossed, no one, you know,

198
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.160
no one had ever done it just like this before. And so he kind of said, Hey,

199
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:38.250
I wanted this idea, but the logistics are super complicated.

200
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:41.490
Like going in Antarctica is all this sort of like treaties that you need all

201
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:44.160
this paperwork, getting a boat down to south America,

202
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.530
importing it through the Panama canal, et cetera. I mean,

203
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:48.000
it's like a tough thing. And he'd been like,

204
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:50.640
kind of thinking about it for a year or so. And he, he said like, Hey,

205
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.430
I've seen you pull off some big projects together. Can we kind of team up?

206
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:54.121
And I know, you know,

207
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:56.370
your team has got really good at figuring out these logistics,

208
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:59.310
would you be interested? And I'd actually looked at ocean rowing. Um,

209
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:01.800
a couple of years ago was something that I always wanted to do one day.

210
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.470
And so it was kind of, uh, after I kind of got that first phone call,

211
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.660
like I said, like kinda like, dude, I just got back from Antarctica.

212
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:09.390
I don't want to go back tomorrow. Uh, but you know,

213
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:12.570
of course the curiosity inside of we got the best of me and I called them back

214
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:14.460
up and I said, Hey, let's do this. What are you thinking?

215
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.310
And kind of dove into it. Um, from there kind of my,

216
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.370
my team kind of wrapped our arms around the sort of like logistic and building

217
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:23.160
out the project. And he was definitely the visionary of, um,

218
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.460
something he dreamed up and it was super cool to team up with him after doing

219
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:27.150
something alone.
