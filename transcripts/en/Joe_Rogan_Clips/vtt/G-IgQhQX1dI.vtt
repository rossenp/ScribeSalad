00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I'm walking around and it, do you know, how did you,</v>

3
00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:08.680
how long were you monk for? I was a monk for about six and a half years. Wow.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.520
Yeah. And it was a, it was a great time in life. And how old were you? Let me,

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.040
I was 22. So from 22 to 28, you were monk. I was a monk.

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.240
That means salibate no masturbating,

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.030
nothing 70 year or seven and a half where' years. Did you live?

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.750
I lived in ashrams in India and in America and I traveled all over the world

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.910
actually. Wow. But it was, it was I,

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.590
but I I'll tell you what brought me to that place after the,

11
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.830
after being very materially frustrated. And I,

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.750
I said those two main factors were some type of material success.

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.220
I wasn't the Beatle and I wasn't, you know, Michael Jackson,

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.300
but I had some materials that I had fans. Um,

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.340
and then realizing how life can get taken away from you in a moment with the,

16
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:54.100
with, with that precarious place.

17
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.540
My father was at it just made me start thinking,

18
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.420
what the hell am I doing in this short, in this short life?

19
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.530
What am I supposed to do? Give me some GPS. Give me some,

20
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.650
where do I go from here? What do I want out of life? What is the,

21
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:12.370
what is a home run? Is it just to be as very famous? Is that,

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410
is that the home run, is it to be, uh, collect tons of stuff?

23
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:17.130
Is that a home run is to live a natural life.

24
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.930
Is that a home run is to learn some art, you know,

25
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.760
some type of art is that a home run? And so this was my, my burning question.

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.160
And, um, now I was still a new Yorker. I was still sort of like, uh, you know,

27
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:33.040
New York in the eighties. So I was like a little street, smart, new Yorker.

28
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.560
I'm actually from Connecticut, but I, uh, started hanging out in New York city.

29
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.160
My parents were new Yorkers. And so we used to my older brothers,

30
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.750
lived in the city, so I I'd visit them. But some the time I was 14,

31
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.790
I used to just go to New York city and just hang out on the weekends. And, uh,

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.590
when I became a, a monk or, and went to India,

33
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.310
I had saved about 25,000 bucks. Not a lot of money, not,

34
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.950
not tons of money, but it was, you know, some money I made,

35
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.780
I thought in my brain, okay, this is my cynical self. I'm gonna go to India.

36
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:10.340
I'm gonna meet a guru. The guru's gonna want all my money. This is how it works.

37
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.300
&lt;laugh&gt; but when I actually lived with the monks India,

38
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.380
especially India, then 1988,

39
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.210
there is no central AC and it's hot. There's no heat.

40
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.410
And it's cold in the winter. The showers are freezing,

41
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.810
cuz all the water's kept on a tank on the roof of the asram in the summer.

42
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.010
That water's super hot, cuz it's all kept on a tank on top of the asram.

43
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.930
There's no creature comforts whatsoever. You go to bed early,

44
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.520
you wake up super early, you go to bed, you know, eight 30,

45
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.320
you wake up three o'clock in the morning.

46
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.680
There's nothing that there's nothing to buy. There's nothing to purchase.

47
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.520
All the fun things that we like to,

48
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.960
to like ease the pain of existence are not there. Um,

49
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.080
you know, there's no movies, there's no television,

50
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:00.040
there's no comedy there there's nothing.

51
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.880
And so two things happen when you strip everything away from a person,

52
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.520
they lose it, they hop the fence,

53
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.440
so to speak and I've seen that happen or they learn to find their pleasure from

54
00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:13.280
something more subtle.

55
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.310
And so when I first went there and saw the joy of the monks, I realized

56
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.710
they don't want my money. They don't want anything. I have to offer them.

57
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.430
I want what they have.

58
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.390
That was sort of a game changer moment for me.

59
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.870
I wanna figure out how to be connected with nothing.

60
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.860
<v 2>What did these guys do all day? &lt;laugh&gt; I.</v>

61
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.580
<v 1>Don't know. They have the different stuff. I think. Yeah, everybody does.</v>

62
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.820
And every asrom's got their own thing. You know what I mean?

63
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.740
Did you have chores that.

64
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.540
<v 2>You had to do to, to earn your food? Like.</v>

65
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.500
<v 1>Yeah. Everybo, you know, every ashram is gonna be different and every,</v>

66
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.770
uh, spiritual path there's Christian monks and you know,

67
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.650
monks from different traditions around the world.

68
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.890
I'm sure they all got their thing, different things.

69
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.490
But later I started doing my next band because the interesting thing about the

70
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:12.370
Baga Bagda Baga bagdas,

71
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.810
you're familiar with it's one chapter of the biggest epic in the world,

72
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.130
the mahabart and it's a,

73
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:23.120
it's the most studied and discussed and commented on by all the saints

74
00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:26.560
of ancient India. Um, people even bringing it to politics and stuff,

75
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:30.880
but it's a real conversation between the spirit

76
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.800
and dev divinity. It's a conversation about, uh,

77
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.280
just about, it's just, it's just considered ancient wisdom for all people.

78
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.810
So the,

79
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.270
one of the ideas of the Gita is you don't give up what you're born to do.

80
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.310
You do what you do, but in a spiritual way,

81
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.150
you don't try to like wipe out your desires. It's not gonna happen.

82
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.670
You take what you do and you do it in a way that is gonna assist you

83
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.580
in your liberation. And is it gonna assist everybody else? So, um,

84
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.540
even I'll say I love comedy,

85
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.420
but I want comedy that uplifts me and not doesn't degrade me.

86
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.580
I like entertainment that when I walk away from it, I learn something.

87
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.100
I feel like I'm growing. I feel connected. I don't want stuff.

88
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.620
That's gonna just give me darker thoughts. Like.

89
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.793
<v 2>Okre.</v>

90
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.650
<v 1>I I've never seen it. You didn't see it.</v>

91
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.690
I didn't I'm I wanna say that I live on a farm &lt;laugh&gt; I live

92
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:34.370
on a farm. We rare. I rarely watch anything except comedy. I love comedy.

93
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.770
Um, cause I think laughing's important. Um, but I don't watch so much TV.

94
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.730
Um, so I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty,

95
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.920
if I do go to the movie movies it's out of like with my wife, let's just,

96
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.800
we wanna get away from the kids. We wanna do something. Right. Um,

97
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.360
but there's no plan on what to watch, but I'm open to good ideas.

98
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.120
<v 2>The jokers, a really good movie, but it's really dark. It's really dark.</v>

99
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:59.400
Like you walk out there feeling really confused. Like you're like,

100
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.320
did I like that? I don't know if I liked that. I know it was awesome.

101
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.440
I know it was really well done, but did I like that?

102
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.720
And it's this it's a it's complicated. I mean, we could get,

103
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:12.640
we could talk about the joker for the next two hours.

104
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.520
<v 1>You know, I don't get lost in the wind. You know,</v>

105
00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:18.710
the mind is like a garage and &lt;affirmative&gt; you become like what you store in

106
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.510
that garage. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so the thoughts,

107
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.630
the thoughts that we put in the mind, we gotta be careful with. Yeah.

108
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.430
The words just,

109
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:28.390
we were talking about mantras before there mantras are like repetitive sounds,

110
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.750
but they're consideredtranscendental sounds so I chant the Harry Christianna

111
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:33.110
mantra. So the Christianna mantra,

112
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.550
you might have known it from the soundtrack of hair. Harry C Krisna,

113
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:39.180
Harry Christian, a Christian Christianna, Harry Harry, Harry Ramma,

114
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:43.140
Harry Ramma Ramma Ramma Harry Harry it's considered a transcendental sound for

115
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:46.540
the mind and it sort of connects the,

116
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.380
the soul with divinity. It doesn't matter what religion you are.

117
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:54.140
It's considered a mantra, a sound vibration. That is a potency on the Mon,

118
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.380
which where they get the word mantra from. It delivers the Mon or the man.

119
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.610
So what we store in the mind starts to create our external

120
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.930
being. And if you don't believe in it, it's one of those things.

121
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.690
We have mantras in our mind. Anyway,

122
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.250
I have things on loop running through my mind that have been handed to me from

123
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.400
parents, from, uh, from, uh,

124
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:22.880
elementary school teachers from a crazy uncle for whatever we get things handed

125
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.240
to us and we play them on repeat.

126
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.440
And sometimes they're mantras of self-eprecation self-loathing you're not good

127
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:33.120
enough. And these are the mantras running through the mind.

128
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:34.320
So the yoga system says,

129
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.430
notice those mantras that's part of self edification or self-reism you

130
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:43.670
notice what's playing in the mind and you replace those mantras with

131
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:48.470
transranscendental sound or at the very least training the mind

132
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.230
to see greatness in people. That's a big thing. Mmhmm, because the mind,

133
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.550
the way the material mind wants to see like what are Joe shortcomings, right?

134
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.380
Cause if &lt;affirmative&gt;, if I find your shortcomings,

135
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:04.180
it makes me feel better about myself, right? That's crazy thinking it. If,

136
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:07.140
if you've got thousands of shortcomings that doesn't make me better at all.

137
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.900
So the material mind,

138
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.580
which is sees one as so insecure that I have to lash out

139
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:18.220
at other people to make myself feel whole. And it's just crazy,

140
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.130
crazy think and stink and thinking.

141
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.490
Whereas the Yogagi trains, I,

142
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.490
I specifically teach BTI yoga, which is a it's it's a,

143
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.130
it's called the yoga of connection or the yoga of the heart.

144
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.050
And it starts to deal with all the essence of the teachings of the GDA,

145
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:37.690
which is you train yourself to see greatness in other people.

146
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.440
And if I start to note it it's good. You could take this from a micro,

147
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.440
like my relationship with you. I want to notice all of Joe's great qualities.

148
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.680
Now, when you hear that, you might think, well, he doesn't really know me.

149
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:51.640
I got some bad qualities.

150
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.320
Immediately makes you a little vulnerable and you start to think well,

151
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.640
but you appreciate it. And, and anybody in our life who appreciates us,

152
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.760
sometimes they even see things in us. We can't see in ourselves.

153
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.640
We want to become like that.

154
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.480
That's why this idea of changing the world really starts with your self

155
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:11.160
connection is I am a spiritual being.

156
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.110
Joe is a spiritual being and I start train myself in not

157
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.790
seeing what Joe does wrong, seeing everything he does. Right.

158
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.110
And it's a great exercise for the brain. What does that duke person do? Right?

159
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.110
What is the good in this person that I, that I'm overlooking? Cuz I'm just,

160
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:30.430
I've got these lens.

161
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.270
It's a lens that we wear of trying to find shortcomings in people.

162
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.540
And it screws people up tremendously. Even so-called spiritual people. Mm.

163
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.620
I just enrolled. Yeah. You can cork me anytime you want.

164
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.700
<v 2>So you spent six and a half years living like this in this.</v>

165
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.540
Saram just trying to sort things out. No, no sex, no masturbation.

166
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.020
What are you eating? None of what kind of food they serve you.

167
00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.330
<v 1>Uh, strict vegetarian diet. And, and not only that, the I,</v>

168
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.690
this is an interesting point too.

169
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.090
And it's debated about in, especially, you know, I was a rough foodist.

170
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:09.250
So these rough food is they're all,

171
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.730
everyone's got their take on medicine and healing.

172
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.330
Let me share the Yogi perspective of it. Okay.

173
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.600
The missing ingredient in food, the vitamin,

174
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.180
the super food that has never spoken about is love.

175
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.740
Food is supposed to be, uh, grown,

176
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.610
prepared, and then offered. And the offering is not even to a human.

177
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:43.570
The offering is to God. That's called prsaded food is first called Boga.

178
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.650
Boga means it's for enjoyment. And then you take that enjoyment.

179
00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:50.250
But before you enjoy it, you are offering it first back, like in sacrifice.

180
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:54.130
The idea is that everything in this world is not for me. Everything is,

181
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.690
I'm not the center. I'm here to serve the center.

182
00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.920
So all food takes on the consciousness of the prepare

183
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.440
of the food. Mm.

184
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.960
So to eat junk food or to have people in very low

185
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:12.560
consciousness, cooking your food, you're taking that into your body.

186
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.400
You're taking the consciousness of the prepare of the food. Do you believe that?

187
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.040
I definitely believe it. Yeah.

188
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.310
I definitely would feel a tangible effect if I walked

189
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.430
outside that line.

190
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.470
So for years I'd only eat food cooked by broins like,

191
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.990
like the priests of the asram or I would cook it myself or

192
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.510
later, I have a very weird story, which was,

193
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.660
I became a bunch of my friends that were monks.

194
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.060
We started our own band and we started a record label,

195
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.100
a second record label in the astronm &lt;laugh&gt; I kid you not,

196
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.140
it's almost an unbelievable story. And perhaps the first time,

197
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.080
historically there was a celibate rock and roll band, but this band ended up,

198
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:58.480
ended up becoming bigger than the second band. This was my band shelter. And um,

199
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.280
so what happened was this band, when we started though,

200
00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:05.480
we were all monks and we would take a candy stove on tour with us and we'd pull

201
00:12:05.481 --> 00:12:09.320
over the side of the road and we'd make Kittery with rice and doll and you know,

202
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.720
faninere and uh,

203
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.390
cor Ann and Cuman and we just cook and cuz we wouldn't eat outside food because

204
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:20.230
if you did, you would feel you would, you would feel it.

205
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.070
You would feel it affect your mind.

206
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.523
<v 2>Really?</v>

207
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.790
<v 1>I kid you, not that, that I can say there's certain things like, I don't know.</v>

208
00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:31.990
There's certain things that they speak about in ancient Indian literature that I

209
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:35.940
can say. I maybe, I don't know. So you think most.

210
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.900
<v 2>People, but there's certain things.</v>

211
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.020
<v 1>I could say that I know. I definitely.</v>

212
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.980
<v 2>Experienced that you think most people are just numb to that numb to the effect</v>

213
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.900
of taking in the consciousness of someone who's on a low vibration,

214
00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:47.540
who's cooking your food. You're just numb to it.

215
00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:48.420
You just eat the food cause you're.

216
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.700
<v 1>Hungry. Um, are people they're.</v>

217
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.220
<v 2>Numb to it? The people that aren't aware of that concept, uh.</v>

218
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.850
<v 1>Yeah. People are aware of the con. I mean that's the point? I mean, for example,</v>

219
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.170
a home cooked meal definitely feels yes. Tastes better,

220
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.450
tastes different or feels, feels different. Feels different. Yeah.

221
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.090
As opposed to some guy just yeah. You know,

222
00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:10.810
making burgers it white castle or whatever. Yeah. Um, so, so I don't know.

223
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.450
It depends on the individual, but is this.

224
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:17.120
<v 2>A perception or is it a, is it an actual energy? Oh, and does it matter?</v>

225
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.220
I think it's both.

226
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.760
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; there's, it's almost like fire's gonna burn whether it, I,</v>

227
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.120
I believe it or not. Right.

228
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.680
But there's is there is a concept of once you get that food,

229
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.040
you don't eat the food,

230
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.480
you honor the food mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it's not gonna be like me shoving

231
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.150
stuff in my mouth, which I do do occasionally. Right. Um,

232
00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:36.350
if you see my eating habits,

233
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.470
but it should be more of a Medi the eating itself should be a meditation

234
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.030
and it's been proven. I'm not one of these guys. There's a thing.

235
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.030
<v 2>That's, there's a similarity. That's gonna seem like it's not, it,</v>

236
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.950
it like, it's not a parallel,

237
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.260
but in hunting when you hunting an animal and you kill that animal

238
00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.500
and you butcher that animal and then you feed it to your family, it's a,

239
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.380
it sounds almost hypocritical.

240
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.220
It sounds like there's no way that would be a spiritual feeling,

241
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.980
but there's a connection to your food. That's very, very different.

242
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.260
<v 1>Well, we've divorced ourself from killing animals.</v>

243
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:15.300
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; for the most part, for the most part,

244
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.770
most people hire people. Right?

245
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.610
Most people have no clue where their fruits come.

246
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:23.210
From-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; their vegetables come from. What a co what, you know,

247
00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:25.330
what a brussel sprouts look like when they grow. Right.

248
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.690
What do bananas look like when they grow? What, what is ground round? You know?

249
00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:30.490
Right. So we've divorced ourself from our food.

250
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.320
<v 3>I.</v>
