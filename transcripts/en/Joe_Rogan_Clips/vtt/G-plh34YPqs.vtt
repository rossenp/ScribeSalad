00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 1>Experience. And I'm gonna tell you something, our country,</v>

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.800
I'm gonna tell you where it's headed. So you understand, um,

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.840
our country can only become one of two things.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.280
It can become number one, that which we stand up, I'm sorry,

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.960
that which we sit back and let it become,

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.110
or number two that's, which we stand up and make it become.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.190
So we are charged with this question.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.830
Do I want to, uh,

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.630
sit back and see what my country becomes or do I want to stand up and make my

11
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:40.870
country become what I wanna see? And I've chosen, I've chosen the latter,

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.060
cause I don't like the direction that's going in.

13
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.460
<v 0>Well, you've chosen a very noble, not just the ladder, but a very noble path.</v>

14
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.741
I mean,

15
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:51.500
what you've done is pretty incredible and the amount of time and energy that's

16
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:55.380
required for you to get close to these guys and the fact that you could be doing

17
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.820
a lot of other things, you're a successful musician yet.

18
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.580
I'm sure you have friends. I'm sure you're busy,

19
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.210
but you chose to spend extraordinary amount of time pursuing this.

20
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.410
<v 1>I would much rather be on stage playing music and making people happy and</v>

21
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.530
causing to, to jump up and dance and carry on and sing along than, than,

22
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.010
than attending clan rallies.

23
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.170
But I find it more and more necessary because we have dropped the ball.

24
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.210
You know, the topic that you and I are discussing right now, you know, 20,

25
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.044
30 years ago,

26
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.240
would've been taboo talking about on radio or whatever people didn people did

27
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.600
not wanna discuss it. Mm. Um, and you know, and I know we can't talk about that.

28
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.480
Just keep it in the closet, you know? Cause outta sight, outta mind, denial.

29
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.080
Right. And, and denying it does not make it go away. Its cause you can't see it.

30
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.880
It's always there. So now we're, we're forced to address it,

31
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.910
but let me tell you where it's going, which,

32
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:46.190
which is what a lot of people do not talk about and don't understand. Well,

33
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.830
first of all, let's, let's uh,

34
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.550
let's define what it is back in the day.

35
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.350
There was only one group, the KU Klux Klan.

36
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.550
They were the first and the largest gang. If you will, of racists. Uh,

37
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.340
at one point in time they had 4 million members. All right.

38
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.420
It's a pretty big gang. When was that? Uh, back in the 1920s and,

39
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.420
and into the early thirties, how many people.

40
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.060
<v 0>Were even in America, in the 1920s. Oh, more than that. More than that. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:16.260
But I mean how many? It wasn't even a hundred million.

42
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.580
<v 1>I don't, I don't even know.</v>

43
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.220
<v 0>India. How bad it's probably about 80, 90 million.</v>

44
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.300
Oh we can look it up for sure. Yeah. Because if there's four,

45
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.850
that's a extraordinary.

46
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.850
<v 1>Number of, and the majority of them were in, uh, Indiana, Indiana, Indiana.</v>

47
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.570
<v 0>Yeah. About 110, 110 million. Wow. And how many?</v>

48
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.730
4 million that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

49
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.290
So it's basically somewhere in the neighborhood of four percent&lt;affirmative&gt; of

50
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:43.250
the entire population of the country was in the clan. Yeah.

51
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.560
<v 1>Now, um, at that time it was called white supremacy</v>

52
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.440
because that's what they believe in. You know, this is our country.

53
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.400
We're in charge with Supreme. They didn't call.

54
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.520
<v 0>It the clan. Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.800
<v 1>Yeah. It was a clan, but the ideology was called west supremacy. Okay. Um,</v>

56
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.040
and a lot of, uh, it, it started in 1865,

57
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.320
a lot of violence, a lot of, you know, lynchings, uh, bombings, you know,

58
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:16.840
dragging people behind vehicles, all kind of stuff began happening.

59
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.150
And oh,

60
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:23.590
they came a lot of baggage with the term white supremacy where a lot of white

61
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:27.510
people did not like black people or did not like Jewish people.

62
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.550
They did not wanna participate in, in this night writing, you know,

63
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.990
lynchings and murder and all that kind of stuff either for,

64
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.710
for moral reasons or legal reasons, whatever. Uh, the membership began.

65
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.620
People began dropping out, all right. It was too, too violent for them. This,

66
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:47.700
this white supremacy word became unpatable and became negative.

67
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.580
So when the membership decreased, they had to rebrand.

68
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.581
So they, so they,

69
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.780
they changed it from white supremacy to white separatism.

70
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.290
I'm a white separatist. I don't hate black people or Jewish people.

71
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.730
I just love my own blacks and Jews should be able to have their own schools,

72
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.450
their own neighborhoods, their own churches, their own workplaces.

73
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.730
We should be able to have ours. And that way we don't have to mix. Oh yeah.

74
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:16.770
Yeah. I like that idea. Sign me up.

75
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.920
I'm a white separatist membership began increasing. And of course, you know,

76
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.440
the more people you have, somebody's gonna start acting up.

77
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.880
So here comes the violence.

78
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.320
So now the term white supremacy also become unpatable and people

79
00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:31.280
began dropping out.

80
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.920
So membership went down again and then they had to rebrand next.

81
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.870
They call themselves white nationals or white nationalists or all right.

82
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.830
Now what is a nationalist?

83
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.030
A nationalist is someone who loves their country like a Patriot.

84
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.430
So you're a nationalist. I'm a nationalist.

85
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.430
Why do we have to say white nationalist?

86
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.430
Why can't we just say I'm a nationalist, right? But no white nationalist. Uh,

87
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.500
so the, I, yeah, I love my country and I I'm white.

88
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.420
Sign me up here, comes the violence. So once again,

89
00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:08.940
they rebranded and now they call it the alt-right. And I,

90
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.853
I hate to use a cliche,

91
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.620
but as they say arose by any other name is what still arose.

92
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.500
So you can call whatever you want to call. It is still white supremacy.

93
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.020
Do you think that.

94
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.650
<v 0>Charlotte was a wake up call for Charlotte over there? Charlottesville.</v>

95
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:25.730
Excuse me for it.

96
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.650
It was for me because I knew that it still existed,

97
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.090
but I didn't think they would show themselves publicly like that in the age of

98
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:36.170
the internet and walk down the street with Tiki torches.

99
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.770
<v 1>Let me tell you something. Let me, I'm gonna show you something. Okay.</v>

100
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.720
Okay. The, the rally there was called unite. The right rally.

101
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.280
I knew the guy who put it on. I know all the speakers there.

102
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.240
I knew them personally. All right.

103
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.400
What was your understanding as to why they were having this big unite?

104
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:57.760
The right rally? I only.

105
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.560
<v 0>Knew of it peripherally. I didn't know why they were doing it.</v>

106
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.800
I just had probably heard it on the news or something like that,

107
00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:05.800
that it was going on. Okay. And then when I saw the KKK showing,

108
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.360
were those guys, the Charlottesville guys with the torches?

109
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.120
Were those KKK or was it another white supremacy movement? All.

110
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.880
<v 1>All of the above. They had different, different, it was unite, the right.</v>

111
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.190
All the different right wing groups came right league of the south,

112
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:21.070
the KU kluxtlan national socialist movement, uh, different, you know, entities,

113
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.910
socialist movement. Yeah. The national socialist movement.

114
00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:28.070
Like the Nazis exactlyn really? Yeah. Okay. They were there too now.

115
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.430
Um, in the media, they, they, they gave a reason as to why.

116
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.140
Why were they there? What were they protesting? What was their reason for, for,

117
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.220
for being there in Charlottesville? I have no idea. Okay. Well,

118
00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:46.780
if the media put out was they had come together to protest the removal

119
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.540
of the Confederate, uh, statues. Okay. You.

120
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.220
<v 0>You call that. Yeah. I remember they were tearing down the statues. Right.</v>

121
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.420
And I had a conversation with somebody about it that those statues,

122
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.810
most of them were very too cheaply made and they were,

123
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.170
it was actually put up during the civil rights movement. Right. Exactly.

124
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.370
<v 1>As a slap and phase. Yes. Yes. Okay.</v>

125
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.450
So that was not the reason why they had the rally. Okay.

126
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.530
That's what the media said. Okay.

127
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.090
Anytime. Okay.

128
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.360
The reason why they had this rally there &lt;affirmative&gt; yes.

129
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:23.080
There were some people who went there video to, to legitimately, um,

130
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.160
oppose the, the removal of those statues, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson,

131
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.120
whoever else. Um,

132
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.240
but the majority of people who came there were there to start the initial,

133
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.070
the initial steps of the race war, what that's right. The race war. Okay.

134
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.990
The white supremacists have been predicting and have been preparing for a race

135
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.790
war, just like Dylan roof was trying to start the race war.

136
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:51.750
That's what he said when he went to that black church and guned up the place.

137
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.150
A lot of these places were trying to the guy who shot all those people in, uh,

138
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:57.790
El Paso. He said the race war, all right

139
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.340
here. Here's what's, you know,

140
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.980
anytime you want to occupy a piece of public property,

141
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.540
because you want to have a rally, a demonstration,

142
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.460
or even if you want to set up a eliminlemonade hotdo stand.

143
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.460
If it's gonna be on public property, you must have a permit. Right.

144
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.300
You go down to the city, get an application, state, you know,

145
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:24.250
fill name and state your purpose. You cannot very well say on the application,

146
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.370
I wanna start a race war. You will not get the permit. All right. So you,

147
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.450
you provide some quasi legitimate excuse. My great,

148
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.450
great, great ancestors fought in the Confederacy. That's my heritage.

149
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.810
I don't want you messing with it. Okay.

150
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.800
That's legitimate sign off. Here's your permit, sir.

151
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.760
And now you can occupy that corner of 12th and Maine from 12 noon to 4:00 PM or

152
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.440
whatever. Okay. So they, they went through all the procedure. They, they got,

153
00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:54.760
they legally got a permit to have their United,

154
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:58.840
the right rally under false pretense. All right.

155
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.680
Now, two things,

156
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.600
anybody who knows American history knows that

157
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:11.520
they were also blacks and also Jews who fought in

158
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.150
the Confederacy. All right. The, uh,

159
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.950
black slaves had to fight for their slave owners in the south.

160
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.350
There were a number of Jewish slave owners.

161
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.510
They didn't wanna give up that free labor. So blacks, Jews,

162
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:31.550
and whites fought together in the Confederacy against

163
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.350
blacks, whites, and Jews in the union.

164
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.980
My greatgreg greatat ancestors were slaves who also

165
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.060
fought in the Confederacy. I have ancestors who fought in the Confederacy.

166
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.140
All right. My parents are from Virginia Roanoke and Salem.

167
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.580
I was born in Chicago cause that's where my dad was working at the time. But,

168
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.650
uh, Virginia is, is, was the, a seat of the Confederacy. All right. So

169
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.470
there are black people today.

170
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.270
And some Jewish people who honor the Confederacy,

171
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.150
they don't condone slavery,

172
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.750
but they honor the Confederacy because of their great, great ancestors.

173
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.670
They honor it. How so? Like they have conf Confederate flags. Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:19.300
They have Confederate flats. Where is this taking place? Mostly in the south.

175
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.660
So there's black people in the south that have Confederate flags. Absolutely.

176
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:25.940
Look, 'em up. You, you find them all, you find them. Yeah. And um, no,

177
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:29.620
they don't condone slavery. They're just honoring the Confederacy.

178
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.980
Cause their ancestors were in it and died in it or whatever.

179
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.530
I honor my ancestors, however, I don't honor the Confederacy.

180
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.050
Me personally, if some of the blacks and Jews wanna do that,

181
00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:44.650
that's their business. Um, I don't do it. So,

182
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.410
and ironically, ironically, this is a historical fact,

183
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.730
the Confederate army was integrated.

184
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.760
The union army was segregated. Right. Which doesn't make any sense.

185
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.880
Okay. So here, here, you know, you know, we're,

186
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:03.840
we're fighting to free slaves and the,

187
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:06.680
and the Confeder army has blacks and Jews and SL and uh,

188
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.400
and whites fighting together and the union had them all segregated.

189
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.560
It doesn't make sense, but it does because it's also ridiculous.

190
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:17.120
Cause that's what humans are. Exactly. Exactly. You got it. Yeah. You know,

191
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.950
rationality. Yeah. So, okay. So now if,

192
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.950
if blacks and Jews and whites could fight together

193
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.343
150 years ago,

194
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.110
why can't they March together in 2017?

195
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.660
Wouldn't it make more sense and give more credibility to your cause.

196
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.340
If your cause was truly to preserve those statues,

197
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.260
why not invite descendants like yourselves of blacks and Jews

198
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.960
to March with you in Charlottesville and say, Hey, that's my heritage too.

199
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.040
Leave it alone. Would that not add more credibility? That certainly would,

200
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:03.760
but what, what are the numbers? I mean, how doesn't can you get,

201
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.000
even if you only got five or 10, right. Okay. That still would,

202
00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:11.400
would lend some credibility. Okay. Okay. But instead,

203
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.190
so they're claiming this is their heritage instead of inviting,

204
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.550
uh, or, or including blacks and Jews,

205
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.270
they excluded them in 2017.

206
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.230
So if blacks and Jews wanted a March, they would not let them. Yeah, exactly.

207
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.030
I mean, there, I don't know there were that there were any who did,

208
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.900
or they just implicitly stated that this is the white people. This is unite.

209
00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:38.140
The, I unite the right. Okay. Yeah. White, white supremacists organizations.

210
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.620
So instead of including blacks and Jews, you know,

211
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.140
heritage should include everybody in that heritage. You talk about the,

212
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.540
you wanna preserve the Confederacy. Well guess what,

213
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.020
there were blacks in the Confederacy, you know,

214
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:54.570
that that's historical fact there were Jews in the, in the Confederacy,

215
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.490
the Confederacy was simply a reflection of, of, of, of the south.

216
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.690
Okay. So instead of including them,

217
00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:06.850
they excluded them and they marched through the uni university of Virginia

218
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:11.050
campus with their Tiki torchs and the streets ofharlottesville yelling and

219
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:15.480
screaming anti-semmatic and racial, epic. That's what does that tell you?

220
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.920
It tells you their protests was not about heritage.

221
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.920
It was about hate that's number one, number two,

222
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.520
nobody in Charlottesville or anywhere else ever met their great, great,

223
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.160
great ancestors who fought in the, in the Confederacy. Right?

224
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.910
Those people were long, dead and gone by 1865. A um,

225
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.950
and these people weren't even born then right now you tell me,

226
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.430
but it's okay. You know, you, you can honor people that you don't know.

227
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.950
All right, that's fine. But how do you honor your great, great,

228
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:52.230
great ancestors in the Confederacy? And at the same time,

229
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.740
you dishonor the very end ancestors who you do know the

230
00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:02.300
very ones who raised you, your fathers, your grandfathers.

231
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.580
And if you're lucky enough, you may have met your great-grandfather.

232
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.140
These people, many fathers of these people in Charlottesville, many fathers,

233
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.090
grandfathers, and great-grandfathers lost their lives fighting,

234
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.570
not in the Confederacy, but fighting in world war II.

235
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:25.050
And who were they fighting in? World war II, the Nazis. So how do you tell me,

236
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.890
you're gonna honor your great, great, great ancestors.

237
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.730
And you're gonna walk down the streets.

238
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:34.530
Ofharlottesville side by side with peoplewearing Swika we went to

239
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.720
war against an Nazis.

240
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.360
Why are you marching with Nazis and flying swastika now,

241
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.320
now, but wait, wait, please. Um,

242
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.680
what did the Nazis have to do without heritage? Right?

243
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.920
The Nazis had no heritage in Charlottesville, Virginia. In fact,

244
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.200
the Nazis weren't even in existence during our,

245
00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.640
our civil war adollf Hitler was not even born during our civil war.

246
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.240
So what were the Nazis doing in Charlottesville? It wasn't about heritage.

247
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.600
It was about hate. And that's what the media failed to tell us,

248
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:12.470
because what the media did was they went to city hall, cuz it's public record,

249
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.830
just pull, pulled the permit and read, oh, they're there to, uh,

250
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:19.430
to protest the statues. They took it verbatim and they reported like that.

251
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.950
They didn't do the background check.

252
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.190
<v 0>Now was it a small percentage of them that were the ones that were marching with</v>

253
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:26.510
the torchs and the swasts.

254
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:31.340
And did they join into the entire group or was the entire group all about hate?

255
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.140
<v 1>The, I would say so everybody was there.</v>

256
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.940
I would say probably about 95% of people. There were about eight Mmhmm.

257
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.160
<v 0>&lt;Affirmative&gt;.</v>

258
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.940
And so there was a few misguided people that were there because they really

259
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.700
thought they were protecting their Southern heritage. Right.

260
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.380
And they were lumped in with all these other people that used it as a R to sort

261
00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:49.340
of set up this hate. Right. Hate meeting.

262
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.260
<v 1>To, to have to have a permit. How many people.</v>

263
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.650
<v 0>Were went there for that thing.</v>

264
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.650
<v 1>I mean, there were, there were more protestors of course. Yeah. As usual. Right.</v>

265
00:15:58.651 --> 00:16:02.810
Which, which it should be. Um, I, I don't have the exact numbers myself,

266
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.130
IM I'm sure I can get 'em. They, they get skewed. My side,

267
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.250
the police would tell you one number and the, uh, people,

268
00:16:09.251 --> 00:16:10.450
they were taking another number, the.

269
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.080
<v 0>The guy who was the, uh, the killer that ran those people over.</v>

270
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.043
<v 1>James Fields.</v>

271
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.800
<v 0>That that guy seemed to be 20 years old, the epitome of a,</v>

272
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.080
a lost soul that got sucked into a horrible

273
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.160
ideology. It was not very smart. And that,

274
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.590
that must be a law, large percentage of what they prey on.

275
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.950
Absolutely lost people. And then they, that's not how it called work gives.

276
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.070
Sure. And they give you a meaning and a reason and a heritage to defend mm-hmm

277
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.510
&lt;affirmative&gt; and then everyone a status and a status. Right. Yeah.

278
00:16:46.511 --> 00:16:48.750
And then a bunch of crazy names like cylops and mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

279
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.990
<v 1>Night Hawk. And you know, and I know Susan bro, Susan bro, uh, is the, my,</v>

280
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.100
of Heather higher, the girl who was, uh, who was murdered and,

281
00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.460
and run down by James Fields that 20 year old boy threw his life away.

282
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.340
And it was premeditated. You, you know, he,

283
00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:07.860
he had said stuff on the internet before even going there. Yeah. And praise,

284
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.500
Hitler, and so forth. And so on, you know, these are things, you know,

285
00:17:11.501 --> 00:17:14.650
that we have to be very much a aware of. Yeah.
