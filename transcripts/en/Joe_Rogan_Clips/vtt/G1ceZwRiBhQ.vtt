1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 0>Um, because there are awful men out there, but there's also men.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.230
They're nice. And they're going to be nice to you.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
<v 1>Some awful women out there who do have other agendas when they come out with</v>

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.570
these me-too games.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.710
<v 0>What you're seeing. I mean, we're seeing these cases now, you know,</v>

6
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:20.430
we're seeing these cases get exposed for what they are, you know, and it, it,

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.570
it, it,

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.890
the problem is that it cast doubt on legitimate cases.

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.630
What is going on with my throat,

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.940
something about these caveman coffees really early in the morning.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
<v 1>Let me think. I'm good though. Sometimes I'm like.</v>

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.730
Did you think, uh, if you're in Lucy case shoes,

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.900
do you think he came back too soon?

14
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.900
<v 0>I don't think it's that he came back too soon.</v>

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.540
And what I honestly think is he should say something more than what he

16
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.383
already said.

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.840
<v 1>Not just go up, like, it's all good. And like.</v>

18
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.830
<v 0>There's not just, I mean, he said he put out a release, a statement,</v>

19
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.040
these stories are true. They happened a long time ago. Right.

20
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:06.480
They happened like more than a decade ago. I think he should.

21
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.460
And I think it might be even better to release a video rather than,

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.170
um, than a written statement. Because a written statement, the problem is like,

23
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.980
it's impersonal, it's personal stake. Well, it's not even, not only that it,

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.080
see, it's not as impactful. I want us, when, what is he going to say? It's like,

25
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.070
I can't fix it.

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.600
Maybe if he donated a certain amount of money to certain causes or,

27
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.900
you know, spent, you know,

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930
time in therapy or talked about it and it's,

29
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.250
and maybe expressed himself and said that, what was,

30
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.590
you know, what was going on through, through, through,

31
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.720
in his mind during that time,

32
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:52.470
when he did the thing and why it was wrong and how he's changed his,

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.860
his way and how bad he feels about it, how he's apologized.

34
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.180
<v 1>He has daughters. I think,</v>

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.390
I think you get all that done by just doing a video with this.

36
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:04.230
I think you'd go so much further form if you didn't have a big production,

37
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.050
nothing. And he's a creative dude, obviously a great comedian.

38
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.520
If you just went off the top of his head,

39
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.720
straight into the camera and post on Instagram, I was like, Hey man,

40
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:14.280
I I've paid a price. I've learned.

41
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.080
I have daughters is a horrible thing that I did.

42
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.200
<v 0>Did you mean even stay away from I've paid a price because people don't really</v>

43
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.930
want to hear that. Like, what is the price?

44
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.830
<v 1>But they don't think he has. Well, they do.</v>

45
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.023
<v 0>They're crazy.</v>

46
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.500
<v 1>They don't realize that they think always find this,</v>

47
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.060
get back on the road and Torrens going to be a millionaire. Well,

48
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.260
he buys a ton of, ton of money off his shows, FX deals.

49
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.491
<v 0>And more importantly,</v>

50
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.030
his daughters have this image of him being this guy jerks off.

51
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.000
<v 1>In front of women. That's never going to go away either. No. So that's,</v>

52
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.510
that's a pretty heavy stamp, which is deserved.

53
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.730
Maybe not forever. Yeah.

54
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.790
<v 0>But it's, it's a complicated issue, you know, it's complicated.</v>

55
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:52.260
Like what was the psychology?

56
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.290
What was going on in his mind that allowed him to do that?

57
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.680
Apparently just started going up again. He just went up again Sunday night.

58
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.560
Yeah. He just.

59
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 1>Went, he went up and I guess the owner of the club was like, dude, I,</v>

60
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.740
I didn't know I was asleep and went up, you know,

61
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:08.290
it's the crowd's discretion if they want to stay or leave. But.

62
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.260
<v 0>Well, the first time the,</v>

63
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:15.040
the owner was upset and the second time they said something along the lines of,

64
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:19.780
if anyone has an issue with someone stops in AKA, Louie, I mean,

65
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:23.470
it's only Louie, maybe Aziz, I guess really? Well.

66
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.540
Apparently some people got upset about Aziz too. Yeah. They do look.

67
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.420
People just like targets. They like targets.

68
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.610
<v 1>They like negativity.</v>

69
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.100
<v 0>They liked negativity, but they also like targets.</v>

70
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.910
When they find someone who's a viable target,

71
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.580
someone who's done something they can criticize and then get.

72
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.860
<v 1>What have you done?</v>

73
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.370
<v 0>Yep. You know,</v>

74
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.930
they there's people that just want to decide that someone's a horrible person

75
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.680
and they don't have this really well thought out

76
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.350
comprehensive view of the situation. They just attack. You know, this,

77
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.320
a lot of those people out there, man. And they think that they're justified,

78
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.750
particularly if that person is famous and they're not,

79
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.780
they think it's fair game. Yup. Public forums.

80
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.370
So people were definitely upset at Aziz, but much, much more upset about Louie.

81
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.240
Oh, a hundred percent.

82
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.020
Will you stop and think about what Louis actually did creepy. Yes.

83
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.040
Asked women if he could jerk off in front of him. They said, yes, he did it.

84
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.230
If they said, no, he didn't. I mean, it's,

85
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.350
it's look if you're working with a guy like that and he's like,

86
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.040
can I jerk off in front of me? Like Jesus Christ. He imagined what the.

87
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.710
<v 1>It's a work environment for shareable. And he is not handsome.</v>

88
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.210
Lou, I love you. Brutal. You know what I'm saying? He's harsh on the eyes.

89
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.910
It's not like Brad, Pitt's asking to Jack off in front of him.

90
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.440
Not that it's ever. Right.

91
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:51.940
But it do less on the it's on the feelings of Brad Pitt's yanking in front of

92
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.090
you.

93
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.800
<v 0>Yeah. I mean all of it, all of it's no bueno. It's a whole mess. Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.560
I mean, he obviously had some sort of a weird kink.

95
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.380
<v 1>You know, I wonder what that is. Probably starting in childhood.</v>

96
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:06.670
Maybe he got caught and then got off on it. Right. Or you just never got chicks.

97
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:08.290
And now he has this power because such a.

98
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.930
<v 0>He didn't have the power when he started doing it though. Man,</v>

99
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.920
when he started doing, he wasn't really famous. He was respected,

100
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.420
but he wasn't famous. No. Which is why it's, um,

101
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.330
you know, it's, it's awful, but it's,

102
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.990
it's just the thing that he's stuck with now.

103
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:29.560
So he's got to figure out how to ingratiate himself.

104
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.540
He's got to figure out how to, to re emerge.

105
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.000
And I think he can do it.

106
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.090
<v 1>I think he can do it.</v>

107
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.810
<v 0>He can do it. Look, he's not an awful person.</v>

108
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.230
I just think he did some stupid things that are really gross and weird.

109
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.090
But if he just, I mean, he, and he has owned up to it. I think he just,

110
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.890
you know, make some sort of a sincere apology and then does something like,

111
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.560
what could you do to, to, I mean, do you help.

112
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.450
<v 1>Female comics maybe do a, do a.</v>

113
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.190
<v 0>That he's trying to help.</v>

114
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.520
But a lot of people accused him of trying to help them to try to cover up his

115
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.354
tracks.

116
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.130
<v 1>Ah, well, man, you gotta, you have to do something. He gets to go back.</v>

117
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.090
<v 0>The work. Yeah. I mean, it's been a year now, right?</v>

118
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:18.470
It's a year next month I think to expect him

119
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.210
to just never work again. Seems ridiculous. And to not forgive him,

120
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.790
there has to be a path, uh,

121
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.560
to redemption for anyone who's done anything other than actual rape or

122
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:34.850
murder, right? Like for bill Cosby, I'm very happy. He's locked up.

123
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.290
I think what he did is awful.

124
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.770
Can you imagine being one of those girls that turned to him as a mentor and you

125
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:41.750
wake up and you, you know, you're,

126
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.870
you've been violated while you're out cold and you're dogged and you're

127
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:45.704
confused.

128
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.180
And bill Cosby did it to you and who the is going to believe that his image is

129
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.240
that's the thing about Louis, right? Like Louie's image was like,

130
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:55.880
he's a pervert, he's a weirdo. He's always talking about jerking off.

131
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.340
Like when you found out Louie CK, Ascot girls,

132
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.930
if he could jerk off in front of him and then did it,

133
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:03.680
it's like not the most surprising. No, but with bill Cosby,

134
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.450
it's, here's a guy who is, and I'm not comparing the,

135
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.970
the acts at all, but I'm just saying, as far as like famous people,

136
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.410
who've done something that, you know, became a scandal.

137
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.730
But bill with bill Cosby, he was this moral guy.

138
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.440
He was this like ethics guy. And he wore sweater. America's dad.

139
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.580
He was America's dad.

140
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.090
And to find out that that guy was drugging and raping women,

141
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.690
he's in jail right now, which is crazy.

142
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.170
<v 1>Right. He's going to die. I give it over under a week.</v>

143
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.490
Do you think that's the way it goes with those old dudes? Really? Yeah. He's 81.

144
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.690
His eyes are shot crazy. He can't see, I think the ones good,

145
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.110
but the last ones all over the place, which one is.

146
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.700
<v 0>The one I thought the right one was white.</v>

147
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.300
<v 1>Ah, it's I think it's this one, but it is to look in the wrong.</v>

148
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:55.700
<v 0>It's.</v>

149
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.500
<v 1>Going on its own way. That's what you get, man. That's I'm going to die.</v>

150
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.480
<v 0>I think, um, I think, uh,</v>

151
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.730
a path to redemption or a path to retribution would be, uh,

152
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.010
would be good. A path to forgiveness.

153
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.150
That's that's the thing that's important for all,

154
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.010
all human beings. Who've made mistakes. I think we can just cast people out.

155
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:20.180
If they've made mistakes.

156
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.651
<v 1>It's important to,</v>

157
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:25.970
with all this stuff is like Lucy Kay got lumped in with the big dogs like bill

158
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:30.110
Cosby and Harvey Weinstein, then there's going to be CK. And man,

159
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.210
there was definitely different levels to this. Yes. These crash.

160
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.193
<v 0>No question.</v>

161
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.960
<v 1>How about one that flies under the radar, especially here in America.</v>

162
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:43.670
And I was just reading about it, how true it is. Who knows with Ronaldo who,

163
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:48.320
you know, in, in soccer as, as your boy, uh, in, in Edwards, I mean, there's,

164
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.700
there's a super superstar.

165
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.140
<v 0>Superstar.</v>

166
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.110
<v 1>It would be like a, it'd basically be like Connor McGregor getting caught,</v>

167
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:58.260
doing something for in world. It's a big deal. This is a new one. Yeah. This,

168
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:01.590
this girl, you know, he said, she said he kept telling him no.

169
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.140
And then he ain't really raped her. And then, uh,

170
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.120
paid her $375,000 to keep quiet. Now she coming back out,

171
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.470
but who knows human beings,

172
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.440
we capable of such amazing things and such awful things.

173
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.470
I have to look that up. Jamie. I might've been drained. No,

174
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:24.490
I think you're right about that. My brother told me about he's usually on it.

175
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.300
That's what I just read in the New York post. Yeah.

176
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.990
We should probably go back to fights. Right? Renata likes that booty. Uh, yeah,

177
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:31.860
we should go back to fight.
