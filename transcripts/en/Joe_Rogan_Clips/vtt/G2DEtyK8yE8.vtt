00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.760
<v 2>And nobody quite knows, okay, who is it that inherited it?</v>

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.600
And there are those people who say, Hey,

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:13.120
this wasn't Ross that ordered these hits. You know, this was like,

5
00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:16.240
nobody knows who's behind the keys at the time anything has happened.

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.080
So there are those people who, who completely deny, you know,

7
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.510
his family completely denies the call ability and who knows.

8
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.750
We'll never know that.

9
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.230
<v 1>Is a problem when you're dealing with corrupt cops too. Right?</v>

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.710
Like they literally could have faked him doing that.

11
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.510
We don't know what has he denied that he called hits.

12
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.990
We should explain to people that haven't seen the film, spoiler alert. Uh,

13
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.940
it goes off the rails for Ross, for young Ross. And, uh, one point in time,

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.313
one of his,

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.940
the guy he's working with gets busted and rats him out.

16
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.780
And then the cops are using that guy's account and communicating with him.

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.900
And he orders a hit on that guy and the guy gets to see it. And it's like, holy.

18
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.250
I can't believe this. Who knows how much of that is real and I, how much is not.

19
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.490
But the problem is you're dealing with corrupt cops.

20
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.450
And if the corrupt cops wanted to frame him for something,

21
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:11.970
that's gonna put him away for a long time,

22
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.050
just running the website and allowing people a, a,

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.890
a portal where they can do this and sell things is not quite good

24
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:21.724
enough.

25
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.480
But if you can get a guy to literally call for murder, not once,

26
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.240
but twice then you've really got him locked up. We don't know though.

27
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.920
Did he deny that he called those.

28
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.400
<v 0>Death? Well, and not only, not only did he deny it, but, um,</v>

29
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.640
what happened was so, so to back up a step, basically the, the corrupt cop,

30
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.550
you know, in the move, the corrupt cop at a certain point sets out to bust Ross.

31
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.270
And then at a, at a certain point,

32
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.350
he's like kind of getting blocked by his superiors and whatever.

33
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.470
And so he's like, he says, okay, I'm gonna rip this kid off.

34
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:54.670
Instead if I can't bust him,

35
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.030
I'm gonna steal the money and I'm gonna use it for my own purposes.

36
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.990
But what ends up happening is, and all of that information, by the way, the,

37
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.420
the fake murder of his employee and the photographs that were taken of it,

38
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:08.700
all that stuff is true. That's all in the real story.

39
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.900
And as we're shooting the movie,

40
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.620
we have access to the actual faked murder photos where like,

41
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:14.450
what does it look like?

42
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.940
<v 1>It's looks like it's available online.</v>

43
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.100
<v 0>Can we see it? Yeah. It's available online. Oh, we.</v>

44
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.820
<v 1>Need to see that right now. See if you could find the Curtis.</v>

45
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.330
<v 0>Clark green, uh, murder photos, fake murder photos.</v>

46
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.490
<v 1>What was his, uh, online name?</v>

47
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.730
<v 0>Chronic pain &lt;laugh&gt; appropriately.</v>

48
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.370
<v 1>Enough. Did he look like that guy? The.</v>

49
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.690
<v 0>Fat guy with the CROs he does. And I, I love that that actor is amazing,</v>

50
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:37.890
amazing. He was in, um, Eastwood, put him in, um,

51
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:42.690
Richard jewel and he was in spike. Lee's last movie. Um, he's just,

52
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.120
he's one of those guys. Did you pray jewel? Yeah,

53
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.720
he play Richard jewel and he's fantastic. Really good.

54
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.640
<v 1>I mean, he seemed like the quintessential internet couch monster, you know.</v>

55
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.520
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; working with that guy was so fun, you know, because like, again,</v>

56
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.560
we had the, you know,

57
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:00.240
we had information about the real guy and what happened was when that guy gets

58
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:04.080
busted, when chronic pain, um, gets busted in this article,

59
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.440
it said he had a Chihuahua and the Chihuahua was going bat barking, crazy.

60
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.360
As the feds are kicking in the door and whatever,

61
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.520
and we're sitting there and I'm thinking like, man, Chihuahua going bat on set.

62
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:16.480
That's gonna screw up the dialogue. What do we do?

63
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.120
And so I'm talking to Paul and Paul's like,

64
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.430
what if we give him a ferret instead? And I'm like, ferret, let's go ferret.

65
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.110
You know? And then the other,

66
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.030
the other brilliant thing that Paul did was he said, you know, all of this,

67
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.950
like, you know, all this online chatter where it's, you know,

68
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:33.790
you're typing on the computer and then the other person types back. He's like,

69
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.630
what if the dude's a mumbler? So he is kind of saying this out loud,

70
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:38.790
the whole time that he's talking. And he starts talking to himself.

71
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.620
So once he had the ferret and made the guy a mumbler,

72
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.580
he had like the keys to the character.

73
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.940
<v 1>Mm yeah. He nailed it. It was great. Everything down to the Fanny pack.</v>

74
00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:50.460
It was beautiful. The, um, the, the,

75
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:55.300
so the dialogue between all the dialogue that you show on on screen was

76
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.700
actually a real dialogue. Yeah.

77
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.370
So in the movie you have have Ross calling

78
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.050
for this guy's murder. Did,

79
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.210
did you struggle with that at all?

80
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.610
If Ross says he never did that and he believe did what did,

81
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:12.930
what was his theory?

82
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.810
<v 0>Well, I think, okay, so there's a couple of important points.</v>

83
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.760
One is the feds never charged him with the heed murder. They put it, you know,

84
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.600
Ross ended up getting sentenced to two life sentences plus

85
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.480
40 years without the possibility of parole. And this is a crazy fact,

86
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.360
which is considerably, harsher than what El Chapo was sentenced to. Right.

87
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.880
Jesus Christ. And so they really, you know,

88
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.870
they threw book at this guy and buried him and did, did they offer a plea?

89
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.390
He had, he, he did,

90
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.630
he was offered a deal at a certain point and he turned it down. What was a deal?

91
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.870
I think it was 10 years. Jesus Christ, kid. I know. And that, well, and here,

92
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.790
this is a crazy, so this is a crazy story. So starting out with, um, you know,

93
00:04:57.791 --> 00:04:59.190
you had asked me if I had reached out to him.

94
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.060
So I reached out to him when he was locked up in MCC, New York,

95
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:07.060
awaiting sentencing, and then all the way through, he was hoping to, you know,

96
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.780
he was waiting, the case was working its way through the appeals process. So,

97
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.420
um, and then finally he was hoping that Trump was gonna pardon him.

98
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.260
And there was a big kind of Hulu, okay. Is Trump gonna pardon this?

99
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.820
Pardon him on his last day in office. And he didn't.

100
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.610
And I wo and I was sitting there watching the news, waiting to see if he would,

101
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.890
and I woke up the next day and I was like, man, I'm gonna look,

102
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.710
I'm gonna look it up.

103
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.570
And so I went on to the bureau of prisons website and I typed in Ross's

104
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:36.850
name and it comes up, you know, Tucson penitentiary. And then it said,

105
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.730
release date, colon life. And it just like,

106
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.200
it hit me, you know, this kid's 36 years old,

107
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.960
he's 10 years younger than I am and just staring down the barrel of that.

108
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.080
And so I sat down, even though the movie's, you know,

109
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:55.440
coming out or whatever at the time. And I decide, you know, what?

110
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.000
I owe this guy and some fun, like just human being man to man.

111
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.240
So I write him a letter and I said, listen, man, I've,

112
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:05.880
I've made this movie and this is my portrait of you and my portrait of

113
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.600
your story and of silk road. Um, and it's, you know,

114
00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:10.560
it's coming out into the world,

115
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.160
but if you ever want to tell your version of this story in any form or fashion,

116
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.910
you want to do it as a rolling stone interview.

117
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.310
You wanna do it as a documentary. You want to do it any way you want,

118
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.311
you tell me,

119
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:24.870
and I will be there in person to sit down with you because I do feel like

120
00:06:24.871 --> 00:06:27.470
there's some kind of, I don't know,

121
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:29.710
I guess like spiritual contract between me and him,

122
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:32.190
like when you enter into a story like this, you're,

123
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.750
you're in somebody else's life in a real way.

124
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.790
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, it, we,</v>

125
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.900
it's almost like we do need to hear his version of it. Right.

126
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.500
And we don't, we just, and,

127
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.580
and especially when you're dealing with lawyers in a court case where it's,

128
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.060
you know, they're withholding some testimony,

129
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.340
if they think it'd be detrimental to his case, or, you know,

130
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:58.330
once all said and done, I wonder why Trump pardon him?

131
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.650
<v 0>I don't know. And, and who knows, you know, the way it was reported that, um,</v>

132
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.010
he was closely considering it. Um, but in the kind of last days of the,

133
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.690
you know, chaotic into the administration or whatever it didn't happen.

134
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.050
But I was, I was, you know,

135
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.600
because no matter what you think of Ross's politics or what he

136
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.640
did as a, uh, you know, or silk road,

137
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.960
even there is this thing where like, I'm a believer in second chances, man,

138
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.360
you know, I've screwed up a million things in my lifetime. And, um,

139
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.680
and I feel like somebody like that hopefully has something to give the world,

140
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.520
you know, and isn't thrown away. It's just crazy.

141
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.670
<v 1>That they were off offering him 10 years.</v>

142
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.590
And instead they gave him two life sentences,

143
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.070
plus 40 years with no possibility of parole. Like why.

144
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.283
<v 0>You know, there's this.</v>

145
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.910
<v 1>It's such a disparity. Well.</v>

146
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.790
<v 0>It's, I think in some way or another, it was like, this changed the drug war,</v>

147
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:57.310
right. It changed the way the drug game happened.

148
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.820
And it changed the way the drug war was fought. Suddenly. It's like,

149
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.620
it's almost an existential threat to the drug war when it's not by

150
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.820
busts and hand to hand and all the street stuff that we've seen, you know,

151
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.940
since, you know, Nixon unleashes DEA, you know,

152
00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:14.260
in 73 or whatever the year is suddenly,

153
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.820
it's wait a minute all happening online anonymous,

154
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.090
DHL us B PS, people are delivering it.

155
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:23.490
Nobody even knows that they're carrying it. So it was like,

156
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.650
it was an existential threat to the us government, to the DEA, to the drug war.

157
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.090
And so he got the book thrown at him.

158
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.010
<v 1>Crazy. So what was the motivation for offering him 10 years as a plea?</v>

159
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.680
<v 0>You know, I don't know. And, and I want, you know, looking back on it,</v>

160
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.960
it's always kind of hindsight is 2020,

161
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.960
but he had been beating the system for a long time. Right.

162
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.680
He was like one dude with a laptop that unleashed this thing that kind of

163
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.280
metastasized and went over the whole world. And, um,

164
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.160
and he was winning for a while. He was ahead of the feds.

165
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.760
He was ahead of the us attorney's office. He had Chuck Schumer there, you know,

166
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:05.680
calling for his head.

167
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.440
And yet he continued to kind of game the system and beat him by just being

168
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.280
nimble and being able to throw his laptop in his backpack and roll onto the next

169
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.070
location. So maybe, you know,

170
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:19.470
maybe he thought he'd be able to continue beating the system. I don't know, God.

171
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.950
<v 1>It just, I mean, I just he'd be out.</v>

172
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.270
He'd be out. He'd be out now full 10 years later. Well.

173
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.350
<v 0>And the crazy thing, you know, he treated this two hours ago.</v>

174
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.830
<v 1>Kind of convenient timing. I put silk road on the tour. Oh, sorry. On the tour.</v>

175
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.300
Now at work, about 10 years ago,

176
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.300
I've been thinking about what was going through the mind of my 26 year old self

177
00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:45.180
back then in 2011 so much has changed if only I could

178
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:46.580
