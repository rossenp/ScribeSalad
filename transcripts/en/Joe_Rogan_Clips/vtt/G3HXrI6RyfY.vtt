00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 1>Experience, but they went to decision.</v>

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 0>I honestly, I wouldn't mind, um,</v>

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.800
Tyson getting into his camp and just even just kind of mentoring him a bit

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.520
like Mike Tyson. Um,

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.440
I feel like somebody like that would really help a guy like the, and I mean,

7
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:23.710
it's not like he needs a lot. Right. But like somebody like Mike Tyson being,

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.230
being, being around,

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.630
just having him to like call on and talk to sometimes Tyson.

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.470
<v 1>Doesn't really want to have anything to do with boxy anymore, though. It seems.</v>

11
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.400
And, and maybe.

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.470
<v 0>Maybe not even in the gym, maybe just somebody to talk to once in a while,</v>

13
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.150
just for maybe some strategy, maybe even about strategy sometimes, you know,

14
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.460
because I feel, I don't know. I forget exactly what it was,

15
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.500
but there was a moment when I was watching Deontay Wilder and then there was

16
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.740
something, I think when Mike was in here, something, he was talking about that,

17
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.220
uh, I was just like, man, those two should get connected.

18
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.100
Mm that's interesting. I was, I was a long time ago. I,

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.730
and I was living in Texas. I got a phone call at like,

20
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.090
like 2:00 AM and my was one of my buddies. This is my buddy Lynn oing.

21
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.690
And I was like, um, I don't, I don't wanna answer that, man. I'm trying,

22
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.330
I'm sleeping. I bed with my wife, I'm sleeping, he calls.

23
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.370
And then the next morning I listen to my voicemail and he is like, Ave Eve, Hey,

24
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.650
if you get this, call me back. I'm like using a club and he like,

25
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.560
somebody wants to talk to you. And he has the phone.

26
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.920
He's like E Atworth ewe &lt;laugh&gt;

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.720
I was so. God. I was like, man, I missed a phone call from Mike Tyson.

28
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.480
Like he ran into him in the club or something. I was like,

29
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.600
Mike Tyson knows my name.

30
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.240
<v 1>Dude. I met him at the, at the UFC. And he is like you that we got.</v>

31
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.270
<v 0>No he's that.</v>

32
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.510
<v 1>Weed guy. Well, he, I mean, he was into weed back then, but it was like,</v>

33
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:52.350
that's what he said goes, he goes, I like you, man. You're funny. I'm like,

34
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:53.870
thank you so glad you like me.

35
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.063
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

36
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.470
<v 1>And then having him in here was so surreal because when I was a kid,</v>

37
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.390
he was the man. Yeah. I mean, he was the,

38
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.820
you would go to you'd pay to see his fights just to watch him somebody up.

39
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:10.980
It wasn't a fight. It was an execution. You would watch him execute guys. Yeah.

40
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.240
<v 0>He was the man.</v>

41
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.580
<v 1>He was the man. He changed heavyweight boxing.</v>

42
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.900
People don't realize that heavyweight boxing in the early eighties was dead.

43
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.100
Nobody cared because Larry Holmes, after he beat Muhammad Ali,

44
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:24.650
everybody was sad. It was like a sad thing.

45
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.010
Like there was a changing in the guard.

46
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.730
Larry Holmes beat the outta Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes never got his due.

47
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.090
He never got his due. He was so good, man. Yeah. Larry was so good.

48
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.770
He had one of the best jabs of all time. He was so good.

49
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.970
But people were still upset at him because he up Muhammad Ali. He came,

50
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.320
he was the champ after the greatest, you know, and not Muhammad Lee.

51
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:52.320
Wasn't just the greatest in terms of like the greatest fighter,

52
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.040
he was a cultural icon. Yeah. He meant something to people. Something lot of,

53
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.880
I mean,

54
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.560
everyone knew the guy was out for three years because he protested the Vietnam

55
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.800
war. Everybody hated the Vietnam war. Especially people who went to Vietnam,

56
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.400
hated the Vietnam war. And they, you know, they, they got it man.

57
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.920
And he just, he meant a lot. He meant a lot. So when Larry Holmes came around,

58
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.270
it's like, man, Larry just never got his due, ever got his due.

59
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.350
<v 0>That, um, that era of boxing. I remember going back,</v>

60
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.310
watching tape mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, and doing that.

61
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:29.430
And that's the one thing I appreciate about Tyson, you know? Yes. Like he,

62
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.110
he was a student. Yes.

63
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.231
<v 1>Um, thank God.</v>

64
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:35.990
He knew Jim Jacobs who had that crazy library that he could get all that,

65
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.830
you know, Jim Jacobs was the guy who curated,

66
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.620
like he has every old time fight. All of them.

67
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.780
He would watch sugary Robinson and Jack.

68
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.900
<v 0>Dempsey. And he's watching like Willie pep.</v>

69
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.460
And he is not only watching like the.

70
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.300
<v 1>Heavyweights. Yeah. He watched every, oh yeah. Harry grab.</v>

71
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.300
He watched all those guys, all old, all and weird obscure fighters, you know,

72
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.010
guys that most people don't remember in anymore.

73
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.130
<v 0>Yeah. That, that, that era of boxing was very different.</v>

74
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.650
<v 1>Sandy Sadler and you know, all those guys, he would watch all those guys. Yeah.</v>

75
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:10.770
That era of boxing before him was terrible.

76
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.690
It's like he had champs like pink and Thomas and Tony Tubbs and no one cared

77
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:15.524
about the heavyweight division.

78
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.130
And then he came along and just started blasting people. And you know,

79
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:19.964
like finally.

80
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.440
<v 0>I remember I was, I was like seven or eight years old. I met Trevor Buric.</v>

81
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:25.720
He was down in The Bahamas for a fight.

82
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.720
And that's that's who Tyson took his belt from. Right.

83
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.040
Got his first belt from 20.

84
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.760
<v 1>Years old. Yeah. That crazy like 20, 20.</v>

85
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.973
<v 0>Now you're the heavyweight.</v>

86
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.280
<v 1>Champion. And then, well, that was the thing talking to him about it.</v>

87
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:40.440
Like what was that like? And it's just, there's no way he could manage it. Yeah.

88
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.550
No one can manage that.

89
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.350
<v 0>You're gonna go crazy. I feel like his career and his life,</v>

90
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:48.190
would've been very different if KU died when he did.

91
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.150
<v 1>I think so too. Yeah. I think so too. It's a, it's a tragic story,</v>

92
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.390
but it's also like, there's so many lessons in that story. It's like,

93
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.630
for all of us, it's like, there's a lot to learn, you know,

94
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.100
that what happened when it got all the way to bus Douglas, when it was like,

95
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:06.660
he thought felt like he can't lose and he was in this rare state, you know?

96
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:07.494
Yeah.

97
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.060
<v 0>Yeah. The like his life, like he's, he's had so many ups and downs and,</v>

98
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.760
and as,

99
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.660
as the heavyweight cha and like to be somebody that's the heavyweight champion

100
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.700
of the world, somebody with so many eyes on them, you know,

101
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.010
the Robin given that whole, that whole song in his life, you know? Um,

102
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.050
I remember they, I forget who was it?

103
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.370
Oprah when they were being interviewed and, um, they were on,

104
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.650
they were on the show and he just, he just kinda looked like,

105
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.330
I feel like Mike Tyson and that interview was like those tigers that people walk

106
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:38.770
with that they drug. Yes.

107
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.520
<v 1>You know what I mean? Yeah. Perfect. Perfect way to describe it, man.</v>

108
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.680
They probably medicated him. Yeah.

109
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.760
<v 0>Cause he did, he did not look. He,</v>

110
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.600
he just didn't seem like the Mike Tyson who I was a fan of. Right.

111
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.760
Like I didn't dislike him in that moment. I was just like,

112
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:54.594
what's wrong with him?

113
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.720
<v 1>Meanwhile, well, who the? I mean, it had to be her idea. If I was this friend,</v>

114
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:01.120
we go, why were you go, why are you gonna talk to Barbara?

115
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.760
Streisand's what Barbara Walters, whoever it was, get the outta here.

116
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.480
Same thing. Barbara Streisand. Barbara Walters, to me saying,

117
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:10.600
you talking to some old lady, you're the heavyweight champ of the world.

118
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.760
Get outta here with that talk. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is nonsense.

119
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.750
And you're gonna bring your wife. What, what, what are you doing? What,

120
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:19.710
what benefit is there in this?

121
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.510
<v 0>Yeah, it is Def. It is. Well, I can't say definitely, but my,</v>

122
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.390
my assumption is it was Robin.

123
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.190
<v 1>Gibbs. She emasculated him. Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.390
She emasculated him in front of the world and you know,

125
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.990
and I think afterwards he realized what happened. He was furious. Yeah.

126
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.950
But it's like that life is unmanageable. His, the life that he,

127
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.500
he lived back then was unmanageable. He was the king of the world.

128
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.620
He was in his twenties. He was buck wild, just going crazy.

129
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.980
Flatlining people everywhere. He went,

130
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.060
people would throw rose pedals at his feet and screaming, cheering fans.

131
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.100
It's unmanageable. He's too young.

132
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.060
<v 0>Imagine me though. Poor</v>

133
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.610
adopted black kid.

134
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.050
<v 1>With no love in your.</v>

135
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.850
<v 0>Life. Life. No love in your life until yeah. Until you're 13.</v>

136
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.530
And then you come into all of this money because

137
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.650
you're the best fighter in the world.

138
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.850
Like there's what could he possibly be afraid of then too? Nothing.

139
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.730
<v 1>Right. Pet tigers, bro. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

140
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.240
He wrestle with him? I mean,

141
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:24.280
that was the crazy thing of him talking about when he found out that he could

142
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:26.840
get a tiger. Yeah. It's like what? I could get a tiger &lt;laugh&gt;

143
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.320
but he's so humble now. It's so interesting. And one of the thing,

144
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:34.920
more interesting things that he said that he doesn't train because he doesn't

145
00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:38.990
want to, and, and he doesn't wanna fire his ego up. You, you know, he's like,

146
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.590
I don't like that part of me. I don't want that part of me to come out again.

147
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.270
I don't, I.

148
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.750
<v 0>Don't want it. Wasn't there video of him, like,</v>

149
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.350
like I understand he doesn't train anymore, but wasn't there video of,

150
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.071
I think last year,

151
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:51.670
just before he came in here and spoke to you where he is hitting a heavy bag.

152
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.430
<v 1>I think it was a little bit longer ago than that, but yeah,</v>

153
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.470
he was doing it for something. He still can crack, man. Yeah.

154
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.580
<v 0>Still scary power is.</v>

155
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.860
<v 1>The last thing. Well, do you see that scene?</v>

156
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:03.100
He's doing a movie and there's a scene in a bar.

157
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:06.340
They're they're they're doing something and he just shows them a combination.

158
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:11.300
He just punches in the air. No warm up lightning, fast jab hook,

159
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.860
upper cut, right hand. It's like, yikes. It's all still there, man.

160
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.700
50 years old, still.

161
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.810
<v 0>You up. And that was, that was, I like,</v>

162
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:22.650
he was the heavyweight champion of my childhood, you know? Yes, mine too.

163
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.890
Muhammad Ali came before I, you know.

164
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.050
<v 1>But, but again, Larry Holmes just doesn't get the credit.</v>

165
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.010
It's like for whatever reason, it's just like in the first round, when,

166
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.690
when Tyson fought Larry Holmes, it made me think like,

167
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.410
what would've been like if Larry was in his prime. Cause when they fought,

168
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:41.320
Larry was like 36 or something that somewhere around there,

169
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.800
it was already kinda over for him. Yep. And Mike was Mike. I mean,

170
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:50.320
Mike was black shoes. No socks. There it is right here. Why she,

171
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.600
he, and then the weave. Yeah. I mean he just can't help. I mean,

172
00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:59.000
that was like built into his system, you know?

173
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.000
&lt;laugh&gt; a head movement with deli. He was, he was such an interesting guy too,

174
00:09:07.001 --> 00:09:11.600
because he was only like five, he's probably like 5, 10, 5 11.

175
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.470
I think he's like five, 10 and a half. Something like that to be a heavy way.

176
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.870
And just so low and bobbing and weaving and moving in. And everybody was like,

177
00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:22.070
Jesus. Yeah. Like you see him coming out. You're like,

178
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:23.230
like his head's right in your chest.

179
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.070
And then he's ripping your body and then upper that right hook to the body and

180
00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:28.910
then upper cup behind it that he used on.

181
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:32.870
Everybody used it on Frank Bruno used it on everybody. Boom. Wow.

182
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.860
Right up the middle. It's hard to him with fancy Francis.

183
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.540
Really Francis it's harder. Yeah. He hits harder. I think. So. I think,

184
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.020
I think Mike Tyson was a way better boxer. Yeah.

185
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.420
But I think if Mike Tyson can hit,

186
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.420
like Francis does just Francis just has to clip you.

187
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.090
He just like what he did to junior. He just he's dumb.

188
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.130
Obviously they're different gloves. Obviously.

189
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.450
I just think Francis is such a way bigger, man. Yeah. You know,

190
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:07.170
Mike at his prime was like 2 0 9, 2 15 around then I remember on, on,

191
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.290
on punch out. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I, I never beat him. &lt;laugh&gt; never beat him.
